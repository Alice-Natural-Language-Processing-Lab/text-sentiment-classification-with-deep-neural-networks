0,1,0.0,113,we stayed here one night before embarking on a cruise the carpets were filthy in the hallways and in our room when we went to our room the door was open and we could see why the carpet was very wet by the bathroom they must have been trying to dry it we did want to walk barefoot on the carpet and we are not usually fussy when we told the desk clerk on checkout he basically ignored us the only good thing was the hotel is easy access to the cruise terminal,LSTM

2,1,0.0,688,we stayed at the clarence on the tail end of a trip to ireland and were very excited to stay here big mistake it was a total dump we had two rooms and both were filthy the bathrooms floors were sticky and spotted the shower curtain liners were black with mildew one room had a horrible and persistent smell one sink did not drain at all the vents were covered in dust there were random smears of gd knows what on the shower walls one room windows did not open at all and there was no ac or ventilation gross and loud as our rooms overlooked a beer garden next door the lobby was likewise nasty with a sticky counter and floors i am not sure how other guests gave good reviews this hotel was totally especially for the price,LSTM

5,1,0.0,1036,for the price and the pictures i expected more the overall feel of the hotel is that it lacks the gloss of its pictures it is average the bathroom was in need of maintenance glass on the bath to stop the splash was falling off and most disappointing of all was the air conditioning or lack thereof after a full hot day of sight seeing sadly the air conditioner on the room provided little to no relief the final straw for me was the toilet making weird running noises all night so i asked to be moved the hotel obliged the next night and i was moved to a bigger room and the air conditioner worked a little better however when turned on you could smell very strongly cigarette smoke you ca beat its location i agree with other reviews but to be frank i could not wait to leave,LSTM
6,1,0.0,1081,my partner and i stayed nights in july both in our twenties from the exterior the hotel is great but disappoints slightly once inside see pictures we arrived in our room to find a used condom on the bathroom floor the women on reception morning shift was insincere and simply told me that the cleaner would move it no genuine apology we did make a fuss complain or ask to speak to management out all the things you do want to find on your bathroom floor a used condom would be up there if we were an elderly couple or made more of a fuss i think we would have been taken more seriously rather than brushed aside the hotel pool area is lovely however the pool itself looks very unclean the hotel seems to be a popular place for large stag groups if a group is in the pool you have not got a chance of relaxing in it they can also be quite intimidating a couple of times i witnessed two groups of females leaving the pool area after being pestered by groups of drunk men the room is lined with wooden panels all of which are chipped and worn the shower curtain is inadequate water leaks all over the floor and wooden door frame making it rot the temp is good cold and we understand that aircon units are loud but this one was the loudest we have ever experienced and rattles the two main roads at,LSTM
7,1,0.0,1170,on our arrival sunday evening the of aug we dealt with a blonde foreign lady who was very ignorant and did make us feel one bit welcome i also did understand what she was saying even when i said sorry could you say that again she would repeat what she said we were also told we would have to pay for parking for the two nights a bit ridiculous considering we paid for the two nights with just a bed the breakfast was also robbery for a fry and for a bowl of coco pops a bit crazy if you ask me there was no electricity in our room from about half monday night until we were leaving tuesday morning had to use a light on our phone to shower and go to the toilet we were woken up to building out the back too tuesday morning and you could also hear everything happening out in the hall as the doors do seem too sound proof poor stay overall,LSTM
8,1,0.0,1327,being greeted by a computer rather than a person was something new for me and i have to say that i did really like it particularly when i came to and i found that computer had charged me for four breakfasts instead of two something to do with single occupancy of a double room i gather or at least that was what i was told by a friendly human who had to sort out the muddle the computer had caused other thing was the this was not working when i arrived at the hotel which was pretty irritating as i had work to do i called down to reception no answer after calling twice and allowing to ring for in excess of minutes each time i went down to reception to find one poor member of staff trying to deal with about no etc feeling it was a bit unfair to burden her with more issues i asked to speak to the manager and was told that there was no manager available furthermore the hotel had no idea when the would be working again and apparently the service was nothing to do with the hotel anyway as it was provided by a and was a service that the hotel could choose whether to provide or not which i disputed as the hotel advertises free and i would have stayed there if it did have it above rather marred my visit which was a shame as otherwise the hotel and staff,LSTM

12,1,0.0,1706,we have just returned from a a two day stay at this hotel this is the first hotel where staff do greet you and say hello no contact at all through the whole check in very clinical staff in the restaurant clearly had been trained in the same manner where is the warm irish charm the service was slow in the restaurant and the service was very disjointed the second night it was quicker especially when we asked for bill the bathroom was small the bedroom was clean and comfortable we had breakfast in the coffee bar in reception and it was fine sorry staff again ca take orders correctly and no interaction with guests would not be going back,LSTM
13,1,0.0,1716,we stayed at the stanley for nights it made us hate athens to be honest the location of the hotel and the rooms are not as they seem on the website we stayed in the executive room with double bed the bathroom was disgusting with old white shower curtains and you could hear everything going on in the next room while you in the bathroom there no ventilation and it just feels like you in a cheap hotel i did like it at all to be honest and felt it was unclean upon booking i thought that the hotel was in the centre and it not it mins away by car from the main streets in the centre syntagma square and monastiraki and you ca walk there because the streets around the hotel do look in addition to all this we were charged for a bill after we had checked out from the hotel and left for drinks at the pool bar where neither myself or my husband even checked out during our stay let alone stayed for drinks and when we requested to see the receipt it just had our room number on the top without even our family name or my husbands signature we told the hotel that this was not us and that we did even visit the pool and until now one week later the money had not been refunded never visiting this hotel again and i advise anyone going on a fun romantic trip to,LSTM
14,1,0.0,1728,the whole experience was disappointing we were made to wait for minutes before our room was ready and this is after the check in time of there was a line of people waiting and we had to queue three times before our room was finally ready we entered a warm stuffy room where the air conditioning has not been switched on it is definitely not what i had expected based on the review i will definitely not be coming back be ready to be disappointed,LSTM
15,1,0.0,1789,it is a shame as the staff work so hard to assist and make your stay enjoyable but the constant construction works and noise is off putting from early in the morning into the evening hammering drilling workmen shouting and banging of doors it is near impossible even to take a restful hour in your room during the day as it is located on a very busy main street with bars and clubs and an outdoor concert venue just down the street people party literally to the crack of dawn so expect to not have a decent of the works the rooms was too warm as the ac is not functioning all making for an exhausting stay on a good note the breakfast is plentiful and fresh,LSTM
