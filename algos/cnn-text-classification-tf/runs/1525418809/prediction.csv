the region has numerous derelict buildings all around as grecian economy struggles yet the prices inside this hotel are astronomical ie small bear and a vodka tonic euros and i know your paying for your surroundings but they were no different to any other hotel i regularly stay in and although the rooms were nice its just kind of spoilt when you feel like you being ripped off with the prices for everything profit is a dirty word but greed would be a more appropriate one such a shame that this is the main thing remembered on a hotel visit,1.0
hotel is located directly on the dam square an easy minutes walking to amsterdam rooms are very clean breakfast garden was wonderful and choices are location staff very,1.0
we booked it on booking without noticing that it is specifically for gay couples so we went there and we were a bit worried but everything turns out super super super fine we had the premium room which looks exactly the same as what we saw in the pictures on booking with two balconies the design of the room is mordern but not cold the service stuff there was really really friendly to us and they answer all of our questions about city sightseeing stuff the location is good too as we were not really far from wherever we wanted to go honestly i think it is a super nice hotel which i would like to go back there superb,1.0

we stayed here for nights monday friday i have been barcelona times before and stayed near by so i roughly knew where we were area itself looks run down as there is a lot of building work going on but a minute walk away looks much more bright and new we did ever feel unsafe walking at night but if you never been to barcelona you may be thinking to yourself where have i ended up the hotel is a few minutes walk from bogatell metro station which is a minute ride from gothic quarter las ramblas everywhere you want to be it also only a minute walk from the beach the reason i have stayed in the neighbourhood before we got to the hotel and the staff were very lovely and helpful even helped us find somewhere that would be serving food as we arrived around we were offered a room but it was on the smoking floor the hallways had an unpleasant musky smell from this but we did notice it in the room thankfully the room was lovely and clean although the floors could have done with another sweep but that me being picky there was plenty of room for us to put our belongings and a safe that was easy to bathroom was clean and bright but if a powerful shower is the and of your holiday do stay here as it was fantastic i say this hotel is suitable for couples and perhaps business i,1.0

we had the executive rooms on the rooms were not big but were adequate and clean the beds and bedding were comfy our rooms were facing the street so i was worried about noise but we were high up enough that it was not a problem the church bells opposite the hotel however do ring but it did not bother us breakfast was great a full buffet irish breakfast with lots of healthy options fruit smoothies and porridge too the only issue was lack of air conditioning as dublin was unusually hot during our would book again,1.0

stayed at this hotel for nights visiting from montreal for business lobby and rooms are very nice and clean staff was extremely friendly and food from restaurants and room service was better than expected they are not in central athens but they offer an hourly free shuttle service directly into the heart of the city and back again which we used few drawbacks walls were thin and we could often hear laughing from the adjacent rooms immediate surrounding area seems to be quite really frustrating thing was the i paid for mbps which is much but all i needed to work during the day it was fine usually hitting around mbps but between pm it was so slow it was completely unusable i ran a speedtest and it was giving me significantly slower than even it seems their internet can not handle the traffic at night when people are in their rooms which meant i could not do my from that it was a very pleasant stay,1.0

nice friendly welcome on arrival walked through nice air conditioned corridors to get to our room but on opening the door the room itself was boiling this meant we had to sleep with the fan provided on and the windows open which was idea small room and as it was in the roof sloped on one side which was a bit awkward not a lot of storage space good vending machine including cans of heineken lovely breakfast good location just off dam square so easy to get to from the station would have been improved by having air con in the actual rooms,1.0
i stayed here for days in a double ensuite room the room was big good and everything was fine telly was also working fine the student hotel have good silent reading room table tennis bar and restaurant and much more drawback the bathroom do not have a cubicle but a shower curtain with no hand experience was really good i would surely recommend this hotel,1.0

four of us two rooms were welcomed by a delightful receptionist who warmly greeted us then sorted out our tours she was wonderful but that is where it ended there is no air conditioning the rooms were incredibly hot it was not mentioned each room has a portable unit that has a long hose pumping out very hot air through the door but of course you have to leave your day open to use it the first night we went to the garden for a drink there was four staff who all looked at us but no one came over eventually we left went to a lovely pub for a drink for a third of the price it is a very expensive hotel for one in such disrepair i would not recommend this hotel to anyone this is my first ever negative review,0.0
we stayed one night before we traveled on to mykonos the hotel is very busy and mostly a business crowd the rooms are spacious and comfortable the hotel location is convenient staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was good with lots of variety,1.0

was there for a business conference for few days nice hotel with excellent location liked the breakfast and the rooftop bar service was a bit confused good but not great all in all would stay again if in barcelona because of the location,1.0
i have stayed here a few times with work but first time for pleasure after a poor experience with another hotel in rome the week before this hotel delivered the complete opposite with excellence all round from the warm welcome on reception to the attentive bar and restaurant staff the hotel could not do enough for us we had a lovely room with view of the sea and high quality bathroom we enjoyed the city but also quiet time by the pool shame it rained one day but we enjoyed ping pong instead outside getting a bit wet but it was fun food is great lots of choice at breakfast and eggs cooked to order when requested love the food at lunch and dinner always an option to choose from everyone always has a smile and is helpful not one member of staff disappointed can not wait for an excuse to come back a really great hotel,1.0
the hotel view is unbeatable but if you stay somewhere else you can still enjoy it with a glass of wine on an evening the food was okay definitely prepared and presented but short on vegetables or things not drenched in oil or sauces but they went out of their way to find me salad ingredients and vegetables i will definitely stay there again if i go back to sure to ask what kind of room you getting some are stunning with big balconies and some are just tiny standard rooms with barely a window,1.0
my mom and i stayed in a twin bed room for nights in barcelona the location was very convenient no more than minutes from everything we wanted to do with transportation very accessible near by when we arrived the staff was very kind and welcoming they offered us drinks right at the front desk we went up to our room and were not disappointed everything was clean and neat complimentary waters daily the beds are very comfortable but right away we noticed that they were very slippery if you sit up against the headboard the bed will slide away from the wall easily and you left with a big gap it was a little annoying but not a deal breaker by any stretch in the morning they have a very extensive free breakfast eggs bacon etc as well as pastries and such my only real complaint is the temperature of the room and it has to do more with personal preference it was adequately cold for most people i sure and perhaps it just what i used to but i like the ac to be blasting or to at least feel that it working like with a fan i would have enjoyed that being an option on the controls but again i picky with my preferences all in all very good stay would recommend,1.0
my daughter and i stayed at the marble house while vacationing in athens and it was the perfect location with a cozy clean friendly atmosphere it close to public transportation and easy walking distance to all the sites and museums highly recommended,1.0
we enjoy staying at the herbert park but we only want nights which from will no longer be offered so will not be able to stay there next year as there is a minimum of nights shame but we will not book again,1.0
this hotel is centrally located in easy walking distance to the museums anne frank house and many shops and restaurants the rooms were small but well appointed and had bvlgari amenities our room was on the first floor facing the canal behind the hotel there was a little bit of street noise at night but mostly peaceful due to the layout of the hotel and the various in total canal houses linked together there are in odd places we had steps down from the landing immediately after entering the the bathroom this could be dangerous in the dark at night if you forget they are there we had in the lobby the prices were reasonable and the wait staff was friendly there were books from just about any author you think to look for as well as board games to play overall it was a pleasant hotel stay,1.0
unfortunately we did have a great experience at the hotel beginning from the moment we arrived in our room despite booking a double room when we entered into our room following check in it was apparent that we had been given a twin room nothing was said to us about this at check in so we had to head back down to the reception desk to ask to be moved to a double room as per our booking the receptionist was very rude did apologise said that there was nothing he could do about it he could move us he could arrange for the the bed to be made into a double bed and smugly stated that the hotel being able to unilaterally change the type of room a guest had booked was apparently within the terms and conditions we asked if there was anything else he could do for example give us a complimentary breakfast the next day but we were firmly told that he could do a single thing including as it became only too apparent apologise we asked to speak to the manager but the manager was at the hotel until the next day which is worrying in and of itself surely a duty manager should be at the hotel at all times we asked for the manager to contact us the next morning but we heard nothing on check out i asked for a feedback form and described our issue so as to give the hotel,0.0
stayed here for one night during a short trip to dublin good location just a short taxi journey from the city centre staff were kind and welcoming and the hotel itself is just stunning beautiful rooms which are immaculately kept and breakfast had everything you could ask for including yummie pancakes i only wish we could have stayed longer,1.0
sure there may be newer hotelrooms in athens but i may not use a calory to find it out best location in the city excellent service spacious comfortable rooms very good breakfast buffet and helpful staff i come back here each time in athens,1.0
i stayed for one night during this trip and was very pleased for the low price i paid i got a clean room very clean bathroom and breakfast and free secure was included it has a lovely little café attached where you can get a coffee or sandwich without having to brave the heat if you do want to if you are so inclined though the hotel is only steps from eateries bars and even a few small supermarkets which is convenience personified when you are traveling the hotel is also within easy walking distance of the megaro mousikis metro stop which will take you straight into downtown athens to see sights like the acropolis and to shop at monastirakis and the plaka for myself personally the beds are very firm but other than that this hotel is perfect for the traveler highly recommend,1.0
stopped in for lunch after walking around the temple bar area meal was large good service was excellent and the staff could not do enough will go back again the bar area was nice plenty of beers on tap and a relaxing place,1.0
we stayed here as we wanted somewhere with a swimming pool because the weather would be so hot in athens the hotel was every and more we needed the pool is fantastic and our room was huge the hotel is very well maintained and the staff are all very helpful the hotel is a little out the city but uber are very cheap so we did mind getting uber and getting out of the heat would recommend to anyone going to athens,1.0
an amazing hotel there was nothing basic about it chic and basic have absolutely nailed location is brilliant and i loved just sitting on the balcony watching barcelona the tapas bar below was very good and the hotel is exactly where you need to decor and style are breathtaking and the touches like free water coffee and open areas are very generous and building itself was very special in the room the furniture bed shower and all the things in the room made for an excellent stay ut was almost a shame to leave the hotel to venture to barcelona although we loved barcelona visit we looked forward to going back to this stayed in the bar late onto the evening where the staff were very friendly helpful and really would not even consider anywhere else in barcelona straight back here and i do hope i can go again,1.0
i stayed in barcelona many times and wish i had known about this hotel earlier the whole experience was absolutely perfect from the service to the room to the amazingly cool skybar and pool it also in the perfect neighborhood so glad i never have to search for another hotel in barcelona again this is the place,1.0
plush decadent and totally over the top décor loved it great location breakfasts good restaurant food very good and the pub a great place to spend some very spacious we had a room in the annex and the service was good,1.0
this place is simply amazing the hotel is stunning the service is and the rooms are gorgeous did i mention how awesome the service is there is always someone around to help you out answer your questions or to simply wish you a buenos dias oh and added bonus the entire staff speaks english,1.0
we stayed at this hotel only night before catching a cruise we choose it because of its location near to the center so we can go out for dinner and walk along the rambles without having to go to the hotel by taxi ou metro anf the entrance to the cruise terminal a few steps away next to the statue of the colombo the hotel is very jovial and different but had everything we needed our room had no view but we did not mind the breakfast had the possibility of being taken in a pleasant open air area without a doubt if you need to stay in barcelona for a short stay i recomend to book this hotel,1.0
this hotel is good for price and near all kinds of shopping and stores and a big mall loved the staff and they were so helpfull and friendly not the closst to city center but buses and metros are easy to you,1.0
just for a two days business trip the location of the hotel is good just a minutes food walk to the beautiful where clean be aware about the inside rooms without a windows will work for two days and if you drink something rest of the hotel is good and clean nice service,1.0
had a most enjoyable weekend clean and tidy all staff were very helpful and hotel is well situated with good access to both tube stations and bus routes with a good selection of bars and restraunts in the local downside of us this hotel was the sewage smell outside the hotel the poor quality of the cooked breakfast and the extortionate cost of the poster sun lounger per day or a basic sun lounger per day,1.0
the location could not have been better for us the free drinks in the lobby all day were very helpful and the breakfast with made to order omelettes was a great start to the day not all rooms have a canal view and my only regret was not checking into that and ensuring my room had a view but we did spend that much time in the room anyway,1.0
i never found a hotel with such friendly and helpfull employees and that in juin the busiest period of the year clean and quiet room a swimmingpool on the roof to escape the busy town an excellent breakfastbuffet,1.0
this is a hotel so quality is assured i love the location which is close to the beach and marina not inconvenient if you want to visit the tourist sites and the bus stops nearby greenline one of my all time favourite hotels reserve the vip pool loungers for a spacious day in the sun,1.0
skip the breakfast was totally not worth it especially since you can easily travel out on metro to get nice amsterdam pancakes for breakfast the suite rooms were large in size and comfortable love the new looking nepresso machine too,1.0
while staying in dublin for one night i stayed in the hilton very pleasant stay breakfast was a little bit limited in offerings could have been better stayed in a twin room staff was very kind and helped me finding my way around general i had a very pleasant stay would recommend it to others,1.0
beautiful and comfortable hotel min from the beach and min to the main street la rambla hotel is very clean and the rooms have air condition on the floor there is a beautiful terrace with a well furished bar and a little price is well balanced with the quality they offer,1.0
i am not sure if this is the amsterdam hilton where john and yoko made love in their bed for a week but they did really help me and i am most was staying for just one night while attending a conference i found the staff most helpful the rooms clean and comfortable and the common facilities is a strange brand once it was very grand and then it confused everyone by getting into the lower end of the market well the hilton amsterdam restores the brand in my opinion here what checked out and caught the train to the airport i was on my way to italy for a friends weekend birthday party only when i reached the airport did i realise i left my tablets in the hotel bathroom i called the hotel and a wonderful lady from housekeeping arranged to send a taxi with my tablets to meet me at the train station i got the tablets and made my way to italy thank you thank you thank you exceptional and caring service,1.0
not what i expect from a star hotel the quality differences are in the little things such as not having sufficient safe deposit box locks for the room safe no complimentary bottled water or coffee machines at breakfast and polite but service at the front desk as can be seen from the other poor reviews management pattern seems to be polite apology followed by the scripted thanking for the feedback which offers an opportunity to improve however this appears to be little more than an empty response that results in no or very few real improvements would we stay here again no,0.0
got this hotel through a secret escape deal we were hoping for the hilton lol very helpful staff who gave us some info on and restaurants etc yes it is a little out of the way of the center but it is also close to some good attractions so i suggest you read up on the map we like to walk so this worked out quite well for us room was ok but nothing special clean and comfy free toiletries expensive bar as expected free felt more like business hotel rather than a tourist hotel,1.0
i was very disappointed in this hotel i do not think it was worth the money charged and the euro extra if you required breakfast was extremely over priced we have stayed in dublin before at a different hotel for less the price and had the perfect stay our stay this time was not good at all our room was so hot it was uncomfortable we could not open a window as it was next to the tram track and railway and was very noisy in fact it was noisy with the window closed too the bed was so hard i probably could have slept on the floor and had the same nights sleep the shower was actually a tap on the wall the room service came at between in the afternoon this was far too late for us and when we spoke to them about this they said their english was poor so did really understand we also made the mistake of drinking in the bar and found that this was also extremely expensive like the breakfast for four bailey and three coffees we did have a good stay at all and would not return the positive was that the hotel was clean,0.0
we have just returned from a great night stay at the skylone hotel we were attending the cold play concert at croke stadium and the location of the hotel was a short distance from the hotel the hotel check in was quick and the hotel left a birthday card and bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise and gesture the rooms are clean and tidy and had everything you need as well as extras like bottles of the hotel and staff provided an excellent service and we will definitely be staying at the skylone hotel on our next trip to dublin,1.0
nestled in a quiet area the clontarf is a gorgeous mix of old and new uniquely decorated with both modern and historical elements and a staff that truly aims to please large knight room bar with excellent food and drink choices the small sized charcuterie board would be considered large at most other establishments many pretty seating areas to sit and relax and have a cocktail close to the airport and convenient to get to,1.0
we finished our trip to ireland with three nights in dublin and happily we stayed at the hotel merrion located in three historic dublin townhouses one of which was the duke of wellington childhood home the hotel is luxurious in an understated way and very charming it location is excellent and the service is first rate we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,1.0
citizen m at the airport is a great hotel in a superb location citizen m nearer the city is a nice hotel in a rubbish friendly helpful staff hotel is also nice but for me the location is just so far out from the main attractions getting a taxi in out costs from euros breakfasts are good but on the basic side not much changes day to day if this hotel was placed in the city centre it would be great but of course it not next time i will stay closer to the centre,1.0
we arrived in the room to dirty sheets and also bugs that looked like possible bed bugs would recommend this hotel to anyone was absolutely filthy as far as i concerned could not use the toilet as it sideways between walls pictures on booking do show true pictures,0.0
location is perfect right next to train station the entire hotel and rooms are clean easy and friendly knowledgeable concierge willing to help sells tram and museum tickets great restaurant and rooftop bar even a starbucks if you are lucky enough to get into the executive lounge the breakfast is fantastic not cheap during peak but worth it,1.0
upon arrival was given a different room than booked regular double instead of duplex the room was comfy and bright but the floor was dirty shower drain clogged and the roof leaked after it rained i liked the white decor but the white furniture was in dire need of a solid cleanup doors of other rooms closed rather noisily and the air conditioning also made noise as did the pipes i sure knew when my neighbors were taking their showers the whole second floor looked rather shabby in contrast to the public areas of the hotel which are very the upside the café was very nice with a pleasant park view and the hotel was located a short walk from a tram or metro stop,1.0
it is a bit further from the city but this is reflected in the price it was a good clean and the beds were perfect it is easy enough to get to from town the metro and a little walk as it such a tall building it easy to spot the room was spacious but to be honest we spent very little time at the hotel as we were too busy enjoying this amazing city,1.0
i have been coming to this hotel since and it is by far one of the best hotels i have stayed in barcelona great location walking distance to metro and plaza cataluña staff is very professional clean and comfy highy recommended,1.0
small rooms but to be expected at a hotel in europe very nice staff and great dinner at pressroom pressroom breakfast buffet is not worth the at all go to a nice restaurant down the street like greenwoods instead for breakfast nice boutique hotel in the middle of everything in centrum but a little pricey,1.0
be aware this hotel has two small rooms on each floor which do not have windows to the outside they have small windows that look out into a very dark small open central lobby it is our first time staying in hotel with no windows to the outside we were unlucky enough to get one of these try to sell you on their buffet breakfast euros reduced to euros if you book breakfast for the entire stay bear in mind that you can get a baguette sandwich plus a coffee for about euros from any of the little pastry shops around the hotel we did bother with their breakfast option and were glad we front desk staff is especially this one lady who works nights the only helpful person we found was maria who was very gracious and helped us with check out,0.0
great location just steps from several of the museums easy to walk everywhere the street is gorgeous the hotel and very comfortable we were a family of four and found it a perfect perch from which to explore amsterdam,1.0

we stayed for three nights in this excellent friendly georgian house which is spacious with high ceilings comfortable beds and were provided with a wonderful breakfast there is a good sitting area with books and a peat rooms were in fitzwilliam place which is a separate georgian building connected to leeson close by a small peaceful is an excellent bed breakfast situated close to st stephen green and walking distance from all the major attractions on the south side of dublin,1.0
this is a nice hotel like many others we stayed her during the recent joshua tree tour in dublin like those others we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by bono and the edge kinda nerdy but there it is i wanted to give this hotel stars but i ca this is not a holiday inn you paying more for a better experience and in some ways the clarence fell hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist it an easy walk to all of temple bar the book of kells and the fun stuff on street its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the guinness factory most public buses run on either street or dame street either one is a five minute walk away the temple bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did i feel uncomfortable walking around regardless of the hour the staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system printing out maps etc if my review ended there it would have five best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds the bed was probably one of the best i ever encountered in europe the front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing they made me want to stay longer this hotel could be so much more sadly several of us met in,1.0
do be fooled by the aging exterior the rooms are very modern with high quality finishes several offering magnificent views of the acropolis pluses include amazing pool phenomenal rooftop bar setting and first class spa despite the amazing setting however service at the rooftop bar is nearly abysmal and a negative incentive to go up there overall the service was very good it a good mile plus walk to plaka so plan accordingly especially in the hot months i would be happy to stay here again,1.0
great a little out of the centre however a cab ride costs euros we stayed at this hotel due to an absolute nightmare apartment appolonos no power no curtains dreadfull avoid at all cost staff found us rooms at the last minute they were really helpful breakfast was great even cooked me an egg white only highly recommend,1.0
only good things to say about our stay here good location with fabulous view of sagrada familia less than five minutes walk to metro and tram stations room was big by city standards food was good and lively bar on top floor the gym was well equipped with stunning views will definitely be back,1.0
family of three visiting dublin for the first time enjoyed our stay at the croke park positives included the clean and quiet room huge bathtub and bathroom we had double beds for a year old and two adults superior x doubles front desk staff very helpful and the free parking in a city that charges everywhere for parking was great we found however this location was not so close to too many food options we made a few walks of over minute for dinner deduct time if you have no children and walk at a far pace also proximity to city sights not so close as other hotels but again we felt the quietness and free parking out weighed this feet are good for walking we did not eat at the hotel,1.0
the hotel is in a good location but they have charged my credit card even if the hotel accommodation was paid in full months before the actual hotel stay i had to wait and contact few people before they even refund the money also they did not refund the full amount and i have been sending follow up emails with no response at all do not book this hotel,0.0
we have just left from a night stay at hera hotel the hotel itself is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location walking distance to everything you would need for a stop over in athens the rooms are of a hotel standard with a delicous buffet breakfast what makes this hotel is the staff the reviews are all true the care and genuine desire the staff have towards making you stay in athens a wonderful experience is commendable thank you hera hotel,1.0
lovely hotel clean friendly great rooftop pool snacks through the day on the roof very relaxed never too busy at the pool staff were great would definitely stay again recommend to friends in the future,1.0
this large hotel offers an excellent price for value ratio probably one of the best on this side of the city nice staff good breakfast with table service for hot drinks and buffet for the rest pretty high standards in the bedroom and bathroom i really liked their orla kiely soap shampoo and body lotion this hotel also offers a rather quick access to the city centre min walk or appropriate for business trips i have stayed there many times over the past year maybe less for a romantic stay as this is mostly a business one issue the restaurant downstairs is specialised in burgers and beers not the ideal place if you on a diet,1.0
we arrived to the hotel very early and the receptionist still tried to get us a room although she could they were very helpful in taking our bags and recommending places for us to visit she really went out of her way to help which was a great start to our trip we had the smaller of the rooms but found that there was plenty of room for us it was very clean and put together excellently the hotel bar and restaurant were also very nice not the cheapest but good value for the quality you get,1.0
stayed at this hotel for nights in july this year the hotel kindly upgraded us as it was a break to celebrate my birthday hotel is great excellent location in dam square so easy walk to everywhere cocktails and service in the hotel bar were excellent breakfast was full of choice in a beautiful room picture attached we took the train from the airport to the centre and it was a min walk from the train station to the hotel,1.0
nice area near a mall and some places to eat and a short walk to the metro train and minutes to the airport the metro goes to many tourist sites and taxi is easy to get and also buses to other parts of the city,1.0
the service is warm and personal there are so many sweet and personal touches which set them apart the room itself note we did stay in a penthouse however i believe it just a bigger version of other rooms has such modern and warm decor with the perfect amenities the rooftop restaurant bar had delish cocktails and food with a wonderful view fantastic location very fair pricing all in all great concept,1.0
we have enjoyed very much our stay in the a little bit disappointed by the quality of the breakfast in particular of the scrambled would recommend the hotel to acquaintances travelling to barcelona,1.0
i really liked the hotel its atmosphere and the facilities the atmosphere was professional but still young and fresh it has loads to offer a gym table tennis a cool bar and a place where you can order and enjoy some food and i received some icecream while checking in the only disadvantage is the relatively high price if i was privately going to amsterdam i probably would be able would want to pay as much per night yet i still liked my visit very much and would recommend it to everyone,1.0
we had a fantastic experience at the best western amazon hotel last week our room was spacious and quiet we noticed that some other rooms were somewhat small there was construction going on nearby but our room did not face the construction and was quiet the location was excellent,1.0
i liked my stay there from to july excellent hotel proffesional staff rooms are wonderful and clean i spent nights there in junior sweet reception staff were excellent breakfast and food were good excellent location in the city near subway approach to any place was easy i suggest this hotel for anyone will visit barcelona i will stay again in it during my next vacation,1.0
stayed at the marker with two other friends and got a corner room with a sofa bed the room was very spacious and the person sleeping on the sofa bed did feel as if they pulled the short straw we all had a great sleep and a wonderful stay faultless,1.0
this is definitely a boutique hotel with very high standards on customer care from the beginning the reception is different than any hotel you know the policy in this hotel is give you the best possible personalized attention the room is big enough for everything you need and you always will find a little surprise after your room is cleaned in the summer is a must a visit to the pool on the roof,1.0
my year old daughter and i stayed for nights in room with an amazing view of the acropolis from the room and the balcony the hotel is well appointed with comfortable beds and a refreshing shower the staff really made our stay special with their friendliness and kindness breakfast was delicious and they packed one to go for us the morning we left early location was awesome short walk to the pedestrian only paths leading to the acropolis and museum we will definitely stay here again on our next visit,1.0
besides my bar fridge not working for the entire stay the tailor bar has very friendly and efficient barmen the service was excellent position is very central will stay there again on my next stay,1.0
my wife and teenage son and daughter stayed here while on holidays in athens it is the perfect place for a family to stay the family apartment was generous in size with high ceilings good air conditioning and spotlessly clean the staff at the reception were so friendly and helpful the location is excellent with lots of restaurants nearby and it is a walk or short taxi to all the main attractions great value for money as well everything a family needs for a stay in athens,1.0
great hotel friendly very helpful staff who assisted us with our excursion online bookings we stayed in the room with jacuzzi bath and infa red sauna which was lovely very clean and well located to the centre of dublin within a minute walk with great transport links would stay here again coffee and tea making facilities in the room was a nice touch,1.0
just off st stephens green large clean room with fresh bedding and good furnishings recently renovated some street noise reasonable friendly and high quality and somewhat pricey fair for the area stays yes,1.0
this was our last hotel in greece after weeks of traveling and it was a perfect stay steps away from the metro on a main street ermou literally behind the acropolis grounds we were able to enter with our tickets through the gates literally minutes away from the hotel the hotel is located a min walk to monastiraki metro station to go to the airport instead of the kiosk machine which sells ticket at euros i bought a ticket to the airport for euros the hotel itself is subtle on the street we walked by twice without noticing it as on the weekend all the shops on the street are closed it is a gorgeous hotel great amenities and restaurant after a long journey upon arrival we were greeted with ice cold water and a few welcome appetizers the breakfast buffet was fantastic at night you are literally staying next to psiri the latest it place for restaurants and shops is convenient so you do have to walk around dodgy hoods at night or get pestered by taxi drivers on sunday there a flea market on the hotel street and neighbouring blocks i found some great records i highly recommend this hotel over all the others in the city centre,1.0
despite the renovation in reception area the room are quite dated and need rennovation our room had terrible view and it smelled very bad we asked for a room change but it was not possible until the next day,0.0
accommodation in barcelona is not cheap however i feel this hotel adds just enough special touches to make it a great are what you would expect shower is fantastic and huge wine hour is a great concept the best thing about this hotel is the rooftop pool it is only small and not at all deep but it is relaxing and refreshing after a long day sightseeing huge thumbs up to xavi at the front desk very friendly and gave us two great restaurant recommendations,1.0
the hotel is really nice and quaint the staff is friendly and helpful they gave us tips on where to go how to get there and where to eat hotel has a cute rooftop bar pool area hot tub gym and sauna,1.0
we got to this hotel very late and were exhausted we were greeted at this hotel by a very friendly reception water and snacks the hotel is very clean and had the best shower of the entire trip it is also located in a great location close to all tourist sites,1.0
stayed nights with our year old and were very happy that they had put an extra bed into our room for her the location is very close to the sants station but a bit far away from the city attractions the hotel breakfast was good lots of choices and the rooms were clean,1.0
i would definately recommend this hotel myself and three cousins stayed there and we were very impressed for the money we paid clean room cleaning staff were lovely and friendly and alway wanting to please how can you not leave them a little something breakfast fantastic and looked after my coleiac need well i would always go back for the right price also wel positioned for seeing the sights and experiencing the culture,1.0
room was really spacious but it was well maintained modern and clean the view from the room over the city was amazing located in the west it a little out of the city centre but very close to the airport will stay here again if i have to,1.0
prices are steep not unlike the rest of the city but the service was exceptional at every turn the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed convenient location to walk to local attractions and shopping area around the hotel is quiet so there is not a lively night life in the immediate area however it is a very short cab ride away,1.0
first it challenging to find a room for a family of this hotel provided a large size room with a large bathroom hotel was clean and for a bit more provided a really nice breakfast is provided and the location is wonderful it was a euro taxi ride from the airport and euros to the cruise port from this hotel you might think you can walk to your ship but trust you ca restaurants shops and a large open air market were within easy walking distance as was the flamenco cordobes in addition we were able to walk to our meeting spots for our tours some say it is noisy we had a room facing las ramblas i opened the windows stepped on the balcony and soaked in the exciting atmosphere staff let us store our luggage until our and even offered a if needed before there is a small elevator and helpful front desk staff i would definitely stay there again with my family,1.0
stayed nights and days as it was my birthday on the first had an early flight so was tired and were allowed to check in earlier than a complimentary bottle of wine and birthday treat to the room the next day and stayed in all evening on the second night as i was so tired and the hotel room was so comfortable the food and breakfast was excellent the hotel lounge had a piano which mymusician son was playing and people and myself were enjoying but unfortunately was told to stop playing a more senior person,1.0
the hotel is in a busy part of town but there is no noise insulation so you wo get a full nights sleep very expensive and poor choice in restaurants bath will not fill more than inches and there are no seats in room to relax on,0.0
hotel is located blocks from plaza catalunya which makes most of the city accessible by foot or short trip room was nice we were on second floor facing the busy street but the room was soundproofed we did hear or feel a thing while windows were closed breakfast was good and the service was pleasant and helpful we paid slightly more than some other nearby places we might have found but were not upset when we spent time there it has a nice rooftop pool and snack bar,1.0
the first thing i noticed was that the actual hotel building we were staying in is not the one shown on the website the hotel reception is in a separate building down the sidestreet and across the road once inside the hotel it has a crowded feeling mainly because it is used by so many tour groups and there always seem to be people milling around having said that we were quickly checked in there is a mezanine level above reception which is airy as it is like a central courtyard we had a free upgrade to a business class room that was comfortable and in the corner of the hotel we only had breakfast in the hotel but that offered a wide selection of food and was always hotel is located in a good position centrally between the old town red light district and the national palace,1.0
spent days is julythe hotel is located a bit of center but it was nice and quite for us we got a nice room with a view to the canal i like the ability to open a window and have some fresh air room was bigger than rooms in ibis hotels in paris and madrid we been at we also walked to and from the center by foot and there are also good public transportation nearby rembrandt house is nearby must see attraction for art staff are very welcoming at the front desk and at the bar pizza at the bar was nice we also had one breakfast which was various fresh and wait to come back,1.0
great hotel with most modern facilities centrally located and above all they have very friendly staff to the hotel manager daniel calvo who was very helpful in sorting out an issue during my stay recommend,1.0
my friend and i visited barcelona from and were pleasantly surprised with how wonderful the hotel and our experience was as for the details aesthetics modern sleek clean great bathrooms amenities super comfortable bed rooftop pool bar a plus if you need to take a nap relax midday before you go back could have asked for better service all the men at the reception desk were fantastic they gave great reservations at fantastic restaurants and booked daily excursions for us seriously did not try the food at the hotel except for a latte location central i big on walking and found that it was min to the beach and a quick walk to central shopping gaudi buildings and parks min to shopping to sagrada familia going at sunset so the sun hits the stained great location our days were totally walkable,1.0
comport rooms welcoming hospitality great was at place the hotel is really to a metro station plaza catalonia and the rambla there is a marketplace across the street most of the guests are so do expect lobby a hotel tax that is not part of the booking price it a small price anyways,1.0
fantastic experience in a very large room with acropolis view at the best location in athens can not beat that the amenities are great the service excellent the breakfast rich in a beautiful hotel is next to king george and grande bretagne on syntagma square it has been built as a luxury hotel to compete with its neighbors with large rooms big marble bathrooms and it does that but at more affordable am staying here every time i come to athens on business and feel pampered,1.0
we arrived quite early friday morning and the staff were very good to take our luggage to a safe location whilst we explored check in was until so we had a while to wait but we were disappointed once we started walking were in a superb location tram station across the road restaurants and convenience stores at every turning we were in such a great area for shopping we walked for miles yet were always in a popular and busy location once back at our hotel we found the doorman to be so pleasant and pleasing the girls on the main desks seemed extremely busy and restless so we found it quite awkward to approach them at first but they were extremely helpful and could help enough as well as housekeeping and minibar staff they were always eager to please and a credit to the leave on aug which is my birthday and i can honestly saythat we would definitely return to the grand hotel maybe with more of our family in the near future as we still feel there much more to amsterdam that we did manage to cover and would definitely want room again it was gigantic,1.0
never having been to athens before i relied on other recommendations on where to stay and i was told by many that either the st george or the grande bretagne were the places to stay so initially i was disappointed that neither hotel had availability and i settled for booking the electra metropolis because it was in the vicinity of the others now if you ask me where to stay i would tell you without question the electra metropolis the electra is located more in the heart of where you want to be in athens turn right out of the hotel and walk a few blocks and you are at syntagma square turn left and you are right on the edge of plaka streets keep walking down the street mitopoleos and it will end at monastiraki square where train station and flea market are located everything was walkable the rooftop view of the acropolis is just for those who make reservations or spend money at the restaurant the free breakfast is served on the rooftop every day while the pool is also located on the rooftop we were there during a heat wave so it was always crowded but that did keep us from enjoying a pool electra also has a heated indoor pool and we had it all to ourselves the hotel is somewhat new so everything is clean and pristine the room and especially the bed were extremely comfortable the staff were very friendly and eager to serve,1.0
we paid for the upgrade to include the executive lounge which was not very executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed it was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel have clearly cut back on the staffing of this area at one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty the toilet door lock was broken the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol i thought this level was over there was little or no food available at the key walk in times like this was repeated in the afternoon this is the year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason i booked the hotel but over the last couple of years it seems to have gone downhill and has got progressively worse i thought last year poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days i stayed there this year it is the last time i would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year i did complain to reception but there was no,0.0
my mother and i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel during our visit to dublin the staff is extremely friendly and helpful from the bar supervisor ivan to the ever so helpful customer service director derek burke i would highly recommend it,1.0
excellent hotel rooms fairly basic but good facilities in room and bed very large and comfortable lots of channels on television a little out of town but very well connected with tram station at door so access to city centre is mins tram or mins walkbreakfast very good and service excellent,1.0
i loved everything about this hotel the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed the concierge was absolutely great we were early for check in so she moved some stuff around and we were in our room within five minutes they have tea coffee cookies and cakes in the drawing room and the breakfast in the morning was delicious the appearance of the hotel is quite grand yet old school in the best way it is only about a minute walk to the oscar wild statue and the hop on hop off bus stop also it less than a five minute walk to the dart station train i would stay anywhere else in dublin this place spoiled us,1.0
location location location modern extremely clean well built with an excellent staff safe nice neighborhood less than a tram ride into city center tram stop is across the street with several great restaurants coffee shops a small shopping center on the water great property for a family at a reasonable rate we were there with our ten years old wanted to be close enough to city center but not in the midst of it if all hampton inn properties in the us is thoughtfully built as this one there would be many more happy travelers,1.0
i had one of the hotel single rooms for five nights it was on the small side but not unreasonable for a single the room was spotless i was on the back side of the hotel so i did have a cathedral view but also had no noise the front desk and bell staff were friendly and professional the restaurant was beautiful and the service very good but as others have mentioned the food in my one meal there was only not awful but there are so many great places to eat in barcelona the location of the hotel is excellent it across the plaza from the cathedral and walking distance to gothic quarter born and la rambla attractions about a five minute walk to a metro stop also an easy walk to the aerobus the airport this is not among the most luxurious hotels in barcelona but it holds its own in the classic old school style of a full service hotel coupled with attractive rates and the excellent location it really a good choice,1.0
good location for a city trip to groningen close to and not in the centre further a good starting point for a bike and staff very helpful in providing information making arrangements and assisting in parking our are relativeley small but ok and with a perfect view on the city breakfast is very good and further is coffee and tea the whole day avaliable for free,1.0
arrived around mid afternoon and hot the hotel was a sheer delight fresh orange juice and bottles of water available all day and a smooth check in the room was big and an abundance of toiletries laid out in the bathroom and the shower was heaven breakfast was a huge choice with amazing views of the acropolis on the roof top in the evenings we went for drinks and watched the lights illuminate the acropolis when the sun went down the drinks were pricey but you pay for the views if in athens definitely stay at the electra metropolis hotel as the staff were amazing kind and helpful,1.0
arrived at hotel at on fri july staff were nice and friendly and check in was quick we were situated on floor and the room was spacious clean and had a brand new memory foam mattress so the sleep was comfy and great bathroom was all modern with a fab shower can not fault the room at all its in the perfect location as was quiet and only mins away from central amsterdam by train you can also get the trams from outside to the museums there is a coffee machine and vending machine in reception if your but then the supermarket is literately mins away and you can get a all day travel card from there for also there are hairdryers kettle and a coffee machine provided in room all in all a great stay and would stay here again when i return to amsterdam,1.0
we booked the hotel for nights as a treat for our first anniversary we loved the location of the hotel just off a side street on la rambla the architecture inside and outside the hotel was modern yet had a feel of age aswell an interesting mix most of the reception staff were helpful the pool bar staff not so friendly the pool itself was very small and roof space was also minimal only room for sun beds the pool bar area was nice to sit and relax in the evening a bit pricey for food and drinks on the roof terrace the ground floor hotel bar never seemed to be open we had a look at the menu for dinner but did like what was being advertised and so never ate there our room rate which was cheap did not include breakfast either we ended up having breakfast locally for very little the hotel is in a central location for the busy la rambla harbour area and for bus or boat tours also for local markets plenty good bars and restaurants nearby cleanliness was a bit of an issue the floor never seemed to have been swept all the time we were there although our towels were changed when needed the room had a safe and hotel wifi was free a bit awkward getting transport right to the front door for as street has rising bollards,1.0
guest relations nightmare two reservations made for the same night paid for in advance one through third party agent other through hotel website family is due to arrive into athens early september we only require one room i have asked the hotel if there were interconnecting rooms advised no rooms of that have paid close to aud for two rooms for one night i asked if it was possible to remove one of the rooms and perhaps use the cost in theory to upgrade to a room facing the acropolis request deniedi was told that i could just cancel the room via the third party agent spoke to ihg guest relations explained the situation the agent was helpful and understanding at no point did i ever seek a refund knowing that the terms were prepayment and the agent contacted the property directly on my behalf to try and negotiate some sort of upgrade given the cost of the room unfortunately the guest relations agent was advised no i would have to pay for have a young family two children under they can not utilise the other room to be honest i am not upset that i booked two rooms i take responsibility for that however i was hoping the property could see it was a mistake and perhaps compensate us a little so am i looking forward to my stay no sure all i know i have tried to contact a management and there is no response i am hoping,0.0
i stayed in this hotel during my business trip the hotel is centrally located with good access to public transport the premises are renovated clean and spacious the room was comfortable the restaurant had an excellent view to the acropolis housekeeping was up to a good standard breakfast had adequate variety the pool is small for the size of the hotel reception was friendly especially stefania was very professional and helpful i will stay there again,1.0
check in easy and nice staff provide parking validation at nearby garage about a block away euro discounted to euro if i remember correctly clean sleek room with ac bathroom setup was a little odd because completely transparent shower door opens directly into hallway there is a door you can shut to get some privacy between the hallway and the bedroom but it means another person can not use the hallway leading to the door was fine for our purposes but slightly inconvenient as i was traveling with my father breakfast is additional but only euro and was very good overall great stay also offered a free welcome drink at registration,1.0
the rooms did not correspond to the rooms at the pictures on the website the size of the room is very different form what is stated when booking it shows that triple rooms are but the actual size of the room was less then the hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived was not small dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room all the halls and corridors are very tiny if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel also no place for the luggage in the room we had to use an extra bed for it the hotel manager was rude to us screaming and shouting sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the website so upon the issue was solved if you book this hotel please do not expect to live in the rooms which are on the pictures and have the size that stated on the website they are tricking people,0.0
this hotel was wonderful it is in between the airport and downtown the tram is right around the corner min walk and very easy to understand a cab ride from downtown was also not too expensive either if you were there late at night the rooms were very spacious especially if you get a corner room the breakfast in the morning was amazing the station was by far the best i have ever seen the staff was very friendly and willing to answer all questions our bartender who worked at night was amazing she was so cute also nicky at the front desk was excellent before and during our stay i highly recommend this hotel,1.0
we loved our stay thomas at the front desk went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and welcome loved the honor bar in the lobby and the eclectic decor the lobby cafe was trendy and the food was delicious the rooms were modern beds were super comfortable and the long jetted tub was a welcome site after a full day of sightseeing located just a few blocks from the major museums and canal cruises as well highly recommend it,1.0
we are a family of who stayed at travelodge fira to be convenient to airport we found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming with plenty of information on travel shopping etc the rooms were lovely and cool in the hot summer and the beds were very comfortable the reception booked us a taxi for an early flight but the metro is also very close we would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
have just returned from nights in this lovely hotel and was really pleased with my stay my room was perfect for one clean and comfortable and had hairdryer too this is an ideal base to explore barcelona it is not situated in the busy tourist area and so is a lovely retreat after a day exploring it is right next to the hospital clinic metro so ideal for travelling very easily to all the places the buffet breakfast was brilliant with a varied selection coming back after being out all day to the rooftop pool and jacuzzi was bliss and the views from the roof are beautiful free wifi which worked straight away and was reliable the staff were all friendly and helpful and being a solo traveller i felt very comfortable i will definitely recommend this hotel and return in the,1.0
we booked this hotel for nights in june as part of our month travelling round spain we chose this because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed this definitely feels more than a star check in was good with the receptionist spending a lot of time pointing out things on the map for us and answering our questions room was one of the best we stayed in with small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel the location was in a quiet area just off plaza de catalunya but within walking distance of la ramblas and shopping area we were minutes from el born a lovely area with good restaurants and bars we used the metro which was a handy way to see the city and very good value if you bought the ticket deal nearest met was urquinaona they have a roof top bar here which was lovely but underused which is a shame but on the plus side we always found a table,1.0
decent location poor room facilities ie no air conditioning and the windows would open properly still the cheapest accommodation we could find but regrettably i would use the hotel again or recommend staying there,0.0
stayed was tiny but well equipped with complimentary nspresso side rooms like overlooks the water is great in heart of of restaurants and hangout places around the hotel,1.0
great location near las ramblas the street it was on was scruffy but do let this put you off room was an adequate size for with air conditioning to etc clean well decorated roof top pool area a bonus for relaxing after a busy sightseeing day pool is small but what do you expect i would scored it stars if breakfast was included i would recommend this hotel to friends,1.0
love this hotels lobby built around the castle stayed one night while in dublin for room with a proper walk in shower not one over the bath breakfast was not included its a bit away from the city center would definitely stay here again,1.0
i stayed here for business and came back two years later with family because of the great location friendly and helpful staff and overall nice experience i was not disappointed and loved my second stay,1.0
we stayed on the return leg of our italian holiday they treat their diamond members very well we were upgraded to a lovely corner room combined with complimentary breakfast the stay was great value given the size of long stay parking in dublin and the frequency of the buses to the car park you can get to the hotel quicker than your car most times pity the shuttle does run for an extra hour as many european flights arrive around midnight the taxi is only though,1.0
we arrived at from an overnight flight from dulles we did not expect a room to be ready on arrival however our receptionist made sure that we were shown to the executive lounge which we were qualified for due to our loyalty points and while there eating breakfast our room became available room was spacious and well appointed hallway was a little noisy with door closures location is great for walking to old town and the red light district as well as canal tours heinenken eating locations and the museums price is at the high end but worth the expenditure,1.0
the dublin doubletree morrison was very well located for seeing dublin the staff could not have been more welcoming helpful accommodating they bent over backward to make us feel welcome offering suggestions for sightseeing and simply making sure our stay was superlative the rooms were very nice clean with good beds and good pillows one morning the electricity went out in that section of dublin for a period of time the staff was scurrying around making sure that everyone was safe apologizing profusely for the inconvenience and trying to help as much as possible we were extremely impressed by their actions we were a family of adults and one child age with rooms,1.0
first thought as i walked in was is this an old people home not up to date quite shabby beds comfortable majority of staff were quite rude not worth euros for two nights per family breakfast was cold and an amazing hotel would stay again definitely not a four star needs re checking,0.0
we chose this hotel for its location and roof top location was excellent very central and easy walk to the attractions of the waterfront la ramblas catalunya plaza and espanya plaza we had a room on th floor just overlooking the rooftops around room had all amenities we needed and the bed very comfortable the bathroom was spacious but the floor could be slippery when wet the rooftop area was lovely nice spots to sit and relax we did not use the pool we went to use it one afternoon and there was a large group of men drinking around it taking up all the space and being very loud that would be the only complaint i would have about our stay the breakfast buffet was excellent,1.0
what a beautiful hotel we stayed nights and everything was excellent the rooms are beautiful they accommodated our request to have adjoining rooms with our children and the service is impeccable the breakfast is one of the best we ve ever had while traveling abroad beautiful buffet of hot and cold foods plus a full menu all served with a view of the acropolis the hotel was conveniently located in the syntagma district on the same square as the parliament building where the changing of guard takes place plenty of shopping and restaurants mostly touristy around though we were able to walk to several great restaurants recommended by the concierge the kg doesn t have its own pool and the fitness room is very small but guests may use the pool spa and fitness facilities at the adjacent sister hotel,1.0
our family of stayed at this hotel for nights in two rooms in early july right at the tail end of a heat wave the front desk personnel were friendly and courteous the hotel in error had on record that i was a gold member instead of platinum upon showing my spg card status as lifetime gold with platinum status it was fixed and then we were entitled to the daily breakfast on the roof top i not sure whether it impacted my upgrade or not as the hotel was full but it was still a bit disappointing the breakfast service is amazing and the staff are very attentive and friendly the rooms are well appointed and the beds are very comfortable as platinum we had access to the spa and usage of steam rooms the location is just perfect and you have a beautiful view of the acropolis we definitely will come back,1.0
first the highlights updated hotel with comfortable rooms and a great breakfast in a great neighborhood secondly the disappointments as a gold honors member and mile flier i have stayed at a few international hotels the staff never quite got all of the amenities in my room right each day no new coffee most days bathroom amenities missed most days daily water was hit or miss on my last day of i asked for water to be replaced and was told the hotel policy was water only on the first day of arrival really this is the first major brand international hotel where i found the complimentary water rationed to one day i explained my concern to the staff and they had no answers penny wise pound foolish i will not be back,1.0
overall very pleasant the staff is very kind and helpful just ask for help or directions and they will help you in any way you need the room was large bright and clean the hotel lies within walking distance of everything but not right in the middle of the most touristed areas the nearby neighbourhood is very nice full of small streets with bars and cafés where the locals also turn up,1.0
pallas athena grecotel boutique hotel makes our stay in greece wonderful the place is so accommodating the rooms are decorated beautifully the price is reasonable and worth it the breakfast served was delicious hotel staff are hospitable and caring they can be easily asked for favors and make way to give it to us recommended,1.0

nice room had access to patio which was a sun trap it could be used by two other rooms but we only seen one couple for about an hour bathroom ok room was clean coffee machine a lovely touch staff were very friendly and helpful there is no residents bar but advertises drinks can be purchased ar reception for the lounge very limited selection only spirits were barcardi jameson and gin no vodka only a small point but as the surrounding area was packed due to the match at aviva all the bars were busy so was looking forward to a drink at the hotel before bed however lovely hotel we loved the patio and for aviva would definitely stay here again,1.0
very good clean bedrooms big size clean bathrooms and friendly staff close to city and public transport thought it should be a little cheaper though the wifi was excellent defintely recommend it,1.0

this hotel was a great surprise as it was a great value as well as a modern quirky fun hotel in the middle of the city the hotel was centrally located to walk to the squares and sites neighborhood was a bit sketchy at night and would recommend being in a group in the evening however we had no trouble and enjoyed our stay our room was huge with a large terrace and nicely appointed bathroom amenities the restaurant was lovely and the friendly waiter even taught us some greek to get us through our visit all in all the hotel and staff were pleasant and i would recommend this hotel,1.0
small quaint hotel very clean with soft comfy bed and pillows staff was super sweet and helpful centrally located near the museum district easy access to bus which is a direct bus ride to the airport high end shopping stores right around the corner plenty of cafes nearby we definitely recommend and return to this hotel,1.0
i was very pleased with my stay at stauntons on the green the staff was friendly and went out of their way to help with my luggage directions and restaurant ideas regrettably i was only there for one night the room was comfortable clean and well appointed i could easily have stayed a week,1.0
this hotel was absolutely wonderful to stay at it was located in a central part of dublin enabling walking to most places the hotel staff was top notch warm helpful and very service oriented i would recommend the conrad dublin to anyone coming to dublin,1.0
chose the hotel due to its proximity to the croke park stadium where i was attending a concert it ideal for that purpose but would say if you want to stay away from the noise of the city centre this would be ideal as it still within a minute walk to the centre all the staff we encountered where highly professional but friendly and welcoming bed was amazing and i had a pleasant sleep with is rare for me,1.0
we stayed at the corner hotel on the recommendation of a colleague of my wife who had stayed there in may the hotel was edgy dark and but warm and welcoming our room was small but comfortable and it had my favorite shower in all of the five cities i visited on this trip the only thing missing were staff was very helpful with any and all of our needs the rates were quite reasonable the hotel was located in the heart of the eixample neighboorhood and was no more than a minute walk to the metro and about a minute walk to sagrada familia i would definitely stay here again,1.0
we only stayed two nights at the hotel room was comfortable and clean we did not eat breakfast here but chose a nearby cafe room service was very good as our room was being the second day mid to late afternoon and we had to wait at least hour until completed before we could use it this was the only issue otherwise a lovely hotel,1.0
this hotel is the perfect location for tourists with limited time in the city it beside restaurants shopping souvenir shops bus to hotel and its rooms are very staff are professionally friendly all hygiene factors for this hotel have been ticked i ca find a flaw to it it just needs to serve with a heart the staff are professional and functional but lacks the warmth and inherent sincerity that creates an emotional to a staff by the name of christian who helped us bring our pcs of luggage from the hotel to the bus station all taxis went on strike on the day of our departure although he was instructed to assist us he nevertheless went out of his way to ask the police for information on which roads were accessible some were closed due to the demonstration and which stops the airport buses are going to arrive at,1.0
excellent location walkable to lots of restaurants and museums and away from the raunchy red light district the room is adequately sized but definitely not your typical stateside marriott decor the absence of a dresser complicates storage during unpacking the shower is very good but the lack of a fan turns the bathroom into a steam room after a shower the breakfast in the executive lounge is much better than the stateside version the front desk service is very good,1.0
lovely hotel in perfect location it was perfect for me for the weekend away the only thing was there was no bedside table which is nice to have but overall loved it it was clean and big enough for ppl,1.0
this is a great hotel with a great location beautiful neiborhood close to many attractions metro very close by rooms are medium size with spacious bathroom and confortable bedding the hotel has a very nice restaurant and the staff is professional and friendly if i have the chance to return to barcelona i will choose this hotel again,1.0
poor housekeeping missed turndown service poor concierge tea is not replaced no views to speak of wifi is miserable and not secured i would not come here the restaurants are decent the spa has no availability for hotel guests so do come here if you like a good spa for two days they could not give me a slot,0.0

we had three rooms for a one week stay and each rooms occupants had a wonderful experience rooms were impeccably clean and spacious room service and laundry were well done location is very close to the beach and night life,1.0
great location one block away from the subway which can be taken to the sites and the airport spacious clean rooms and on site restaurant the breakfast was fresh and plentiful front desk staff was friendly and helpful only con is that there are no irons in the rooms or hotel only option is to use their pressing service note they do not before but do keep your bags in case you want to start your trip asap it is also about or blocks away from a local delicious svylavki restaurant,1.0
dublin seems generally expensive so we choose travel lodge as a budget hotel dublin stephens green is more expensive than most tl but is better than most tl as we had a very nice and large room and bathroom it is very well located just off grafton street not far from the liffey and temple bar you can walk to most places mins maybe to the guinness store house and jamesons distillery for kilmainham prison you will probably need transport and be sure to book in advance,1.0
the best of many good things about this hotel was the terrace on the top floor plenty of chairs and tables from which to survey the spectacular view the acropolis to the north and the city and the mountains beyond it to the east and south we took our breakfast up there on a tray no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift every morning and our coffee or wine every evening it was a spectacular way to start and end each was also well placed not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the acropolis so instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years and joined them a little further up only a little but it was more magical the hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times whether we needed to know about museums restaurants bus routes etc they telephoned hertz for us when our lack of greek and the hertz office busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting,1.0
i satisfied of this hotel it an honnest price and the staff is very kind breakfast basic but to beach and metro are perfect good bed and bathroom with bath staff very helpfull,1.0
lovely place to stay very nice interior very central with great breakfasts room was a little small but that is probably typical of athens staff were very friendly and helpful and gave good suggestions as to where to eat,1.0
we had a great stay at this hotel the room was clean we selected a room overlooking the canal breakfast was exceptional at robertos the complimentary internet was ok and there was trouble with tv service one night other than that great experience,1.0
easy minute bus ride from dublin airport centrally located in city my husband i walked everywhere clean comfortable room bathroom by american standards but typical for a european city we did try the breakfast as we were in out each day of our stay,1.0
my wife and i stayed here last weekend just to get away for a couple wow tara on the main desk is a legend after the free upgrade to the honeymoon tower suite and complementary bubbly and chocolates all within the first moments of the staff refusing to take tips and all making you feel very location with views of the vodel park main entrance and leidsplien directly oppisite the main holland casino just off the main hussle leidsplien will be using this hotel again in the future,1.0

this was the perfect stay for our last night in ireland before flying home the next morning the staff was very attentive and friendly our suite was beautiful spacious comfortable we especially loved opening the balcony doors it truly is an incredible also accessed both the gym and tub and both were lobby bar was bustling but the servers handled it very well and we felt that our service was very attentive even though they were busy the food was excellent i ca say enough about this place i highly recommend it for a retreat while in dublin,1.0
the room was clean nothing like the picture the pool is small what you see is what you get for a star hotel we made reservation for hotels bucks they were going to give us a discount for to return to the airport i ask a cab driver what he charged to get to the airport tourist trap i had the garden view which overlooked plants that people grew on their patio renovation for apartments and workers looking in the window thanks booking,0.0
having read the ta reviews i made sure to get a room at the back ended up with which was fine on small size but fantastically comfortable bed and nicely decorated baffling was finding the ac control in the closet who a thought my partner loved the blue bottles of water for guests she collected a set and brought them home but a work colleague got a room backing onto the elevator had to move due to noise another was looking onto la rambla on level i think and also complained of noise the rooftop restaurant is so worth the small premium holy cow how much beautiful food did they bring out we went twice being gluttons for punishment at night the view is great but the bar is barely adequate no expertise in cocktails given the near proximity of excellent bars without the view head to somewhere like bar negroni for a much better and cheaper experience,1.0
spent nights at the hotel and my stay was excellent the room was clean and had everything you need free coffee tea toiletries and wifi member of staff was friendly and hotel is not in the centre but about tram ride out but there is a tram stop about minutes away which has frequent trams into the centre there is also a train station about minutes walk which has trains to the pool and changing area was also very clean and pool was eat at the hotel so ca comment on the food,1.0
a modern castle hotel much more live able and much much mores affordable than the other castles we stayed at during our plus weeks in staff here was simply amazing without being room with its bed was our last great memorty of our the lounge was fair priced were you were hesitant about ordering more than one drink,1.0
nice budget hotel very comfy bed good collection of tv stations limited complimentary water bottle in the room not that it matters unless you do like tap nice staff and great lobby to relax it is very central so easy to go to many places and also next door to the shopping area and there is a park next door which i will highly in all i will recommend it,1.0

firstly the location of this hotel is excellent we purchased a card which allowed us use of the cities excellent public transport system all of which is readily accessible from this central requested a double bed in advance through the app received a room with singles frustrating but not the end of the world the room itself was an ok size for people but felt very small due to the window not allowing much light in after exploring barcelona all day my wife and i decided to spend a little time on the rooftop soaking up the sun in the jacuzzis before our concert that evening we were disappointed to read upon arrival that the jacuzzis were in fact hydrotherapy pools unheated again frustrating but it summertime so not the end of the had bought a couple of beers and took them up to the roof and had sat down for more than seconds before being set upon by a very rude member of staff who asked us to leave immediately as we were not aloud to bring our own drinks to the rooftop i attempted to reason with her explaining that it was one bottle of beer we were unaware of this rule as there are no signs or notices anywhere we had seen forbidding bringing your own drinks plus it was our first visit to the hotel and city all to no avail we offered to pour out the drinks and buy some from the bar no out,0.0
ideal for couples staff extremely helpful and friendly short walk to the main sights of central barcelona but in a nice quiet alley so great for undisturbed nights top pool and bar area which could be made of by the hotel but a nice place to relax of exploring prior to for couples,1.0

went to barcelona on july spent a week at the catalunya plaza boutique hotel hotel has been restored very pretty inside very nice staff especially jordi at front desk great breakfast in morning beer and cava are put out in afternoon clean rooms but they are small we requested to be moved from first room as it was so small no washclothes great location as bus stop is across street and you are at the top of la rambla walking area with shops and restaurants lots of high end stores like avenue in ny also very busy this time of year and warm weather no public bathrooms you either use a mcdonalds or some restaurants require you to buy something to use the toilet eating outside was crowded and everyone smokes but inside where they had air conditioning was less people make reservations before you go online if you want to see the major attractions we took a minute train ride to see the champagne caves and could get a tour as they were all booked train and bus service were easy to use itapa next to hotel was not very good food however la tagliatella was an excellent italian restaurant as was bars bar everyone eats late to at night so if you go earlier you can get right in mediterranean sea was beautiful to swim in beach nice but crowded and there are restaurants you can eat at right on the beach,1.0
we stayed at the coral prior to a sailing vacation and the hotel had been organized by the sailing group very nice facilities with a great view of the waterfront from the lobby lobby restaurant and breakfast rooms none of our party got rooms on the oceanfront but room rate was per night so no worries there rooftop pool with retractable roof for sunbathing was fun and relaxing and a swim in the ocean from one of numerous handy beaches was possible also getting to athens city center was simple enough by tram but took about each way breakfast buffet was included in room rate and buffet was fairly complete by north american standards bacon and eggs lots of pastries and fruit and fresh squeezed oj that you make yourself with the help of a machine that literally eats the oranges a couple of youth tour groups were i the hotel at same time as our group and hallway and breakfast got a little noisy with some their excitement but it was a big deal staff was very welcoming and helpful whenever we needed something safe unlocked bag storage tram directions etc rooms were good sized with comfortable beds and all conveniences coffee hair dryer etc elevator was a little tight ppl so some waiting involved there or get your exercise on the stairs floors max great oceanfront boulevard made for a few nice walks and a decent running location long or so mega yacht harbour nearby was fun to,1.0
this is a beautiful hotel close to la rambla and also placa catalonia super outstanding service from all of the staff including paulina who was very helpful focus and good service at the beautiful hcc terrace with a wonderful views value for money was ok and the breakfast presentation and quality just outstanding stayed july travelled with group,1.0
it was out first time to greece we were a bit concerned about all the online stories about pick pockets i choose this hotel after quite some we were surely not the hotel as such is strategically located on a well known karaiskaki all taxi drivers knew the the hotel is surrounded with bakeries hr restaurants convenience stores taxi stands the open blue red yellow busses stop right by the the famous monastrisaki square is a good mins walk through main roads and interesting we walked all times during the say an night without any the hotel is good a bit the toilets need the staff are very breakfast though monotonous we stayed for a week was the view of the acropolis is something all buildings have at athens therefore not a big overall a good and safe hotel to stay,1.0
after disembarking from our oceania cruise we spent eventful days in barcelona to cap off our vacation the hotel bagues located on la rambla was a perfect location for walking around the front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the restaurant staff was excellent as was the food we were supposed to have a car pick us up at the hotel to take us to the airport and we asked the front desk staff to please confirm it for us turns out that our flight was moved up an hour so they had to call the driver and ask him to get there earlier i think everyone at the front desk got involved in this task from finding the number to waiting on hold they were terrific i sure i may have missed some names here but thanks go to avelino jorge anastasia fabio nicolas soungalo the friendly doorman and eder and marco the restaurant staff heartily recommend this fine establishment,1.0
was expecting a holiday inn to be so nice really clean and great for the money we got a standard double for with free breakfast although the breakfast was a bit disappointing room was big and bathroom really posh great shower which was also really clean taxi back from the local red light district and coffee shops was euros though so get a bus or tram instead it only miles,1.0
we stayed at the hi for a couple of nights and were quite happy with our stay first off great location to everything downtown or any of the busses to take you wherever you want to go the staff was very friendly and accommodating we arrived super early in the morning but they were able to take our bags and store them for us while we explored breakfast was included which was a nice display of eggs meats breads and fruits the room itself was clean and spacious enough the only complaint i would have would be we were on the second floor and above the underneath so we could hear people and music well into the night but we would stay there again we would just ask to be in the opposite side of the hotel or on a higher floor,1.0
the hotel américain as it was once known is a grand ol dam beautifully appointed our room had a balcony that overlooked a canal within easy walking distance of many restaurants and shops not to mention the beautiful canals loved the attention to detail the staff provided and the hotel bar is a wonderful surprise,1.0
fabulous location so central and yet serenity by the canal and near to the river liffey the staff are fabulously friendly and efficient and the rooms have views for days they helpfully changed my room so that i could maximise from the experience and the concierge is very knowledgeable and efficient,1.0
to the westbury thank you after days up north that were great you somehow topped it all and left us happier than we ever could have expected from the moment we arrived we were greeted with the kind smiles of your welcoming staff never found ourselves with unanswered questions or wanting for anything afternoon tea was a wonderful experience our room was simply amazing comfy bed lovely sitting area wonderful view yet still quiet at night i was disappointed to leave dublin with only half of my must see list accomplished there is only one solution to this problem another visit to ireland and another stay at the westbury look forward to staying with you again in the future,1.0
this is a fantastic high standard hotel located in one of the best prime locations in amsterdam which can be rare to find in city towns of amsterdam very clean rooms were great and good size local to many attractions at pretty much walking distance and located in an area you wo get bored of day or night staff are friendly and polite other stayers were also nice and polite no hassle or trouble local area is also pretty much safe and quiet in the night can be a little expensive but if you look out for deals you can catch yourself a great value trip no complaints would ideally like to be always staying in a hotel like this for european destinations,1.0
oh the hoxton how i will miss you this was a wonderful hotel experience how you might ask maybe it all began with which was quick and efficient we had an early and the room was ready and then lovely room a large and tastefully decorated room with massive floor to ceiling windows overlooking the herengracht canal and romantic century burghers homes across the way this has to be the best room in the hotel with both the bedroom and gloriously large bathroom overlooking the canal and with a small juliet balcony off of the bedroom the king bed was firmly comfortable and covered in luxurious white cotton sheets the room has which is important in the humid summertime and a flat screen tv if you like that sort of thing bag breakfasts arrive at your door with yogurt and bananas in the morning and there is coffee in the room but the part that makes it special a pint of fresh milk for your coffee why does every hotel do this there is also unlimited bottled flat and sparkling water again every hotel should do this downstairs there is a fun and lively bar and restaurant with reasonable prices that seemed to be a hot spot for hanging out the hotel location is also fantastic not far from the trams and shopping oh i almost forgot they have four free bicycles available for their guests to use ilovethehoxton minor complaints to get to room you get off of the,1.0
fantastic location very close to lansdowne road dart station which gets you into the city in a few minutes lovely old house with good sized rooms and a nice sitting room with tea coffee the bed is good but the quilt was much too hot in july so had to use the throw as a blanket the breakfast is excellent there is an amazing menu to choose from as well as a buffet i will highly recommend this place to our friends,1.0
excellent on all counts food room quality cleanliness contact staff well done we stayed three nights and the staff contacted me when i had vacated the room by pm on day they wanted to tidy the room good work,1.0
thought quite expensive as did include breakfast view of a wall from our window room bit disappointing but we were not in room that much good location air conditioning good very clean and good amenities taxi rank just up from hotel so handy for airport mins away euros for four of us would recommend restaurant ca which we found through trip and it was only mins walk wonderful catalan food we also had the best ever burger at another restaurant mins walk in other direction called bacoa there is a little takeaway breakfast place over the road euros for a croissant each and a bottle of water but there are loads of cafes to eat a substantial continental breakfast in in every direction you turn we paid about euros for coffee juice and croissants for the four of us in a cafe whereas it would have cost euros at the hotel drinks by the pool were reasonable the hotel is very big that why i felt it impersonal would recommend though,1.0
my wife surprised me with nights at the pulitzer a wonderful experience perfect in every way one example they called ahead and asked about our four year old daughter hobbies and preferences as we checked into our room we found a personalised pillow for her they printed a sign with her name and some graphics which was then ironed onto the pillow the only sour note was the one waiter from the patio bar who was slow to get our orders and by the time we had to leave for an external dinner reservation minutes later had still not actually served our can also highly recommend the restaurant,1.0
we stayed at this hotel on two occasions within a week with a trip in best attribute of this hotel is its location it is just one block from syntagma square and the metro station in fact we hardly have to take the subway while we were there acropolis and its museum was just a short walk away and so is the flea market plaka and shopping district the meeting points for both the walking tour we tooks was also a short room of this hotel was ample and clean its bathroom was also of a good size there was too much facilities in the hotel which is fine by us since we are out most of the time the breakfast was sufficient but nothing to shout in all a decent hotel at a reasonable price in a great location,1.0
we were very satisfied and would recommend this hotel location and cleanliness could be beat only wish it had a pool bakery was excellent start to the day and staff was always helpful and friendly even when it was was very busy we would stay again,1.0
overall a very good stay here comfortable room double comfortable bed and delicious breakfast minutes outside of barcelona would definitely stay at another hotel good helpful staff a short stay to visit family who live here and also to soak up some culture i would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
stayed here on our last night in ireland a few miles from the dublin airport a wonderful experience i agree with all previous comments i was told that this was indeed the sight of the original castle supposedly a wall in the reception area was part of the original regardless it was well worth the stay,1.0
before i booked this hotel i researched and read all the reviews good and bad i figured i will take a chance since i was going to be in athens for three days from the piraeus port to the hotel the taxi ride cost euro upon arriving to the hotel the bell hop greeted up and took our bags the checkin was simple and breakfast ia euro per person i stayed on the floor the view was terrible my room faced the back of buildings the was clean and everything was in place the hotel provide shuttle service to the city center the driver was extremely helpful and very informative i wish i remember his name the times are perfect starting at and the last pick up is the shuttle service has two stop the first stop is at the mcdonalds where you can shop at h m zara and other fine store the second stop is close to the acropolis museum the hotel is located in a area where plenty of restaurants are around in walking distance one of favoriterestaurant was the tavern second restaurant on your right the food was amazing the vegetables soup is everything simply burgers was also a nice place to eat for under erous all in all my stay at the hotel was okay i made the best of it they can extend your check out time if you ask in advance in plenty of walking drink coffee and eat spinach the swimming pool,1.0

on arrival we were immediately impressed with the hotel it is decorated beautifully at reception we were spoilt with a room upgrade the rooms are very comfortable with great views this is probably the most comfortable bed we had in any hotel the room top bar is great with a pool and jacuzzi at night time the roof top bar comes to life there really is no need to look for a night out when it already location is perfect just mins walk to las rambles and gaudi architecture the gothic quarter is also within walking distance too we will be coming back again also very impressed by the hotel asking if we did mind making a very small contribution to aids research what a wonderful policy they have here,1.0
we only stayed one night at the westbury before moving to the intercontinental the location was great the rooms were small but comfortable service was impeccable and staff super friendly not pretentious for a star hotel i have to give it only stars because it way over priced the rooms were really star worthy and aside from the public areas it no different than a nice hilton or marriott property i recommend for the location but honestly how much time can you spend on grafton st,1.0
i stay in this hotel very regularly on business and can not fault it at all it is very homely staff are very pleasant and the bar food is top are very comfortable clean and modern and there is a great car park on site with plenty of tried various other hotels in the area cheaper and more expensive and this is the best prices are very very reasonable i would highly recommend this not just for business but for family breaks or short away from home is not so much of a chore in this spot,1.0
absolutely excellent book it you wo regret it i be back i hope well trained knowledgable staff keen to make your stay perfect location excellent in the heart of everything room was super cool a real experience,1.0

the staff were extremely warm and room was pleasant and clean and was also cleaned free continental breakfast was simple but hotel is located just off of omonia square which seems to attract a rough and seedy wouldnt recommend going out late at night there are plenty of eateries located near by which served nice food thats also cheap the metro is located two minutes away with easy access to the acropolis and other sites,1.0
we just leaving after a two night stay in this great hotel very friendly reception staff on arrival we were offered a comfy seat and given a welcome drink whilst the lovely receptionist explained the finer details and volunteered lots of information about barcelona our room was smallish but was emaculately clean and had everything we could possibly need for our stay we were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which had plenty of choice with lovely hot milky coffee and staff who were on it always replenishing food our days out in the city were finished off by a drink or two in the bar where the staff were just as friendly and efficient all staff from chambermaids waiting staff concierge to receptionists were super friendly i would definitely recommend,1.0
stayed a few nights while attending a conference held in the hotel nice common areas and generally spacious well appointed rooms somewhat outside the city centre which in theory did not matter in this case however continuous drizzling rain and cold wind did not encourage venturing out pleasant and friendly attitude notwithstanding it took over min for the reception staff to find my reservation not sure if the fault was with the event organisers or otherwise service in the lounge area could be slow and spotty the spa seemed very popular with no availability for certain treatments without a reservation booked well in advance,1.0
nice place to stay and start to my first trip to ireland parking was in front of the hotel fun pubs across the street for a short get the breakfast in the morning everything is fresh and really good,1.0

cozy rooms and old world charm i lovedi the antique decor of the common rooms breakfast rooms and the bedrooms breakfast was excellent lots of fresh choices great service the hotel is located near the archeological museum and is worth the trip it is within walking distance of many great restaurants,1.0

the hotel is located next to the plaka minutes to the acropolis and museums and shopping and cafes the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful spacious rooms and gorgeous swimming pool breakfast is served at the restaurant on the top floor terrace restaurant overlooking the acropolis and parthenon it would take too long to describe the breakfast so i will just say marvelous i highly recommend the restaurant for a memorable dinner while not iunexpensive it is reasonable for a star gourmet experience try to reserve while the sun is setting over the acropolis,1.0
me and my family staying here for night we wish we could stay longer but the hotel is fully occupied we experienced very good service and at the same time very bad service during joana was very helpful she showed us our options in our first night we orders room service we were very disappointed with our room service our club sandwich was missing tomatoes bacon and very little lettuce it was basically only cheese and small meat in bread our pasta was missing parmesan it our chicken sandwich was good fausto was very helpful during this issue and made us feel like proper next day we had called at times to have our room serviced returning after the beach at to find our room still very dirty was the worst part of our after we called again it still took hours to have our room clean at that time is was already maria was very helpful with delivery our ice which we waited over minutes pool staff was always in the back room therefore it was hard for us and other guests to obtain towels and order we enjoyed this hotel we want to recommend this hotel although there are a lot of device to fix it seems like the ma agents and higher staff hide in the back while getting the interns and other lower staff to complete missed jobs,1.0
just got back from two nights at intercontinental dublin we had a wonderful stay friendly staff great irish breakfast and very comfortable beds i highly recommend this hotel although it is a bit far from the city center but it worth the distance the area is plush beautiful and very safe thank you intercontinental for making our stay a memorable one,1.0

we had a fantastic stay at the grand central hotel as a couple looking for a break away from the usual daily grind the staff were friendly and service was excellent they could have been more welcoming or helpful and nothing was too much hotel is a smart boutique hotel with good sized rooms and complimantary we absolutely loved the roof top bar and the infinity pool after a day at the beach or sightseeing it is so nice to come back and have some relaxing time in style the hotel is well positioned close to the shops and beach many tourist attractions are reachable via transport links near by hop on hop off bus etc thank you to everyone at grand central hotel for making our weekend blissful,1.0
very close to the train station which is an easy taxi or shuttle from the airport our room was very spacious with a sliding door and small patio overlooking the river and guiness factory about a mile away the staff was friendly and ion i think that is how it is spelled who checked us in was so friendly professional and accommodating which was such a nice way to start our vacation especially since we flew all night and were exhausted he got us in our room a little early too which was a nice surprise,1.0
i can not rate the polis grand high enough from the moment we walked in to the moment we left the people there could not have been more arrived in the early evening and the night receptionist gave us a warm welcome and helped us with some basic but very useful local information the hotel is located minutes walk from omonia square where there is a metro station and tour bus pick up there is a bakery and supermarket located nearby the main tourist section with access to the acropolis and other attractions such as numerous bars and cafes is minutes straight line walk from the room was typical of a star european hotel included was a safe tv fridge and balcony the aircon actually worked and was adjustable remotely which is unusual from my experience the bed was amazingly comfortable and the room although located next to a busy road was very quiet the hotel said they had spent a lot of money on was typical european fare the usual array of pastries cold cuts bacon sausages fruit cereals etc all being refreshed constantly vasilis the catering manager showed me how to make greek coffee in hot sand i enjoyed it surprisingly linda thought it was had dinner on the rooftop one night with our son and his fiance there was a nice view of the acropolis and the meal was very enjoyable total bill was which was not too bad for have no problem in encouraging you to,1.0
after a long trip it was nice to have this hotel to such a close distance to las ramblas it was very easy to get to it also was a great base to explore the city as the medinaceli is situated right at the start of the barrio soon as you get in you are welcomed by very friendly staff that make the check in process very easy we then took the lift to our room and everything we asked for we traveled as a family with a baby in tow was set up it even had a little balcony where you could see the narrow street and people walking not the best of views and at the start it did concern me about the noise but all was great no noise at all in terms of facilities the hotel has all you would expect the rooms get a bit stuffy but there is air con and that is always a pro the only thing we would have wanted because of the small baby would be a kettle to clean her bottles but unfortunately they do have any they asked us to ask the kitchen for hot water was pretty clean apart from the floor which was pretty did really try the breakfast hotel breakfasts are usually a rip off this was per person so we adventured outside and just went for a local the building is beautiful on the inside with a hanging circular staircase and some hidden rooms,1.0
the hotel location is excellent centrally located we arrived early to drop of bags to be greeted by friendly staff who gave us all the information we needed to get to croke rooms were very clean and comfy the food at the hotel was good and reasonably priced as well cheaper than temple bar which is totally a rip off the live music was excellent as well would have no problem booking the arlington again,1.0
we just stayed here this past week while attending a conference and overall enjoyed our stay the hotel public areas and rooms are immaculate very professional yet friendly service enjoyable full breakfast buffet that is included in the price of the room there were a couple of issues that kept me from giving it a rating of especially when factoring in the cost of staying at this property i was surprised by the lack of sound proofing between rooms we could clearly hear everything the occupant in the adjoining room was saying as if he was in our room he was on the phone talking at a normal volume for me when traveling location is key because of the conference held at the hotel it made sense to stay here and if you are in dublin for business then staying out in ballsbridge might be just fine however as a tourist i would prefer to be in the city centre where everything of interest is to be found it about a min taxi ride into town and would cost between euro there is a city bus that stops nearby on the main road which was very convenient bus or takes you into the center of town at a cost of there is also a dart commuter train about a min walk away,1.0
great staff good clean room excellent breakfast located if you want to explore plaka and monastiraki areas easy walking to restaurants with a mini mart next door and a large supermarket around the is approximately a minute walk from the hotel suggest wearing good walking shoes with rubber soles to avoid slipping on granite steps and pathways qheading up to and in the rooftop terrace gives you great views of the acropolis especially at definitely return to this hotel,1.0
summarized when we told the young lady at the front desk we did enjoy our stay as we found the hotel outdated with old carpets beds small and dirty rooms we simply got the reply it an old building definately not worth for tourists this hotel is not the dutch standard not a recommendation,0.0
absolutely ok place although nothing special clean and proper quiet at night not quite what i expected from the picture which showed both a view and a balcony got an interior and a small room but fine for a short stay for work travels and airconditioning slightly dodgy area good enough breakfast but what with swiching off the lights when the service finished,1.0
we came for nights to visit amsterdam attractions and the concert breakfast was good and varied as well as staff friendly and helpful close to tram stop which makes it easy to move to the center also nearby are good affordable restaurants we be back at this hotel again,1.0
the hotel is located in the area of montjuic just some minutes walking from the city center the views from the restaurant and the terrace are amazing the rooms are nice and well distributed they have a nice bathtub big king size beds and also have a lovely balcony to let the nice summer breeze in the service is fantastic the front desk staff is always on point and are willing to go above and beyond to solve any issue that you might have it was always a pleasure to be greeted by them and to see their smiling faces day to day overall a fantastic property top choice i could not recommend this hotel enough until next time,1.0
superb spot in the centre of athens the spa and rooftop pool were great features that we used heavily during our stay imo very good value for money with everything you look for in an old world luxury hotel in a city,1.0
the rooms were clean comfortable and small but lovely excellent air conditioning the breakfast was very good and varied i did not visit the restaurant or bar the staff was friendly and accommodating there is an elevator i was only there for one night but would stay again,1.0

so far not impressed poor service in bar only three tables of three and two bartenders and a manager behind the bar room has mould in the shower door in hallway squeaks sooo bad anyone have some definitely not a four star,0.0
the hotel is situated in a stunning and quiet neighborhood it is not exactly near the centre but it is very easy to achieve it with means of transport staff kind and are clean and comfortable,1.0
not central as its in the northern suburb of kifisia very close to the metro station handy for the airport and in a very nice quiet and leafy side street very close to the shops in kifisia limited parking spaces in front of the hotel but there is a parking garage close by with good prices nice boutique decor modern and tastefully furnished rooms monsoon shower good wifi throughout comfortable bed and very helpful staff by nice buffet breakfast too would happily stay here again for a staycation,1.0
room was clean and location was good the front desk staff need to more customer service skills as everyone i ran in to came off as very standoffish and aloof i was afraid to approach them to ask any questions because they seemed so involved with themselves the one time i did ask for some direction i was given a very curt reply overall i would look for another hotel if you are going,0.0
stayed at the hotel praktik rambla for nights on vacation with my mom we could have been happier with our stay our room was always clean and we could only hear minimal street noise loud motorcycles the beds were very comfortable and they provided each guest a pair of disposable slippers for the stay the staff were polite courteous and helpful i spoke to them in both english and spanish without any communication difficulties last but not least the location was perfect it was much quieter than the area around many of the other hotels i looked at for our stay but it was still in the heart of the city the block of dischord was only blocks in one direction and las ramblas is only blocks to the opposite direction there are plenty of restaurants and shops around and there a pharmacy nearby should the need arise i highly recommend the hotel,1.0
we stayed here for the coldplay concert we were very happy with our stay from start to had a great welcome check in was easy our family room was adequate for adults the bar staff were very friendly and could have done more for us at the end of the evening we had a visit from the local farm animals the resident reception sheep served a great pint of guinness lol great hotel we certainly be back,1.0

very good value stay in a lovely part of barcelona the recent addition of the rooftop bar and pool made our stay all the more enjoyable we stayed with family and friends and had a very enjoyable time service is good and reception staff very friendly and helpful,1.0
staff very pleasant we had a triple room clean basic we where at a music festival with a group of girls some stayed on the first floor some on the second the girls on the first floor had no sleep as the music was thumping into their room throughout the night from the beer garden nightclub bar you are supplied with earplugs in the drawer they got some discount the next day after complaining we paid each for breakfast but it was not worth it fine for but i would recommend for a family,0.0
we based ourselves here for nights during our stay in the city and the although not right in the centre it is only a short walk away check in and out was efficient and without any fuss the family room we occupied was huge with everything you need there including a basic ironing board and iron and making facilities what sold it for us was the quiet and relaxing atmosphere there was very little noise from other guests on our floor room but some from the street to be expected we did eat in the restaurant or use the pool so ca comment but cheap eats are available just around the corner see munchies review parking is available nearby but it is expensive eye wateringly so after unloading the luggage i put the car in the connolly train station car park ok it about half a mile north from the hotel but at per hours it great value and safe on the walk there you see lots of other places to eat and even nearer in the square off misery street behind the bord gais theatre are more restaurants and cafes the clayton is a comfortable modern hotel and we would be happy to stay again,1.0
stayed here a few times excellent hotel great location very friendly and helpfully staff very quite no outside noise whatsoever very helpful with early food is very good and lovely big seating area,1.0
a fantastic hotel with really great staff especially the maids and staff in the breakfast room the lobby area smells so nice and is the same scent of the shower gel in your room rooms are spacious and my room on the second floor had the most powerful shower i have ever used it was the best plenty of plugs however none next to your very close to passeig de gracia for transport around the city and also for trains out to the coast plenty of high end shopping in the area chanel is just next door a brisk minute walk to the sagrada familia you should definitely head up to the floor and see the view,1.0
we booked a family room and instead got a very tight room with no space for the of us we had paid for the extra spacious room but it turned out they had room is stuffy as there is no circulation of bathroom is small and floods with water after reception has a strong smell that i ca quite place it like a damp staff are fairly friendly the location was the only excellent thing as you could walk or commute with would stay there again though at least not for the price they charge,0.0
location location location great location of the hotel the room was clean ca expect luxury it a business hotel but it one of the best on this next to it there is a wonderful park so if you have your kids whit you you can have some good time people was very friendly like most of the irish recommend,1.0
first time to athens and chose melia athens omonia as my base and shuttle to santorini mykonos zakynthos and choice as even though the area is old part of athens omonia was first public square in athens but accessible was key with metro only blocks down from there everywhere was just so convenient with all the sights and things to was super friendly and professional in check in to luggage directions and arranging transport,1.0
our family enjoyed a wonderful days in barcelona and we loved our stay at the sheraton four points the hotel was wonderfully situated and provided easy access to all the tourist sites while giving you a local experience in their emerging neighbourhood the surrounding restaurants were excellent and within a few minutes walk from your room while the rooms are modestly appointed they were clean and perfect for resting at night and parking suitcases during the day while you explore the city lastly the staff was excellent front desk waiters etc were all interested in making our experience positive i was very happy about our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time touring while visiting barcelona,1.0
we had a pleasant stay at this hotel rooms were slightly small but very clean and good service the hotel is in a nice location convenient for sightseeing and transport links would be happy to stay here again,1.0
we had a lovely stay at casa fuster staff was extremely helpful and nice location was ideal and close proximity to many things breakfast was very good with lots of choices in an interesting room downstairs loved the bar area rooftop for the evenings with delicious drinks and snacks pool area is little small but plenty of space to get sun door men extremely friendly overall would love to come back to casa fuster,1.0
this is a lovley hotel which is part of a wider chain it is good value for money on a bed and breakfast package the breakfast was very nice and well stocked the bar during my stay was understaffed as i believe the bar staff were off or on a training course the location is good although expect a min walk to the centre or a short taxi ride very clean and comfortable place to stay,1.0
i can not remember how many times i had stayed at the nadia hotel but the welcome remains very warm indeed the staffs are as friendly as it was when i first stayed here many years back i was always greeted with a welcome home message from staffs and the hotel manager himself when i first arrived in the room was a vase of flowers with a welcome card on it and a basket of fruits the hotel is ideally located near the city centre tram station and a supermarket nearby,1.0
friendly flexible service from smiley staff comfortable rooms great location and good value for money my teenage daughter and i and our friends had a wonderful experience modern furniture set in a beautiful building,1.0
was amazing they even rmoved crusts from my toast very attentive staff could do enough for it was a it noises outside during the night but that not the hotels fault,1.0
we loved our sense of safety and the combination of the rooms overlooking the courtyard the sound of the seagulls the cosy room the bar the staff and all the help everyone gave us made us feel that we had a soft landing after a long and awful flight to ireland we go back without even looking at alternatives next time we are in dublin,1.0
myself and my husband stayed here after getting a really good price for the night online hotel is lovely building in a nice area of dublin room standard enough but both bathroom and bed area was spotless parking which is slightly annoying when you are a paying guest but i would stay again,1.0
this is right on bridge so you perfectly central the room was nice we had a huge comfortable bed it was clean and spacious the only problem was that our room was up or flights of stairs and they had no elevator i would of minded it just that the person i was with has a disability but when we mentioned this to the staff they were more than happy to bring our suitcases up to the room for us we had one drink in the bar just one because it was pretty expensive for a single pint but that to be expected in a central city would stay again,1.0
excellent small bijoux hotel you could walk past on grand via it within easy walking distance to the regular bus routes and the bus touristique red and blue lots of local restaurants to try out and big shopping areas all around the hotel is clean and the room is quiet spacious with a great powerful shower and excellent air con required at the moment with these extreme temperatures staff are really helpful and friendly a special mention to karen in the restaurant who every morning has charmed us with her friendliness and kindness highly recommended,1.0
amsterdam is cripplingly expensive when it comes to hotels and if you still want to be close to the city centre but avoid the cost and bustle this hotel wins minutes walk from the free ferry to centraal and on the trendy north side this hotel is very handily stayed here on business but would hesitate to use its services as a tourist staff are super friendly bar and restaurant are good cosy during the winter downside is in the summer the rooms can be quite stuffy with no way of letting fresh air in,1.0
i had the opportunity to spend an additional five nights in dublin this past july my stay at the ashling hotel was exceptional it is close to all forms of transportation yet it is just outside the hustle and bustle of the city center which made for a quiet stay the room was large and well lit the bathroom was impressive with its separate shower and large soaking tub the staff were more than friendly upon my arrival every employee that i met throughout my stay was helpful pleasant very professional and made my stay that much more special room service was very prompt and the food was fresh and hot the breakfast buffet had so many options to choose from which drew you to it every morning i will definitely stay here again on my next visit to dublin and i highly recommend it to others,1.0
the hotel is located very close to syntagma square which is very convenient for taking the bus to and from the airport it is also perfectly situated for exploring the plaka and all of the historical sights on foot our room was small but clean and the hotel breakfast was good with a variety of hot and cold items,1.0
stayed here saturday july for the coldplay concert the hotel and room was very clean and staff was friendly the hotel had put on a free biz to and from the concert which was good when checking in i was told that an extra would be added as a deposit for the room but would be returned on the card as soon i we checked out now this shocked me as the room cost i would have thought that would have been enough the room was overly big we stayed in did hear any noise which was good and slept fine the receptionist had offered breakfast at a discount of which we declined personally i thot after spending there would be more than a discount reading through other reviews i see the hotel offered ice creams little extras in the room which did seem to be the case in our experience for location wise and cleanliness yes i would go back to the hotel but maybe think about little extras for all guests and not just some,1.0
we are a family of we stayed at casa camper for nights and thoroughly enjoyed it we had a suite which has a double bed sofa bed and hammock which slept and then a standard room that had a double bed and a separate which had a single in it the buffet worked a treat the kids loved it there is a basement area with a bar seating and pool tables the roof terrace has an outdoor seating and honesty bar and a rainforest shower having never been to barcelona this waste perfect place to stay,1.0
i chose this hotel on my trip to barcelona primarily for its location there are more luxurious options in other areas but the olivia plaza is so centrally situated that it is easy to walk to both the older parts of town barrio gotic ramblas picasso museum etc as well as the more modern parts eixample gaudi houses we arrived by train at the passeig de garcia station easy minute walk to the hotel and departed by the aerobus which leaves every minutes across the street from the hotel there is a metro stop right outside the hotel and we used it to get to the sagrada familia and park guell there is a huge el corte de ingles across the street checkout the foodcourt on the top floor for an amazing view the hotel itself is well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful if you are traveling you are not totally comfortable with check the room pictures on the website and be aware that some rooms incorporate the bathroom into the actual room this makes the room feel more spacious but compromises privacy somewhat overall i felt that the positives of this hotel outweighed any negatives though and would stay here again if i return to barcelona,1.0
fiance and i stayed here for two weeks in february lovely hotel staff was very professional and helpful great housekeeping staff breakfast is included and was the best way to start our mornings close to everything would stay there again,1.0
if you like a small room untidy floor and industrial extractor fans all day then this is for you i stayed in this hotel before and took into account the location and the fact that the building is old the beds were comfortable however this time there was no escaping the fact that the room had not been cleaned and the noise level was beyond ridiculous previously i had been at the front of the property so nightlife influences things considerably but the room this time was so small there was no escaping the noise it sounded like the window was fully open and it was the only quiet place was the bathroom and had there been a bath i most likely would have slept there having had a terrible sleep even with ear plugs i stepped out of the bed to go for a refreshing shower and found that a piece of pepper that had been around the bed not mine became stuck to my foot the level of gross was not pleasant to say the bar is lovely the location great if you completely deaf and the rooms a roll of the dice for the area there are better choices that give a good nights rest,0.0
got it for its location absolutely right on temple bar area and walking distance to molly malone statue where all the tours start in the morning can also walk to grafton st and shopping area you barely stay in the hotel being that its so close to so many things first room had an outside facing window into a street but due to some construction noise in another building we changed to an internal facing room with no view but room was fine everything worked well i would say its a bit on the small side but probably the case with city hotels has all amenities ca go wrong choosing this unless you have a lot of luggage and need larger rooms,1.0
the hotel has very high standards when it comes to premises and service a special thanks goes to claire for helping us out with the bookings and check in even going the extra mile by supporting us with info related to dublin,1.0
this is a very nice hotel the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful it is an easy walk to the subway a special thank you to ali in the terrace bar who gave us exceptional service for hilton honors members there is a nice continental breakfast and the server there was very kind and helpful we had a junior suite with a beautiful balcony and nice view,1.0
hilton diagonal mar is a great place to stay in barcelona only had a few days so the staff went out of there way to make it great they booked an excursion and followed up with us each day they took a personal interest in making sure we had a relaxing time,1.0
here what we really liked about the hotel the room was comfortable the bed and pillows were comfortable the bathroom was clean and the toiletries the white house were quality the reception staff whilst not warmly welcoming ensured we had the information we needed they ordered our taxis on time the breakfast was excellent i love a hotel that provides great breakfasts and include coffees in the cost rather than an extra i love a breakfast that provides loads of fresh fruit yogurt seeds nuts and crunchy granola my husband went for the cooked bacon eggs tomato and toast option and he was very happy with the options the downside for us was that the hotel is not near the dublin attractions we wanted to see kilmainham gaol the book of kells christ church cathedral temple bar etc we needed a taxi to and from these each time around a cost of euros but thinking about that if we stayed at a hotel where we could walk to these attractions we would have missed all of the lovely and informative chats we had with the dublin taxi drivers all but one who was a of the taxi drivers where friendly and really up for a chat and happy to explain more about the city and about ireland history so when considering your hotel options factor the taxi rides into the cost of the hotel room the croke park is a comfortable hotel to stay in plus you get the bonus,1.0
despite the name i had no idea this was student housing seems that it mostly student housing during the year and mostly a hotel in the summer that said there were many young people which made us feel a bit out of place despite the excellent friendly and english speaking front desk rooms are spacious enough and thoroughly modern wifi is excellent although on a metro line this is mostly useful if coming from the train station or airport tram is much more useful figure minutes to get to the hub not a big deal given the frequency of the trams some basic and fast food restaurants close by we chose this hotel for financial reasons and it is great bang for the buck,1.0
sebastian is a small boutique hotel on a lovely canal the style of the decor is quirky lots of purple black orange and gold and the standard canal room is quite small that was ok for me as i was traveling solo perhaps one or two of the barrel chairs set by the windows could be removed i think what sets this hotel apart is the service all acted with the utmost courtesy and friendliness i got to know many of them by name including the sister of the owner who tended bar the front desk really came to my rescue on the last night of my stay i left my credit card at a restaurant and was slated for a cruise the next morning the hotel checked and made sure my card was safe and their communication with me was timely and friendly the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff was efficient and amiable there was a lingering scent of tobacco in my room when i checked in the management apologized sincerely someone in an adjoining room had been apparently with the management honestly i like a cigarette now and then but i would never smoke in a hotel room nor would i ask for an exception this is amsterdam however lots of smokers if sebastian completely banned smoking in rooms i would have given the hotel stars,1.0
the mirror hotel is very different it is not called the mirror for any other reason you are literally walking into mirrors from floor to ceiling it is quite bed was to die for one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in in a staff are very unique they are all dressed in black and white trousers waistcoat and hat very buffet breakfast with an egg man,1.0
i was very impressed to take my family to such a nice hotel we ordered a bedroom apartment which was very clean and modern beds were very comfortable and facilities in great condition we ordered room service as we had just left a full day tour and were very tired the meals were very reasonably priced and very tasty hotel was also in a quiet location and we all had a good nights rest breakfast buffet was included and offered a wealth of options thank you for your hospitality,1.0

stayed here as part of a cosmos group and it was my favourite hotel throughout our tour of staff and concierge at reception were so friendly and not the fake friendly it actually felt genuine they spoke impeccable english and were beyond has a vast array of different meals to suit everyone sometimes the waiters are a little slow to offer address you and offer you coffee but a minor restaurant also offers lunch and dinner and has quite good are comfortable spacious clean and the air conditioning functions well a must in greece very good location minute walk to the metro which gets you to the centre in stops and the acropolis in stops with a line stay here again,1.0
you can now stop looking for a hotel in amsterdam this property was clean the staff was wonderful the internet was reliable the food was excellent the location is fantastic the air conditioning was perfect the entire experience was lovely,1.0
we located just minutes away from centraal station or from dam room mate give us very good conditions to stay in the city modern with good and large rooms in the middle of the water simpatic team,1.0
dont stay in this hotel if you need an extra bed in your room my son could not sleep in his and we had to stay tried night but got sore back after having the metal springs in the matress hurt his spine and do not expect to get any help to get better bed either you will only hear lots of even i booked the extra bed week upfront they prefered to give the good extrabed to someone arriving same day who had not booked this in desk manager told me they were a big group arriving bit earlier than really dissapointing,0.0
i enjoyed my stay at the clarence the location ca be beat it within easy walking distance of many historical sites shopping and restaurants it also very easy to get to from the airport by bus and to heuston station the hotel itself is very clean cozy and i like the simple decor the room is a nice size and the bed is very comfortable the staff at the clarence were very welcoming friendly and helpful will definitely be staying here again,1.0

great hotel in the heart of athens we could see the parliament building from our balcony hotel was very clean there is a bar on the ground floor that serves food and drink breakfast is served on the first floor there is no formal restaurant all the staff were lovely we were allowed to use facilities at the sister hotel round the corner,1.0
this hotel is absolutely fantastic the staff on the reception and at the bar are friendly and welcoming nothing is too much of a problem we arrived two hours before and as our rooms were ready the receptionist was happy to check us in as soon as we had arrived the location is incredible the hotel is just opposite the cathedral and the gothic quarter and is less than a minute walk to major tourist hotspots such as the harbour las ramblas and to plaça de catalunya the hotel is impeccably clean and the rooms are designed beautifully the roof top terrace has the most amazing views of the city and perfect to relax with a drink after a day exploring barcelona we stayed in a basic double room so the rooms were a little small but perfect for a few days stay in barcelona although our room was situated on the first floor facing the busy street of via lietana there was no problem at all with noise from the street on an evening my only issue with the rooms is that as we were situated on the first floor the metro underneath the hotel caused our room to rumble like a small earthquake after midnight and before this was a problem but for light sleepers the rumble is enough to wake you up perhaps if we had upgraded our room to a higher floor this would not have been a problem despite this however i would definitely recommend,1.0
i spent nights here in location beautiful hotel spotlessly clean and well room was large beautiful and had great balconies fantastic rain shower shower bathroom was really rooftop bar and hot tub the pool is small but all you really need unless you swimming laps great way to cool off after a long hot day in the bar was crowded every night i was there good variety of guys too clearly it a bar that barcelonans visit as well which is good not just hotel guests there so you meet a lot of people only cons no shelf or counter space in bathrooms and i had a premier room the elevators are slow and not very the toilet paper was like sandpaper just being loud club music at breakfast and in the lobby in the morning is a little much even for a gay service was horrid i had a morning appointment and wanted coffee in my room while i got ready i asked for a carafe of coffee in languages to make sure he understood he did speak any english and postponed getting ready so as not to miss room service coming to the door minutes later i called and asked where it was and he informed me he was downstairs alone and could bring it up i told him to cancel the coffee as i was now running late while in the shower a housekeeper brought up one cup of coffee she told me they do have carafes,1.0

a little way out of the centre but ideally suited to the aviva though i prefer the pringle i prefer to stay out of the hustle and bustle and you get far more for your money that way too there still plenty to see and do in this area and it no more than a twenty minute walk to grafton street etc very clean comfortable beds and tasteful decor there even a beneath it though our room was peaceful when we stayed,1.0

this hotel has just about everything from a medium priced faultless location right on and restaurants everywhere you look and great buffet were relatively basic but very clean and adequate what more do you want when visiting barcelona as there is so much to see rather than sitting in your hotel room wifi was not very good and did not connect for us at all during our nights hey so what we had a ramblas room with balcony very small which opened directly onto the ramblas however rooms were quiet and after long days walking and a few drinks any low level noise did not keep us awake conditioning worked well in deg temperatures and friendly metro station just a minute walk awaybarcelona is such a wonderful place to visit our time and this hotel could not be faulted at all and would stay here should we visit we got the best deal by booking directly with the hotel,1.0

we stayed here for one night before our tour started the rooms are very small and it you have luggage there is very little room to open it you end up tripping over the was difficult walking around the bed because of the tv and dvd player sticking out of the wall near the foot of the bed i had set it up so our group had rooms i was a little embarrassed also you have to be able to walk to get to the on off bus the hotel is in need of updating the paint was peeling off the bath room ceiling there was some black mold in between the tiles in the shower and when they touched up the paint on the walls it did match the ac was also poor on a positive note the breakfast which is extra was very good also do expect to get into your room until after,0.0
this hotel is fabulous we were in room for nights the views are spectacular in directions the hotel is spotless with a star staff we were stunned by our room when we entered and saw how spacious it was the only negative we felt was that the restaurant menu is lacking so we ate out at nearby places everything is in walking central station the ann frank house included we would definitely stay here again,1.0
barcelona is a cool city praktik is a cool no fuss hotel i really recommend staying here the rooms are perfectly appointed and the bathrooms are really nice i enjoyed my stay and slept really well the italian restaurant right next door is great for a quick bite to eat too,1.0
the staff could not have been nicer but this hotel needs work our thermostat in our room and for our shower did not work the thermostat might have been fixed by a battery but the staff were not given the ability to execute any repairs we were given a fan and moved to a new room the next day the new room worked but it had a moldy smell the grout in the bathroom needed a good scrubbing there are no top sheets and only one outlet for charging the breakfast were included and very good i felt that the staff had their fingers in the dike trying to keep the hotel together,0.0

my mum and i recently stayed in this hotel as a belated birthday celebration for nights on arrival i was greeted with amsterdam cookies and a souvenir mug as a birthday gift which i thought was very sweet we stayed in a ground floor room near reception the room was very small but i liked the modern decor and the bed was very comfortable the hotel is situated in a beautiful part of town i liked that the street was residential as i enjoy seeing how locals live it is a bit of a walk up to the top end of the town red light area especially for us as we got lost a lot the on hop off boat is good to use during the day but both nights we struggled to find our way back to this hotel as the streets look very similar at night we should maybe have looked into using the trams all in all this is a great hotel that met our needs i would stay here again as the part of town is picturesque and a lot nicer than the top end of the city we did eat in the hotel so i ca comment on that but all staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful,1.0
our new room was spacious and better than our original room due to some hick up upon check in we were allocated a better room thanks to the efficient solution to us the hotel looks tired and it seems like it has never been renovated or refurnished at all but i will say the location is really very you must book the half day tour to see the windmills cheese factory and the wooden never regret even we experienced heavy rain in the morning when we were in the tour,1.0
this hotel is on the banks of the liffey in dublin financial district the surrounding area is spacious and quiet with many shops places to eat and drink if you take the time to find them the hotel itself is run very professionally with great customer service the rooms are clean spacious and the quality of sleep was excellent with the luas just around the corner and busaras connolly mins walk away it is a great location just off the city center,1.0

as a family of we booked a familiar room which is essentially two separate rooms accessible through one door this was the perfect set up for a family with a and year old the kids had their own ensuite bathroom and separate beds keeping everyone happy the rooms are quite sparse with minimal decoration essentially a bed desk and wardrobe as an environmentally friendly hotel there were any bath products available no face towels or tissues however it is in a very good location just a short walk to las ramblas the main street and to the port the hotel also offers a buffet breakfast of per person which was quite reasonable with a good selection of foods available,1.0

motel one is far from the city centre and top attractions the central station is very far top attractions and canals will take you around minutes by the public transportation staff were rude no bath available just shower no iron or british electricity adaptors were given rooms were too small keep your passport and money in safe place as no deposit safe was there it is simply a motel not hotel i misunderstood the motel facilities due to reviewers comments and i made a wrong decision if i will be going to amsterdam again i will go for another option,0.0
they offer early check in on internet but once you are on site they do have that there was no ac in the room and the front desk told us they would fix it but we later learned that there is no ac at all in the rooms it is just an air circulation system the windows barely open so it was suffocating,0.0
we arrived at the hotel this afternoon a little frustrated with things not related to hotel after having a few issues with the airline missing bags delayed flights etc xavi hope that the spelling turned the mood of our trip around by being super on getting my partners bags back from the airport and arranging delivery and finding several awesome little ways to make our trip more enjoyable and the experience exceptional very impressive customer service and the room is really nice opted for upgraded room for euro well worth it loving it and looking forward to a couple of nights exploring barce,1.0

very good hotel that i would definitely recommend staff was incredibly nice and knowledgable about the area hotel rooms were very clean and the bathroom was heavenly location of the hotel was perfect for walking everywhere,1.0
myself and my boyfirend stayed here for my birthday the transfer was great as we got to see the surrounding city before arriving at the hotel we arrived before check in but we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room and were able to explore the area and then check in was easy and rooftop pool and bar area is nice and has some really amazing views of the city there are a few sun loungers which means it doesnt get too busy however the pool is freezing and i could only manage a few room was amazing the bed was nice and big so theres plenty of room if you struggle with heat on holiday but we had the aircon on i loved the bathroom with the glass window the blinds are also an added bonus as you can block out the light the only downside was our view of a construction site and another room service was the best but was very prompt if you have booked without breakfast and need something quick and convenient i would avoid the breakfast buffet at the hotel as it was so expensive for what it was however there are two little cafes right next door which are breat have and some good food,1.0
good hotel just on the outskirts of town next to the park bus station just across the road along with the tram would go back nice little hotel also you get a free continental breakfast also free wifi and a good pizza shop just a cross the road with a few shops,1.0

this restaurant is situation in the clayton hotel opposite the bord gais theatre and offers a pre theatre menu that where the conveniences end apart from one efficient waiter the service was slow and disorganised there appeared to be a total lack of communication among the six or seven members of staff who came to our table over the course of almost two hours a group of work colleagues all ladies arrived for our reservation before for a much anticipated evening out this was the third visit for some of the group minutes later the manager noticed that we were still sitting waiting for service and was most apologetic he gave us two bottles of prosecco which were very welcome although given the heat of the room we would also have appreciated the jugs of water we asked for on arrival they arrived at around an hour after arrival we finally got starters and drinks and it was close to an hour and a half by the time we got our main courses at we had to make the decision to cancel the rest of the order and leave for the theatre for those who had decided to skip the starter and enjoy dessert this was a big disappointment the icing on the cake however was when the manager ran out onto the street after us and accused us of not fixing up the bill despite the fact that we had paid his colleague in cash and left a tip,0.0
the facilities were excellent and the staff was friendly and efficient we felt welcomed from the time we arrived until we checked location was convenient for touring the city as we began our tour of ireland,1.0
great central location for exploring minutes from the acropolis and loads of local dining well served rooms and the optional acropolis view is well worth paying the extra for the roof top restaurant is a great place to spend an evening watching the city and acropolis light up at night very helpful and attentive staff complimentary fruit and wine in room a nice surprise the kids loved making their own waffles at breakfast a hotel first petite and bijou rooftop pool very popular a great place to immerse yourself in the wonders of athens,1.0
everting was great the hotel is wonderful moderm and very well located very calm location near from museum and parks they have a very nice japanese restaurant inside the hotel breakfast is nice,1.0
be careful of not getting what you booked i was given a room with single beds when i booked a despite many rooms still being available on this night i was told it was my problem and i have to pay to upgrade if i wanted a bed according to the front desk they had changed my room at some time between my booking and my arrival,0.0
loved this hotel location is excellent and we loved the rooftop pool the desk staff and doormen were very as we were early arrivers and they went out of their way to get us a room early concierge also very good while traditional looking on the outside the hotel is very modern in its décor particularly the rooms i would definitely recommend it,1.0
overall this is a gorgeous hotel with great designs and furnishings the rooftop pool is a nice touch and you can see the sagrada familia off in the distance while the hotel was impressive on the inside and service was great upon arrival we felt the service was a bit lackluster for the remainder of our stay for the price point i believe better value can be found elsewhere,1.0
fantastic location room excellent staff nice but not overly which we like on holiday roof terrace lovely drinks pricey with only choices of wine and do think can buy a bottle roof terrace pool opens at but was for some reason did make a fuss though,1.0
the best location you ever dream everything is near by the hotel its make the vacation the evening its must to get to the pool that in the roof of the hotel there is a bar and with a cold beer with the view you can enjoy from a quality time,1.0
a hotel that can be reached by all means of transport from the airport we used the airport shuttle express in just minutes you will be infront of the hotel in about minutes you can be in street by the frequent buses they pass from just outside the hotel nos and just beside the hotel there is a food store which is open hours and a petrol station if you are to be using a hired car regarding the hotel it is clean with good breakfast the only problems were our room had a really noisy really headache bathroom extractor if somebody uses the bathroom at night he wakes up the rest we arrived saturday after and when we went down again at about and asked for the restaurant the receptionist told us that its till she should have told us when we arrived we had to go outside looking for a restaurant by walk but on the other hand when we needed to go out very early for our excursions they made us a good packed lunch thank you for heather and hannah they were very helpful,1.0
we spent nights this july at wyndham and my likes it so much that he thinks the hotel is the nightlight of his first ever trip to greece the staff are very friendly and attentative the buffet breakfast is very good with plenty of choices the crown jewell of this hotel is the rooftop which offers a million dollar view of acropolis both day and night we enjoyed lovely ice cream with the fab view every night there and it only costs euro each and the staff could be nicer we did eat meals there as it is quite pricey however just opposite the hotel entrance there is this lovely family run restaurant called alexander the great which offers delicious grilled dishes fried zucchni greek salad and mousaka for very reasonable price we ended up eating dinner twice hotel is located in the middle of the metro lines between the airport and the port which suits us very well as we were taking a med cruise from athens the metro stop is only minutes walk be aware that not much air conditioning at metro stops and in peak summers it gets really hot in athens a degree and so it can be uncomfortable a metro day ticket for unlimited rides only costs euro and so it a cheap way to get around,1.0
ink is in the central tourist area yet if you walk a few blocks away you are in a wonderful neighborhood that is more residential and filled with shops and restaurants lots of fun design touches throughout the hotel the lobby bar and restaurant as well as lounge areas that are comfy and a nice place to hang out with a drink or check your email our room was a superior room and it reminded me of the cabin on a nice cruise ship it is very small but filled with thoughtful design touches to help with storage and comfort room was quiet and bed very comfy we slept well but it small so if that is a concern upgrade to a larger room staff is young and caring they responded to requests and even went out and purchased a mat for us to use in the stall shower when i expressed a concern about safety they were not as knowledgeable about local restaurants think that is something to address but we did follow a recommendation for a canal cruise all in all our three nights in amsterdam were a little more special because we stayed at the ink,1.0
the athens mirabello hotel is a nice choice for a cozy stay the air conditioned rooms are very clean and wide with a balcony the breakfast does not have a large variety but the food is of high quality the hotel is very easily reachable from the famous omonia square and its metro station the hotel is overall a good choice,1.0
the view of parthenon was nice though no one informs the guest that when the cafe at the ground floor is closed there is no way in or out of the hotel during the night i needed to go out of the hotel and i realized that i was locked honestly that was a nice experiences,0.0
i had booked a room at a hostel but that hostel was so loud and low quality that i immediately looked for a proper hotel to transfer to after quite some sleepless nights i found hotel via augusta and spent my last night there i found out it is a hotel but i give it one more star it felt like heaven after that horrbible hostel experience the room was very clean and mostly quiet and i slept wonderfully the location was fine as it is close to the fontana subway maybe the view was not the best as my room was an internal one but all i was looking for was some peace and i definitely slept like a might come back here,1.0
every time we asked for something we were told no for example do you change money no do you have a laundry service no do you have a computer i can use no but the worst was our second night we called to see if we could dine in the hotel and were told yes when we went to the dining room we were told we could eat there because there was no food then we were told we could eat in the bar but someone from the front desk came and said no we could we asked if we could order a pizza and someone had to go ask the chef eventually we got a pizza probably frozen and it was awful apparently they cater to tour groups and were only feeding the tour group we did go to the irish night on our last night and it was wonderful however the meat was dry and tough we travel a lot and this was a very strange experience the room was stuffy and the last night there was a party or a fight going on in the street and we had to close our window so it got even stuffier,0.0
very excellent we enjoyed and all was good we were happy to be upgraded to suite instead of guest room i will recommend this hotel to all the people that i know the staff were nice and helpful the hotel is located at good area easy for shopping and transportation,1.0

i never written a scathing review in my life but so disappointed with our stay feel i have to try and give a true reflection of this place an over night stay booked as close to ariva stadium cost without breakfast on arrival the hotel was chock a block with football fans not a problem was a nice atmosphere but queuing to check in was painful pleasant enough just not enough of them a quick visit to room on floor to drop bags off shocked by state of the room i honestly stayed in better blackpool b bs on hen nights the walls were filthy not dirty or in need of a spruce they were absolutely black skirting boards had big chunks of wood missing and again dirty beyond words furniture and curtains ok drab and outdated but in ok condition no main light only lamps that did we returned in the evening hotel was still packed with footy fans and after trying to find a table for food we gave up and returned to room to order room service a blt and burger with chips soft drinks euros i could live with that if it was nice deliver on filthy trays and the glass was that dirty i had to use a mug to drink out of food order was wrong and as i have an allergy could eat it chips not cooked so literally ate the burger out of both meals as the thought of trying to wait,0.0

we stayed at the clayton hotel ballsbridge from the hotel is a former masonic girl orphanage and it is quite beautiful the rooms were spacious we thought the location was perfect it was not in the middle of noisy downtown but there was a bus stop right outside the door which would easily take you downtown in about five minutes on the or and the aircoach to and from the airport also stopped right outside of the door all of the staff were very friendly and helpful in particular imelda at the front desk was wonderful we would highly recommend the clayton hotel ballsbridge robert and graham chattanooga tn,1.0
nice hotel and well located for aviva stadium a short walk to the left when coming out of the hotel leads you to and a few shops if you go straight ahead you have a walk of about minutes to st stephen grafton street and you can enjoy the georgian of shops and restaurants along the way our room for people was well fitted out and had most things that are required but no mini bar to keep drinks cool the bed was a proper bed beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet overnight our room overlooked a construction site which became noisy at there is no air conditioning but a fan was provided fixtures and furnishings were generally good quality although our room had a stain on the carpet shampoo and shower gel are provided but not conditioner we stayed room only at a price of euro which was annoying when our friends stayed a few days earlier for a price of euro wifi was good we decided not to have breakfast at a cost of euro each we walked elsewhere and had breakfast for the of us for a total of euro the bar was expensive euro for a pint and a vodka it is a nice hotel but would only stay here again if attending the aviva stadium and i think that when there is an event at the aviva the hotel puts their prices up,1.0
the hilton doubletree is a few minutes walk to central station and the hub of amsterdam the hotel seems somewhat tired and the foyer is not grand either our room of course was not ready but we were offered an upgrade to an executive suite which included breakfast and the executive lounge privileges for an extra which we opted to do and was well worth it entering our room on the floor with great city and canal view we were a bit shocked at the blandness of the room and only a queen bed all the usual amenities were provided free wifi were very friendly and a fantastic buffet breakfast with exceptional waitress we would stay here again,1.0

this hotel was clean and the rooms large however it really is near anything so you either have to walk quite a ways or take a taxi the hotel does have and traveling in july it was quite warm since our room looked out into a courtyard we could get any airflow windows only opened about at the most we opened our room door but they had painted the hall and fumes were overwhelming everything great other than lack of or a fan,1.0
just spent nights easy walking distance of the train station this is like a tardis in that they have many more rooms than you expect even extending into the next building the room was clean and well maintained though this bathroom only had a water pipe to the waterfall shower it did have a normal shower head but you had to that pipe most hotels allow you to have both without resorting to messing with any pipes i do know whether this is a new policy to save some money or somehow that pipe got would recommend the hotel,1.0
i was taken to barcelona as a surprise for my birthday last year the hotel was good the bed was incredibly comfortable we had the level experience which was ok but i do think worth the additional the breakfast was not very exciting and we were informed of ordering additional dishes until our last very close to the main attractions but quiet location,1.0
small rooms it is in the center after all but clean and cozy no pool or rooftop terasse nice personnel really nice how the wine theme is represented throughout the hotel vouchers for a glass of wine,1.0
near to airport shuttle bus available at certain times early morning and later in the taxi from airport approx euros good value compared to other hotels friendly staff local supermarket take away pizza nearby,1.0
if your main priorities are getting an excellent location without having to pay much then this is for you it just a short walk away from monastiraki station and a number of the ancient sites and is surrounded by places to eat the price was amazing but the facilities were basic i had a private room with shared bathroom but the walls were and did block out any street noise there were some opaque windows for light but no view to be had but if all you after is a place to sleep at night it does the job and i no complaints,0.0
i stayed here for two nights on business from the airport this hotel is very quick and easy to get to by using the airlink express bus from outside either terminal of dublin airport the bus stops a short walk away from the hotel entrance the whole style and atmosphere of the hotel is very modern in comparison to others in the area check in was quick and hassle free my room was minimalist but very bright and airy as well as being exceptionally clean two free bottles of water were provided as well as a decent hairdryer ironing board and iron two things i have found to be rare in other dublin hotels i did use the restaurant or bar but the choice available on the menu in the room looked great the only negative i would have is that there was one mirror in the room next to the door and there were no sockets close enough to be able to plug the hairdryer in and be able to get close enough to the mirror to use it at the same time,1.0
excellent room and facilities way better than any of us were expecting only fault of this place is the cleaners extremely clean but a few of our possessions were chucked out whilst we were out sightseeing such as water bottles we used on a night time that we kept next to our beds and sets of eyelashes which were left out neatly in the bathroom on tissue costing me just under hide anything you do want to part with the cleaners do think before chucking things out,1.0

the hotel is right outside a metro station and about a block from a tram that takes you into the museum precinct they also offer small boat canal tours ppl from memory which are reasonably priced so you do have to do it on one of those larger touristy boats we went up the eastern channels around the zoo and ended up outside amsterdam centrale staion hotel is on the main road but as bikes are the main form of transport little road noise could be heard and nor were sounds from neighboring rooms present,1.0

i extremely critical in my reviews as tripadvisor has served me abounds for the past decade and i try to pay it forward i enjoyed this hotel and athens even though i only spent great location to all the action in athens small supermarket next door amazing rooftop ac works great really liked the complimentary wine greek treats and water soft pillows and a comfortable bed as it should be appeared to be one large mattress not beds together which is a bonus in europe breakfast was nice decent choice of food including eggs and bacon plenty of seating and food area was constantly being cleaned i requested a taxi for the next morning it was outside on time early in refurbished older building but definitely some obvious short cuts in construction elevator lift extremely small and slow not adequate for luggage and people i wouldnt mind all the steps but they were sketchy uneven width due to winding circular design i watched an elderly gentlemen try and navigate them carefully i went to bed around midnight and had to be up at for a flight if this was the case the dragging of chairs around on the rooftop at midnight and would have been an issue as i stayed on the floor overall i will definitely return i took off star for solid reasons i respect rejuvenation of old infrastructure and the revamping of an existing space however the elevator lift is extremely small and extremely slow during busy,1.0

stayed at the hotel espana for nights last week lovely hotel road just off la ramblas we had a deluxe room with street view balcony which was very spacious can be a bit noisy if you like to go to bed early but was a problem for us personally modern decor absolutely loved the rooftop bar chilled but good vibe bar staff up there very friendly and great service did have breakfast or eat in the restaurant there so ca comment rooms were lightly cleaned daily my only moan is the reception staff were very welcoming when we arrived did seem friendly at all and always seemed to rush you when you went to great stay at hotel espana,1.0
we arrived early but there is a room where you can store your luggage while you start to see the sites of the city the room great and and with being close to the square you can walk down to the square where you catch the hop on and hop off buses also other coach tours the hotel is situated so it is a nice stroll to a lot of eating places etc,1.0
cons the location of the hotel is seedy and horrible as we walked from the metro stop to the hotel men were breaking areas of the sidewalks to fill bottles with water from the underground pipes litter was everywhere and the area is severely i was embarrassed to bring my family and international guest to this hotel and arrival we were informed our family room was on the floor once entered it was clear it was a double room in which they tried to squeeze in a single bed and a rollaway chairs from the desk were moved to the foot of our double bed and crammed against the my discussion with the staff we were moved to a family room on the floor facing the back streets of athens we were informed that the room on the floor was indeed a family room which i know it was not here the description copied from their official website dorian inn hotel offers a great variety of standard single double and triple rooms and from the to the floor we offer superior double and family rooms for an stay in athens spelling from hotel websiteupon departure at we saw a man sitting on a doorstep sniffing white substance and a woman sitting on the sidewalk with adult dog and puppies who appeared to be malnourished so very sad for all these reasons i will not stay at dorian inn hotel in the the breakfast was very good and the support staff,0.0
we stayed here just last week and the hotel is clean and comfortable we had an external private bathroom your key card unlocks both your room and your bathroom and they were just across the hallway so this did really bother us the bed was comfy and it has a kitchenette with microwave fridge and kettle hairdryer in the wardrobe is handy towels shampoo shower gel and soap supplied in the bathroom room comes with a bottle of water each and to help the environment they offer to opt out of your room being cleaned any day you like and as a reward they give you a free beer of soft drink there no way our room needed cleaning everyday we had it cleaned once in a night stay and that was fine the area is quiet but it is a minute or less walk to the sloderjik train station and only stop on the train to amsterdam centraal so very well located to get around we did not eat at the hotel at all we went to a local spa shop right outside the station and bought breakfast bits and kept in our rooms fridge to eat on a budget a great shop which is in the amsterdam centraal train station is hema they are cheaper than spa and we shopped there alot you have to try the stroopwafels and the waffles and the pancakes around amsterdam delicious,1.0
when we decided to make a last minute trip to ireland we had to decide what sort of room to book we checked out a few sites where you can rent a room house or hotel we opted for the castle hotel because it was convenient included a full irish breakfast and had room for an odd number when traveling our room included a twin and one double roomy enough for our breakfast was a great way to start the day they do mention that certain hours are particularly busy so we were sure to get up early to beat the crowds breakfast included eggs bacon sausage mushrooms tomatoes beans assortment of breads jams and irish butter fruit juice and were included you could go up for night we went to dinner downstairs as it included live music we had their pasta the first night which was heaping bowls served the of us and the night we had the irish stew which was excellent the hamburger with frits was also great the first night we had regular western soft rock but the night was irish music both with one musician it was a fun way to end our evening the food was excellent and reasonably priced and the staff was exceptional always serving with a smile and very helpful the cost for nights was on the pricey side but because we booked so last minute our options were limited if we had more time and more options we might have,1.0
a very convenient hotel with a good location clean rooms along with excellent breakfast was also nice with a good selective thanks for the champagne on my birthday,1.0
a truly wonderful hotel their location on a quiet canal was perfect away from the hustle near central downtown but close enough to restaurants and shops the staff was top notch and very professional they went out of their way to help with anything and make or stay more than comfortable the bar off the lobby was a great evening respite and one of the little things that makes this a hotel feel like a home away from home the room was large and amazing appointments in the bath it was worth the price for this exceptional experience in amsterdam we will be back,1.0

we were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend this to anyone looking to stay right on la ramblas staff was polite and professional and the room was good we paid for the breakfast and it was an excellent value with good service and good booked a small interior room and got a small interior room the bathroom was relatively modern the furniture was in good shape the only minor complaints i have were there were too few electrical outlets available in the room one in the sleeping area and one in the bathroom the ac was a little weak but did function and cooled the room when given a long time i went out and bought a fan though,1.0
everything was perfect even for a guest like me who is exactly one of the regulars you would find in these kind of hotels the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and professional i was impressed with the cleaning of my room when i came back i found a used towel still on the floor some bits of paper from the breakfast that morning and some other minor details that was unfortunately overlooked other than that everything was perfect and i certainly hope to come back again,1.0
me and my boyfriend making our trip to amsterdam and been looking forward to stay at the arcade hotel cause their pictures on the website look so good turn out when we get here we could find the hotel cause there is no sign or the name anywhere so we guess from some random paper on the window said with no this place still under construction dusty everywhere in the air and smell very bad the stairs to the upper floor as small as hamsters house when we open the door to our room we kicked the bed cause the bed just stand right there you have to move very slowly and super careful cause the hallway in the room is very small check my picture bathroom was the worst cause the water couldnt go down the well so it flooding the front desk say its our design of the place i speechless cause if you can call this design i would never send anyone to study with much not worth your time and money to come to stay here and tell your friend family neighbors and some strangers you walk pass never come here,0.0

no disappointments from our return visit to the universal we stayed for three nights in a superior room at the front room modern great air conditioning needed and all the basics being at the front there was some street noise but hey it a busy city famous for night life the hotel was quiet though loved having a pool on the roof also the roof top space is well used with seating areas and a sun bathing deck there is a bar too sea city and montjuic views made relaxing evenings we did eat our evening meals there but drinks were pretty standard hotel prices for a large beer for a cocktail breakfasts were good lots of choice personally i would have preferred tea or coffee made and served it came from a machine and you served yourself but it was fine really you pretty much got on with it at breakfast restaurant looks new and is a pleasant environment the lobby and reception staff were knowledgeable and helpful the location is ace mins to la ramblas placa reial about mins walk to see the magic fountains and just across the road from metro and funicular we enjoyed our stay very much,1.0

knew what to expect from pictures and reviews but can say we definitely enjoyed our stay clean and comfortable floor room provided great city views and right outside a main metro line stop decent price for a pricey city and would stay here again if visiting say the bed was extremely comfortable and the curtains were very out great night sleep was had,1.0
needed a for coldplay concert and saw leeson inn on for just under for night the fotos looked good and felt that for the price it must be good the reality was a dirty hole damp walls black spot all over curtains dirty brown carpet with car mats strategically covering stains badly broken glass in front window that permanently rattled noise from street all night the beds never seen a bed arrangement like it i could go on but could give the place any more airtime i would say that if you had a big smelly dog and needed to stay in an inn this would be the one as it has the ambiance of a dog kennel,0.0
i can under stand when hotels get busy that you need to wait but when people who are booked in advance at least groups by my count are told to wait some over an hour while off the street are checked in well that is clearly all their rooms became available at once so clearly there is no coordination between and front desk they could have avoided the problem by having housekeeping release the rooms for check in one by their systems are more important than the a pleasant stay,0.0
i am a silver member so the day before online to make sure i get a room away from the tram if you get the wrong room here it is incredibly noisy my room was very quiet and the bed comfortable the lighting in the room is not bad for a business hotel the breakfast is comprehensive and very tasty with good bakery selection staff are pleasant and helpful,1.0
the bar is well stocked the restaurant is excellent especially the seafood chowder and the smoked haddock and cod patties for starters were the best i had in all of need to mention how you like your fish cooked as they will bring it out well done i like mine a little rare in the middle the breakfast was abundant the ambiance in bar is is also a club lounge with tea coffee and fruit and continental breakfast on offer with some room types however we chose to eat in the large dining area well worth the extra to be paid the room is spacious and very reasonably priced when i booked i was not aware that were going to play across the road hence the hotel was booked out on one of the nights that we wanted to stay will definately stay at croke park hotel loved it,1.0
we stayed one night and had two rooms for people rooms were spacious and comfortable did not eat at the restaurant because the breakfast price was outrageous within a minute walk to one of the hop on hop off bus tour stops which was convenient for us do even think about getting laundry done price is per item for a pair of underwear to be laundered hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood,1.0
just completed a night stay at this centrally located hotel before we even arrived the staff was very helpful in setting up our accommodations the hotel was centrally located which made many of the attractions in the city accessible by foot they were very helpful towards my year old child sending milk to our room at all times on the house they would even warm up her food when needed and you ca beat the rooftop pool overlooking the city on a summer day i would also like to extend a thank you to hermo who works up front you can tell that he genuinely cares for the patrons at the hotel and wants to make their stay as pleasant as possible the only downside was that the wifi although fast in the lobby struggled to pick up the pace in the i return to barcelona i would absolutely stay at this hotel,1.0
we arrived late in the morning and even though the lobby was full we were checked in quickly our room was ready but our bags were whisked away into storage and we set off to explore amsterdam a short walk in the direction of centraal station and we had our two day tram pass coming back at our bags were delivered promptly to our suite which was on the executive floor our travel agent suggested a suite for us since we were traveling with our grand daughter and were considering booking two rooms booking a suite turned out to be less expensive then two rooms and having the island suite gave us a spectacular view of the city the hotel provided a roll cot which proved to be uncomfortable for my grand daughter but she simply moved to the couch which served her needs very well being in an executive room we had access to the executive lounge which provided free light snacks wine beer and soft drinks from to pm this was a lovely treat our breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was delightful the buffet was varied and well stocked when my grand daughter voiced a desire for a crepe the kitchen was pleased to provide her with it the number of gluten free options for my wife was outstanding and at the end of the meal you could take a few items from the buffet for a later snack or light lunch,1.0

two train stops from schipol and a short walk min to the room was not huge and only had one chair but was clean and the bed was comfy great shower as well there were limited spots to put your clothes as there are no dressers only shelves and only clothes hangers i imagine if you were staying for a longer time this might become an issue there is no phone or clock in the room the clock was no biggie but no phone seemed odd to reception staff was more than helpful giving us maps and tips on where to used the tram about mins to get into amsterdam and bought a day pass that was good on the tram bus and are restaurants nearby about a minute walk and a grocery store next would stay here again,1.0
we stayed three nights at the catalonia magdalenes everything was great the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated we even had a room connecting with that of our swimming pool on the roof top is small but sufficient to cool after a day of visit and was appreciated a lot by the kids especially with its window on one side making it look like a giant hotel offers free snacks every afternoon until great rooftop was closed from during one of the days of our stay not a problem for us but we found out by chance and it would have been more courteous to inform us when we checked in,1.0

it was our wedding anniversary so i asked for a room with a view and the hotel delivered i ordered flowers for the room and they were lovely too however their house champagne was very expensive room itself was again lovely and very clean could have been more tea bags in the refreshment pack we had to ask for more from reception hotel staff were very polite efficient andhelpful and i would definitely recommend this hotel to travelling,1.0
i can not fault this hotel the staff were friendly and helpful and my room was immaculate the only down side was it was a bit of a hike to get into the centre of amsterdam i should say it was a bit of a hike to get back to the hotel as we had late nights and the trams stop operating at around midnight,1.0
we stayed at this hotel for nights in july we booked an acropolis view junior suite due to the extra space it would provide for our son basically an extra room the room was great very spacious with an amazing view of the acropolis loved the free toiletries more expensive greek brand than korres which i had seen before the downside was a lack of drawer capacity to put clothes in really lacking here despite a good size wardrobe space and the rather strange huge showerhead which was so large it felt as if you were drowning whilst showering very odd indeed we also had a bit of an issue with the daily maid service as although very good if you were out of your room by around a note was put through the door saying our room would be cleaned today we had to ask at reception for it to be serviced on occasions this has never happened before to us in a was fine but quite chaotic which often seems to be the case at large hotels in pool area is nice the pool itself was larger than i expected given what some people have said in their reviews but the area itself is the hotel could have made this larger and forsaken restaurant space we were lucky enough to be able to get a sun lounger for an hour or so at the end of the day after sight seeing but had to wait couple of gripes,1.0
great hotel with a very convenient location far enough from the ramblas crowds but walking distance to everything attractions metro passeig gracia etc rooms are nice europe standard size no drawers clean nice shower quiet front desk very helpful with restaurants and directions they also provide towels to take to the beach the bakery located in the lobby is outstanding best bread in barcelona according to locals great for breakfast or light meals,1.0
not impressed rude reception staff extremely rude manager myself two friends stayed in blooms as we attended a concert in dublin when we arrived back at hotel after our night out it took the doorman about minutes to answer the door there was anyone on the reception desk or answering the we were three women in a part of town who did appreciate being locked out at that hour of the night approximately it is safe anywhere the breakfast was horrible and i had to ask times for some ice for the oj as it was just sitting out all morning this hotel is a pure tourist trap and they should be ashamed to be changing people to stay there never again i wrote a review on their facebook page and they did i noticed that they only replied to which there were many of,0.0
spent a week in this hotel whilst attending a nearby conference it is a bit out from the main buzz of las ramblas but easily accessible by tram that stops outside the euros by hotel is outstanding rooms airy and very clean with good air conditioning the staff were all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was outstanding the beach is minutes walk away the rooftop pool ideal after a hard day and there were several good eating places a few minutes walk would definitely stay again,1.0
we stayed twice at this hotel recently and could not have been more satisfied with the rooms and the customer service we enjoyed the executive lounge the downstairs bar and the rooftop bar the nighttime views are amazing and should be visited if you come to town the rooms are well sized and each one has an imac that can be used as tv music or computer we had great views of the central city from both of our rooms will be back,1.0
the president hotel is a beautiful hotel that greets you with an artistic foyer and welcoming staff the rooms are clean and well maintained though the furniture is a little old the room was comfortable and relaxing the rooftop bar and pool area is stunning though it was hard to get a lounge to lie on as they were always taken and thus we regrettably did swim breakfast was fabulous with a huge variety of food and drink available the service at breakfast time was perfect and any finished plates were collected promptly there were taxis always ready just outside the hotel awaiting to be used which was convenient the only drawback was we did feel safe walking around that area at night as we nearly had someone try to take our phone when we were at the bakery directly across the hotel we enjoyed our stay here and hope others will,1.0
we were only here for one night so not too much to say here we decided to enjoy one last night in athens before heading to the states and booked here because of the beautiful view of the acropolis which did not disappoint especially at night room was with brand new features a beautiful bathroom and a comfortable bed the amenities particularly the rooftop pool and bar were exceptional finally the staff was very friendly and accommodating especially in helping us get back to the airport for a flight the next day they even offered to prepare us a private breakfast before we left in the morning but we opted for extra sleep instead,1.0
the clean towels are stored on top of blue plastic on the floor of the hallway these clean towels are exposed to people shoes dust and other pollutants the shower doors are closed allowing water to spill on the bathroom floor room was dark and dank a substandard hotel at best depending who is on duty results in pleasant or unpleasant communication to generate the requested results my request for shampoo led to the maid busting into my room after knocking only once i was naked to prove to me that she had put shampoo in the good point is that it is in close proximity to the city,0.0
wow very boutique chic stylish hotel not my traditional style but i was blown away by the service and accommodations i would highly recommend the dean to every person staying in dublin the accommodations were great but most importantly the staff was amazing it like having you own personal concierge when i return to dublin i will only stay at the dean love love the dean ally and tom were awesome,1.0

stayed at the academy plaza hotel for nights while in dublin it is a few feet away from street which is the main street it is only short blocks away from the spire the tall pole in the middle of the city the hotel looks like it was newly renovated so the rooms look clean and new the beds were comfortable and modern bathroom with plenty of hot water we enjoyed the complimentary in room tea every morning and the wifi it also comes with an indoor safe the street construction was pretty noisy even though we were on the floor however once you close the window it was pretty quiet however you do hear the occational hallway noises the cold and hot breakfast was good it only cost us per adult for breakfast while my year old son ate for free we saw a couple of airline pilots eating breakfast and assumed they stayed there as well the check in and check out was quick and painless it is conveniently located to the taxi stand the bus stop the hop on hop off bus stop it is also walking distance to restaurants and pubs convenience store bank and shopping trinity college was maybe minutes walk overall i would recommend this hotel and would probably book again,1.0

i booked this hotel well in advanced back in march as i started organising my partners surprise birthday the service from the very start was incredible unfortunately my partner was very well the day we arrived and had an early flight i phoned the hotel when we landed to see whether we were able to check in any earlier than the usual at half they said our room was ready and once we turn up we can check in straight away this was perfect for us and allowed my partner to get the rest he needed before the weekend properly started on the initial reservation i had told them the occasion for our trip and requested a higher floor in the hope of better views and that was exactly what we got we had a welcome letter birthday card and some chocolates in the room on arrival we ordered some room service on friday and shared a burger between the two of us that value for money was excellent and was plenty for us to share we stayed nights and have got a single complaint the hotel was quiet clean and in walking distance to the tram which then took mins to get into the town centre very impressed and would be returning to the hotel on our next visit to dublin,1.0
this hotel is in a brilliany location for accessing and the main shopping square where you can easily pick up the tour bus and you be at the main sights in about mins the architecture of the hotel is beautiful and has a very gothic vibe but with a comfy modern bedroom the shower was heavenly and the little garden patio is incredibly peaceful and quaint i stayed for days and the staff were very friendly and efficient they organised my taxi to the airport which was about overall i would definitely stay here again just so convienient to everywhere but with a traditional barcelona vibe,1.0

our family of recently stayed at stauntons on the green for nights while visiting ireland we were very pleased with how much room we had in the family room we even had two bathrooms the location was perfect close enough to be within walking distances of most of dublin most popular attractions but also far enough way from the noise of temple bar area the hotel staff was extremely helpful and the room was clean it was definitely a nice alternative from a chain hotel we would certainly stay here again,1.0
thoroughly enjoyed our stay here beautifully clean room with great view over the river there was fab choice at breakfast really freindly and efficient staff on reception in the restaurant and housekeeping yes there is renovation work going on but apart from the scaffolding you would know the hotel is handy for the airport bus that stops right outside would definitely stay here again,1.0

we have stayed here many times over the years to us busswells is less like a hotel and more like a home we are writing this comment because we would like ohter travelers to be aware of the possibility of a friendly experience friendly is the word we would use for this hotel does not have the grandeur or modernity or in some cases the spsciousness of other places although it does have a provocative history has great people no number of stars can equal that,1.0
we had a lovely big room with excellent bathroom and separate toilet the only problem was there was much space to put your clothes very small wardrobe and no drawers or shelves to put underwear or tops in we had to live out of our suitcases which is very pleasant however this is our only complaint the hotel is situated in the old city and very near to all attractions i will definitely stay there again we did bother with breakfast as there are little coffee shops and restaurants just a few minutes walk away which serve lovely coffee and rolls etc,1.0
i booked this hotel at at night and checked in minutes later due to my other hotel being really average i chose this hotel because of the location it is a few minutes walk from the main shopping street buses train a girl travelling on her own it is a great hotel because of it location i would stay here again the staff and cleaning staff are really friendly and very helpful breakfast is included which is good it nothing special but it fine i have been having fruit and yogurt because it gluten free but there a lot of other is an amazing absinthe bar across the road down a lane way full of locals which is great the bed in the hotel was not good at all i could feel every spring having a terrible bed in a hotel is the worst because after a long day of walking and sightseeing you want to have a good sleep these beds do allow that the pillow was fine very spacious room with a large window bathroom is fine everything works they give you fresh sheets every day and mop the floor so it is very clean no kettle i thought that was unusual i like to make tea in my full length mirror aircon was great wifi works best at the door and the window i stay here again but the beds really let this place down if you love a comfortable bed then you might want to look,1.0
we booked and paid for the stay however owing to circumstances beyond our control we had unexpectedly been called back to england at that time we were at the ibis in bruges when i used their wifi system to inform the hilton in amsterdam that we had to cancel our booking this was done on tuesday morning at around i firmly believed that i had given the hotel plenty of notice of my cancellation upon arriving back in england at around pm dieppe i discovered that the email was sent by the iphone when it connected at home i have subsequently sent two emails asking for a refund and received no reply just goes to show how bad wifi can be cost me because email not received before checking in beware anyone using wifi abroad make sure that if you are relying on email to cancel bookings that you also phone hotel to check a very expensive and unfortunate lesson not of my making would much rather been in amsterdam than hospital here visiting dad,1.0

we stayed in the croke park hotel for the coldplay concert which was taking place directly across the road from the hotel was seamless and hassle free on a busy day and the room itself was clean spacious however the area were packed as is understandable on such a busy occasion but there was no separate residents bar that afternoon we had to take a taxi into the city centre to get and in the evening we had to leave the bar area and order room service so that we had somewhere to sit down and have our food drinks it seemed like the hotel was keen to capitalise on the concertgoers but forgot about the guests who were staying in the hotel that i would stay there again but maybe not when events are taking place in the stadium,1.0
the hotel is just out of dublin downtown a at most minutes walk away from it this is no bad thing since the downtown is very noisy crowded and history apart not really stunning the hotel in contrast is excellent on all fronts friendly and professional staff absolutely clean and quiet lovely food for breakfast and dinner we highly recommend it,1.0

positives unbeatable location absolutely fantastic very friendly helpful staff excellent facilities we were lucky enough to have a big room with a lovely balcony on the floor we had a view right over plaza del catalunya we loved it and will go back there if we ever return to barcelona wifi was excellent signal in our room possibly not fast enough to stream hd video but it was great for normal browsing lovely breakfast if a bit expensive negatives they very minor and would not deter us from staying there again it a very minor issue our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough water tended to flow under the shower door onto the floor in the area of the toilet the bathroom is sort of and is right in front of you as soon as you enter the room this did bother us at all but it is a somewhat strange layout,1.0
we traveled to amsterdam to go on a viking river cruise rhine getaway and arrived a day early to try to recover from travel fatigue and to have a chance to explore a little of amsterdam before embarking on the cruise we chose the doubletree because of the proximity to the piers where the viking ships usually dock as well as being in a central location the location was ideal it was so close we were able to walk with our luggage to the ship if you arriving by train the hotel is ideally situated as centraal station is a short walk as well we arrived in the late morning and had requested an early we knew it was unlikely and we were right as the hotel seemed very busy as i believe it is most of the time we were given a warm cookie and found a place to sit and wait fearful of falling asleep sitting up we set out in the rain to explore to stay awake and find some lunch we highly recommend an argentine steakhouse called lagouch which is close to the hotel we had memorably wonderful burgers and fries there the hotel had many eating areas and places with a very large starbucks among them when we went on a walking tour on the first day of our cruise the guide told us the starbucks is owned by the doubletree there is bottled water and green apples in the lobby for the taking the,1.0

struggled to choose accommodation in dublin as everything is so expensive and the quality seems lacking for the price finally settled on the radisson being a chain and having some level of expectation from previous stays i joined their members club for free online which gave me access to the lowest standard rate cheaper than all of the hotel booking agent sites the hotel is situated on the edge of the main city centre it certainly not too far to walk anywhere and honestly nice to be close enough but not in the hustle and not disappointed with quality king size bed and very comfy room furnishings were modern and the room was large and clean excellent bathroom with full bath and walk in rain shower we had the buffet breakfast the next morning in the restaurant and it was lovely could not fault it extensive range of hot and cold foods excellent we had a really pleasant stay for our last night in dublin the hotel is certainly worth the price if i had to look for faults the pillows were not great but i believe that just a personal preference also the fire doors between the lift foyer in the basement and into the bedrooms corridor on level one are extremely heavy and i struggled to open then while trying to manoeuvre a stroller as did my husband with the luggage trolley all minor issues though would definitely stay here again and highly recommend,1.0

is it perfect when you can return to a hotel which you have rated with points out of the concierge send me a mail days before my arrival asking if the hotel can do things in advance to make my stay more every guest would believe that this hotel is really interested in you and that they are caring about guest satisfaction or is the sense to make more profit with guests so i answered the mail and informed the hotel that i am a frequent guest and in addition i stayed several times in the neighbor sister hotel grande bretagne which is located in the next house less than meter in upon arrival there was no warm welcome we received the keycard to room facing the busy road in front of the hotel with view to the square and government room has a has guided us to this room when entering the room there was not a card with a warm welcome there was no decoration like a flower cookies or sweets and not even a bottle of mineral i went down to the lady and asked if there is not an advantage for frequent question was what do you mean then i have told her our experience and have told her that i have answered the mail from the concierge and mentioned that i am a frequent we left the reception to have a drink at the bar in the belongs to the tudor my separate review under,0.0

we stayed in a balcony room for nights and we loved the view of the acropolis from our private terrace the hotel is located adjacent to the metro station and a very short walk to the plaka area and within easy walking distance to the major tourist sites including the acropolis and the museum while the hotel is not flash it is clean and functional and excellent value for money there is certainly no need to stay in a pricier hotel in the plaka area the terrace provides wonderful sunset views of the acropolis while the bathroom was compact and the shower was a bit tight it was manageable the staff were accommodating and helpful our room included daily breakfast and we loved the selection available especially the greek yoghurt and coffee machine all of which was provided with love and care on our last day we needed to catch an early ferry so they opened the breakfast room early especially for us which we really appreciated we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants a safe clean place to stay without paying an exorbitant rate,1.0
we stayed two nights the receptionist kindly swapped one of the room so that we had adjacent ground floor rooms and could create a apartment between them microwave fridge sink basic crockery and cutlery provided in each apartment supermarkets within easy reach nice walk to south to canal and then east along canal by georgian houses easy to walk to city centre only downside the front ground floor room was bathed in floodlighting until about midnight seems to belong to the restaurant next door and the receptionist did try to get it switched off earlier take eyeshades if staying on this side of the building,1.0
we booked this hotel almost a year a head of our stay based on trip advisor and a friend who stayed overall it was a very nice place location and front desk staff were great rooms are nice and quiet i could give it a star because we found the pool bar service at the pool to be very slow on different occasions we went up for drinks at the pool and found ourselves waiting a long time to get drinks minutes from time of ordering usually there was one nice bartender who just moved way to slow also i came to the pool one morning at and it was filthy with stuff floating on surface i was surprised it had been cleaned from the day before close to a star but not quit again front staff were awesome,1.0

the hotel is very well located just off the busy dam square but down the quiet and more refined nes plein so best of both worlds the staff are young and trendy but friendly and very knowledgeable and happy to siggest places to visit restaurants or lend you a brolly we had a designer suite that was a good size quirkily designed though slightly inconvenient shape but proved comfortable and quiet for a day stay the bathroom was very smart a very powerful shower and unusual black toilet the restaurant food was superb and again staff here and in the bar were fab my only criticism was that it was a shame more seats werent available outside and were often marked reserved so everyone was too crammed together and one evening we went to the bar next door a very stylish comfortable and luxurious stay,1.0
myself and three friends took a weekend break to amsterdam to see the sights and attend a festival we have had a wonderful stay the hampton hotel has been very accommodating and we were very impressed by their excellent customer service and their facilities no request went amiss we forgot to bring hair spray so a member of the reception staff brought us up some when one of my friends had a head ache they happily provided us with paracetamol the cleanliness of the hotel was also faultless i would highly recommend this hotel and plan to return here in the near future,1.0

we travelled as a family of four and stayed in the ashling for two nights in a family room with breakfast the hotel exceeded our expectation in every respect the room was large clean and comfortable the breakfast was superb with a huge choice of items for both ourselves and the kids and all the staff were friendly and welcoming the hotel was slightly further out than some but with having a stop on the hop on and hop off bus service right outside as well as a tram stop this did not present a problem it also resulted in a peaceful and quiet nights sleep the addition of parking was a bonus for us in the city centre and the hotel was excellent value for money we would definitely return to the ashling should we visit dublin again,1.0
i stayed here for two nights whilst on business the single room is very spacious with a queen size bed and a typical hotel thick duvet the rooms have aircon you can control there plenty of space and even enough room at the table to work with a comfortable enough chair included there were a few nice little touches i liked about this hotel the standard shampoo shower gel and cap were there unless you asked for them i mean who actually uses them typically they get put on your bag in case you need them on another trip but never do breakfast was adequate with a reasonable choice plus there a bar that open until very late in case you arrive late and need s guinness now the bad i stayed in room this read almost over the top of a night club presumably on the thursday night the music was thumping until around i assume rooms to would be in the same position and maybe even to maybe the higher floors may be okay when i checked out and was asked if everything was okay i said the hotel was nice but before i could continue the receptionist said was it a bit noisy si this is something they are obviously aware of i will stay here again but will ensure its not in these rooms if it were for the noise i would mark this with stars if it were for being really nice i mark this,1.0

stayed at the serras for nights in june and on most counts it ticked all the boxes you expect from a star luxury boutique hotel service standards throughout the hotel were superb with the tone set by a warm and personalised greeting upon arrival accompanied by complimentary cava followed by a tour of the hotel smartly designed and beautifully furnished public areas including the wonderful rooftop plunge bar area which offers panoramic views over the harbour and the many mega yachts moored there despite it being quite crowded at times because of private functions there we always managed to find a seat to sample the excellent range of drinks on offer while we did eat breakfast in the hotel michelin star restaurant el informal we enjoyed two excellent dinners there with the food wine and service all top tier the serras location is perfect to explore the historic gothic quarter and adjoining el born area which both contain a multitude of shopping and dining options be sure to visit the picasso museum which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel and is well worth the queue time we also walked through the winding alleys and laneways of this historic part of town to the city centre eixample and the city main high end shopping strip along passeig de garcia despite all its pluses including above all it superb staff our stay at the serras did quite match that of some of the other similar standard properties we booked,1.0

my stay at internacional cool was one of the worst i have ever experienced the room was per night for nights my room was so small it barely fit a full sized very uncomfortable bed the manager who was cordial said he could make no changes the bed was so bad with thin old mattresses that i ended up with back and neck pains the shower was so small one could barely turn around it was a very high priced for barcelona low quality hotel avoid at all costs the only thing it had going for it was the location on the ramblas,0.0
location right next to phoenix park so walking distance to zoo and only short walk to main areas of dublin buses pass regularly bars in area staff we met were extremely helpful male receptionist checking in on monday july in afternoon could be more helpful told us about the area and where to eat and drink plus managed to check us in a little early as had an early flight and were both very tired room we had was very spacious cleaned everyday to a high standard my partner is a hotel housekeeper and she was very impressed with standard of rooms would definitely use this hotel again if in dublin,1.0
we had a room with terrace and it was awesome the terrace was huge with table chairs and even with two sun bathing chairs room was nicely equiped and minibar and complimentary coffee products were refilled daily only negative was the aircon that blowed directly to other side of the bed even the restaurant was good only tried for dinner pool was as small as expected the location is just perfect close to everything and the area is full of lovely restaurants and coffee shops,1.0
my daughter and i just spent days at holiday suites and we had a great time the rooms are really large and well equiped and the staff is very pleasant and helpful we had most of our breakfasts at the nearby crowne placa as the selection is a little bit larger there and the view is magnificent but the breakfast at holiday suites is quite good also going to the city centre is very easy only two metro stops to syntagma and three to monisteraki the best way to get to the hotel from the airport is also by metro go off at megarou mousikis take the escalator to the left when leaving the station then you walk around the corner by the cafeteria go down the street two blocks then you see a blue sign saying holiday suites prices are euros for a single ticket but there are discounts for return tickets and for groups starting already at two persons although bus is cheaper i recommend the only complain would be the that was cumbersome and we constantly had to log in with a quite long and complicated username and password instead of being automatically connected,1.0

my husband and i loved this hotel it modern and attractive with a bar and swimming pool on the roof our room was a good size and the service was excellent we had to leave early in the morning to catch a ferry and at checkout without our having requested it we were handed a breakfast to go nothing fancy just a sandwich and an apple but a thoughtful touch as for the neighborhood it certainly is a fancy one but we always felt safe at night and during the day there are some really great discount stores i bought a pair of italian leather sandals for e it just a fifteen or twenty minute walk in one direction to the plaka and the acropolis and the same in the other direction to the national archeology museum i highly recommend it,1.0
back yesterday from a night stay at the marina my teenage daughter and i had a basic twin room on the floor i asked for a quiet room away from the bar and rooftop pool and away from the lift which i was given as in any hotel earplugs were useful the cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm the pool is on the floor it superb after sightseeing it was a quiet sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill it got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available even if there were any loungers left my only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool the itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful pillows comfy bed was clean so all good the staff were all lovely and helpful particularly the staff on the ground floor it a min walk to the beaches which again were superb la rambla and casa bastilo would be a bit too much to walk i think so we hopped in a taxi are taxis to the left of the and then walked back ish alternatively you could catch a rickshaw bike along the beach front part of the way and then walk the rest to the bottom of la rambla la sagrada familia is walkable about mins up a straight road with,1.0

the hotel occupies several old canal houses on the beautiful herengracht canal so the buildings have a lot of character it is just two short blocks away from major tram routes so you have all of the convenience without the noise the hotel is beautifully kept and filled with original art we had a fourth floor room on the herengracht canal and the view was so pleasant it was delightful to see all the boats of all sorts going by at times there would be a slightly exuberant boatload but never obnoxious and they pass quickly the room was very comfortable and with very nice amenities the staff is exemplary each and every staff member we encountered made us feel so comfortable and the staff at the front desk is extremely helpful with tourist questions there are three cozy areas on the main floor in which to relax have a coffee or a drink at the intimate bar the breakfast is bountiful and delicious we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would love to return someday note on our floor there were a couple of stairs up and down as you navigated from the elevator to our room because the hotel consists of four canal houses it was an issue for us but might be for some,1.0

from the moment we entered this grand old building we were welcomed efficiently by the reception staff the breakfast was star in a beautiful dining area the room was small and had a musky smell i think due to the age the location was perfect in walking distance to everywhere which you need as the traffic in the city was pretty hectic however tram stop right out front i would definitely stay again,1.0
we had a wonderful stay in this hotel i noticed that a lot of reviews mentioned the hotel room that has a small bathroom that is part of the room please read the room descriptions when booking your stay we read the descriptions and realized we did not want the smaller bathroom therefore we booked the slightly larger room at a slightly higher price the cost of this room was still excellent and our room was very comfortable we overheard a couple in the lobby expressing concern about the smaller room and the staff member was very nice and offered to change their room to the larger room for just the small cost difference my sister and her husband stayed in the smaller room and the size did bother them the location of this hotel is perfect we were so excited to see all the art museums we could have walked everywhere we wanted to go but i sprained my ankle the first day we were so close to the tram stop that i did not miss out on any of the touring even with my injury we did have to use any transportation one day to sum up the location is superb the staff was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable,1.0
very friendly service clean and comfortable rooms and very quiet even though we stayed on a match night for access to the aviva stadium this hotel is ideal we have stayed in much nicer places for this price but it clear you definitely pay for location especially as the price gets hiked up on a match night ballsbridge was a lovely area within walking distance,1.0

we stayed at this hotel before our cruise guests with rooms for two nights a significant investment we went hotel directly from our international flight we knew check in was til later afternoon but hoped for a place to freshen up a bit it was like for us we returned to the hotel at and for our family with rooms we only had ready at we were late for our pm reservations to sagrada familia and no one seemed to care others were waiting for rooms also by sleeping in the lobby i not sure how difficult it would be to have enough staff to get rooms turned around more quickly especially for that first night after international travel the hotel is beautiful loved it and the rooftop area i wish i had felt more cared for in the check in process,0.0
good hotel in the perfect location with tram stop taking you into amsterdam centre room was very basic and on the small side but was really a problem as we spent the majority of our time exploring amsterdam breakfast is good with a nice selection but the toasters are the worst i ever used staff are mostly good and friendly but some spend way too much time faffing floor bar is very relaxing with some beautiful views over amsterdam both day and night however the staff in this area of the hotel are too slow with their service drinks seem to take forever even in the quietest times but overall pleasant stay very convenient,1.0

stayed for a weekend excellent service and a very nice room it is a fifteen to twenty minute walk to the temple bar area and to shopping so other hotels will have a better location if that is your priority the hotel has a nice rooftop bar where you both outside and inside the service at the hotel is very good and very friendly i highly recommend this hotel,1.0
very welcoming and helpful staff lovely indoor and outdoor spaces to relax in small but well appointed rooms great breakfasts and good coffee at the bar if you need one to keep you away from the main tourist area was a bonus for me as was close enough to walk to most areas or catch transport and was not crowded having the beach so close was great too to go for a walk or swim and the big local park was lovely to wander around in the area felt fairly safe even later in the evening and would stay there again if came back to barcelona,1.0
giving stars because this place is my favourite always top class service and standard whenever myself and my boyfriend visit sexy clean and quirky and right in the centre of everything saw some reviews about noise issues from the street and i must say out of many visits we never had any complaints about noise from outside maybe we got lucky the reception staff are so helpful and welcoming and it so beautiful in the rooms would definitely recommend for couples and gal pals getting away in dublin x,1.0

we come to athens every summer on our way home from the islands we have always stayed at the divani and have loved it but this year decided to try the royal olympic due to its proximity to reception on arrival was offhand and snooty we were told we had an internal room and to our horror it had no windows and seemed to be over a light shaft we decided not to complain bc we were only staying over night but nonetheless were very shocked as had booked in when i mentioned this the gentleman made a very disparaging comment about having booked through the bathroom was frayed soap and shampoo basket with toothpaste spittle splattered on it taps with soap stains basin with toothpaste from last guests surfaces dirty the sign please service my room was still hanging on the outer door handle when we arrived at towels although good sizes were yellowed and tried to have a drink in the hotel bar before dinner at but were told that the bar closed at in an inner city star hotel we found this rather stayed in for a meal and it was amazing service with a very professional and pleasant waitress food was in general good but far from exceptional it was very expensive the view is magnificent to say the least and we were five a fantastic table on the cherry on the cake was ringing reception at to ask for extra pillows from housekeeping as we,0.0
great family trip away rooms with view of torres loved rooftop bar and pool great lunches only issue is beds have sharp corners that stick out and on day this caused an injury to my mum bed frsmes not suitable for anyone with fesility or mobility issues saying that would love to come again as location great and next to metro,1.0
the hotel is located near the sea front and is pretty handy for the beach restaurants and on the bus city tour routes we had rooms with double beds with a great sea view on the and floors we asked to have the rooms near each other but the hotel could accommodate the rooms were nicely decorated and very comfortable were very clean with free bottled water by the beds the toiletries provided were nice the rooms were clean and serviced regularly the reception area on the first floor is attractive and the concierge was very helpful with dinner did not eat in the hotel but used the bar in the reception area a couple of times but it was completely without atmosphere and the service was pool area is too small for the hotel and the sun beds are packed in around it we were told that if we left our spot for minutes our beds would be given to someone else and our belongings removed so we could even leave our beds to have lunch the outdoor restaurant by the pool was nice but a little pretentious and not good value for did not have breakfast at the hotel because it was not part of our booking and was ridiculously expensive so we ate in a cafe around the corner which was fine we had a great week in barcelona and despite the comments i have made enjoyed staying at the hotel it is a good base for,1.0
i stayed here in may only remembered now to do the review as i was looking up other places in barcelona as i am going again next stayed here with a friend and as soon as we got out of the taxi when we arrived at the hotel there was an over powering smell of the hotels fault but just pointing it nice clean hotel and good breakfast were so of the days in the late afternoon i had a bad migraine i tried having a nap before dinner and the room next door to us had music on full blast with their doors open could sleep or even hear myself think i phoned down to reception to ask if they could ask the guest to turn the music down a little which they did as we were leaving the hotel to go to dinner i complained again about the music at reception where the receptionist just laughed at me and said they could play music if they wanted as a paying guest like everyone else our comfort and every other guest should be a priority also the cleaner took our spare room key from our room while we were at the pool and when i confronted her she reluctantly gave it back to me it made me a little uneasy as to why she would take our room key security at this hotel is the hotel is a short enough distance to the beach and there is a lovely,0.0
this was a surprise for my boyfriends birthday as soon as we walked up the drive we were both very impressed it looks amazing checked in by marcello there was a little wait as he was arranging a couple of glasses of champagne and chocolates waiting for us in the room lovely touch thank you we also had four mini cakes delivered to our room before going out that evening brilliant customer had a room at the end of the corridor and it was smaller than expected but it was too much of a problem still very comfy the water pressure in the shower was a little lacking but loved the toiletries smelled delicious the first night i struggled with the pillows as they are really hard i then read that they had feather ones so requested some only to be told they had run out disappointed by this the bed was comfy but the pillows let it had breakfast there which again was fantastic lots to choose from and very tasty on the second day though we gone up to get a little bit more and when we came back to the table the staff had cleared our cups of teams cutlery away so had to ask for we loved this hotel the staff were very helpful and the location was good we used the bus and train to get into the city and had a nice walk along the seafront,1.0
a cross between allison wonderland and some famous dutch architect and artist turned into one of the coolest hotels we ever stayed in from the moment we walked in we were greeted extremely kind leave by the front desk team and as our rooms were quite ready we walked over to the bar and the bar will likely become one of the top in the world next year in my opinion all members of the staff go out of their way to do anything they can to make your stay more enjoyable more comfortable and more fun without question this will be the only place we stay in amsterdam going forward,1.0
my wife and i stayed here for three nights after spending nights in milan we enjoyed our standard room although a bit small the carpet could use some attention however overall the room was clean and well maintained by the housekeeping staff bed linen was clean and hand and bath towels were changed daily the reception staff was very helpful and conversed in english our spanish is not so good they checked us in quickly and provided useful information about the metro and restaurants in the area also a shopping mall with restaurants is nearby however getting to the metro from the hotel may be a challenge we had to walk about minutes to the nearest metro station on the day we were to depart for the airport all of the taxi drivers in barcelona went on strike fortunately the hotel provided a very comfortable bus to the airport for euros per person,1.0
in my job i have to stay in quite a few airport hotels and while most of them are worn out because of the quantity of people staying there this staff manages to keep the hotel in great shape if you beed to stop in ams tjis is def an option,1.0

i have stayed at this hotel for business two times now and i keep coming back the staff is very attentive and if you have the good fortune to meet carlos for the breakfast buffet he will take very good care of you in fact that is one of the reasons i returned carlos made me feel right at home with his friendly and caring demeanor the location is central to everything and easy walking distance to everything but it can be quite loud because the bulldog is right across the street they upgraded my room for free and it faced the canal very nice but quite loud,1.0
when i booked i had a romantic vision of being in a wood panelled room with a large leather topped desk but the reality was really basic student digs the room was large a single bed and a shower and loo down the hall was tea and coffee making facilities the college is beautiful a stunning building and bang in the centre of dublin there a cafe there the buttery that does cheap studenty food lasange cooked breakfast etc that cheap and not only drawback was check out was and they knock on your at exactly to get you to vacate an hour later would be so much better the room cost around euros which is very good for the centre,1.0
from now on this would be the only hotel that i would stay in while i am in athens from its rooftop surrounds you see all of athens including the acropolis it the newest hotel in athens as well also it has the best staff and the cleanest rooms and a beautiful rooftop pool,1.0
terrific reception staff friendly and knowledgeable room was comfortable and clean location was convenient only complaint was that mattress was a bit firm plunge pool was a nice plus great hairdryer in the room hotel room was quiet centrally located walking distance to many wonderful restaurants and attractions again can not say enough about the staff,1.0
the sandymount hotel was such a pleasure to stay in i will certainly recommend it to others hope there will be a vacancy next time i am in dublin it is walking distance from bord gais theatre and arena it is also perfect location for travelling on to south dublin coastal towns or further on to bray or greystones,1.0
delicious meal i would recommend the beef rather than the hake however portions were very small for the price delightful surroundings with nice background music and friendly staff i will definitely return in the hope of larger portions,1.0
the staff were very nice from top to bottom the pub was nice and the breakfast was good the room was dirty and in great need of maintenance do look under the bed the lamp shades were barely hanging on the hot water faucet was loose the shower was leaking and the safe was in operable and broke either they plan on selling the property soon or plan to rent out each room until it ca be rented again the one i was in was very close to this point but on the positive side the location was great they can arrange parking for you about a block away underground and the staff is very nice bring earplugs and an open mind do pay too much and the place will be fine,0.0
from the moment you stop your car in front of the hotel you sense the luxury of a carefully hidden treasure behind a beautiful old building for business or pleasure the location is superior the staff is well trained and ready to help you with whatever you like to be arranged the rooms are not big but the interior designer made the best out of the nicely decorated suites everything is up to the latest standards from the little reading lights next to bed to the gorgeous bath and practical shower beds are great breakfast is served at the table at the cost of pp some can find it expensive but we found it worth every cent nothing was too much to ask for and everything is of a high quality if you looking for special culinary experiences hotel has also place is a hidden gem when in barcelona we come back hasta la vista,1.0

this hotel is not pretty to look at from the outside but the inside is quite nice we were fortunate enough to not stand in line at the level one reception as we booked the club level and were able to have lovely personalized service for check in where they served drinks with or without alcohol the public reception served champagne the service everywhere is impeccable although it seemed like every employee i encountered had started work in the last weeks to months thus there were many mistakes with their answers to my questions yes even at the club level i had little confidence in our club concierge who had begun work weeks ago as she did not know about a couple attractions and gave us some incorrect information which frustrated us and cost us time the club itself is lovely with a fabulous view and delicious food as well as drink our room on the floor had a view of the sea and the city we loved the size of the room as well as the appointments the rooms were large and the storage plentiful in european standards the fitness facility is excellent and had much more equipment options than i imagined this hotel is well situated on the coast next to the casino if that means anything to you sure to bring id and available to all areas via taxi or bus the pool was crowded but the area poolside was lovely the bed by the way was,1.0
our junior suite at floor with amazing wiew was great also lowed the tower club lounge nice place to relax after hot day in the sun overall the hotel was very good atmosphere was excellent it really looks that the staff were there for you great service breakfast was great good selection of everything just ask and you get special coffee or omelette location is out of the centre but we knew that advance easy access to metro or using hotel shuttle bus and centre can be reached in minutes ask the higher floor rooms and city view side,1.0
really friendly reception guy greeted us when we arrived late at night and was really chatty the next night too when we saw the rooms were very modern and well set out i found the bed uncomfortable but my friend thought the beds were good i do struggle to be fair the location was great a quick walk to maremagasin placa trial rambla the beach to name a few the pool is more of a cooling down pool not a swimming pool so if you are wanting a pool type holiday this is for you if you want a fab city break and a quick dip in a pool to cool down with great views then it price was really reasonable tooall in all i definitely stay there again,1.0
four night stay in a superior double room perfect location and great value views from the hotel were stunning and it seemed to be the only hotel with a pool terrace on offer in the local area it was the perfect setting to relax in the evening and included a live singer one night which was superb reception dealt with any queries quickly and effectively view from the room was onto the back of the hotel and local flats but it was not an issue and probably helped guard from any noise on the main street the hotel restaurant named the wolf tavern offered a small but great menu especially for vegetarians complimentary beer tasting and afternoon tea were nice touches all employees were helpful and made the atmosphere great especially on the roof terrace it is clear the hotel manager values every guest and asks for their feedback when they return home looking forward to returning to the hotel again,1.0
our stay here was great the staff were very friendly gave great advice and direction and the breakfast was great with traditional greek foods as well as more general continental breakfast foods we probably missed this on the website but our bed was really two beds pushed together also we did have an issue with the hot water in our room and after a few attempts to fix it had to move to a different room while inconvenient the staff were prompt and helpful in their response we also took advantage of the roof top view from their sister hotel around the corner which had a great view of the acropolis and rooftop bar,1.0
we did not recommend this hotel at all even the staff was friendly and it is in front of amsterdam central the hotel is poor for us breakfast was bad beds are uncomfortable and i think my husband and big daughter were bitten by bedbugs it was not that clean no air conditioner no fan with like grades hot hot,0.0

booked the hotel because of its location which is ok the rooms were v small for the price in our first room there was black mould around the bath the view from the window was a brick wall there was construction work going on room service was poor pillow case changed in such a way that it was not put on properly causing crease and discomfort pillow in cupboard had been cleaned and were smelly and unusable bathroom accessories not replaced towels not changed room window left open during day presumably to save on ac costs letting in mosquitoes that bit causing considerable discomfort ac itself was weak and were hit in miss some grumpy some helpful,0.0
we stayed in this hotel as part of a tour group the rooms were large about the same size as a us hotel room clean and well organized hotel is in a good location only a brief walk from the main metro station that will take you most places within the city breakfast was amazing with a big variety and good quality concierge was also very helpful and willing to help i would stay here again no question only real downside was how busy the place was,1.0

i would like to firmly voice my disappointment and frustration with this sons were traveling alone to amsterdam for the first booked a reservation on july a week before their travel date directly from the website and received an email guaranteeing our my credit card company flagged it as fraud activity and put a hold on the contacted my credit card immediately and assumed that the charge would be of sending us an email to inform us of the denial the establishment cancelled our reservation once again without informing us of this event this left them stranded in amsterdam on the scrambling to find a hotel where there was availability for days as you know that is not an easy feat and the reason that we booked a week in advance they eventually had to take a lesser hotel with a higher a sad first experience for two novice travelers,0.0
the croke park hotel undoubtedly would merit a star award the hotel oozes hospitality coupled with excellent quality in all areas including bedrooms restaurant and bar facilities as well as free which most certainly is very rare in dublin from the moment that guests step into the spacious lobby they are cordially greeted with a warm friendly smile from each and every one of the receptionists including the concierge staff we have been guests in the hotel on numerous occasions and thanks to all the staff we have enjoyed many happy stays over the years each time we arrive we are amazed how every member of staff can call us by name in such a friendly manner mr sean reid deputy general manager ensures that he is always on hand to meet and greet all his guests with such warm hospitality even though he is such a busy gentleman in every area of the hotel he always finds the time to have a cosy chat with the hotel guests especially on match days sean is a true dub supporter but it must be said that he is to be admired for the greatest respect that he has for every other county teams supporters his friendly banter with guests from all parts of the world certainly make everyone stay a truly delightful experience with sean we always find ourselves so warmly welcomed in opulent surroundings with such impeccable service and an incredibly luxurious stunning ambience no request large or small is,1.0

good hotel and excellent location the staff really were lovely and so helpful our only issue was that it was quite expensive for what it was especially as when we checked in the man next to us paid less than half we had for some reason equally although spotless when we checked in to the room the cleaning was terrible after the first night and we complained on check out having said that it was a comfortable room and the more than made up for it,1.0

my friend and i went for a long weekend in amsterdam we stayed for nights on a bed and breakfast hotel itself was really easy to find from the central station it was approx a minute walk away check in was very smooth and reception staff very room itself was spotless clean but a tad run down it could do being refit with new furniture and a friend and i probably would stay here again but was fine for a cheapish hotel in the centre of amsterdam,1.0
the hotel location is very nearby from amsterdam centraal just took the boat and walk a bit then there you go and whenever you reach the main station you can continue going to city area great room with roll theme and best view to the ams centraal staffs are friendly and very helpful breakfast is great and can also hang out in the resto call the butcher play overall very recommended this hotel will be our choice next time we back to amsterdam,1.0
the hotel was recommended by a friend and confirmed all we expected the location is wonderfull opposite christchurch cathedral and within walking distance of most of the main attractions of dublin the staff was friendly throughout the room spacious and very clean the breakfast plentiful and of excellent quality a strong recommendation if you want to stay in the centre of dublin,1.0
have visited amsterdam a few times with work this is probably the best hotel for price and location the rooms are very clean and the staff only to happy to helpyou are less than min walk from the ferry and the central station dam square is about mins walk so you are right in the middle of it all if you explore the streets there are some great places to eat or you can take advantage of the hotels restaurant the food is really good i will defiantly use this hotel again for both future business and personal trip,1.0
i absolutely recommend this hotel very great location the staff was helpful and kind there were only two cons the leaking pipe small leak waas fixed only two days after we reported it and the houskeepers kept taking our key that we left so the air conditioning would work while we were away but overall it was a pleasant stay,1.0
novotel had the potential to be a luxury hotel but it constantly let itself down to begin with they had mixed up the rooms and ours was a lot smaller than expected secondly the way children were allowed to run wild around the hotel made the experience far from relaxing the pool is smaller than it seems and was packed with small children swimming in it all day despite the pool rules saying that children must be accompanied in the pool however parents seemed to let their kids mess around in the pool making no adults want to swim and the staff did not do anything about it due to the lack of sun beds it felt like a race to get somewhere to sit on the rooftop the worst experience i had here was with the food on the rooftop not only were the prices generally extortionately high for a can of coke but the hotel prices were unbelievable we thought we would eat there due to the area surrounding the hotel having no shops or restaurants although the prices were very high we thought the food would be worth it and we could of been more wrong i ordered the lamb shank which came from frozen and i sure they had been using the microwave they had in the kitchen my boyfriends food was awful he ordered a chicken burger but what arrived was a plate of chips with two minuscule patties oddly flavoured i regret staying here,0.0

we have been here before and as our son and daughter in law were visiting we decided to go back rooms were great overlooking the amstel canal and had recently been refurbished bathroom modernised and really lovely the bar was closed on our first night due to illness but was then open for the rest of our stay barman was really good and could make anything we asked for on waking on our first morning we thought we were in a building site drilling banging etc when we complained to the supervisor on duty he was pretty blasé saying he did know the works were to start but soon had a notice up telling other guests about possible noise following our complaint to be fair they did refund us for the inconvenience the remainder of our stay was without incident and we all enjoyed ourselves,1.0
it was not too difficult to find with gps while the indoor parking is a test of the driver skill esp we had a big car there are plenty of outdoor parking around the hotel room is quite the bare minimum novotel is a usual in asia but this one would be our amenities are at just minimum towels were very thin the room was that comfortable overall to make me stay in longer lots of choices at breakfast with both hot and cold dishes staff looked very grumpy though hotel souvenir shop got some interesting stuff i like that the hotel installed a kinnect at the lobby this keeps the older kids entertained,1.0

just had a friends hen party in the skylon last weekend from the moment we emailed the hotel to book our stay right up to checkout the staff were fantastic our hens were made to feel really welcome and the hotel had left a complementary bottle of bubbly in each room as a special treat our dinner was in a private dining room and again the staff were so attentive and helpful the hotel is really central and easy to get to thanks to all you made our stay extra special and we came home with some fab memories of our night in dublin,1.0
the hotel is renovating its rooms i think by the end of the year most rooms should be done we were very lucky to get one of the few already renovated rooms and it was very nice modern and clean no old carpets beatiful design see photos we really liked this room a lot but felt a bit bad for those who had old rooms these are absolutely not compareable stuff was very nice and helpfull and breakfast extremely good large choice of different stuff and its possible ask for an individually prepared omlette,1.0
stayed in the hotel from july fantastic fresh with superb staff welcomed with a glass of cava on arrival waited mins for the room to be ready retrieved our bags and greeted with another glass of cava the room was beautiful we stayed in a junior suite with a hot tub the balcony had sun loungers and was very peaceful the water was slightly too warm so that evening someone came up to rectify this too much water was then splashing over the away they sorted this out nothing was too much trouble breakfast was excellent with plenty to eat covering all nationalities and menus the roof top bar was a relaxing place to have a drink and sunbathe during the day the bar prices for a centrally located hotel were competitive and not at all overpriced the staff throughout the whole hotel were helpful and as said before nothing was too much trouble i could recommend this hotel definitely stay again,1.0
we have been at this hotel for the third time now this is a clean hotel with friendly staff in walking distance to the centre sights and bus stops are also just a few minutes away to us it is the perfect accomodation for a city trip to dublin,1.0
we did not get the room we pay for it was clean but very small that is about all bad we have to say nice staf little pool and not enaugh space to go into pool since we close to beach it was no problem with that so we go there to bus and metro but dont eat at the restaurant they need to improve a lot go to restaurant close to hotel instead many many to chose from at the beach and like around there with tapas and other no stars but ok if you want to fill your little belly any way i would go there again the weather is fantastic and walk at the beach nighttime warm is worth the trip and place itself,1.0
this is the first place we stayed the beginning of a month journey in ireland the we booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early we wanted to be sure we had the room apparently there was a miscue the hotel thought we were a no show well this amazing staff jumped right on it had us in a room in no time they were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way it went uphill from there they recognized us when we were in the lobby asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable we were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our night stay we booked the room through virtuoso we use them or amex platinum program which lists a room upgrade if available upon check in the hotel did have the upgrade the first night but called a day later moved us into a junior suite really lovely each every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel make every effort to make guests feel special joseph is the guest relations manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome rory is the front office manager who we are still talking about wow does he love his job we watched him interacting with guests spending more time with us than he really needed to an affable manager who wants,1.0
enjoyed the location and helpful staff the hotel was within walking distance to everything and very trendy restaurant food was delicious and the bar was a popular area to hang out front desk staff shared many helpful tips and recommendations,1.0
i have just checked out of the hotel and wanted to get my views about this hotel submitted before it becomes a distant of all the hiltons i have stayed at since i became a member i think this has been the worse experience things to note and out was painfully slow mins waiting each no complementary bottles of water i presume that is a hotel issue and more to do with membership levels disappointing since other hotels offer this for free to family members were staying in room and were not informed that there was going to be maintenance works going on around them resulting in them leaving the hotel to be able to relax in the family members had no fridge in their room so they could store the water they had purchase to keep hydrated again was informed by hotel staff that the fridge was going to be available my partner and i stayed in room i presume it was located next to the service room i kept being up in the middle of the night due to sounds of trolleys crashing and doors slamming this room is not sound proof and was not relaxing or a peaceful experience again hotel staff did not inform me of this i am usually an advocate of hilton hotels however i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone or reusing it in the future,0.0
good location and services love it so much the bed is comfortable and the coffee is free every day there is a small garden you can have a rest with coffee and bread in the morning near from the mila batllo and metro station,1.0
i stayed at fresh hotel for five nights in fresh and clean everything looked new including the bathrooms rooms were made every day breakfast perfect good quality food i could hardly have asked for more but why do they boil the bacon nice nice and helpful top i loved it it was almost degrees during our stay in athens so we spent daytime by the pool on the roof top usually no problem finding a sunbed if you go up before a bit expensive but if you want to save money you could easily find cheap gyros m from the hotel for less than immediate area around the hotel looks a bit run down but hotel and location is great with just minute walk to monastiraki metro station my friends were also very happy we chose this will stay at this hotel next time i visit athens,1.0
we are here on a two night stay and loved it so much we booked another night for our return trip the staff is truly wonderful from the moment we checked in we were given great service the concierge provided two great restaurant recommendations pinchet and rustic stone both exceeded our room is clean well appointed quiet and there is a beautiful view of the city from our mint bar was a nice surprise great wine selections and highly recommend the westin not only for the local but more importantly for the outstanding service and wait to return next saturday,1.0

imagine you are on a destination amsterdam consisting of only the groom best man for days we did and chose the hoxton as our hotel recommended by the groom himself who had stayed there before this is a hotel review i just keep it at that a few days before we arrived i sent an email to the hotel requesting the groom be given special outstanding service and a few bits and bobs for the groom including a plate of curry and chips which i felt were symbols of some of the unique quirky aspects that reflected our year friendship evelien was the first to respond and did so with such genuine enthusiasm that i got an immediate insight to the warm hospitable culture there the email correspondences from the various rostered staff afterwards carried on the attitude from evelien so when we arrived and the groom sauntered into his hotel room there waiting for him were the curry chips sitting on a tray and piping hot with the other items which had been arranged between the hoxton and i we were blown away and the groom was treated like a king for the duration of our to the hoxton team evelien micha yorinda karim lennart diego you are a credit to your hotel we will remember our stay with you for decades to come so if you are looking for a hotel with a fantastic central location with a cool buzzy vibe funky decor with quirky detailing friendly and,1.0

my mother and i stayed at your hotel last week and overall it was a dreadful it was described on as a quiet haven it is not for a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet we arrived tired and hungry at later than planned due to travel delays we were told the restaurant was closing even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until the receptionist who greeted us in a rather cold and manner called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open so we rushed through to the restaurant the waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley but he did start the conversation by saying oh the chef is gon na be pissed off grab a table and order quickly the food was not good we had booked a twin room that according to the photos on had two small double beds on arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite however the suite was a room on the ground floor at the front of the hotel next to the busy car park it was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed it was noisy and depressing my mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking i went back to reception to query the,0.0
i have been staying at the room mate aitana for four days last week and really enjoyed my stay rooms are very spacious as well as the room bathroom and nicely designed the bed was very comfy too breakfast is absolutely great one finds everything one could desire having for breakfast in a very good quality and it was never too staff were very friendly one felt welcomed i would say the room mate aitana is an excellent hotel for a to amsterdam if you want to be close to the city centre but away from those huge tourist crowds,1.0
this hotel is located across the street from croke park a hurling venue and one of the largest stadiums in europe we stayed over a championship weekend and the area was very busy but it was great to get a taste of what game day is like in dublin and the rooms were clean quiet and comfortable there free parking under the hotel and the service is truly wonderful friendly accommodating and competent,1.0
we arrived very late at night the bakers were already making bread for next day so it smelled like heaven friendly staff amazing location clean rooms superb breakfast even if you do feel like the hotel breakfast you can just buy stuff from the bakery and eat downstairs or make it a breakfast at bed rooms are nice a bit small,1.0
recently stayed two nights with my family so we had two rooms had tried to make many coordinations prior to arrival but nothing was done as planned arrived early in the morning on a sat so they were busy although i had used the app and done an early check in it was still discovery learning and the woman checking me in could have cared less i stay over nights a year in marriott so i have some expectation of what right looks like and this was not it i was thanked for my loyalty and gold status although i am lifetime platinum and currently platinum premier seemed odd a manager came over and quickly tried to make things right and apologized for the lack of internal coordination we eventually got two rooms but not without effort my guess is like stated before with an over occupancy they do not have to work hard to get people to come and it is clear no issues with the rooms or breakfast all were very good can not beat the location overall we enjoyed our stay but never once felt appreciated for being there almost like we owed them for allowing us to come in seldom acknowledged by staff or doormen everyone way too busy looking busy stayed at several other hotels in ireland and most tried much harder to earn our repeat business and went out of their way to make us feel appreciated,1.0
clean room although a bit dated lift dodgy as advised by sign advised to take stairs central location with a great pub below bar staff very friendly and hospitable good selection of pub grub will definitely be visiting the pub a few times during our stay,1.0
hotel curious is located just west of la rambla lots of people walking the main north to south touristy thoroughfare in barcelona the hotel offers a great breakfast with lots of juices and coffee options the balcony we had overlooked the street the hotel sits on and noise was not a problem at night the balcony doors were nice and kept the sound on the outside the room was nice and modern my only complaint is that we could feel the springs in the bed despite this we had a surprisingly good night sleep each night i especially liked the light switches by each side of the bed that could turn the whole room lighting and also would control a table side lamp very nice and thoughtful the staff was helpful and friendly,1.0
the hotel is well located to access the main city areas on foot and is a minute walk from croke park if you are visiting to attend a concert the staff are friendly and welcoming rooms are of a good size are well furnished and equipped the price for a one night stay was very expensive but that was due to the popularity of the band playing in croke park we would definitely consider using this hotel again,1.0
hi everyone i would not recommend this hotel to anyone very sub standard to what i used to in ireland and all over room is clean but basic reception and food here is disaster the only thing good is the location do know how they got stars and how it has rating in would return and only because i had it paid for in advance i would leave and was cheap either,0.0
we wrapped up our long trip to greece with a very relaxing yet inspirational in terms of architecture and design stay here and loved it the hotel was a bit of a scene with trendy people and such but still felt comfortable for our family the kids absolutely loved the pool and simply seeing the pop art decor we loved it all,1.0
we arrived very late due to flight delays and without luggage pro tip shuttle stops around midnight so get a cab if later than that we were greeting by a very friendly front desk guy who saw i had checked in on line earlier and quickly had keys for us hearing we had no bags he offered up a comp shaving and dental kit we had a late night room service offering of a decent pizza and a couple glasses of wine which all hit the spot just fine we had a quiet and comfortable sleep breakfast the next day was very good shuttle back to airport was fine and we were off,1.0

this is one hotel that definitely deserves its rating the facility is beautiful my room was so comfortable and the extra amenities like a bathrobe and slippers were great i loved the turndown service they definitely made me feel like royalty it not the most exciting part of amsterdam but it beautiful i really enjoyed going for a walk in the late afternoon along the quiet canals that front their property and you can get to some more bustling areas with a decent walk or a short tram or bus ride not hard to get to the airport either i was only there one night so i only got to experience one of their dining facilities i could afford the two michelin star rated restaurant on the top floor but i could get some of their appetizers at the bar some of the best food i have eaten in my life take advantage of that option if you ca go to the restaurant itself and there are three other restaurants there that certainly seemed like they were the best choices in the area so if you have a long stay take advantage of this fantastic hotel,1.0
the paul hotel is in a wonderful location a short walk to the museum district great restaurants and nightlife our room faced one of the canals which we loved canal cruises are offered right across the street and you can even buy tickets at the hotel at a discounted rate hotel staff super friendly and helpful will definitely stay here again,1.0
june we arrived at our hotel polis grand in athens and were completely exhausted from the flight plus a hour time zone difference the hotel is a in my opinion the hotel itself is clean but like many european hotels the room is very small as is the bathroom however the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it they put out a lot of hot and cold dishes plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast too many things to list including the drinks overall this hotel is nice and the service is friendly and is good for a quick day stopover on your way to see other part of greece greek isles while i am here i will take this opportunity to mention our day stay in we got to our hotel at from the airport they told us that check in time was and after so we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of athens and eventually wound up at the monastiraki square we had a gyros and went back to our hotel to take a nap we woke up a little later and went back to eat dinner at monastiraki in the evening this is a very lively place full of lights music shops street vendors and live bands it was entertaining as far as the food goes it was good but unfortunately being from toronto i can not in all,1.0
we were greeted by friendly staff at the front desk who helped us settle in for the nights the hotel has a spanish flavour our room was comfortable and a good size we faced out on the street but there was little noise to mention we were less than blocks from the underground and a bus stop across the road a weekly pass is the most economical transit bought inside the station we only had buffet breakfast once good but expensive drinks out in the courtyard was very pleasant way to spend early evening we would definitely return,1.0
the staff was so nice and helpful and thankfully spoke excellent english they even humored us when we attempted spanish the rooms were roomy comfortable and clean the location was close enough to tourist sites to walk but removed enough to feel like you were getting a taste of local life and they even gave us a free bottle of cava to make our honeymoon extra special,1.0

as a professional hotelier of some years i can say our time at this gem of a hotel was exceptional we stayed here for four nights from july till the andreas and his team are super friendly professional and bend over backwards to make sure nothing is too much trouble we are a family of four and did not feel uncomfortable to the contrary felt very comfortable as some rooms can accommodate four people as i would say this hotel is more suited for couples very cool vibe with beautiful bedrooms the hotel is beautiful with very tasteful decor quality furnishings huge bedrooms gorgeous bathroom with a cast iron tub in the room in addition to a shower in the bathroom luxury toiletries nescafe coffee machine plush towels and bathrobes andronis is extremely well located in the heart of athens in a very cool and trendy area of athens called psirri full of restaurants and quirky stores and located near all the major attractions of athens but did not feel touristy at all we would definitely stay in this area hidden secret of andronis has to be the restaurant it is highly underrated and not much advertised but hands down i have to say as a massive foodie and a hospitality professional the food is exceptional although we only had the pleasure of the breakfast i can safely assume the rest of the menu which looked very scrumptious indeed has to be amazing overall i must say with all the,1.0
i lived in the baggot st area years ago so when i came back i wanted somewhere close to the city centre where my wife and i could get to by walking the mespil is the perfect place to stay in a lovely part of dublin the hotel is clean spacious very central and has very friendly staff the free parking is a real bonus but breakfast is a little pricy so we got coffee and a breakfast roll nearby for a lot less overall it a lovely hotel and is recommended for a stay in dublin for night or more,1.0
good size and comfortable family room sofa bed double friendly staff location great for cafes and public transport taxis easy outside the hotel breakfast is available but more fun going out to explore local cafes and eateries,1.0
this hotel just gets it right their most important assets are their employees people who stood out for us were the front desk especially maria and dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend extra days in athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship the location is excellent and close to almost everything the area seems a little dodgy at night however it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world perhaps safer than most there are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel with an excellent dessert shop right next door the rooms are spacious the public areas well laid out the food really good especially the breakfast and room service and the decor is modern yet functional this is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment i especially like the interactive smart tv in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device the wifi is free and fast the beds and pillows they have pillow menus are extremely comfortable and all areas including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after they have plugs next to the beds and also a usb charging cable for telephones or ipads the ac worked well especially during the celsius heat whilst we were there the rooms have fully stocked minibars and a highly quality brand of soap body lotion and,1.0
we were very pleased with this hotel despite the large size and location my family and i are hilton diamond members and enjoyed the executive lounge for the breakfast and the evening reception rooms are standard in size but have great showers and balconies we had an amazing view and enjoyed a glass or two of wine every evening while watching the sun set over the must mention that my teenagers loved both the indoor and outdoor pool this really is an oasis in the middle of a our travels ever take us back to athens we will gladly stay at the hilton again,1.0
the location is great a minute walk to the plaka and within minutes from the acropolis getting here from the airport is very easy simply take the bus from the airport for a few euro to syntagma square and then either walk meters downhill to the hotel or take a taxi for rooms are quite spacious and very clean the staff are super friendly the breakfast is fantastic from around to it also has a gym and a is a restaurant on the top level with great views a little distant of the acropolis and live music pianist the only suggestion i would make is that management relook at the pricing of drinks to attract their clients to stay and dine in the hotel i read a review prior to arriving commenting on the reasonable drinks prices you must be kidding the cocktails were double the price of those in the plaka literally exactly double this put us off and we ended up dining out every than that a great upmarket hotel i would stay here again hopefully by then we have a reason to dine in the restaurant,1.0
the hotel is clean the toilet is very clean staff was very kind and helpful very professional the restaurant got good tasting food the sauna and pool facilities classy but come with extra euro per head for the duration of your stay away from central station using tram or tram them metro min walk to the hotel,1.0
if you want attentive first class service then try the shelbourne the staff were excellent the surroundings luxurious and the location perfect i have stayed in numerous star hotels all around the world but have to say that the staff here have been superior to any other,1.0
if you go to a citizen m you need to know that you need to expect relatively small rooms the bed goes from one side of the room to the other this gives it a very cool feel the interior decorating and modern tablet control of the room makes it a very fun and comfortable place to stay personally i find it perfect for a city hotel although my brother finds the rooms too small the idea in the citizen m hotels is that your leasure area is in the area and the rooms are literally only to sleep and watch a movie in the staff were great and very love the ambience the moderness and the overall idea and setup of citizem to get into town it takes about by tram and the tram station is just around the corner this makes it a bit far out for some people but it is definitely doable although coming back in the early morning hours was a bit challenging and we ended up having to take an uber the train station is about a min walk and this is probably your cheapest option to get to the hotel from the airport only a few euros,1.0

this hotel is situated within easy distance of for example green i walked liked the decor particularly the lighting in the corridors and the decoration of my room beds were very comfortable bathroom was splendid and there is a good sized restaurant bar on the ground floor also rather important the price was remarkably good for dublin,1.0
i stayed in that appartment because my company sent me is good because you can take metro and reach city centre and acopoli in less then minutes with for ticket employees very kindly and can give give good informations internet connection good and air conditioning bad thing is the barely accettable condition of fornitures carpets wallpaper ceiling kitchen curtains the staff do its best to keep at least clean the room but i can not understand fornitures years old price for the room space is good but i prefer having one fourth of the space in a room of this century,0.0
the location was a selling point as it is right across from the central station it is walking distance to many of the top sites admittedly not much from the outside the room was larger than expected modern clean and just right for me my wife and our grandson he especially liked the lift as did i the breakfast room is pretty and the breakfast was a good variety the staff were all pleasant although mostly there were a real variety of people many singles and people looking for a secure environment a good european hotel,1.0

very good hotel in a fantastic location i liked the fact that we were given a few little extra as we had booked using the hotel website superior room was excellent if a little compact but was very clean and comfortable with everything required roof terrace was also excellent with a good vibe but very disappointing that on our second night it had been closed due to a private function as this was one of the reasons to book the hotel i did not give star because of this front of house staff very good and friendly,1.0

this is a very stylish motel in amsterdam south the room was spacious and clean the staff friendly and breakfast good it does not have english breakfast but for us it did matter there was plenty of other options just meter to metro tram and train and minutes by train to the airport minutes by metro to the city but note if you want to stay in a cozy or lively street this is not it it is outside the main part of the city by a main road and only one restaurant in the area we felt it was good value for the money and would stay here again,1.0

my boyfriend and i stayed for nights at acropolis hill and enjoyed every minute of it the room was clean and spacious with a comfy bed and modern decor throughout the breakfast buffet was lovely my favourite was the greek yoghurt with fruit our room was on the floor which meant the rooftop terrace was a few seconds away we made use of this in the mornings and evenings the view is just too good to miss the hotel is located very centrally which means you can walk to all the best attractions we spent the whole holiday on foot i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an enjoyable stay in athens,1.0

the rooms are small but clean and very efficient the water pressure is great the patio and restaurant and bar are lovely our breakfast was not included in our room price but the breakfast buffet was fantastic and worth the price per person five minutes walk to a dart station which brings youafter three stops to temple bar or trinity college,1.0
lovely hotel although it little bit further away from the main scene the marina and the rambles the rooms were very clean and the beds were comfy the staff were very friendly and helpful there were a few restaurants close by and a shopping centre not too far either and it was also a stones throw away from the beach i would definitely stay here again ca fault it in anyway,1.0
we spent nights here and were sad to leave the staff at reception gave us a very warm welcome on arrival which we appreciated when we got to the room we loved it but found it warm combination of a brutal heat wave and being off when the room is occupied when we left for dinner a little while later we mentioned it to the staff since we knew it would cool down while we were gone and they went ahead and cooled it so that it felt pretty good by the time we got back we slept great on the beds there enjoyed sampling all the delicious breakfast items while looking out at the parthenon and got addicted to nightcaps at the rooftap bar with that glorious view you can walk to everything from the athens gate plaka minutes syntagma sq minutes acropolis museum min so the location is perfect and we not forget the kind staff who went the extra mile not only by packing us a breakfast for our early morning flight but also mailing to us in the us an item we accidentally left behind an wonderful stay,1.0
first time to athens and chose melia athens omonia as my base and shuttle to santorini mykonos zakynthos and choice as even though the area is old part of athens omonia was first public square in athens but accessible was key with metro only blocks down from there everywhere was just so convenient with all the sights and things to was super friendly and professional in check in to luggage directions and arranging transport,1.0

stayed just one night in airotel parthenon hotel room was simple but was clean and had the essentials however what stood out was the phenomenal service by the hotel staff from the moment we alighted from the cab velisarios and giota were the most friendly and welcoming hotel staff i ever met they did not hesitate to assist us in any queries regarding the hotel amenities the places of interest to visit whilst in athens and even recommended food options nearby as our flight was at midnight they willingly offered us to place our luggage in the concierge once we checked out so that we could tour the city and come back later in the evening to collect our luggage they are such an asset to the hotel and i would not have felt more welcomed and enjoyed our stay in this hotel if not for them the free breakfast provided was great and had a good variety would definitely come back to stay at this hotel because of the impeccable service from the hotel staff and the convenient location,1.0
on arrival we were greeted by friendly staff at reception and booked into our first floor room within a couple of minutes with no hassle at all there was a small lift near the reception desk or you can take the stairs the groundfloor was homely and decorated in the edwardian style of the era of the hotel itself and had rooms off the reception area where you could sit in peace and quiet if you wished and admire the decor and stylish was a doorway leading from reception into the bar area which could also be accessed from another door in the street if you go in the bar off the street you see a plaque on the wall as you enter telling you that george bernard shaw once lived in the building that is now the harcourt hotel our room was very clean and and well presented big enough for two and with an ensuite that was well maintained and clean we were very pleased with it the bed looked very clean and comfortable and on closer inspection it was a good nights sleep was on the cards and it certainly did disappoint after a great day visiting the guinness store and walking around dublin it was a nice bolt hole to return to as you had the bar next door which served a good choice of hot or cold food and plenty of beers and cocktails were on display as you expect the odd guinness was taken,1.0
the radisson blu hotel is a great place to stay centrally located and close to everything the room was very clean and a good size room to move the bed very comfortable and a good sized bathroom the hotel has fast internet it is in a quiet location and public transport is only a to minute walk the location is perfect min walk to the museums minute walk to the central train station with shops cafes and bars everywhere hotel bike hire or a minute walk to damstraat bike hire hotel staff were happy and very helpful recommended,1.0

the casa fuster is perfectly located in one of the best areas of barcelona near all major attractions or subway stations staff is friendly rooms are large enough and very well appointed bed and linen were delicious complimentary water every night the building is very beautiful and well maintained having a historical fell but not old internet worked very well and breakfast although not varied very satisfying swimming pool on rooftop is tiny more like an enlarged bathtub not really for sports but for freshening up although the room was spacious bathroom had a quite odd layout where shower toilet and bidet were all squeezed in a tiny corner of the room and felt a bit cramped overall i would recommend casa fuster to all my friends when in barcelona,1.0
my fiance booked this for my birthday present night break and our first time in amsterdam on the way to the luxury suites our uber driver much cheaper than taxis even said what an ideal location it was in from the moment we arrived we were taken good care of a complimentary glass of champagne suitcases taken up to our room and shown around the room was so impressive large comfy bed massive tv complimentary coffee machine and tea robes and slippers we did have the option of purchasing items from the mini bar but chose not to as we found it to be over priced so purchased our own from local shops it rained on our last day but was a problem as the hotel provides umbrellas free of charge overall we are delighted with the accommodation and service we received and would imagine staying anywhere but the luxury suites apartments when we return again in future anywhere else would certainly be a big downgrade absolutely perfect in every way and two extremely happy customers going home today,1.0
a lovely easy going clean hotel very comfortable we upgraded to an executive room and it was fabulous quiet and no noise at all did not get chance to use the lounge but it looked lovely easy to get to all parts of amsterdam,1.0

we stayed at the athens lotus hotel for five nights in july the accommodations we clean and everything that should be expected from a hotel in greece the staff was extremely courteous and helpful and the price ca be beat the location is not the most central in athens but the hotel is about feet from the metaxoughio stop on the metro the metaxoughio stop is very easy to transfer to other metro lines all three of the major metro lines are accessable within one or two stops of the one near this hotel grab a five day metro pass at any station and getting around in athens is a snap we would definitely recommend others to stay here,1.0

we stayed here in late june it was a family trip we had two interlocking rooms it is a beautiful hotel quite pleasing to the eye the service was great and the location is great there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance or within a short taxi ride the gb roof garden restaurant with a view of the acropolis was wonderful a great dinner at that restaurant was a highlight of our trip to athens if you are looking for a five star hotel in athens i very much recommend this hotel on the less positive side the rooms were a bit tight i could have used more room and it is not a cheap hotel one pays for the high quality so make sure that it is within your price range,1.0
the hotel staff were always very friendly and were happy to change our room on arrival from one bed to a twin room without any fuss the rooftop pool and skybar were fantastic and a great place to while away the morning before heading out exploring the staff were always happy to offer assistance but did bother you if you were just happy sunbathing which made a nice change to some hotel where you feel guilty not buying a drink they also gave us complimentary ice lollies that were delicious the room night staff were very happy to help when we needed any help regardless of the time overall a great stay and we would definitely return,1.0
had the pleasure of spending nights in the astoria excellent hotel in a very convenient location minute walk to the metro did dine at the hotel so ca comment the rooms were very clean beds extremely comfortable the feel of the hotel is high end so it represents excellent value the rooftop pool area is an added bonus all in all an excellent base for a barcelona stay,1.0
we visited athens and stayed nights we were a party of adults and children we received lovely large connected rooms the beds were huge and comfy the bathroom was beautiful the hotel seems new and has a modern styling everything went well and the staff were very warm welcoming and helpful the hotel is located on a main street and there were many coffee shops and bakeries in the area across the road there is even a cinema the hotel is located about a minute walk to the acropolis we enjoyed our stay a lot and will recommend it to others,1.0
i arrived there with of my friends on the of june the hotel is located in the centre you can find a lot of coffee shop in the same street even starbucks bakeries supermarkets bus stops and the metro station is only to minutes away location was for the hotel service it was perfect everything was clean and staff was very helpful breakfast area is really big and the food was at last but not least the rooftop pool we went up there everyday the view was awesome drinks at the bar up there where perfect water was always clean and each time we went up the staff provides you with towels and makes sure to find you a good seat the price in comparison to the location of the hotel is very you for the pleasant stay,1.0
what good about this hotel it pretty much centrally located walking distance to central train station shopping areas the notorious red light district and most attractions in amsterdam the hilton badge will assure you the quality of stay in the hotel i had a good nights stay at the this is a busy hotel so do expect to get an early check in but the warm cookies may cheer you up a little bit the rooms are very spacious choose the rooms facing the city the view is worth the extra cost the apple tv is interesting at first but the small screen is a little turn off there is also starbucks at the hotel it may be redundant as the hotel cafe also serves good coffee but i think it worth pointing it out overall i enjoyed the stay in this hotel if i travelling back to amsterdam doubletree by hilton amsterdam central will definitely be my choice of stay,1.0
possibly the best hotel i ever been to the counter staff were always lovely and helpful the free waffle at was a great perk the puns on the furniture throughout the room and hotel were great,1.0
my friend and i stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago i booked thorough hours before we stayed the hotel advertises no booking fee on their website but apparently according to one staff member in the print it states that the hotel will put a holding fee on your booking but your card will not be charged when i checked out i paid for our stay that was two weeks ago and the holding fee is still on my account and there is essentially euro in my account i can not access i just wanted to let future guests know as this has been a serious inconvenience for me this last two was fine bed was fine bathroom,0.0
this was our second visit in so many years we find the movenpick not only a great hotel with a fabulous breakfast but it location close to the central rail station makes it a good base of operations for visiting amsterdam as well as other cities close by it close proximity to the cruise terminal is also a huge plus for cruise passengers,1.0
stayed for nights for our first visit to amsterdam great location mins on the tram from the centre tram stops right outside hotel and there are supermarkets if u turn right from the car park comfortable rooms with a coffee machine down graded this star as depending on which staff you ask you can not get any tea or coffee to make in the machine when other staff are on its no problem breakfast buffett was good with lots of fresh fruit good price for a modern hotel,1.0
really really expensive for the general quality of the hotel poor breakfast quite simple room very poor bathroom no service available in the bar and the price really high i would not recommend this hotel,0.0
we stayed here for one saturday night before the coldplay concert although it was expensive for night all hotels are about that in centre this is in a great location bathroom is massive we booked the exquisite double room and it was lovely,1.0
everything was great about the hotel our room was spacious well appointed and comfortable high tech though we never could master the bluetooth the staff was incredibly helpful we had a lot of questions of where to go what to see and they went out of their way to help lobby was nice lots of people there using wifi and having coffee the food breakfast was tasty we sampled just a few of the pastries convenient location,1.0
the place is so clean and organized once u enter the place u will feel that you are in the right place the stuff are very helpful with a beautiful smile the location of the place is too close to the beach and the shopping area also the place surrounded with many great restaurants,1.0
nice small hotel small swimming pool top of the floors nice present free beverage in rooms clean comfirmtable stay little balcony our room was open view to barcelona towndown streets happy stay,1.0
my friend and i arrived and both of us were greeted by two people on reception they were extremely helpful and very positive the room was spacious and comfortable the shower was large and the bed was comfortable the location was our favourite thing about this hotel as it was minutes from amstel station and then a direct metro three stops to the centre it was very easy and convenient it was not right in the centre but close enough to it we were two girls traveling alone and felt very safe walking around we could not recommend this hotel more,1.0
stayed here for days on business selected it because of how it looked online and some customer reviews they are currently doing a major renovation and things are quite disorganized and rather chaotic the restaurant apparently has been moved and it was hard to find they had my researvation all wrong i was with my wife but when i checked in they had it a single person they at first did not believe that i had made the reservation for two people and it was only after i showed them the reservation on my laptop that they grudgingly corrected it they also had that i had not paid for breakfast but we had and again it was only after i showed them the reservation on my laptop that they corrected it a number of other similar problems overall a fairly unpleasant experience particuarly given it is not cheap we would definitely not stay here again given how many nice hotels there are in amsterdam,0.0
just back from days in amsterdam where we stayed at the casa the staff were welcoming and helpful the room was clean and well appointed travel links are really good as you would imagine with regular connections to all the sights and the airport we had dinner in the restaurant on two of the evenings which was very good and again the service was great,1.0
stayed for night inbetween airbnb stays and we had a great location with really friendly staff who could be more helpful in checking us in and advising on places to go things to do staff were also very quick to reply to emails about parking and checkin before we arrived which is always a room had amazing balcony view of casa batllo and a huge comfortable bed with a great bathroom and nice selection of bathroom products included could have asked for pool on the roof was a pleasant surprise and the views from the terrace are incredible checkout time of noon was greatly appreciated with breakfast served right up until then and the staff happily stored our bags afterwards when we went minor criticism would be price for the original room booked we felt was a little pricy and we paid an additional to check in early into a junior than that a wonderful place to stay right in the heart of the city would happily stay again,1.0
we booked to stay at this hotel via a travel agent who told us it had a flat entrance and a lift she failed to mention the steps about to actually get to the lift the hotel staff were very efficient friendly and helpful and let me use the phone to try to sort out the mistake another hotel could be found nearby so we ended up is a lovely hotel and so convenient for the museums etc the room we had was a bedded room large and roomy with comfy beds and the most comfortable pillow i have ever laid my head on smart shower room and quality toiletries we got a complementary welcome drink voucher for the bar,1.0
stayed here for a nights it a good cheaper alternative than staying in the middle of amsterdam the hotel is very modern and clean it a minute walk to the train station trains run every few minutes to the centraal station it in between the centraal station and the airport it suited our needs but would recommend if you plan on partying past in amsterdam when the trains stop running as you will need to catch a taxi back,1.0
albany house is close to stephens green and iveagh gardens the staff was great especially in the breakfast room we enjoyed the breakfast lots of options the room was nice and clean with a good size bathroom the only drawbacks were the noise from outside which continued until the middle of the night and the construction inside the hotel the quality of your experience is largely dependent on which room you get,1.0
for solo traveler i had not a big room but it was ok as i came to explore the city but i saw a family with kids and more than sure there are big rooms also in general i would recommend this hotel as it it unique trendy and has it own charm unlike the ones in chain,1.0
we had to book at nh hotel group after our accommodation cancelled on us at the last minute the hotel was a great choice it is well located with all local attractions an easy walk away it is close to dozens of yummy restaurants and cool bars our room was a little on the small side but bed was comfortable and room was quiet despite the busy street below we would stay here again but would request a bigger room,1.0
fantastic location fantastic staff and fantastic hotel we stayed at this hotel for our anniversary and is a fantastic place we would recommend and will definitely be going back breakfast was great and had lots of choice fantastic weekend break,1.0
we booked this hotel as we were looking for a place to stay in athens with a swimming pool for a week we were not disappointed it was really great the view is breathtaking on the city and the acropolis particularly for hotel is really perfect the rooftop pool is very small but refreshing pool bar a little bit er it had a good variety just no station have stayed less nicer hotels than this one with better breakfast options was only downside is the neighborhood you ca really walk at night im usually okay with the rough neighborhood but yeah be safe this area had predominantly asian middle eastern people i was actually surprised to find alot of halal food for choice behind the hotel within walking can walk to the main sq in station is right out side the hotel so is the bakery on the corner choices of food and pasty to choose from,1.0
when i first arrived at this hotel i was pleased with the look of it it was clean and well presented the streets around the hotel are not very nice but exploring the area further many streets in the athens area seem run down but once you are in the hotel you feel far away from it all the hotel is located right near the metro station so you do have far at all to go if you want to catch the stayed in a room on floor the room was a nice size and very clean the only let down was the balcony view it was overlooking other hotels and a dirty street but this did really bother me too much as i did spend much time in the room as i was out exploring athens the bed was very loud and creaky any movement in the bed made a loud sound sounded like it was going to collapse in the mornings from half to half is the breakfast buffet there is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up one night at the hotel i decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the floor top of the hotel it had a great view of the acropolis you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat the menu did have much food choice i went for the burger it looked great but came out cold so i had to,1.0
daughter paid for this trip for xmas present lovely clean hotel perfectly positioned for camp nou and close to metro to get into the city ate here one night and could fault the food or the lovely waiter would definitely recommend,1.0
we didn t really know what we were getting when we reserved rooms at this hotel but we were soon to be very information said the hotel had a view and it sure elevator holds three bags and a thin woman but the stairs are rooms are small but nice and the air conditioner workers were helpful and friendly especially terrace on the floor could use some umbrellas and other items to make it more comfortable we still enjoyed beer on the terrace with a great view of the acropolis met some other travelers from other countries sat next to the pool had decent breakfasts and could walk any and everywhere we needed including to the acropolis there is plenty of shopping eating and site seeing within walking distance i would stay at this hotel again without hesitation,1.0
came here for a couple of days in june with some friends and family i booked it because of its perfect location minute walk from las ramblas and minutes from placa catalunya and its price which because it was so cheap had me worried i did need to be though on entering the hotel the people were so friendly and the courtyard beautiful yes the rooms are very basic but they big enough with lots of wardrobe space and enough room to move around the air con also worked brilliantly and the shower had plenty of hot water i also could believe breakfast was included for the price and included a wide selection of breads cheeses meats spreads juices and decent coffee the only slight negative would be that there was a slight damp smell in the room and that using the shower did mean the bathroom got drenched every time even if you were careful because of the price and location though i could give it any less than stars and will definitely be recommending it to anyone who wants a bargain in barcelona,1.0
our stay at the element amsterdam was wonderful nicky the front desk manager was very helpful before we even arrived nicky answered all of our questions and even offered so many helpful suggestions making our trip fabulous the rest of the staff were also very liked the location of the hotel even though the hotel was about minutes away from downtown there is a tram stop very close,1.0
i recently stayed at the hoxton during a celebratory trip to amsterdam with my boyfriend from the very beginning of our stay the staff made everything special we arrived at the hotel waayyy before and the man at the desk offered us bottles of water and a friendly conversation considering this was our first real contact with someone in this country he made us optimistic about what we were to experience they were able to watch our bags as we set out for the day when we checked in later on they made the process smooth and quick our room was incredible a roomy canal view on the third floor and they even left us balloons for our celebration our view was wonderful and made our vacation really meaningful one thing i might suggest planning ahead for is the breakfast bag my boyfriend could eat the yogurt so all he had for breakfast was orange juice and a small banana for some it would be perfect but we needed to find some other options overall a wonderful experience would absolutely stay again,1.0
we walked into the bar and were warmly greeted by the clerk it the first time i ever checked into the hotel at the bar we were taken to our room up two steep flights of stairs and were pleasantly surprised with the cute decor and deck area outside our room we loved this location close to the train station and within walking distance to many of the places we planned to visit the breakfast was great with many options but it was quite busy and a challenge to not bump into others we would definitely stay here again,1.0
we stayed one night here in advance of a ferry trip and found it well located and happy to have our dog poppy which is always in all hotels which profess themselves to be dog friendly our room was clean and had a good sized bed there was a bit of noise from their bar next door but this was to be expected on a saturday had to leave early so missed breakfast but the kitchen had arranged for a packed breakfast for us to take ate in the restaurant and were allowed to take our dog with were friendly and helpful,1.0

we celebrated our honeymoon in ireland and my husband booked a room at the davenport hotel from the outside it a beautiful hotel and when we checked in it was a beautiful lobby i was really excited and then we walked into the room when we walked there was an issue with the electricity within the room we called to the front desk who called several electricians into the room to fix the problem the electricians came in and out of the room for an hour and were able to fix the issue but we lost an hour of our time with no apology or compensation the room was comfortable but a bit dated and really needed to be remodeled the bathtub had wood on the sides additionally there was spots of blood on the shower curtain and the clocks were set at the wrong time which made us an hour late for a tour with all the hotels in dubin i would book this one again,0.0
amazing breakfast i am gluten intolerant and the hotel had special bread for me which just made my vacation much easier the location of the hotel was right in the middle of the city which means everything was close to the hotel shopping centre was only a walk away and the rambla was almost beside the hotel i would definetly recomend this hotel to everyone,1.0
very nice hotel great service but slightly uncomfortable mattress would have preferred a room with a view the lobby area was very nice and well designed rooms were spacious would have preferred a gym or swimming pool,1.0
we booked nights at this hotel as my birthday treat we booked an executive room and i emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion i received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this on arrival the hotel was full this was the least of our problems the hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel taxi at euros on our return to the airport we were quoted euros by hotel staff which we booked decided to take the metro as we thought euros rather expensive the metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband passport were stolen from my handbag this resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the british embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement day ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within executive room was nothing like executive the bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath i reported this but the engineer could make no were replaced each day although the quality was not is unusual not to have facilities in a,1.0

having been to the w hotel on a number of occasions in london i was expecting a about this fantastic rooftop bar and pool area things where looking good how wrong i could be as you walk into the hotel it looks fantastic although a little busy with year olds running about taking photos but that was as good as it cheap blue lighting making the place look more like a grotto than a up market bar floor worn out grey concrete bar relatively little atmosphere with large areas roped off with nobody in the bar music dull and when you do have a full bar i would probably go for something a little more up beatdownstairs there was a massive party at the pool which looked great and i can imagine it to be an ace day out around the pool perhaps a bad evening for them but just not what was expected,0.0
this is my fourth stay and i think the hotel is great beautiful venue great staff etc however i am a little unhappy over how i was treated or not treated at checkin i booked thru virtuoso a jr suite i am also spg gold no upgrade this did surprise me as the hotel was full however it is my birthday so you would think they would at least acknowlege the lack of an upgrade but i would have expected to have gotten one of the best jr suites but instead got one on a low floor with zero view as gold i was offered pts or free drinks or so i thought that is what i heard but apparently just a drink for me my wife gets nothing at least they were kind enough to let me use my lunch amenity for my birthday dinner but still love the hotel,1.0
when we first visited athens three years ago we relied on a cruise ship company for a hotel recommendation it was a nice place but not within walking distance of anything a rare miss for the cruise ship line on that experience we did our research for this trip and selected the herodion it was perfect within a block of the acropolis museum and the restaurant row near by it was easily within walking of the acropolis hadrian arch the plaka even monastriaki if you push it a little walking the other way there were wonderful shops some featuring art the location us hotel is very clean with a very relaxed feel and a courteous staff to help with everything we relied on them for directions suggestions and just general things the rooms are nicely decorated and well maintained the hotel also features breakfast including european style my wife day can not start without breakfast and coffee she was completely satisfied with the herodian offerings especially the coffee the hotel also has a rooftop bar and restaurant we visited for the view of the acropolis but we did not dine there as we had other plans the restaurant was packed regret i did not take pictures my mental lapse but i know the pictures on the hotel website well depicts the a great place if there is a third athens trip in our future we will stay here,1.0
very friendly service from the staff very convenient location next to a metro station rooms are basic but clean and hotel but a little pricey more powerful ac in the rooms would be nice too,1.0
my partner and i stayed here for nights we had a great time and the hotel was excellent this is my first review but thought it was important to support independent hotels such as this and give credit and recognise the great service they is a city that will accommodate every need if you want history fine dining easy relaxed weekend art music or a wild time amsterdam manages to deliver is exactly the same it manages to address the needs of an eclectic mix of guests when we arrived we were welcomed and efficiently checked in the lady at the desk was informative and friendly the mix of people in the hotel lobby and bar summed up volkshotel there were students groups of young families couples and older friends all enjoying the same space this is the beauty of volkshotel it manages to meet the needs of had the johnny jukebox suite and it was brilliant the sound system set up was great and the room was just perfect yet quirky food and service at the hotel is very good on the saturday evening we arrived after the chef had finished taking orders however the chef still offered to cook us a main course and it was excellent we had our meal and the restaurant then transformed into a club with some great and house terms of location it is right by a metro and short walk to tram which takes you to the museum has captured what it,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at the ashling hotel the location was perfect for getting around dublin right across the river from heuston train station and between luas stops loads of sites were walkable from the hotel including the guinness storehouse jameson and several museums the hotel itself is really lovely spotless guest room charming public spaces and an engaging staff we happily stay again upon a return to the city,1.0
there is an overall feeling of the hotel being tired it is a bit like it not sure what it wants to be and would really benefit from a lick of said the staff make up for it they are really helpful and kind i honestly thought that the guy that checked us out was going to give us a hug as he walked us to the is always worth booking direct with he hotel as you get a better had a lovely sea view which is always a great way to start the was typical of irish hotels,1.0
we stayed at the fleet street hotel several times recently this hotel is close to many of the pubs and restaurants in the temple bar area it is also close enough to walk to the museums trinity college and other attractions the hotel was very nice and clean and the employees were very attentive to all our needs we had a room on the second floor above a small side street be aware that noise from the streets and bars will be loud the ear plugs should have been a good clue for this we did close the window on the third night and the noise was reduced and the room temperature remained quite comfortable,1.0
i stayed in many hotels in amsterdam and nothing come close to the hoxton the staff are amazing the rooms are amazing and the location is just perfect the last time i stayed the food was good but nothing to write home about i decided to eat there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had upped their culinary game i went for the baby octopus which was incredible and recommended to me by mindy who was rad and made sure i was left feeling like a billy whilst eating on my own the stroopwaffles left on my desk in my room was a real touch ca wait to go back,1.0
goodlocation good bakery next door for breakfast that room was tiny little bigger than the double bed there is nowhere to put your luggage let alone sink had a large flat bottom and drained very slowly so anything in it like toothpaste settled on the bottom and would not rinse away the same for the shower in the shared bathroomthere was no hot water at all at times sometimes it was cool or moderately warm never was only electric socket and it was over the sink in a room for people my phone is not waterproof neither is my camera there was a to adapter but the electricity supply was unreliable my camera was not fully charged after hours the same with my phone at first i thought it was the to adapter causing a bad connection but it was the same when i plugged direct into the socket i could see the power light going off on my camera then i thought it could be the charger but it did not happen at all when i plugged it into a socket in a nearby bakery so it was the socket in the room the lift was very slow and was blocked from use by the cleaners in the morning i needed the use of the lift as i can not carry heavy weights for long distances i had to carry my luggage down flights on because the cleaners were using the cleaners cleaned the bathroom at on a saturday,0.0
i ca complain about the location of the hotel and the size of the room but the cleaning service is very poor and our bed we were staying in a room smelled strongly like cigarettes it took days to have the issue resolved but the bathroom and the main room were never cleaned properly during our stay furthermore the price for breakfast is euros per person which is quite expensive especially if you traveling with your family,0.0
not only is the hotel top notch in every way but it is also located in a very central part of the city the square where it is located is one of the most beautiful of the dublin city squares i would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
great location well appointed and quiet room with the most comfortable bed friendly and attentive reception staff who gave us a personal tour of the hotel facilities and our room the only not so good point here was our evening meal in the hotel restaurant was terrible,1.0
great hotel rooms are tight but very nice and classic place friendly and very helpful staff free buffet including free beer etc very good location been there before and will go again thank you,1.0
what a hotel excellent location being at the heart of temple bar next door to the hard rock cafe and a min walk from grafton street the manager was more than friendly and helpful in fact he could have been a better manager greeted with two complimentary cocktails which were amazing food was lovely rooms were perfect with everything you would need the hotel also has an amazingly cosy smoking area which seemed to be where a lot of people chilled out as it has heated sofas and it just lovely the hotel is super busy on a friday and saturday night as it is a popular place for drinks so the vibe is great also very close to many and food places i really ca fault this hotel could have asked for a better stay,1.0
i was down for a match and i was taken back by how well the staff here treated us nothing was a problem and all our needs were dealt with in a nice mannerly and helpful way rooms were spotless clean food was excellent staff brilliant what more could a guest ask for thank you croke park and my family look forward to staying with you again,1.0
when in athens we always stay in pkaka district it what athens is to me the plaka hotel is in the middle of it lovely room nice breakfast lovely help full and professional staff roof top bar and seating area with magnificent views of acropolis the hills covered with white colored homes we love it for early check out they offer continental break fast,1.0
me and my girlfriend went to amsterdam for a weekend getaway our first time there so were both excited we were met by a long wait to check into the the room before entering it to find it was tiny there was so little light in the bathroom that we had to have the door open to let light in when having a shower and there was no extractor fan so it just steamed everything up and to top everything off the later that evening we happened to notice some red marks on the carpet to our disgust when we looked closer it was blood yes blood and when we told the staff they tried to tell us it was red wine but it was obviously blood there was no doubting it they did then send someone up to clean it who just stunk the room out with chemicals which after the carpet had dried the stains were still there so they tried again and it still did help,0.0
we chose to visit athens as it offered the best of both worlds a historic city close to the sea and the emmantina is the perfect place to stay to enjoy both located centrally between the airport a bus ride away with a stop outside the hotel and central athens a tram stop minutes walk away from the hotel you can either explore the city or stay closer to the hotel and relax on the wonderful rooftop terrace or the local beaches the hotel is a minute walk from glyfada which boasts a wide range of shops and restaurants to suit all tastes rooms were basic but functional and the breakfast good the staff were friendly and mostly helpful particularly julie who was always able to offer advice and answer our many questions only one issue was the busy road in front of the hotel the noise was loud and pretty constant which did restrict our use of the balcony however the glazing shut out most of the noise at night would definitely stay here again if we come back to athens,1.0
room was nice and clean air conditioning worked great also had two big windows to open for fresh air wifi worked at times was a little slow breakfast was delicious just wish they had a little bit bigger variety all service was very helpful and friendly perfect location for everything would absolutely return,1.0
good accommodation everything is just good the steak in the bar is a little bit over cooked and the temperature of the showers during morning time turns between code and hot frequently assuming there are many guests having showers at the same time,1.0
lovely hotel but did get the low floor room i requested and when checking in they could do it for ages and then they forgot about us food and drink is expensive for drinks breakfast is really good but i go back to my treatment as this was really bad on checkout i was given the managers business card so i emailed him once back home no reply a week later,0.0

my daughter and i called this hotel home for a week in june our room was fine but warm at night i keep my house very cool so i hesitate to judge the staff was very accommodating the bartender camillo promised me the best mojito of my life and he delivered located on a pedestrian shopping street there was easy access to buses and taxis las ramblas was within walking distance as was the gothic quarter i would definitely stay here again,1.0
absolutely amazing hotel nothing was too much trouble and got great recommendations from the staff for nights out cocktail bars and restaurant choices also enjoyed a manicure in the spa located within the hotel and could be happier for people going for the nightlife the bar also has great deals for cocktails and they do the trick would return great place,1.0
my wife and i stayed at the marker hotel in dublin twice during our trip throughout the british isles it is five star accommodation with very friendly and helpful staff the location is a newly developing area by the canal river and docks we found that the price of the hotel and parking was quite high even using discounts provided through,1.0
loved our stay at the toren is a charming old amsterdam canal side building decorated with old school charm location could be better and the staff wa attentive and helpful from the minute we checked in we had a room facing the back so was very quiet with a comfortable bed,1.0
looking for a restaurant who could also offer vegan dishes we decided to try brasserie de ambassade the experience there was perfect since we had to stay a night in amsterdam city a few days later we made an online reservation while enjoying our food easier then walking down the stairs to the reception in short reception was fast and pleasant room was very nice and the service friendly and impeccablewhat can i say more than you really should try this,1.0
we loved it super friendly people location is min walking to everywhere they provide snacks fresh orange juice min free international calls each day and free bottled water we took two rooms one was ok size the other one was small our room seemed to be beside the room house keeping which was noisy,1.0
it is the very conveniently located to everything you are well within walking distance to the old town plaka acropolis museum which is another must visit when you are in athens arch of hadrian temple of olympian zeus etc the property is pretty big and tastefully updated it does give you a very grand feel to it the gift shops are like museum gift shop everything there please your eyes and taste buds if not your wallet the hotel has both an indoor and outdoor pool restaurants spa separate for suite with butler service the junior suite with butler service is very spacious with lots of room to move around with a king bed bed for our six year old closet and a bathroom with separate shower and bath tub double sinks and well accessorized with molten brown toiletry the suite also has a good size desk and ample room for a sitting area with a arm chair and sofa with a coffee table the only thing that i can see improving would be placing some clear pad between the glass and the coffee table and bedside tables to prevent the glass keep sliding away from the its own roof garden restaurant on the floor overlooking the acropolis parliament building amphitheater and the city hotel grande bretagne brother hotel king george hotel which is just located next door also has a roof top restaurant called tudor hall sharing the same view tudor hall has been awarded michelin star butler and,1.0

this is a centrally located hotel in barcelona right on the square at the barcelona cathedral very convenient to picasso museum shopping and restaurants buffet style breakfast is good but over priced stop in at a nearby cafe instead great beds and shower,1.0
the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,0.0
hotel is dated but well maintained in the center of tourism just across from greek parliament good nightly rates this said clerk talks of breakfast at checkin as though it included likely it not so ask prior to taking your breakfast otherwise you might get a surprise at the end a good star hotel with character and close to it all,1.0
michelin starred restaurant closed for vacation not mentioned when booking concierge did not follow up when promised on a reservation we had to follow up on status they were unable to obtain a reservation day lost along with any chance to obtain a restaurant booking a street restaurant for us turn down service hit and miss omg the basics had to ask for that also in fact had to ask twice each time for the simplest of requests this hotel is living on a reputation and most certainly do not understand that a star reputation has to be earned every day that is why we pay so much who knows it may be your turn next to have our experience,0.0
hotel is very clean i booked in the third floor and room was up to the standard it worth every penny paid for staff is the is very helpful from reservation reception waiters and housekeeping breakfast was good and pool bar very professional towels and bed sheet are very clean free beach towel available also,1.0

lovely tragic i decided stay at this hotel because i saw it on tripadvisor this hotel nicely in front of the river and i booked with my travel agent planning for staying when i got there they said i couldnt get the river view room cos it fully booked and theres no view for the street view either so really disappointed okay let start from the entrance there a stair at the entrance quite have to pass the stairs if you want to go to the hotel you have to think twice if you alone and bring so many luggage you get the trouble and theres no staff to help you bring the luggage first got room number i really would not recommend you to stay at this same floor with the receptionist theres a stair in the middle of hallway are u kidding me no way if you bring big luggage you be in trouble especially if you old no view at all the room exactly the end of the corner kind of spooky theres a noise like a wind blows or the blower of air conditioner i dont know sure but kind of annoying something trouble with the parquette in the front of the bathroom becareful for the door stopper often bumped to it not really not worth it for the price if u stay in this room really disappointed the next day we move to room number more better but still no view only view for another,0.0
the view from the room i was in was that great but it not like you spend a lot of time there anyway the room was clean in good condition beds comfortable and the sheets were super nice especially for a hotel an in room safe was awesome ammenity to have especially since i was travelling from out of the country the hotel was just a short walk from temple bar and along a lot of the site seeing companies and busses took the airlink from the airport and the stop is right outside the hotel,1.0

we stayed one night at the ashling our room was quiet and comfortable the breakfast buffet was very nice the staff was friendly and helpful we had a problem getting our rental car and they were quite accommodating about letting us have a late checkout,1.0
very few complaints did exactly what i expected reasonably sized comfortable rooms with great friendly staff and all at a good price it not exactly centrally located being around a minute walk from the nearest metro waterlooplein and minutes from rembrandtplein but still very accessible also a mention to the free wifi no problems at all with connection and good complimentary breakfast the only issues i had was no bin in the room only a small one in the the bathroom very little storage and only one pillow on the bed minor issues perhaps but all make a all of this in mind i would happily stay here again and recommend to others at the price thanks,1.0
the grand hotel krasnapolsky was located in an excellent location it was a short minute walk from central station after getting off the airport train about short blocks the front of the hotel faces the center of dam square the sandeman free walking tours meet out in front restaurants are all around and there is a dirk supermarket half a block up we had three adults for our premium triple room beds for very comfortable double sink so multiple people can use staff was friendly and helpful i only encounter two minor issues with my night stay the first was the concierge did know what the dutch museum pass was i had reserved for the anne frank museum but you would still need to have the dutch museum pass i needed to know where the nearest museum was so i can buy it i was redirected to use the iamamsterdam pass which would work or try using the tours desk located outside i had used my google map to locate the rembrandt museum which is about minutes walk for my second issue was the elevator was making a loud sound since it was having problems closing i saw what appears to be the repairman working at it early in the morning but it was never fixed it went on all day i brought it to the attention of the hotel and i was told no one had reported it,1.0

truly beautiful hotel with friendly staff and great service the hotel is a series of connected and separate beautifully restored canal homes you can get a good idea of what it was like to live in a canal house on amsterdam most beautiful canal the only problem we could see would be getting to some of the rooms with physical handicaps as there are many steps so definitely check out accessibility when booking the restaurant was very good for breakfast and we heard excellent for dinner,1.0
had a great stay the hotel itself had great decor the staff were extremely helpful and all fluent in english if that a concern for you and the metro was less than a min walk with only a min ride to the big city center i also went running along the canal next to the hotel while there and there are lots of restaurant options nearby,1.0
stayed for two nights to attend a concert in dublin our stay was fabulous from start to finish on arrival claire a trainee receptionist checked us in she could have been more helpful from giving us a map recommendations and explaining the luas to us our room was great everything from air con to the fridge and rooftop balcony the location was great as the luas is great value and will take you straight into abbey street for under already looking for another excuse to visit dublin so that i can stay again thank you gibson,1.0
my niece had her communion here and we were happy at all with the food i had chicken wings for starter which had barely any meat on them and got about on the plate the mains came out about minutes after and i got penne pasta which was absolutely vile to say the least the pasta was dry and hard and the sauce tasted like tinned tomatoes it was basically day old pasta with a tin of tomatoes poured over it with no meat or anything disgusting,0.0
stayed july room was pleasant and comfortable however at our expectations were not met i passed on breakfast even though it was paid for looking unappetising and poor quality dining room is very outdated a good morning how are you when greeted would be nice upon arrival to the breakfast room check in was very poor phone calls and visit to the hotel and the parking situation was still not made clear as the parking facilities for this hotel is not straightforward make use of your website trips back to the desk to get the room keys to work correctly staff need serious basic training at reception we feel lastly staff were friendly however the guy the area on the needs a proper talking to how he treated and spoke to the staff was shockingly horrific the swearing the tone he took the body language pointing fingers and raising of hands and physically rushing past me that i nearly dropped my drink actually unsettled me to the point i had to leave he is in the wrong job if he gets that angry i felt so sorry for the waiter out of order i wo be returning,0.0
stayed here for night during a recent vacation to amsterdam the hotel is located right next to the metro station and about stations from the grand central station it super convenient the hotel is located in a very cool neighborhood with some some shops and restaurants away from the chained stores that you see in the city center staff is exceptional friendly and i really like the communal working place on the grand floor as well as the coffee area it really has a great atmosphere and i had a great time staying here than a standard international hotel chain i would highly recommend to stay here to enjoy and experience another side of amsterdam while it still close to the grand central station,1.0
this is a very comfortable boutique hotel in the gothic quarter a seven minute walk to the metro in either direction lots of good restaurants steps from the hotel great for exploring the gothic quarter on foot comfortable beds but only twins professionally run the buffet breakfast is pricey but you wo be disappointed by it if you prefer something less elaborate there are bakeries within a few steps of the hotel i read the reviews that complained of a sewer smell on the first floor there is a slight smell i only noticed in passing through the lobby and sometimes in the elevator it did really bother me excellent ac balconies the street below can be noisy at night because the street is lively and the block is narrow the hotel is owned by the nh chain but the name on the front of the hotel is hesperia so you do confuse the cab driver,1.0
the hotel is very snazzy the room was spacious breakfast ok the service was good conference services were fine slow wifi at times on the bad side no irons in the room the one they brought me had rusty stains which came off on my shirt no good the rooftop pool is ridiculously tiny why bother at all with something that can barely fit people across every lap pool i have ever been in anywhere in the world is much wider than this one the whole deck is so tiny that people were splayed out on the hard floor with barely a inch to step around each other and there were relatively few deck chairs hotel charged euros for me to use an indoor spa area for one hour with a big jacuzzi and tiny sauna,1.0
we could not have asked for more great location not too close to tourist area plenty of wonderful places to eat within a few blocks always welcomed on our return each day breakfast was a fabulous mixture of local foods and self serve nespresso coffee,1.0

my favorite hotel in amsterdam very convenient location next to the train station perfect starting point for touring the city great hotel amenities food etc but best of all the staff a little surprising for a big chain hotel but the staff are genuinely friendly very professional and will make your stay that much better if you appreciate convenience quality amenities and great service this is the place for you,1.0
good location within walking distance to acropolis rooms are spacious tea coffee available as well as good bathroom amenities and quality of pillows and mattresses is not the best but breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and attentive personnel worse to go to the roof top where swimming pool with stunning view over athens is you can get free water from the bar there overall decent quality hotel,1.0
thank you amsterdam american for another wonderful stay if you want history and art deco architecture this is the hotel for you i sure that amsterdam has many wonderful hotels but we are devoted fans of the amsterdam american the staff is courteous and always helpful the bartenders in bar american are exceptional shout out to all of them especially sara the location ca be beat walking distance to the major museums vondel park the trams are right outside the front door the bus to the airport is steps away too costs only minor complaint is that our room room is directly over the booth for the canal trip a few times it got a bit noisy in the morning however the room is worth this minor ca wait to go back to amsterdam we will be staying at the american again,1.0
lovely hotel with amazing views of the acropolis from some rooms and especially from the roof garden which all guests can access for a meal or just a drink very close to the acropolis museum which is well worth a visit very friendly staff nice breakfast clean and tidy good air conditioning we stayed twice and were upgraded once to an acropolis view room which was very special,1.0
while i only got to stay there one night it was really nice the location is only a few minutes away from downtown and the hotel staff and accommodations were very nice from the time we pulled up the bell hops were friendly and helpful the front desk greeted us with a smile and hello the room was more spacious than most european hotels and it was clean and functional,1.0
the location first of all was perfect a stone throw from all the local tourist attractions the rooms were very quirky but in a good way for example our room had a basketball hoop which meant for an easy pastime whilst the girlfriend was in the shower only one real problem which was the bed found to be a bit too big often found that the bed was swallowing me up on a couple of nights this flaw really is me being very picky though as overall my experience of max brown was excellent,1.0
i just returned from a day mini break august from dublin i stopped at cassidy star on street the hotel was spotless and the staff could do enough for me the breakfast self service was awesome and you could have as much as u liked the double room was very clean and was attended to every day there is a free gym on offer the main area temple bar is only about minutes walk this is the time i have stopped here and would definitely stop here again next time i come to dublin,1.0
check in was simple with a very pleasant helpful member of staff our room was everything we could want clean comfortable with a safe and ironing board and plenty of tea and coffee bathroom was a good size and lovely orla kielly toiletries this hotel is a little walk from city centre but easy to find and get around from there are plenty of bars cafes etc for food on the route and this proved handy when we walked home late after being out for the evening i used the pool which was quiet and clean another bonus is the bus to and from airport stops right outside this is the second time i have stayed here and i would definately stay again,1.0
we had a wonderful time the design of the hotel and the location in the center of dam was great hotel staff are very courteous and ordered breakfast in advance breakfast is from the menu and it was hotel restaurant is wonderful we loved the atmosphere and the food everything was extraordinary,1.0
excellent location and easy to reach by tram or bus as one of the great advantages tramlines and buslines with numbers should be mentioned prominently on the hotel homepage or booking sites great breakfast room very small and should also be redone very friendly staff,1.0

we had a great time in barcelona recently staying at pratik rambla pros very nice and helpful staff great terrace area to enjoy location is incredible and perfect for exploring free croissants in the morning are actually excellent but make sure to get in by or they be gone cons small rooms very little space for luggage the washing subcontractor lost serveral items of my clothing still waiting to hear from hotel if they turned up overall decent for price fantastic tapas place across the road which is great for breakfast,1.0
this review comes along side my partners and i can not fault this hotel in anyway we are reluctant to visit amsterdam if the ramada has no vacancies available during the time we want to visit it is honestly one of the best hotels me and my partner have visited and can not fault the staff we are hoping to revisit amsterdam in august and are looking to book here again and will only ever stay in this hotel when we visit everyone that visits amsterdam and asks where to stay the ramada is always the first place i suggest the facilities the hotel offers are fantastic and tram which takes you right to the centre in less than minutes is right outside the hotel offers free airport shuttle from airport to hotel and is only euro if you book to take you back at the end of your visit overall this is a hotel you will not regret,1.0
hotel is well situated very clean staff is very friendly and helpful the view is amazing pool was very well kept water could be a little warmer staff at the pool could be a little faster i would recommend this hotel to everyone looking forward to returning,1.0

i recently stayed here for two nights and must admit that i had been dubious having read the previous reviews however i could not fault this hotel and i would be quite hard to was spotlessly clean bed very comfy and peacefully quiet we enjoyed breakfast on each morning buffet style with a varied choice to suit all we also dined in the restaurant both nights food was excellent specific compliments and thanks to david restaurant who is charming his customer service skills are fantastic and he is a credit to this hotel,1.0
we stayed at the o b athens boutique hotel for nights while seeing the main sights of the city everything is walkable from the hotel and the furthest sight panathalenic stadium was maybe miles the front desk is fantastic and helped us set up taxis to pick us up from the airport and also drop us off for an early morning flight they even packed us a breakfast on the morning we left as we were up before the breakfast buffet opened the was incredible and we slept great we highly recommend this hotel and stay here again if in athens,1.0
we stayed here in late june it was a family trip we had two interlocking rooms it is a beautiful hotel quite pleasing to the eye the service was great and the location is great there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance or within a short taxi ride the gb roof garden restaurant with a view of the acropolis was wonderful a great dinner at that restaurant was a highlight of our trip to athens if you are looking for a five star hotel in athens i very much recommend this hotel on the less positive side the rooms were a bit tight i could have used more room and it is not a cheap hotel one pays for the high quality so make sure that it is within your price range,1.0
very clean very good and helpfull staff good location best hotel manager jose who makes sure that the hotel guests are happy and comfortable by asking them daily about there satisfaction and their comments if any simply the best hotel manager i ever met,1.0
a fabulous gwa girls weekend away for three of us to see joshua tree tour it was first time for two of us and yrs prior for other friend since we only had full days of touring we need a hotel with the best location this hotel hit the mark for us first off the staff were awesome hazel and marko were so helpful at the front desk over the days with all our tourist questions the breakfast buffet was perfect and consistent every day and we were greeted with we had a business class with twins and a rollaway and we had plenty of room to maneuver closet was fine plenty of outlets for adapters for phones and other electronics look under bedside tables hair dryer out of for shower water rain shower plus handheld deep soaking tub with hand shower you will use after pounding the streets all day is modern comfortable in deep warm tones hallways are wide and beautifully lit again with deep warm wood tones love the shoe shine station at the elevator on each floor these items are all important but the best reason to stay at raddison blu royal is the location on golden lane walking distance to everything patricks guinness grafton temple bar trinity college etc we were hoping to stay in temple bar it looks so darn cute and it is thank goodness we did way too crazy at night to stay there in our opinion enjoyed the fun and we,1.0
picked as a relatively inexpensive option for one night prior to flying out of dublin so just looking for a basic place to sleep in a convenient location expected it to be noisy given the busy street did meet these expectations however a fresh coat of paint everywhere and a new mattress and pillows with even a bit of fluff to them would greatly improve the quality of the stay mattress was so saggy and lumpy that we could only sleep on the edges of the bed and pillows might as well have been folded blankets stuck in pillow case triple glazing on windows would also help,0.0
we feel very confottable in this property staff is very nice and they are always taken care of us hotel is located very near to the center and ther are two subway stations very is good all is very clean,1.0

we really enjoyed are stay in hotel nadia we got a room with a balcony rooms are indeed a bit small but everything is very clean stairs are steep but that typical in this kind of building however staff was ready to take our luggage upstairs the staff is very friendly breakfast buffet was ok it a minute walk from the train station but you can also take a tram this hotel has a very good price quality,1.0
hotel is just minutes walking distance from sagrada familia well connected by buses just around the corner and metro sant pau nearby easy transport access to every major tourist attraction welcoming and helpful staff can book visits to top attractions on offer and skip queuing in line would keep in mind to visit again in the future,1.0
we stayed here for nights after a river cruise this was a very good place to stay the breakfast buffet has a very large selection of foods and is fresh and very good the rooms are on the larger size for europe and had washcloths which is not common in europe staff in reception the restaurant and customer service are very helpful and friendly there is bottled water available to take each day when touring out in the city excellent location and close to centraal station the only drawback we found was that on saturday night it was very loud outside with a party or a bar close by and the noise echoed into our room until the early hours of the night saying this it was something the hotel has no control over we would stay here again on another visit,1.0
loved the vat pub traditional irish music after from somewhere pounding driving music from nearby venue kept us awake all night long front desk was interested the next day when i reported it it more like a hostel taxi driver had had an ominous smirk when he dropped us off now i know why,0.0
the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,0.0
we had four nights in barcelona so wanted to find a location that would allow us to walk to restaurants of our choosing yet not be in the mobs of people on the rambles the hotel is located approximately four blocks off the main square above the gothic portion of the city in a much quieter part of the city the room we were in was relatively small but was very well appointed the huge plus was the open air patio at the rear of the hotel again well designed with numerous group seating arrangements this was a delightful setting for morning coffee and some of the best croissants we had in spain and back to the deck for evening wine before proceeding to dinner the staff were very accommodating and helpful as we finalized our daily site visits and restaurant plans we worked very closely with johanes during our stay who was a wonder it was the perfect fit for us,1.0
we arrived at the brooks hotel after a hour flight from the states absolutely exhausted and a nice young man at the desk greeted us and informed us of places to visit on the map he gave us he also said there was a lounge downstairs for guests who wanted to take a nap before their room was ready or just to relax my dad wanted some coffee so he asked at the front desk and they brought it down to him on a platter what amazing service we were able to get in around as the young man had put us as a top priority and the room was fantastic and clean the room staff was super friendly and the head maid actually checked on us to make sure we made it to our room okay breakfast was the only part of this trip that could use some work simply because the head of the separate restaurant where breakfast is served is quite stuck up however the restaurant as i said it separate from the hotel so does not take away anything from the hotel great staff who are friendly and always on hand would absolutely stay again we were absolutely spoiled in great hospitality and the rest of our hotels for the rest of our trip in europe had high bars to reach to come close to the brooks hotel,1.0
we stayed here on several occasions whilst visiting my favourite city in spain amenities were perfect excellent service and friendly polite and respectful staff everywhere we went from the gym to the swimming pool breakfast etc handy to the beach and niteclubs are within walking distance magnificent night vista over the city highly recommended,1.0
the room is spacious clean and overall very pleasant breakfast was very good basic kitchen in the room and a wonderful supermarket in the mall next door public transportation is good once you check in your suitcase there is a walk from the closest tram to the hotel,1.0
one of the features that mark a good hotel is how seamlessly it operates the hotel do meets this criterion in spades with the courteous and attentive staff all singing from the same hymn sheet to provide excellent customer service the hotel is elegance personified with superbly spacious and comfortable rooms and an excellent kitchen which serves imaginative and fresh food in a variety of settings from rooftop evening dining to al fresco dining facing onto the pedestrianised placa reial my partner jen and i stayed there in june this year as part of her birthday celebration it was expensive for our pockets but it proved worth it a special place to mark a special occasion,1.0
we got to the hotel in the middle of the night after we got lost in amsterdam the night shift worker welcomed us in a very delightful way explained about the city and answer a lot of our questionsthe hotel is very close to rembrant square and about minutes walk to dam square supermarked nearby and a marketplace and there is public tranportation minutes walkthe classic boutique hotel,1.0
we were two families of four with some of us staying nights and other nights overall we were very happy with the divani caravel the rooms were very good sized although we had expected that the triple rooms would have had a true bed for the person not a sleeper breakfast as mentioned is overpriced for what you get if you pay out of pocket but was actually very reasonable when you booked the room with it pool was very nice although we were a bit surprised at the cooler temperature of the pool especially given how hot it had been in athens the two weeks before we arrived service was excellent and they were very helpful in the one area where we ended up having some because the people in our party had been in europe from weeks already we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry ultimately this is more of an expedia issue than a divani one but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service not the laundry facility we were expecting however the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant overall i would say it was good nothing special but it certainly hit the spot and let us get to bed earlier than if we went somewhere for food options there are several,1.0
i stayed here in may for nights with a friend the hotel was very clean and the staff were extremely helpful our room was small with the shower and sink in the same room as our bed with a curtain to separate and a separate toilet cubicle this took a bit of getting used to but it was an issue although small the room had everything we needed and was ideal for us as we were out exploring each day and did need to use it a lot there was a hairdryer a tv a safe towels shampoo and soap rooms cleaned and towels changed daily the only downside to our room was that there was a huge crack in the mirror though this did cause any issues the hotel has a unique theme to it though do let this put you off as it really interesting there is a rooftop terrace with a bar and sun loungers we ate breakfast at the hotel which was lovely it was a buffet style set up with plenty of continental and hot food to chose from full selection of teas coffee and juices the hotel is less than a minute walk from la rambla and minutes to the metro station there is a mini market opposite the hotel the hotel has facilities to leave your luggage in a safe locker space which we found useful on our last day as our flight home was till late all in all i have no,1.0
returned here in july after visiting last october love the hotel and the location is great to visit all the great local restaurants and bars loved sitting outside watching the world go by will definitely be going back,1.0

can not fault this hotel in anyway my wife is very particular and she loves this hotel she wont hear of going to any other and we have been to a few but this one stands out i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience from check in to check out the customer service and the staff the facilities the room breakfast the merkado the views from the level overlooking the city and sea were all well worth it definetly looking forward to our next visit keep up the good work,1.0
this hotel was opened in april it is a very nice hotel close to the tram and across from a supermarket it about a minute walk to town the staff are very friendly the rooms are spotless i would visit amsterdam again and i would definitely stay at this hotel the room had a canal view and it was very comfortable great customer service,1.0
the hotel is in the best part of the city in the eixample but it s a minutes walk for the underground a hotel itself is really clean the rooms also there is cleaning service everyday the rooms are amazing for us the beds were really comfortable the room itself wasn t big but it was enough for us it s important that there is no fridge in the rooms the bathroom is also okay the is slow in the recepcionist are really kind they helped us to find any transportation places to eat or with any other personal needs as i mentioned there was no fridge but we had some leftovers so we asked them to store it and they helped immediatelly even at s important to note that the hotel is built together with hotel aston we have to go in that hotel if we want to have breakfast over to use the pool during breakfast you can use from various foods i think it was a really good thing but nothing was too tasty the pool is really small also as the jakuzzi so these are not the advanteges of the hotel but otherwise it was marvelous,1.0
a lovely hotel outside the main tourist area but connections are really easy we had access to the lounge too which was nice a lovely breakfast too we hired bikes which was great fun and easy to use,1.0

we found this hotel on and booked a night stay check in is at but we arrived at pm very early we we very fortunate to be checked in by the lovely dana front desk manager who upgraded us to a room with a balcony and proceeded to get our room ready asap even though we were very early we then were able to leave our luggage and go explore and get lunch while this was happening we got to our room at and walked through the door to find some bubbly and balloons for my husband birthday it was a lovely touch as well as the call dana made to see if we had everything we needed and to wish us a lovely stay all the staff we encountered we friendly and helpful the only negative i would add is the room was slightly dated and a bit tired décor wise but clean and tidy would definitely stay there again,1.0
there is a happy and excellent hotel with very kind and helpful staff hotel has an excellent location and metro station is beside the hotel that you can reach the central of city in ten minutes and free wifi is great but it would be better if they put the slippers in the room,1.0
the room was clean and the decor was very nice and fitting to staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure a pleasant trip and the hotel itself was in a good location overall wonderful accommodation,1.0
just a rather ridiculous place stupidly for everything just to park in the hotel car park each for breakfast and for a small glass of milk for our toddler just somewhat up itself with no obvious reason absolutely no charm the pool was poor the obligatory bag carrying felt agressive the staff were pompous there was a weird thing where someone came in to put a piece of paper on the floor beside the bed not sure what that was about but it made me feel our room was not private the room was cramped the bathroom big but badly designed all in all go somewhere else,0.0
i have had the pleasure of staying at the gallery hotel twice before my current stay and the quality of service is always the best the staff at reception the porters and the housekeeping staff are friendly and very efficient in the the service is welcoming and excellent thanks to nuria andres and their compañeros i hope i will return soon,1.0
we stayed for days at madanis hotel recently we were given the floor room which was always tidy provided with a brilliant housekeeping service as we were very active in barcelona trying to see as many things as possible we did not spend much time in the hotel however there are many touches that made our stay a pleasurable experience first of all the staff they were all really nice and helpful constantly smiling especially the lady at reception when we checked in she gave us a map of barcelona and immediately circled around all the most important and interesting sites to visit which was very nice of her staff were all really responsive and first class spot on i also work in a hotel in england and i must say that the details in madanis are most certainly worthy of the it has,1.0
the location is great next to the train station and public transportation the bus stop of to the airport is right next to the train station the breakfast is simple but i have no complaints because of the good price the room is clean and comfortable they gave me a quiet room,1.0
my husband and i spent nights at this hotel we were very impressed with the courteousness of the staff the cleanliness of the rooms and the overall positive atmosphere in the hotel although it is not in the heart of dublin the tram service just outside the hotel is very efficient,1.0
ideally situated nearby the port la rambla and in the barri gotic very nice rooms good working airco very good and large beds very friendly staff take the breakfast inside the hotel it s nearly perfect between there s a little but nice buffet ideal for a quick bite only negative is the very small terras sunbeds very small swimming pool meters,1.0
we recently stayed at the athens gate for nights and were very pleased with this hotel it was clean welcoming and the staff at the front desk very pleasant the views you get are spectacular the included breakfast offered each more was fantastic and never mind the incredible view of the acropolis on top of it i would definitely book her again returning to athens crystal jamie looney,1.0
stayed days and it was great location is awesome its quiet and train is just away price was also ok and the staff was really friendly and helpful breakfast was ok too cant complain hope we come back one day,1.0
well i would recommend the maldron hotel in smithfield certainly for the price that we paid for a room for four people sharing with breakfast convenient location away from the hustle and bustle of temple bar and its environs yet not too far away minutes walk from the centre of dublin of the dublin pass attractions is directly across the courtyard outside the hotel jamesons whisky distillery convenient fresh produce supermarket is situated next door to the hotel in case you need to stock up on fresh essentials for your day trips around the have no hesitation staying at this location again,1.0
this is a boutique hotel but does quite live up to the star rating the room is nice entry level rooms are small which is what we had there was really anywhere to put your suitcase let alone of them one of the good things was that the toilet is self enclosed meaning one of us could be in the shower or using the sink which did prevent access for the other one to the loo if you like privacy the main disappointment was breakfast we stayed at other boutique star hotels on the same trip which were streets ahead with breakfast service the hot food is cooked to order but to be honest was that nice the bacon was really fatty and greasy the eggs also greasier than fried eggs elsewhere on our first day the order was delivered wrong also i pretty sure the hot mushrooms were from a can fresh fruit was rarely topped up while we were there so we missed out on some they only put out small croissants at a time so often they were all gone too unless you waited around for a bit the location is great walking distance from many of the sights and a metro close by good sound proofing in our room which faced the ramblas overall staff were good we stay somewhere else next time,1.0
we booked this based on previous reviews and were disappointed the room was spacious and spotless as was the entire facility the staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating as others have mentioned the breakfast was varied and good especially the pancakes made fresh on couple of things to be aware of the lift is small but can accommodate large suitcases the as is true throughout amsterdam are very steep there is a school playground across the street and is somewhat noisy happy noises during the day otherwise it a nice tree lined it a wonderful small hotel in an ideal location for food parks and museums you wo be disappointed,1.0
all we can say is very good service very good location excellent service from the staff we will come back again sometime but the bar closes way to early that is the only negative thing i have to say,1.0
fab hotel great location wonderful staff who could be more helpful we had a beautiful room lovely view spotless hotel breakfast was delicious will be back in december a wonderful hotel in a wonderful city,1.0
this is a funky elegant hotel in dublin just off stephen green a great location we had a very mix d experience that the hotel made right the room was funky chic think crystal chandelier in bathroom that featured a deep slope top claw foot tub there was all night construction outside our window that we were warned about after a relatively sleepless night complained and asked for full refund within a couple days manager sent an email apologizing and giving requested refund in my opinion stuff happens making it right is what matters my wife and i agree we would definitely stay here again our warning is to either be sure construction completed or you get a room that does not overlook dawson street on other matters friendly helpful staff not very disabled friendly so far as i could tell i rated very good as i sure the hotel is under normal circumstance if you like funky clean but not pristine in a great location this is for you,1.0
we stayed nights and loved the location great restaurants nearby and just a short taxi ride away from the gothic quarters and la rambla the hotel offers breakfast at a cost loved the quiet outdoor patio,1.0
the hotel was very very nice the personnel was very friendly and the room was cosy the best thing is that the hotel is in a very nice area everything needed you can find in the room the beds are extremely comfortable,1.0
set on koninginneweg in amsterdam this hotel is on the tram line making it easy to travel around the city it very clean the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were very friendly polite and helpful my only complaint is not having a luggage rack in the room i was faced with either putting my suitcase on the floor on the desk or on the bed otherwise it exceeded my needs and was a very good hotel solution for the one night i was in amsterdam on this trip,1.0
we had a deluxe room overlooking the canal the room was luxuriously appointed with a small chandelier over the bed and a nice sitting area the bath was compact but nice the lobby is very inviting and always had pastries cookies or sweets out great breakfast and service,1.0
stayed here at the start of july when we arrived after we payed and asked for a receipt but we were told we would recieve the receipt as we checked out at the end of the week we were then told our room was ready and we could check in until when it states on the website that we should be able to check in from onwards when we checked out they tried to charge us again and we had to show that they had taken the money on our banking app otherwise the stay was pleasant and the hotel is in a good location,0.0

my family and i visited the netherlands early july starting with a night stay in amsterdam we chose the westcord art hotel as it was easy to reach from the main ferry terminal in amsterdam and had onsite car parking we were not disappointed the hotel was super stylish and the staff were very helpful we ate in the hotel on one evening the food was lovely however there were only two staff on duty and the restaurant was very busy we would of ordered a few more drinks with dinner if we had the opportunity still the staff on duty did their best the family room we stayed in was fantastic main double room with an adjoining twin room for our children amsterdam city centre was only a minute walk from the hotel although we could of took a bus we enjoyed exploring the streets by foot i would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity,1.0

convenient location friendly staff clean rooms and good room service staff are keen to provide you with any advise you ask i have one comment about the room design itself the toilte is kept separate from the wash basin and shower room which i found it inconvenient,1.0
i have heard a lot about the clarence and it famous for years but never had a reason to be in dublin that changed not so long ago and given the opportunity i decided i would try and stay i was struck by two things immediately the availability was easy and the price was not out of line with other options provided by the conference i was attending great sign me up i would refer to my first impression as this is authentic i may have been expecting something more extravagant given ownership and what is the norm at boutique hotels in london and ny excellent is cleaver east no doubt about it breakfast out of this world i would have eaten there again if it was for other responsibilities due to the conference lift to room quaintly oldschool the room very nice well appointed with a large washroom and good ammenities ah now let go get a beer in the famous octagon bar okay this needs serious help back over to cleaver east for a pint at the bar i had not researched the location it is literally a minute walk to temple bar the bar not just the area great if you like this sort of thing s t if not very close good news options roberta and the liquor room hop across the liffey and go to terra madre for italian tell alessandro i said hi otherwise the city is small and you can walk to everything,1.0

we had short visit to athens before returning to the states the athens hilton exceeded our expectations in service and amenities we especially enjoyed the indoor pool hot tub and fitness center dining at the galaxy resturant with it amazing view of the acropolis was the perfect ending to our day vacation to italy and greece,1.0
we booked this hotel for nights in june as part of our month travelling round spain we chose this because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed this definitely feels more than a star check in was good with the receptionist spending a lot of time pointing out things on the map for us and answering our questions room was one of the best we stayed in with small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel the location was in a quiet area just off plaza de catalunya but within walking distance of la ramblas and shopping area we were minutes from el born a lovely area with good restaurants and bars we used the metro which was a handy way to see the city and very good value if you bought the ticket deal nearest met was urquinaona they have a roof top bar here which was lovely but underused which is a shame but on the plus side we always found a table,1.0
the parliament hotel is the location you want walking distance to grafton st temple bar area the river liffey is a bar on the main floor with friendly staff where you can also get your free breakfast if in the morning staff informed us the hotel will be going through major renovation as it was recently purchased and the last bookings were set for july which is a good thing as the floors and rooms are works fine in all locations i went to elevator is slow so you will likely end up taking the stairs as you will beat it every is though you will get a discount ticket that gives you almost off when you go to get your car two blocks away be ready to test your driving skills at the parking lot as the the spots are incredibly tight and you will see people trying several times to make it would stay again as i mentioned earlier the location was ideal,1.0
this hotel was nice the location was excellent just a short walk to the acropolis zeus temple the museums and plaka the view from the rooftop was amazing breakfast was included and the sister hotel was a short walk away which we appreciated because it allowed us to use the pool there the staff was great and very helpful the wifi needs improvement as does the air conditioning we had to call down to ask for the staff to help us with that several times overall i recommend this hotel if you have large luggage you be entertained by the size of the elevator lol,1.0

not stay at hotel we paid for nights at hotel oasis believing their promises of an inner city oasis what a mistake we made my partner and i are not picky nor do we have unrealistic expectations for hotels all we wanted was a clean comfortable room but from the moment we opened the broken door to our superior room we were extremely balcony doors were also broken so anyone from outside could get in towels were dirty and the was broken initially we decided to put up with these issues but the constant disruption from builders next door tipped us over the edge from early in the morning to late afternoon there were builders renovating the room directly next to us we wake up to the sound of industrial drills and hammers and the smell of dust and cigarettes obviously we were really disappointed and requested to be moved the manager laughed in our faces and dismissed our complaints but promised to move us to a better room later that day we were directed to our new room and i have never been more appalled the smell of cigarette smoke was so pungent that my partner and i began to cough and react additionally the basic ugly wall fittings were falling apart and there were stains all over the walls and lampshades the lights didn t work either sitting in a room knowing that the manager of hotel oasis was probably taking great pleasure in our misery we asked,0.0
this is an excellent hotel but with some drawbacks it not very close to anything other than the beach which is a little grimy it a city beach so we found ourselves walking for minutes before hitting anything very interesting the hotel facilities are lovely but are not commensurate to the number of rooms for example the pool is v small and often was overcrowded the lobby was often a zoo the restaurants were packed the staff are very friendly but needed multiple follow ups before any of our requests were handled,1.0
greeted by friendly staff as we pulled up in car who took our luggage and brought us to reception where equally friendly staff checked us in and brought us to our room i had emailed previously to mention that we were staying for our honeymoon night and the hotel kindly sent us some cupcakes and a note thanking us for choosing their hotel for our honeymoon room was spotless and my husband enjoyed the nespresso coffee machine we also had a great view and the bathroom was huge massive shower lovely soaps food in bar was exceptional staff again very friendly and helpful after our night out we arrived back to find the staff had dimmed the lights arranged rose petals on the bed and made swan towels such a kind gesture ordered breakfast in the room which was amazing pool was incredible steam room and sauna definitely worth a visit overall best hotel experience i have ever had great attention to detail would recommend to anyone,1.0
do not book this place if travelling with young children because sex shops are but the location is quite good close to madame tussaud and ripley museum and canal tours are very close by as well the eateries around the area are simple and great places to grab a bite rooms have ac free and fast wifi clean amenities shower was nice has shower head however the walls of the interior were not as soundproof as you could hear people talking in the hallway and their footsteps thumping down the hallmornings are quite noisy around this area because garbage trucks are around,1.0
this is a pleasant clean hotel with a great location we always choose our hotels for location and this delivered although just a star hotel we could not have asked for a better location it was perfect clean had a swimming pool and served a reasonable breakfast included in our rate all staff were friendly and extremely helpful we emailed ahead with some and they came back immediately helping in every way possible our room was great we had the top floor with a large balcony comprising sun loungers tables and chairs all with a roof top view could not have asked for more the room and bathroom was modern with a huge bed and exceptionally clean we would advise anyone to read the blurb on the hotel as tea and coffe was not supplied in the room however this was not a problem for my coffee addict husband we took a travel kettle with us water was not supplied in the room however a supermarket close by sold bottles reasonably priced there is no concierge however the reception staff are on hand to answer any questions about this city we purchased the open top bus tour through the hotel saving us a couple of euros there is no entertainment here just a bar with little atmosphere buy hey you are in the heart of barcelona go out into this beautiful city and embrace it it right on your door step we enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate,1.0

from the moment we walked thru the doors our stay could not of been better we arrived on their opening day everyone was so friendly and kind marjorie at the front desk was great check in was smooth and fast we got a great last minute deal on our room we loved all the small details in the room from the pencil and notepad the coffee cups the pillow menu if you want a specific pillow not a problem we took advantage of their continental breakfast great way to start the day one of the servers paola gave us some great recommendations on restaurants and bars thanks again paola the hotel is in a great location we walked everywhere the beach was about a min walk the rooftop pool was a great way to cool down after a day at the beach the ice cream floaties were a nice touch as well we ca wait to visit barcelona and yurbban passage again thank you for a great stay,1.0
the location is great if you visiting for business but it a little ways out of the city center for restaurants bars etc we walked to the main shopping street which took about minutes and another minutes from there to the la rambla room was huge so was the bathroom air conditioning was nice they also had lemon water and snacks in the lobby which was nice because it was insanely hot and humid outside july the staff were very friendly and helpful and you get access to the rooftop pool at the adjacent hotel which was a really relaxing way to start your day each day,1.0
my wife and stayed for six nights and enjoyed every minute the hotel is modern beautiful and best of all the staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful being right at a luas tram stop makes the location very convenient to desired locations we would definitely stay here again next time in dublin,1.0
for a few days in barcelona it the perfect hotel the location is great centre and m from the metro the balcony and the view on the ramblas is lovely the room and bathroom are clean and you have enough space in the room,1.0
not cheap at nearly for the night i stayed but i loved the hotel it could be hard to find the sign discreetly hidden behind some trees but the staff are terrific and have perfect english the decor is imaginative the aircon was a blessing and there were ingenious touches like having the aircon in the bathroom set to a higher temperature and having a little light by the toilet so you do have to turn on the light if you have a call of nature in the middle of the night it had the most comfortable mattress i ever slept on it was so handy too to have the vending machine right outside my door i liked my private balcony and that the hotel had a the price for the room the price for breakfast and the fact that the crisps in the vending machine are heavy enough to activate the release mechanism of the machine so you have to get someone from reception to rescue them oh and the free wifi was so weak that i turned it off and used my own data,1.0
hotel curious is located just west of la rambla lots of people walking the main north to south touristy thoroughfare in barcelona the hotel offers a great breakfast with lots of juices and coffee options the balcony we had overlooked the street the hotel sits on and noise was not a problem at night the balcony doors were nice and kept the sound on the outside the room was nice and modern my only complaint is that we could feel the springs in the bed despite this we had a surprisingly good night sleep each night i especially liked the light switches by each side of the bed that could turn the whole room lighting and also would control a table side lamp very nice and thoughtful the staff was helpful and friendly,1.0
my husband and i spent nights at the brooks hotel in late june i would say this is one of the best locations in dublin for sightseeing without a need for a car on one side of the hotel was a starbucks and the other side was a typical irish pub with great food and friendly staff we walked to most of the sights although several days is needed to see everything the weather was cool and wet but the room was very spacious nicely decorated and comfortable with and a pillow menu it is close to temple bar but far enough away to avoid the met barry the manager who was very friendly and helpful as were all the staff on any future trips to dublin i would certainly stay here again,1.0
comfortable clean close to bars and shopping after sightseeing day this may be a review for dublin or ireland as much as the westbury but we found the irish people to be warmer and friendlier as a whole than perhaps anywhere we traveled must i leave a balanced review the only negative i can come up with is that the breakfast room is small and crowded relative to number of rooms,1.0
we are traveling with a and year old very safe location deceiving upon entrance then you go downstairs and it opens to a beautiful hotel no ac but ireland is cool most of the time our windows opened fully in our family suite which we loved the double bathroom and layout it on fleet it will be loud but we enjoyed the live music and felt like we were at the concert the room has earplugs if you need them staff is helpful and polite we left our ipad and passports in safe they called us and we will pick up when we return to dublin they are keeping it in hotel safe until our return,1.0
the hotel is in a fantastic location with great amenities and friendly helpful staff the room was large clean and with a great bathroom we used the restaurant and the bar both were great we would definitely stay there again,1.0
hotel location looks good so we booked may be the cheapest room because we only spent one night in athens the room was too small and did have any window its ok thats why it is the cheapest room but what about the towels their colour went yellow and smell very weird and the bed also smells like that just try another hotel there are many options in the centre of athens,0.0
perfectly located just outside the old city section and just down the street from sagrada familia boutique hotel with friendly service where they answered all my questions and helped me get around barcelona the rooms were a combination classic and ultra modern,1.0
exactly what it says on the tin the hotel is very pricey so do expect star luxury however it is right in the centre of temple bar so ideal for that the room was to a good standard and always kept clean daily however many improvements could be made but can not complain with the price we it is above a very busy bar i did hear this once during our stay but we were on the floor ideal for those who are planning on spending much time in the hotel and want to be right in the heart of temple bar,1.0
not a pleasant experience at all set back on a dingy street the hotel offers randomly poor customer service and staff with sticky fingers we booked our stay at the astor with a group of people so good business for them but after our poor overall experience they wo be seeing business from us again here why some of our group are and naturally occasionally forgetful while enjoying our breakfast out on the balcony which it has to be said offers a great view of the acropolis one guest my sweet nanna just about the kindest woman you ever meet accidentally left the door on the balcony open which separates the rooftop viewing area from the eating area as she walked through it instead of simply closing the door and forgiving the obvious mistake a particularly angry witch of a waitress who was on staff at the time decided to make an example of her slamming it shut and pointing and gesturing as if she could believe the incompetency of her guest i can only assume she got out of the wrong side of an empty bed that morning or perhaps was up all night in a full one and forgot her basic customer service training in all the excitement leaving the astor was an bizarre experience we had left our luggage at the hotel while exploring athens for the day and went back later to collect it order taxi so we could move on when the bags were rolled,0.0
i recently purchased a house in clare and when i fly from la into dublin i like to stay at the clarence before traveling onward the location is great and the rooms are well organized and maintained,1.0
we stayed here in july and found it to be a nice hotel rates were affordable and rooms were clean staff is friendly however be careful if aviva stadium has an event as the hotel is very close to it and i heard it can get busy in that area we ate at the pub and found the food very good the hotel is located away from city center although easily reachable by taxi train or bus line there are local within walking distances towards sandymount center do not buy the cityscape hop on hop off bus tickets at the front lobby desk we waited almost mins at each bus stop while all the other bus lines came by every to minutes we finally gave up on them after the stop and used a cab,1.0
we had a wonderful stay at the fitzwilliam hotel in dublin the staff are very pleasant and very helpful our room was great the location is excellent as well we are happy to rate our entire experience here as excellent,1.0
i stayed at the gresham hotel in dublin recently and was disappointed check in at reception went smoothly i was served by a lovely pleasant lady who gave me a complimentary room upgrade and what a room it was too overlooking street the room was absolutely beautiful and very clean we ordered food in toddy bar and it was as good as we would have liked it to be we were disappointed to find that the service was slow and the food was only warm when it was served with only small portions too when asked if everything was ok i did inform the staff of this but the only response i got was i definitely would eat there again as it not good value for money at all the breakfast was better though they claim to serve until but if you are down before that time most of the buffet has been put away and only a small amount of hot food remains available so get down early finally there is renovation work underway at the front entrance which is surprising for the time of year i would have thought that this type of work could have been completed early spring or in the autumn time not during peak season the workers are very noisy resulting in some difficulty hearing the very good reception staff they too appeared frustrated with all the noise from dropping tools and banging equipment all in all a great stay costly but then again,1.0
great location near central train station staff were very helpful getting us train tickets when we were checking out luxury hotel with nice wine social hour in early evening thanks for a wonderful stay and also for sending a complimentary bottle of champagne and gourmet cookies for our wedding anniversary,1.0
location was the best thing about the hotel the rooms could and should have been cleaner i personally told them multiple times that there was a bad smell in the room which they totally ignored the hotel manager was extremely corteous though not the rest of the staff,0.0
when you book a hotel it usually to sleep with the nightclub in this hotel literally shaking the walls of your room down you will not sleep a wink it am as i write this and i feel as if i have just been scammed by the dean i a frequent traveler and hands down my worst experience at a hotel ever,0.0
as soon as you arrive you can tell the hotel is going to be special it is beautifully and even smells lovely the check in was smooth and the artfully decorated lobby is a welcome surprise even the corridors are decorated artistically just providing that special touch the room was lovely and again really good the special touches like the toiletries provided free bottles of water on the first night and even a little pack of biscuits on the side when we arrived all made it even nicer we had a problem which the staff dealt with immediately and very well the staff were very attentive and provided us with information for how to get to the airport and let us know when there was an issue with taxis the rooftop pool was the real highlight of the hotel was too busy towels were provided again by attentive staff the pool is very deep but was a nice way to get out of the heat and can see a view of the mountains through the other roofs the location is a really good way to explore barcelona close to a metro station and not too far to even walk to the centre restaurants near by as well as little supermarkets,1.0
this was the cheapest hotel i could find in dublin given that i did want to take the hostel route the staff went out of their way to be helpful i had a tour that meant i would miss breakfast which is served from but you can get an earlier continental breakfast if you ask beforehand furthermore i needed to print out my boarding pass so sent it to them by email and they printed one copy sent to my room and another at reception i liked how the breakfast was served by staff but you still had the choice to choose what you wanted a wide choice and good quality rooms are a little tired but it is a three star hotel there is no air conditioning which means it can get a little warm in the summer the corridors have a lot of character and you feel obliged to stop and see what is on the walls and to sit in the various reception rooms the location just off street is very helpful just minutes walk from temple bar etc and close to bus stops for the i would definitely recommend staying here,1.0
first of all i would like to say that i am a hilton honors member for quite some time and have thoroughly enjoyed most of hilton hotels where i had stayed also i would like to make it known that i very rarely review any hotel however my experience in this case has been so extremely bad that i felt an obligation to my fellow travelers this hotel quite frankly does not deserve the hilton designation when someone looks at hilton hotel he has trust that the franchise will guarantee a certain level of quality and experience at this hotel was a total disaster from the very beginning i arrived at the barcelona airport at on thursday morning and when booking this hotel of course it threw it into the next day when i arrived i said that i would pay for wednesday night plus the prepaid night for thursday they gave me a room which had no air conditioning when i complained they told me that the minimum it could be set at was when i continued to complain they finally switched me to another room at that morning i talked to the manager mr dalmau and was told that i would have to switch to a third room in this room the air conditioning worked well however there was a family with several young children and infants that were screaming crying and running in the hallways despite my complaints there were no apologies only a very arrogant attitude,0.0
stayed in this hotel a couple of times amazing value for money rooms are spacious and bright we had breakfast in the hotel daily and the amount of selection was unreal highly recommend to stay for breakfast best you will get in amsterdam we also had dinner on one occasion which was also fantastic staff are very attentive and helpful the hotel is tram stops away from city centre really easy to get to though from outside of the hotel you save a lot of money staying in this hotel than you would in the city centre even though you have to travel it is definitely worth it,1.0
booked here after reading the reviews and enjoyed a fantastic four day break despite arriving very early we were given the warmest welcome our bags were securely stored and we were offered breakfast which was one of the best i have eaten the full irish is just that and worth every euro service levels here are way ahead of many top brand hotels and the friendly and charming staff always go the extra mile to ensure guests feel welcome our large bedroom was very comfortable and clean and the black out curtains ensured great sleep the hotel is a short walk from the light rail service dart which provides a very reasonable service into the city there are also a number of decent eateries nearby if distance becomes a problem overall a fabulous hotel which we look forward to returning to soon highly recommended,1.0
i highly recommend the fresh hotel the location is excellent the breakfast is outstanding the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff are very helpful be sure to check out the rooftop restaurant and bar excellent food and the view we stayed for three nights,1.0
i have just returned from a excellent night stay with my daughter the roof top bar and pool is such a welcome extra to this hotel the staff are very attentive and the cocktails delicious the room on the floor was very good except the shower flooded into the toilet area and did not drain away i spoke to reception twice before maintenance man came minutes later he said it was fixed but it did the same thing for the next nights such a shame and he room was not cheap when i mentioned it again the night before we were leaving i did expect some compensation he did take bout euros off my bill i ca check the exact amount as he could print the bill shame,1.0
under renovation stay across the street at the davenport until complete they tried hard but are really not ready to provide the experience they want for guests the room updates are good just need to get the rest done,0.0
we stayed here for a couple of nights whilst visiting the city staff very helpful the concierge was always polite and friendly reception staff equally helpful and rooms were clean tidy and had all the necessary requirements for a comfy stay the fan provided a welcome cool room the windows opened as well providing fresh air whilst there was some noise from outside it was not excessive or disturbing at breakfast was fabulous great choice and no rush,1.0
thank you all it was a lovely one night stay clean and staff were very helpful after a long night at croke park will be hoping to come back in to watch england beat ireland at train is on the door step and it is a couple of stations to city eat at the hotel but looked very nice,1.0
although i love to read reviews i have to be honest that i hardly ever write one and if i do it is usually because i had a bad experience and want to warn people that being said i had such a positive experience at this hotel that i felt compelled to write a review i typically stay at star hotels and this is honestly one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at mostly due to the service the rooms are very nice but not over the top they are spacious and it is a boutique hotel so take that into account the location of the hotel is perfect i ca imagine a better place to be in barcelona unless you want an ocean view but we live near the beach so we did not need that the hotel is right in the center of the beautiful gothic part of town next to la rambla and in a beautiful traditional square with lots of cafes and shops my wife and i sat out and read on the square for an hour each day because it was so nice the staff take such good care of you and they do try to nickle and dime you a huge tasty breakfast is included and drinks in the room are included very nice perks there are only rooms in the hotel and they treat you like you are staying in their home i ca say enough great things highly highly recommend,1.0
i stayed here for nights with my boyfriend from the july to the july we had stayed here previously a few years ago back in and were fortunate enough to be offered an upgrade on room view from room spacious and powerful was very comfortable and cosy roomthe rooftop rooftop bar is a wonderful gem to unwind with a cocktail or beer after a day of sightseeing cocktails were nice service efficient and the atmosphere was always friendly both during the day and the night did have time to try the pool out but it looked extremely inviting and ideal for a few hours sunshine it was popular with guests but not overcrowded i will definitely utilise this on our next i found all staff to be professional friendly and hard working and always happy to help out we were made to feel welcome at all times i could fault any of the area some nice bars tapas places brunch spots and shops in the local area within a short walk a wonderful area to another fantastic barcelona trip and a lovely stay in hotel america i will definitely return again soon,1.0

loved this hotel we felt like family and friends the staff were kind and very helpful sergi was extremely good to us each morning as he welcomed us to breakfast and custom made our coffee and it was a fantastic breakfast buffet at the front desk andré and alexandre were so helpful with directions calling cabs and obtaining things for us that we needed for example alexandre even went and got us a kitchen knife so we could peel some fruit that we also liked that this hotel was both and it was a wonderfully open environment and both kinds of couples were present at breakfast,1.0
my husband and two friends spent wonderful nights at this hotel we had a room right at the top and were amazed at how beautiful and in keeping with the original features of the hotel it was our friend had a double storey room but we much preferred ours to theirs the building is stunningly gothic and set within walking distance of tram stops into the centre and right inside a park i would hesitate to stay here again and it was extremely reasonable in price too also the huge bath was amazing,1.0
easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,0.0
we decided to do a quick stop in barcelona open browsing the hotels in the gay area i came across rhis hotel that has a wine theme boutique style and quite unique upon entering the lobby you will be ushered with a glass of bubbly and some pastries and while finishing your drink you can relax in the lobby and be entertain with their wine inspired deco the hotelis neat clean has a urban inspired interior guest agent was very hotel is very close to the subway station aeroport bus stop sagrada familia the famous church unesco stamped and number of attractions further it also close to gay bars and bathhouse to mins walk avenue and street name are found in the building corner edge sometimes it hard to navigate lol,1.0
i checked in my first day in athens before leaving on a week long drive through northern greece and booked a room for july and was assigned room a premium room it was mediocre at best but for one night did not mind it upon my return i had also booked a night august for one night also a premium room and was given room i had booked both nights before leaving on the trip room was substandard to say the least dirty and frayed curtains bad causing around sink old shower head was probably from the original construction low water pressure when i checked out and printed these out to the desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and ignored me i surprised this hotel still has it best western affiliation if it does i bet that room was not inspected,0.0

after disembarking from a scenic river cruise we were most pleased to find the hotel was an easy walk to the left of the pier with all of our luggage as it was right on the water although we were unable to access our room the hotel was most willing to store all of our luggage and give us a map and directions into the city we purchased a hour tram pass from the concierge and the tram stop was out front and across the tracks we learned to watch out for the bicycles and motorbikes we did not eat at the hotel but there is a bar fridge to store your small items a very nice gift shop is also in the spacious lobby as they were four of us traveling and two rooms with accompanying luggage we booked a van to the airport again with the concierge,1.0
we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast had a good variety the staff were extremely helpful and friendly they recommended us the best places to visit in athens some amazing restaurants they ensured we are all comfortable and nothing is missing very nice,1.0
just spent nights at this wonderful hotel and had adjoining rooms for adults and a child it leaning more towards a in my opinion great location with easy bus service to city the hotel is beautifully bright and spacious as you enter and overlooks a lovely terrace the attention to detail was superb beds were just so comfortable bed in one room and decent single beds in the other room the staff were fantastic service excellent great breakfast with fabulous variety of fruit cheeses and everything you could want we ate lunch and had dinner on evenings the food was wonderful really great stay and would be delighted to return i recommend this hotel highly,1.0
my daughter and i stayed at this hotel for a wonderful days we had a fantastic view of barcelona rooftops we could even see the sagrada familia and other tourist sites from our window the breakfast was plentiful and varied it definitely suited my vegan daughter with two choices of milk oat and soya as well as my self the gym swimming pool and fresh fruit cocktails on the roof certainly provided a relaxing end to the days where we trekked around a very warm barcelona city speaking of the city the location of the hotel is perfect not too close to las ramblas la boqueria etc so it was too noisy or crowded nearby montjuic too the metro station is right outside the hotel lobby which provides great access to every possible area you would wish to visit many people spend extra money on transport from the airport but we found using the hola transport card the metro was an apropos and cheaper form of transport from the terminals ca recommend this hotel and barcelona high enough we wish to return soon,1.0
we had a glass at the bar at hotel art and it was an amazing and breathtaking experience lovely and very service minded staff and overall a luxury and top experience we will definitely stay here next time drinks are super,1.0

i stayed in this hotel during may hotel is nicely located it is possible to reach the hotel from athens airport by metro and a great saving on taxi charges there is a metro station close to the hotel megaro mussikis and it will take only minutes to reach hotel that too the way to the hotel is rather very quiet and not crowded hence it is possible walk with luggage without any difficulty the hotel staff were extremely cordial and was available in seconds after making a tel call i felt so homely at this hotel the room was also very good with fine view to the road and the greenery closeby to the hotel there are lot of small restaurants shops and eateries the breakfast in this hotel was also upto my expectation i had spent nights in this hotel and and it was a nice experience,1.0
we have stayed in dublin many times while this hotel is a little further out it is definitely one of the best we have stayed in parking at the rear lovely spacious room recently decorated a leisurely walk to grafton street or bus stop outside we got a taxi back in the evening which was still cheaper than staying in the city centre where mediocre rooms were priced at for one night due to coldplay concert will definitely stay here again have recommended to friends,1.0
amsterdam is such a wonderful city and my stay at this hotel only added to the amazing experience i had while i was there the hotel is centrally located from to the museum square and yet in a quiet little street just by one of the canals comfortable room and they offer free bikes perfect for amsterdam,1.0

having been to barcelona a few times and seen all the sights my daughter and i chose this hotel because of its location in the gothic area which we reviews of a hotel are not enough to deter us and we have always been fortunate to experience a good stay wherever we have course there are better hotels in barcelona but for a short break in an area of authentic narrow strees little shops and sunny squares where you can enjoy a glass of sangria and a few tapas hotel rialto fits the room on the floor overlooked the street but with the window closed there was no noise and offered us an excellent view of a few paradesair conditioning in the room was a blessing but it was a bit cold during the night and i had to use the blanket stored in the wardrobe we found our beds to be hot buffet breakfast was not to our taste but there were the usual cereals yoghurts fruit different types of rolls toast cold meats and cheese to satisfy that is not enough there is an abundance of snack bars cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood at competitive prices,1.0
buswells hotel is a classic georgian style hotel that has excellent service while the hotel is close to a host of touristy attractions it is off the beaten path and a quiet place to stay the excellent breakfast is more than enough to fortify you for a full day of sight seeing would stay here again anytime we visit dublin,1.0
we felt like a prince and a princess the staff was very courteous and helpful the property is thoughtfully modernized leaving the old castle where it matters and adding a modern hotel with amenities destroying the experience,1.0
very nice quite hotel located close enough to dam and various other sights very clean definately will be back again the staff very helpful definately will recommend this nice tidy hotel for travellers for a quite stay,1.0
we stayed at the hilton for nights at the end of july the hotel downstairs is clean and the rooms are spacious puro beach is definitely the best part about the hotel on the whole we felt that the customer service and performance was pretty poor for a star hotel also considering the cost per night the bed sheets in our room were not changed once in nights we were missing basic amenities hair dryers bottle openers etc and it took multiple calls to reception to obtain the items we should have already had in the room on check out we were extremely suprised as frequent travellers that there was absolutely no facility for once you had checked out their solution was to use the shower in puro beach the one as you enter the pool or to go to the toilets which are cramped and very hot location is quieter and is further out of the city which we preferred but if we had wanted to be central this hotel is not the one the beach is close and the shopping mall being directly opposite was extremely handy as there are no other convinience shops and surprisingly for of water at the hotel was not so appealing great experience of barcelona however would think twice about returning to the hilton diagonal mar especially as you do not have to be a guest to go to puro beach also if this is your first visit to barcelona be advised that,0.0
we loved this hotel and location in plaka close to acropolis and other historical monuments we walked everywhere rooms were very nice clean with good airconditioning roof top pool with view of acropolis and nice little bar breakfast was excellent with lot of choices staff very pleasant and happy to help would stay again,1.0
this is one of the closest hotels to sants railway station great for an early morning member of staff at reception when we arrived was a bit grumpy but the room was good and we found a great place for dinner nearby and another place for breakfast next morning it was a breeze to wheel our luggage to the station and hop aboard the train,1.0
my husband and i stayed here for our honeymoon we had a room with a view of the cathedral square wonderful the hotel was very very clean and in an incredible location it was also super easy to find just take the aeropuerto bus to the last stop and follow the avenue to the cathedral the staff were also superb competant and friendly,1.0
terrible hotel in this day and age dirty rooms ac weak in this heat and no tea coffee station in the rooms unhelpful reception staff with major attitude had to buy water and no room service after pm only the rooftop bar and pool were good but even there the life guard was like a policewoman do not recommend at all,0.0
the staff were very welcoming at the ashling hotel the room was nice and clean and the size of the room was typical for a city hotel the location was great and we were able to walk everywhere we stayed nights and we had a very early check out the day we were leaving and they packed us a breakfast bag to go since we would be missing the breakfast that morning so very kind,1.0
the hotel is in good location it has huge halls and pretends to be luxury but it is not especially rooms are definitely not stars they are ok with everything needed but nothing special when booking the description says that the executive rooms should be of better standard than de lux especially they should have better view this is not true we were able to compare because we reserved two de lux and one executive and actually the cheaper rooms had better view this so called view costs about per night the hotel stands perpendicular to the acropolis so all the rooms on the side with the view have similar not the best perspective it is beautiful but not direct look at acropolis this can be found at the roof breakfast is good very nice people working there as opposed to the front desk where a little more genuine friendliness would be nice there is a lovely pool area but the sun comes there only for a few hours during the day otherwise covered by the shadow of the buildings the prices in the bar are too high for example espresso costs it is a pity because almost nobody orders from that bar overall the hotel is good but i had much bigger expectations therefore maybe i am a little disappointed,1.0
what a great hotel and great people the rooms lobby and restaurant added to the overall feel get the pancakes if you eat breakfast in the restaurant i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there was an enjoyable visit,1.0
the hotel and the staff were very attentive to my needs they even put a cake in my room for my birthday and i did even tell them it was my cool is that the rooftop pool was very chic and the location of the hotel was perfect it was outside of the trap gothic area and perfect i give them a out of,1.0
great location we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and there were many excellent restaurants in the area the hotel itself is a gem especially if you like purple the room was quite large for europe and very nicely decorated the bathroom was huge modern the breakfast was great with lots of hot cold choices the bar has a nice selection of wine beer etc and the bartender owner sister was friendly and fun to talk to and the front desk staff were quite helpful i would definitely stay here again,1.0
we had a lovely time here the hotel is clean and modern in a fantastic location near great bars and restaurants it just a short minute walk to la rambla and the metro is even closer the roof terrace is a delightful bolt hole with excellent cocktails pool is small but good for a quick dip free chilled bottled water on every floor is a nice touch would definitely stay here again,1.0
hotel was very clean and stf was very helpful perfect location just away from the metro station breathtaking views might be a bit expensive for breakfast they offer parking as well at a reasonable price considering that parking in the city is expensive and impossible,1.0
we specifically requested a quiet room and were place on the story in the back with a lovely view of a green courtyard our concierge told us the building was originally a hospital there rooms are not huge but have plenty of room and are well organized with which made it easy to unpack we enjoyed not being in the center of the city and being near a lovely park the tram stops are only block away and so it was super easy to travel any place within the city the staff ar very friendly and helpful they seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your stay,1.0
the only good thing about this hotel is its location rooms are very small and becomes congested if you have even a little luggage very few options for breakfast wifi was bad especially in the floor,0.0
clean comfortable with all the amenities wonderful full irish breakfast inviting lobby area bar and dining available staff go above and beyond to help would stay again close to the quay walking distance to downtown dublin bus routes luas and many amenities highly recommend,1.0
i had some doubts about this place as i read most of the reviews but i booked it because of the location at the end i have to say that my experience was better than expected the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly and helpful you can reach the train station easily as it located on min from the hotel we purchased a day rider ticket for which you can use on trains trams buses and metro be aware that amsterdam is a big city so having these tickets made our journey easy and well time consuming the breakfast was great too i paid it in advance if you book the room online through their website you get a box of biscuits which was great as a small souvenir the bathroom is located next to the room and it for all your use no sharing with other people the parking is free i paid for a parking when i booked the room but they gave me the money back so ask for this one you get discounts for the attractions from the reception will consider this place in future ignore the bad reviews you get a bit more for what you pay and this is the best balance in customer service well done teleport hotel keep the good work up,1.0
hotel was just a block from the heart of the temple bar area surrounded by good bars and restaurants yet was happily a quiet relaxing spot as well room was fine breakfast was great and the staff was very helpful,1.0
stayed nights with two rooms canal view room with small sitting area second room looked into what in nyc is called an air shaft the canal that the hotel is sitting on is not the prettiest of the central canals so the view is so so the canal view room has a tiny tv whereas the interior room has a large tv i suppose the idea was if you ca look out the window you can at least watch tv limited cable by the way good spot near the old city and the fashionable western canal rings you can walk to museums and central train without bags breakfast full on buffet was great nice staff they had to put up with so many complaints usually about nothing very nice canal ride from right in front better than love boats that a dutch name and the big tourist boat operator many good restaurants in area,1.0
this gracious old property is absolutely top notch it is not an edgy new world place it is of the class of a ritz property which it was until and has been extremely well maintained the rooms especially for europe are generously sized but what really sets the place apart is the staff they are excellent the concierge desk in particular is extremely knowledgeable and helpful highly recommended,1.0
close enough to the city centre wlaking time approx mins or hop on the tram which is directly outside the hotel close enough to central amsterdam but also far enough out to get some peace and quite and enjoy views of the river amsel clean room with friendly and helpful staff,1.0
not great but nice helpful front desk staff but most were difficult to understand it seemed they all wanted to speak spanish with an irish accent not good for the vast majority of the good location clean rooms that are paid maybe euros each for the breakfast but had to get breakfasts for two of our three days there due to early tours and an early flight what we got with the breakfast was an apple a banana and a very small muffin no more that was a complete would not return there must be better options in dublin,0.0
great they let us check in at noon upon arrival even though it was supposed to be after the neighborhood was a little sketchy and someone hard to find but overall pretty convenient location to metro great price for the room with bathroom inside breakfast provided and computer to print boarding passes available,1.0
we stayed at stauntons on a saturday night before heading to the airport the service was great the porter met us at the taxi and brought all of our bags in we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the day we were early when we returned our bags had been brought up to our room hooray we were on the second floor and as folks have noted there is no lift our room was beautiful we were in a triple with our young daughter the bathroom was beautiful and we appreciated the deep tub and plush towels at about the music started there was an outdoor concert in the park next door and it was loud our room faced the back garden the concert was nathan carter and it was great instead of being miffed we were happy to have a front row seat to this wonderful concert breakfast was not included in our rate but we went anyway because breakfast is tough to find early on a sunday service was very good always tough to pay full price for a full breakfast for a five year old but that was fine check out was easy and a taxi was called and promptly came to take us to the only beef and this is for irish hotels in general it was warm and without a top sheet only a duvet it was tough to get comfortable,1.0
the clayton is excellent value for money modern and very clean rooms lovely breakfast but most importantly staff who is extremely committed we celebrated our daughter birthday there and they went out of their way to make sure that she is truly spoiled the city center can be reached by taxi easily but it can also be a pleasant to minute walk to st stephen green and not to forget the canal bank cafe is just one minute away from the clayton,1.0
we stayed there for three nights on a room only board the room we got was a good size and overlooked one of the many canals right outside the window were bars and restaurants but we really ca complain about the noise yes there are late night revellers but that will happen in any busy city the room itself was very clean and well presented and a good sized walk in shower mini bar in the room with not the cheapest prices but well stocked we did use any of the hotels facilities because we got up in the morning and got back at night the staff were very friendly and helpful as were all the local people we spoke to the hotel is a star and not the cheapest but this was a special birthday so we splashed out a little more the hotel is in a great location for bars restaurants cafe etc but probably even better is it only a few minute walking from central train station if you want to see amsterdam and treat yourself then this is the hotel for you would i go back yes,1.0
we absolutely love loved our stay the service was excellent and very helpful the room was comfortable and very stylish not a lot of natural light but what there was served ok loved the murals with sights of the city very clever the only drawback was the musty smell in the halls it was a little intense but the rooms smelled perfect breakfast was delicious if a little pricey but that to be expected in a high end hotel i definitely stay here again and probably will as i love amsterdam,1.0
really nice hotel with a lovely breakfast and really nice room service food from the room service was cheap and delicious staff could have been nicer easily one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in,1.0
currently in room on floor at am with the incessant thud of drum and base torn duvet cover on bed still at least i have no fear of actually being able to sleep book a different hotel if you actually expect to sleep in your room,0.0
this is a perfectly decent hotel nothing spectacular but pleasant rooms good breakfast and a great location a minute walk up penbrooke takes you past beautiful georgian townhouses to a small community along the canal groceries a few bars good restaurants fast food bakery etc another minutes and you at stephen green all the best of dublin city center just a shortwalk away,1.0
my friends and i stayed at hotel estherea for three nights as a stopover prior to visiting africa the hotel was lovely they serve coffee lattes and tea in the foyer along with delicious biscuits the hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk everywhere on my first night a group of people decided to have a party on the street below my window so my first night was not restful although the room was lovely the following day i requested a room change and the desk staff could not have been more accommodating the hotel also provided me with an electrical adaptor as none of the three i had with me were compatible i would certainly return to this hotel in the future highly recommend,1.0
on our first day we went down to lie by the pool to be told we had to pay between euros per person depending on how close we wanted to be by the pool we thought this was a joke as we were residents of the hotel this was not a sick joke it is a beach club so the hilton make their money from hen and stag parties particularly at the weekend we felt like second class citizens as we felt that the hilton were more interested in making money from non residents using the beach club than residents of the hotel we complained so did not have to pay for our sunbed so follow our example complain on our last day which was a saturday the rave music started at noon and got louder as the afternoon went on so much so that the lady beside us had to go to her room with a headache you could only block out the boom boom for so long so we complained to the manager while i was complaining other residents also complained hilton hang your head in shame a hotel should never have a beach club attached to it and there should never be any charges for lying by a will never be back at this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone,0.0
this hotel has unique decor with entertaining community areas biallards chess set with pieces that are at least a foot tall there a metro station right outside that makes getting around very easy,1.0
i stayed at the shelbourne dublin this july and it is a fantastic hotel the hotel has great history and the location in dublin is excellent i had a suite and everything in the room was perfect and the bathroom was very spacious the breakfast was incredible from the options the seating rooms the staff and the quality of the food the best part was the staff i met at all points during my stay they appear to enjoy working at the shelbourne and it comes across in how they greet you and take care of the hotel and guests i would like to have stayed longer the shelbourne should be your first choice for dublin even if you are not a member of the marriott loyalty program,1.0
the decor and serviices were al excellent as was the hotel central location to all sites and conveniences if back again to barcelona we will definitely consider it one problem i was quoted euro for private transport to the airport the driver demanded euros at the airport somebody was mistaken pleas resolve,1.0
perfect location for business area in the telecom industry but so far away from business world class standards to host important guest for meeting room high standard gourmet meals and on the palace is not so clean and quite for business travelers that regular to hotels,0.0
we greatly enjoyed our quick stay at this hotel and would happily return the staff were very friendly and helpful with breakfast and local tips the executive suite room that we stayed in was recently renovated and a beautiful room we enjoyed using the sauna hot tub and large rain shower,1.0
when in dublin several times a year the ashling is my first choice it well located for museums tourist attractions and transportation needs directly across from heuston station and minutes from connolly station train connections are easy the luas is also proximate for sightseeing in dublin various hop on hop off tours are easily accessed from the hotel it a scenic walk along the liffey to street from grafton street trinity college book of kells the national museum of archaeology and newly reopened national gallery are just a few blocks away hotel amenities meet or exceed expectations rooms are lovely and comfortable staff friendly and helpful dining delicious especially the full irish breakfast buffet over the years it has not disappointed and continues to serve as a reliable and comfortable home base in dublin,1.0
my husband and i drove to amsterdam from germany for a day trip but decided to stay the night so we booked a room at the andaz on short notice and was very pleased we also stayed at the andaz in san diego but the amsterdam location is much more magical with the beautiful lights and an enchanting garden the bed was extremely comfy and the staff was very accommodating we will definitely stay there again,1.0
the location of the hotel could not have been more perfect it just a short drive from the airport and the hotel is centrally located in athens city center great design and a short walk to all the chicest restaurants and shops,1.0
i have stayed here many times over the years on business and i like the area being just outside the city centre and unique in having a decent size pool hot tub sauna and steam room and gym which i use every this july trip however the rooms were hot due to lack of any air conditioning and with no mini bar to keep water and drinks cold so a sleepless night with a noisy fan blowing hot air around the room and if you open the window then you will be kept awake by the traffic and noisy people on the street late at night so you ca would imagine they would have to tear the place apart to put air con in so understandable but no excuse for a star hotel not to fit mini bars in the wardrobes so at the very least you can cool down with a cold drink while you sweat the night another matter when i came back here for the england v ireland nations rugby match in march they charged me euros for a room and no breakfast this is simply taking advantage of england fans charging star hotel prices for a hotel just about a star my irish business partner who introduced me to the hotel was so appalled he secretly paid for our room as a surprise when we checked in you really must stop doing this on nations match days it bad than that good all round but i,1.0
terrific location if you have no intention of sleeping tiny rooms no no flexibility if the room does accommodate the group we accidentally booked a double when we came to find that we had to have a triple if we wanted our eleven year old to join us staff is indifferent if you use our fee was doubled,0.0
my husband and i stayed at ibis in august for nights the primary reason we had booked this hotel was for its location and we were not disappointed the hotel is less than a minute from the amsterdam central train station and is less than minutes walk into dam square the room size however is really small and the bathroom is even smaller at first when you open the bathroom you almost miss the shower area because the shower cubicle is that small also please note that there is no in the rooms i quote the receptionist we do not have air conditioning but we have air cooling and there is a fine line between them this was a new concept for us to grasp these air coolers would go off every hour or so at night and the reception told us that they control them centrally and turn them off if they feel it too cold our room became very stuffy without any cooling system the room has a small device to control this cooling but i think that a dummy device and the hotel controls it we did buy the breakfast because per person for breakfast was expensive for ibis overall if you just need a bed to crash in i guess this but it too expensive for just a bed at night,0.0
the motel is unique in many ways service was top notch little pricey including the roof top bar pool was refreshing on a hot day rooms could use a little work but beds were comfortable with extra pillows i would look around before staying here again but we were happy with our stay the breakfast was excellent and many fresh choices,1.0
beautiful views of the city and ocean from the room the club level was a great experience with excellent food and very attentive service would certainly choose this hotel again when traveling to barcelona,1.0
i surprised by some of the negative reviews due to noise we stayed in a room facing the street on a summer weekend and did not hear much noise perhaps we were lucky the hotel was great wonderful location tasty breakfast friendly service we were pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews,1.0
we stayed at the westbury at the end of our itinerary side note the train to galway is inexpensive easy and just a bit longer than driving after small rooms at other hotels the westbury was a nice and luxurious way to end the trip our room was spacious and nicely appointed the staff was helpful and responsive and the friendly bartenders at the bar make outstanding cocktails you can not beat this location a block from grafton but still quiet as a bonus for music nerds like me the hotel is near the statue of phil lynott we will return to the westbury,1.0
my sister and i spent just one night at and had such a wonderful experience from being prompt and eager to assist us with our travel questions and needs even before we arrived to designing a day itinerary for us to ensure we saw what we needed to during our short stay in athens before heading to the islands the service here is truly commendable nicos cristos and catherine were really great add to that an impeccably clean and very new hotel room perfectly located on a quiet side street just feet away from much more bustle and you have an ideal place to stay we will absolutely be back thank you,1.0

wanted a central city hotel with a pool and were disappointed right on the heart of the gothic old city area round the corner from the picasso museum santa maria del mar mercator el born and the franca railway station with great links to sitges rooftop pool area had comfy seating and a very welcome bar with a great barman pool was small but met some really friendly people and enjoyed our time up there a needed oasis in the city heat breakfast was plentiful and varied served in a looking restaurant staff here are all very helpful and cheerful highly recommended,1.0
lovely olde worlde hotel spotlessly clean very nice rooms the decor is amazing could believe how many people were at the nightclub under the hotel on a tuesday evening could of been a pint offers security on door on an evening to stop people from club wandering into hotel great cooked breakfast next morning good choice of continental as well only fault i could pick beware the windows open very very wide be careful if you have children,1.0
just returned from a long weekend in barcelona staying in the hotel arts our party comprised three generations including a twelve year old and a sixteen year old in every respect this is a superb hotel wonderful facilities welcoming helpful and friendly staff throughout the hotel having spent three days exploring this beautiful city it was bliss to come back to the pool or simply relax in one of the quiet areas i hope to return in the not too distant future,1.0
this is a lovely hotel and it customer service was exceptional after having my us passport stolen the staff were so kind and accommodating that i could not have asked for more in particular keith garreth lorraine ivo were amazing they helped me negotiate the embassy the police the taxi and all the other details when i was pretty stressed i am deeply grateful and highly impressed with the level of customer service they demonstrated i did not encounter a staff person at the gibson who was not terrific,1.0
arrived at the shelbourne after staying in ardmore cliff hotel spacious entrance with a lovely bar and foyer and well appointed bedrooms staff were accomodating and the service is outstanding rooms are refurbished but i thrink not all and bed is comfy with generous share of toiletries for bathroom clean and comfortable and yes was a good experience my only issue is the way to the spa is like labyrinth and we just lost interest to go there the bar is beautiful and lively good place to spend time after dinner in all it was a lovely city break being in a confortable place in a historical building yes would not mind staying there again when in dublin,1.0
our travel agent suggest omm since she had herself stayed there and was impressed by the staff and the hotel the location for us was perfect since we have friends that actually live near by we enjoyed heading out and walking all over the area and the metro was right there if we needed it the rooms were very good we had a standard and a the superior being a bigger size and that was nice the front desk and all the staff were very friendly and helpful the morning breakfast was very good an excellent mix of local treats and foods as well as the ability to have eggs made as you wish the only thing we found odd and not in a bad way were the hallways to the they were darkened and lit by glowing florescent floor lights cool looking but very dark and kind of futuristic in a weird an excellent stay and a top notch staff,1.0

we were two couples stayed nights at nh podium in july the hotels is lovely inside and outside spacious and clean rooms separate area super quite ac quality bed sheets the staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions the location is excellent although at first it seemed a bit more tucked in away from the major sites than we expected but it actually proved to be a very convenient and quite there are two subway stations nearby but we did not use them as for four of us taxi was really cheap and we walked to the most of the attractions also bought a sightseeing hop off bus tickets which we used as transportation as well especially for the more remote attractions placa catalunya is a min walk along ronda de sant pere very pleasant street lined up with mature trees and we would go through el born quarter to get to the gothic quarter via passeig de lluis companys just east of the hotel and then take one of the many streets that cut diagonally into the el born we did not opt to have breakfast at the hotel as it was unreasonably expensive about euros per person per day instead we enjoyed breakfast at many nearby restaurants especially on passeig de sant joan street just east of the roof top bar and pool is a huge bonus for us it was a meeting point in the morning and the place to have last drink before,1.0
we recently lived in the above accommodation for a family recommend this small boutique hotel to you most service was exceptional the facilities great and the position in glyfada perfect with the beach nearby and a min tram ride to the city centre as well,1.0
rooms are good but small during my visit i had multiple cases of mistakes in service and not professional handling of claims i got my room only pm wrong luggage was brought to my room waiters forgot my order in restaurant and they over charged me from my credit card from rooms star staff in a star hotel,0.0
this old classic hotel is a bit worn but worth it it is in close proximity to trinity college the newly renovated art museum and not far from the main shopping area the rooms are of adequate size and they hay have king rather than double beds always a good thing,1.0
fantastic staff and clean comfortable rooms location is great as well if you want to shop there is a mall across the street see the city the best way to get around the is city is by bus and there is a bus stop across the street in front of the hotel,1.0
stayed here for nights on the floor our room was large and very spacious with the added bonus of corner windows which provided great views great toiletries were supplied and our room was cleaned each day our bathroom was enormous with a wet room and bath provided there was also plenty of wardrobe and drawer space had booked a taxi to collect us from the airport to the gran hotel but unfortunately the day we landed the whole of the barcelona taxi fleet were on a day strike we had to take the train how fortunate it was that the hotel was just across from the train station it made a big difference to on the floor was fantastic and spacious with the added bonus of panoramic views of barcelona it was lovely we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts here the food was tasty and the friendly staff provided a first class service other good points are the amount of lifts available if i recall there are which were quick and fast reception staff were also friendly polite and very helpful the reason i only gave stars was because of the noise of the air conditioning unit i am a very light sleeper and found it difficult to drop off with the noise but i have that same problem with any i stay here again definitely the gran hotel torre catalunya provided everything and is in a great location,1.0
good hotel and excellent location the staff really were lovely and so helpful our only issue was that it was quite expensive for what it was especially as when we checked in the man next to us paid less than half we had for some reason equally although spotless when we checked in to the room the cleaning was terrible after the first night and we complained on check out having said that it was a comfortable room and the more than made up for it,1.0
great staff greets you upon arrival we were offered a cold drink as we checked in and quickly escorted to our very stylish room the room was very clean and the bed was comfy the bathroom had a great rainfall showerhead and plenty of space the free mini bar was restocked daily as an additional bonus i would stay here again without hesitation the staff should be recognized for there excellent hospitality they made us feel welcome and at home from the very minute well done fellas and thank you,1.0
the hotel is a business and is centrally located to both the barri gotic area and to the exiample section of town as well a number of good shops and boutiques are nearby on passeig de gracia and el corte ingles is on the nearby placa de catalunya the hotel public areas are beautifully decorated staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions on places to eat our room was very nicely furnished with decent lighting for reading and with double sinks in the bathroom even though we faced the street and were on the floor the room was quiet that being said a white noise app on your phone will solve any problems anyone else might have the breakfast buffet offers a wide selection of items fruit was fresh as were the breads,1.0
awesome location just walking distance to museumplein ledseplein and vondelpark we wanted to stay a decent distance away from city center and this was the perfect place much closer to schiphol airport than amsterdam centraal the hotel offers transportation to the airport but it a fraction of the price if you take an uber staff was very friendly room could been a lot cleaner but it had the essentials like coffee pot and water kettle semen well what else could it be lol stains on the curtains,1.0
the marker has great staff when you check in they walk you right to the elevator and ensure everything is set for your stay the rooms are large and quiet the staff take great care in their evening turndown and cleaning service the marker is the best hotel i have stayed in in dublin,1.0
really nice rooms love that we can open the windows and get fresh air the staff was really nice and accommodating its perfect to have a pub connected to the hotel where you can even charge the bill at the pub to your room only thing that was a little high price wise was the breakfast but it was convent as heck so we ate there each will use the hotel when we are back in dublin,1.0
from start to finish it was brilliant a good location close to the metro and a reasonable walk to the main areas the car park is great as well the staff took care of our case as we arrived early and set off for our exploration of the city we came back later to check in and were taken to the club lounge as we had booked club rooms the staff were fantastic and we enjoyed a drink there with our children and checked in our case was taken to our room while we were there breakfast was great exactly what we needed and was also served in the club lounge there is a new roof top pool which is small but enjoyable with a great view the bar is also nice with a good selection of food we had a late check out so returned here after a trip to camp nou for a drink and some nibbles i would not hesitate to stay here again brilliant,1.0
one of my top hotels the location is great seconds from the beautiful beaches of the mediterranean and a short walk into downtown barcelona the hotel is fantastic rooms were in stellar shape the pool was perfect really not a single complaint about our time their car service picked us up promptly from the airport and we were allowed to check in early which was great having just landed on a red eye from the us recommended to anyone traveling to barcelona who wants to enjoy the best of the old city and the beach,1.0
we decided to stay at this hotel at the end of our trip because our flight was at in the hotel was very clean we booked the quadruple room because we have two room was very spacious for european staff brought our kids complementary writing block and crayons which was dinner in the restaurant was nothing to write home about but this hotel is a very good choice for one night to catch an early free airport shuttle was good and got us to terminal in good staff was courteous and all in all a good experience,1.0
if you staying in barcelona then you almost have to consider an hotel there are many of them in this great city this hotel is right by ave diagonal and a short walk to the sagrada familia and catalunya plaza both mins the lobby has water juice and snacks for guests there is a nice rooftop bar with a small plunge pool the larger plunge pool on ground level is more appropriate for a swim although still a small pool wifi is free breakfast at person is a little steep but you have plenty of alternative options nearby the rooms are modern and chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and well located,1.0
stayed nights rooms positively surprised even after reading positive reviews on ta rooms were extremely clean bathroom was great service was good comfort rooms are smallish but okay the deluxe room with nespresso machine is great though and does cost much more location is nice and cozy and minutes away is the clot metro at eur per ride anywhere in the city i would much rather stay in a quiet and affordable location sagrada familia and the glories mall are easy walking distance and there also a bus we took to parc guell and the science museum to the you can get from the airport to el clot arrago railway station for euro using the train and walk to the hotel which we did on arrival and return was super fast the breakfast was okay when we tried it but most days we got some croissants and pastries from the several bakeries up mallorca a couple of good dinners at the glow bar a few steps from the hotel certainly stay here again on a next visit to lovely barcelona,1.0
praktik bakery is in a great location for both sightseeing and shopping the rooms are very small but nicely decorated bathrooms are very small hardly any closet space it is nice that there is air conditioning and the bakery downstairs is lovely,1.0
the pulitzer has a lot going for it prime location on the banks of the canal amazing service by the staff great restaurant and a very enjoyable breakfast and a tradition of excellence you do have to make sure you pick your rooms because some are small and a little far to reach other than that this is first class hotel,1.0
we stayed here for our final two nights in barcelona the hotel is great the room was over the top awesome see pix the staff was friendly and helpful especially oriol freixas who treated us as though we were royalty the bed was ritz quality and the bathroom products were ok molton we stayed in room which has a panoramic view of all of barcelona including the beaches the only complaint that we had was that this hotel is not in the best part of town we tried to go off premises to have dinner but we quickly ran back to the hotel to eat there as the neighborhood was a bit seedy no question we would stay here again,1.0
this is my seventh or eight time staying at this hotel i love the proximity to the airport the city and the park the staff is wonderful and the breakfast buffet is top notch the room is very clean and the bed is huge short walk to the tram number and i suggest the for a shorter ride to dam square and central fitness facility is good enough for a short visit elliptical treadmill and free weights the pool is sufficient for a short was the only stay that was someone difficult and it was not the hotel fault the highway is shut down for weeks which means you will have to use side roads to get to the other highways during the week depending on where you are going it can add minutes or more to you commute if you are taking the tram into the city no will be back at this location again next year for my annual visit,1.0
the room was quite small and bathroom even smaller the was traffic noise but it to be expected in the middle of a busy city the hotel is modern and very clean this is a about to minute walk to the centre but a nice stroll and it is safe there are bars and cafe near by the roof top pool is lovely too most hotels have roof top pools in barcelona,1.0
nothing to is good central lot of eat possibilities in the near topstaff are very well speaks a lot of languages help in every can recommended espescially you one more by this way,1.0
pretty well faultless tastefully modern genuinely courteous staff excellent food we arrived after a long drive and refreshed ourselves in the pool and sauna reinvigorated we took off in the courtesy car really nice touch we were lucky ca book just happened to be free after a brief tour we walked back the mins from the centre of town for drinks on the rooftop and then dinner all good the best night sleep in ireland followed silent corridors silence outside these people recognise that as a hotel what they are selling amongst other things is sleep and here you find top quality sleep,1.0
the hotel is centrally located and has every amenity one could wish for the unique combination of several town houses creates a quirky maze to navigate with numerous ups and downs that said it is a masterpiece of engineering and design the outdoor gardens is special however all this comes at a price which is at the very high end of reasonable,1.0
the hotel was good nice beds space etc but it a bit of a walk to see things food was good nothing exceptional most staff from other countries tried their best to be understood just have to get used to different accents pretty often bar was great bar staff was wonderful parking available but tight very interesting history of this hotel,1.0
staff were friendly and kind room was better than i expected which was a good surprise food was top notch lounge has that important feeling that many similar hotels lack in close proximity to the aviva stadium so really handy for match trips,1.0
non smoking hotel but allowed to smoke outside lobby greeted by very friendly staff clean lift bar unfortunately but that a good thing in a way about minutes cab ride away from dam square also excellent bedroom and even more so showers,1.0
we stayed here as part of our air transat honeymoon trip to greece and its islands nights upon arrival and before departure to canada upon arrival at the athens airport we were greeted by the air transat rep along with other couples we were eventually taken to our hotel stopping along the way for the other couple s in a large bus no bathroom i would strongly suggest having transfers to your hotel but it s not necessary as there are many taxis which will cost you around euros to get this hotel is appointed nicely with a clean appearance and decor the lobby is open cooled and pleasant despite the weather outside our upon arrival was handled swiftly and efficiently with the staff having a good grasp of english our room was on the second floor right near the stairs there are different sets of elevators but each one is not very large since there are different sections of the hotel this makes sense wifi is offered free and the username and password are given upon but if you re early as we were when going back to canada you can get that and use while you room was a standard double room that contained one bed a bathroom and a unfortunately i did not get any photos of the room which is unusual for me but rest assured the room was sufficient and we found the king sized bed very comfortable giving us a good sleep make sure,1.0

i will not add to the previous reviews mentioning the facilities and the beauty of the architecture i would rather add to them the outstanding attitude of the staff there from the front desk mariano to customer service suzanne the operations manager jaume and all the room service and concierge staff members it makes you feel that you know all these people for so long even though on a short stay we were upgraded to a suite on arrival and hence got the full treat it will become our next destination every time we visit the city,1.0
stayed for days july thru the room was beautiful so was the bathroom the complimentary breakfast was excellent and consistently so every best thing about this hotel is the front office staff very respecful and helpful and honest my wife forgot her earrings and sunglasses in the room when we got to our next stop in germany we called the hotel and spoke to nickos one of the front office mangers and told us that they found them and sure enough he shipped them to germany the next definitely recommend this hotel it is a great symbol of the great greek hospitality,1.0
we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite for one night as we were in transit we were greeted by name at the front desk without presenting ourselves and this level of service continued throughout our stay the family room was very modern and spacious note that the wall and door separating the bathroom from the bedroom was a smoked glass this made our teenage daughters uncomfortable when using the bathroom the breakfast was great and the location was adequately close to the plaka,1.0

the hera hotel is a great little the grand façade is a very cozy hotel with lovely comfortable staff excellent room amenities that many hotels that charge a lot more do not comfortable bed but be aware that a double bed may be just two singles pushed together this is the only criticism i would fast internet a balcony with a table and chairs for gazing over the buildings and the acropolis in the restaurant and rooftop bar very decent breakfast breakfast can be very very boring at greek hotels but the hera does a good job great location meters from the acropolis museum and the underground station dozens of restaurants within a minute walk and the plaka area is minutes lovely people at the front desk organized a car to take us and our big suitcases to the airport euro for this which is a fair a really lovely stay at the hera hotel,1.0

stayed here with my husband for nights hotel is lovely and has the best hard working and friendly staff our room was no and was really too small for my liking nowhere in shower room to hang towel etc and not enough shelf space however it was only for nights room was cleaned every day hotel has such a beautiful garden where we sat every night for a drink when returning back from discovering amsterdam it in a really good location about walk from dam square but you can take the no or tram beware of the bikes thousands of them would return to this hotel if ever back in amsterdam but will request a bigger room lol thanks to all lovely staff,1.0

stay in the pulitzer amsterdam we will definitely return the recent renovation is superb with a lovely quirky intimate style all spaces throughout this hotel have the same fun vibe and the old canal houses give it a fabulous sense of character gardens are also beautiful very happy staff which says alot about a place we had a group here and everyone loved our choice the area it is in the streets is also the perfect place to be located i think it would be hard to find a better choice in amsterdam,1.0
we stayed for our first short break as a couple the room was clean and nice not one english channel on the tv to have on while in the room the pool area was lovely as for the hotel reception staff we found them rather rude as we booked our booking on booking com and booked it at and had to pay as they put on street tax wen we got there and we were not informed of this via email there was also a taxi strike wen we were there and the hotel did inform any of the guests about the situation it would have hurt to put a notice up in the reception area the hotel is miles away from any amenities and barcelona we found was very expensive as it was euro in a taxi to most places,0.0
pleasantly surprised at this conveniently situated hotel for the port and airport very comfortable rooms good bathrooms some aspects of the building are a bit tired and dated but the place is clean and the staff are helpful breakfast was good and dinner in the bar was good value in quite an expensive city would stay there again at the right price,1.0
i agree with the other reviewers that the service at room mate emma was quite good i had some questions prior to my stay and they answered very quickly and helpfully the room was small but not ridiculously small as some european hotels can be the location was great close to a lot of transportation and walkable to most attractions if you do mind walking for minutes my only complaint was that the room completely lacked any natural light my room was on the floor and faced the stairwell which was weirdly purple i felt like i was on a cruise ship and not in a good way aside from that i do have any complaints,1.0
we ended up here as our first hotel let us down but everything happens for a reason as soon as we entered the staff were friendly and welcoming speaking perfect english our room was spacious with a lovely bathroom and decent fridge to squirrel away snacks and nibbles downstairs in the foyer and restaurant were art installations and exhibitions which was interesting for us the hotel is about mins walk from the nearest tram which can be reached by crossing the road at the side of the hotel and taking the path through the houses and woodland opposite,1.0
wynn hotel never fails to please this historic hotel is steeped in irish history yet the updated rooms are very comfortable the breakfast which was unremarkable before has been revamped to a delicious spread the fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious the staff remember us from visit to visit and it certainly feels like a home away form home a safe comfortable gracious place to stay in dublin,1.0
i spent one night at this hotel prior to joining an organized tour of ireland however i would have no issue staying here multiple days if the occasion presented staff at the front desk were very welcoming unpretentious and did their absolute best to check me in to my room well before the standard time my flight arrived a the breakfast staff were equally friendly and offerings ranged from basic cereal fruit juice tea etc available as to continental which includes cooked to order porridge accompanied by slices of toast and a nicely prepared plate of cheese and ham to full irish breakfasts again prepared to order and cost a little more note all the breakfasts are separate from the room rate unless otherwise there is one slight issue with the breakfast hour it would be the dining space limited seating and a little cramped i recommend you get down there earlier rather than regards to the room it was very clean and cozy had a comfortable bed an infrared sauna which i did try tea kettle complimentary tea hairdryer and iron with ironing board is available in all areas of the hotel on an open network free of respect to location the roxford is on a quiet but very well connected street in an affluent area of the city the aircoach from dublin airport stops just a min walk away from the hotel main entrance at the schoolhouse hotel and there is a stop for other public transportation right,1.0
the front desk personnel was very friendly and accommodating that the only plus the wifi in the room was very slow it only works in the lobby and lobby is small and crowded the room is very very basic with no cabinets the mattress is thin and not comfy furnitures in the room are basic looks new but flimsy looking there no free breakfast as it says in it about per person but the food is good and considering it expensive to eat anyway outside we loved the coconut yogurt outside the hotel is a nice park that stretches couple of miles with nice restaurants and shops with lots of nice folks just hanging out not too crowded nice ambiance,0.0
a clean and comfortable hotel in a really good location just round the corner from the major museums in the museum quarter a quiet location which felt very safe the staff of this hotel are so friendly and helpful i could not recommend it more highly,1.0
perfect for couples great location with many cafes and great restaurants around the staff was extremely nice and helpful the roof has beautiful wall art and it a great place to visit at night you can have a drink and see from the roof the surrounding scenery including the acropolis,1.0
gardiner lodge has undergone a refurbishment and the results are excellent we had the handicapped basement room even though we are not incapacitated in any way it was perfect and right near the breakfast room the staff are wonderful and everything was just perfect the only thing was small towels but i believe this is going to be rectified you can walk to everything with ease it was a great first stop in dublin,1.0
we had nine of us staying here for one night upon arriving in barcelona en route to a cruise our travel agent made the recommendation based on the location in the middle of the city and the price point everything went fine my family not used to hotels were a bit taken aback by the old style heavy keys that you have to leave with the front desk upon departing it was a holiday in barcelona that saturday so all of the shops were closed in the neighborhood therefore we really did get a great feel for the rooftop pool was refreshing and the deck was nice pool is very small and fills up quickly they did have much in the way of service at the upstairs morning breakfast was typical european not fantastic but suitable overall it was fine for a one nigh stay the rooms are very austere and i do think i would choose it for an extended stay in barcelona,1.0
the divani is in an ideal location the acropolis is within walking distance as is the museum and many other tourist attractions we have stayed in many hotels we thought the lobby was swish considering the price we paid for nights the rooms do have the best views onto residential areas but we only used it to sleep in beds were comfortable shower hot and plenty of water towels changed as needed and beds always remade we did stay long enough for the sheets to be pool was refreshing closed and shaded for a large amount of the day best time to go is as we found few people there and lots of sun drinks are somewhat expensive but the iced coffees are delicious however walking up the road to dive coffee gets you a bigger one for a cheaper price you must visit sfika for food it not far you can almost see it from the door to the hotel the food is delicious we went to the secret rooftop restaurant pricey and though everyone was so pleasant not really worth used the blue tour bus ticket allowed days of exploring just what you need we off to santorini now,1.0
very good hotel big hotel very nice the service is very nice the rooms are very goodthe price is expensive the breakfast is very goodnice localization need to have reservation good pool in front of ocean,1.0

where do i even begin we loved our stay the hotel and the staff we thought the hotel was beautiful the room where breakfast is served is really nice the rooms were large and the bathrooms are amazing the rooftop terrace views are ridiculous it the view of the ports and it gorgeous yes the pool is small but we were there for that the beach is across the street there are plenty of tables if you like to sit but only about lounge chairs we would go up for a cocktail everyday otherwise we were running around the city if we had more time we may have lounged near the pool it did bother us really the location is everything you are close to the port barceloneta las ramblas and in the gothic quarter the only reason why it would be bad is because it hard to pull yourself out of the area to visit outlying neighborhoods really we were able to walk everywhere this was our favorite area of was incredible the spread was perfect and food fresh you are also able to pick how you like your eggs made that right there was a home run for my husband and i wish i remembered the woman name that handled the breakfast but either way she was great very friendly and very efficient and she maintained the breakfast area wonderfully the bellboy was super friendly as well i think his name was ruben he was always smiling and,1.0
we spent one night in athens and the hotel location was great the room was a good size and nicely furnished the bathroom was not well laid out and difficult to manoeuvre the shower was located in the narrow bath and it was extremely slippery and only had a shower curtain which constantly stuck to you the room was not very soundproof and every time someone left their room you could hear every noise breakfast was pleasant with the usual yoghurt scrambled eggs assorted cakes and hotel reception smells of cigarette view from the rooftop bar is fantastic,1.0
our first visit to the westbury and this will be our hotel of choice in dublin joseph the front desk manager and mary front desk agent went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable our guest room was luxurious and the breakfast room looks over a lovely street which leads to grafton street incredible shopping trinity college and the gaiety theater just a short walk from the hotel fun pubs an dining this hotel is truly in the center of everything,1.0
i had another excellent two days here in may service is impeccable lovely ambience throughout the hotel and the breakfast is first class i can not imagine being in athens and not staying at this boutique hotel,1.0
this is not a star hotel the food is ok but overpriced compared to what i was getting at the local restaurants for those prices i expect more it is a nice looking hotel but just because you call it luxury collection does not mean star and then charge high rates i would not stay again at those prices,1.0
the hotel was nicely situated in the city closer to the mountain than the cruise port the staff were friendly and quite accommodating as we arrived early from our flight and were let into one room for storage of our luggage we found the room to be typical of european hotels a bit small compared to us but nicely situated the bathroom was rather open with frosted glass surrounding it rather than actual walls the power points outlets were european so converters were needed for us taxi fare to the cruise port was from here the breakfast was good and open at appropriate times offering both hot and cold options the front desk staff were very helpful at arranging rides and providing directions for us clean and comfortable accommodations would definitely stay here again,1.0
excellent with family children this hotel is so central and was excellent value for money it was approx minute walk from las ramblas and minutes from plaza catalunya catalunya metro station is only around the corner the room had single beds and they said that of my children will have to share a bed this was perfect we pushed singles together and of us slept there and on the other single bed there was no issue with noise outside at night i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone there was no issue with the air con cant comment on the breakfast as we didnt eat here staff were very helpful and friendly,1.0

this hotel is situated close to the action in amsterdam within walking distance to the anne frank house streets and other activities the decor is modern and colorful while paying tribute to being dutch high end finishes particularly in the bathroom amazing shower with marble being set in an old canal house is particularly fun each room has a plaque that tells you about the history of the house great bar as well would highly recommend,1.0
spent two nights in the house with eight friends we were met in the reception of the hotel the receptionist then showed around the house very polite and efficient the house is immaculate and very spacious we were even supplied with tea coffee bread etc it takes about to walk into the city but staying in accommodation like this and the weather sunny and hot all weekend made it certainly recommend staying in the hotel house fantastic house staff,1.0

i seldom post an unfavourable review preferring to deal directly with the restaurant or hotel reference saturday we had occasion to overnight in dublin checked my favourite websites and for last minute price and location hotel seemed to fit the bill central and at very cheap indeed for dublin in july arrival our reservation made and paid for a few hours earlier was confirmed but we were asked for euros cash as a deposit for any room damage well travelled at years of age we were astonished at this request indicating that we were reluctant to stay at an establishment where the guests obviously trashed or ransacked the were advised that it was unusual for the charge to be levied but it was the managers idea and the reception staff could not get the policy were however advised that had we used an alternative website to book there would have been no charge which mystified us were given vouchers for a free drink at the bar at at check inwhen we looked at them later they expired at the room was adequate but when i dropped an earring on the bathroom floor i gave up the search early on as the discovery of a less than clean floor left me feeling a little illthe final insult came at checkout when we were advised that there was a chargeof two euros per bag if we wishedtoleave our small overnight bag with them for a few hours we felt sorry for all,0.0
staying in this hotel for nights we were attending a match in the aviva location is perfect for the were very friendly our first night we did get woke by the fire are extremely comfortable other than the fire alarm we all slept have any meals in the hotel so i ca comment on the park nearby to go for a stroll,1.0
what an absolute top notch staff we wrapped up a two week trip at dublin westin with previous stops in paris westin vendome and maldives regis and could say enough good things about the hotel and staff first the location is as good as it gets next to trinity college and very short walk to temple bar area the great experience started long before our arrival when i received an email from tracy asking for our arrival details and if anything could be done to make our stay better once we arrived the girl checking us in did catch name after long flight could have been more polite and helpful we also received a very nice hand written note from maggie asst manager during our stay our stay at the westin could have been any better and would stay anywhere else on future trips to dublin,1.0

i knew from the minute i walked through the doors of this hotel that there was an issue you could sense the atmosphere amongst the staff now i booked a two night stay for four people some time ago they charged me for the privilege on may i asked if there was any chance i could have a check in instead of the normal they duly came back and said it should be a problem but they would see how things were on the day i arrived at from a cruise and spent the next six hours waiting on my room all with young children they kept saying come back in minutes every time we asked which was after and got all stroppy every time we did i accept that there is a check in just say that an early check in is not possible better still and i said this to reception why not ask housekeeping if they could make a family room a priority as there was a family with young children waiting all the while guests were arriving and getting their rooms early nobody told me that the bar was a building site banging and crashing all day and dust everywhere i would have booked if i had known they also saw fit to remove my spare room key that i had the audacity to leave in the room to leave the air con on shame on me so they just left me with one key the,0.0

this hotel was simply perfect i could not find a fault if i tried location was great just a short walk to the station and one stop into amsterdam central the hotel has been beautifully done up and had a gorgeous seating area with fire in the reception where you can check in and print off your boarding passes with ease at no cost the rooms were quiet comfortable and had everything you needed including iron hairdryer toiletries the staff were friendly helpful and made you feel instantly welcome,1.0
had a night stay in an exchange fabulous room given the style of the w it is not best suited for sharing with friends room was well appointed good amenities soundproofing interior exterior and use of property is spread out over two buildings across from each other exchange and bank the bank is more elegant with matching decor whilst the exchange is more loud and bright colours we had breakfast in day at the duchess bank and day at porter exchange the duchess has a limited buffet offering with most items available à la carte service somewhat poor porter has a wider buffet with a more mediterranean touch to it and excellent service and views with windows allowing sunshine in and an outside can rent a bike for w insider restaurant recommendation was quite,1.0
i had a very short stay here and it was appreciate that it is not downtown the train station is a minute walk it will take about minutes or so to get to down town or it is a minute walk to temple normally do not really like the soft beds however here i did not want to get out of it was cold enough and colder than a lot of hotels in europe thank amenities were nice gym set up with a good variety of equipment to get a good work out also have a set up which i did not was good not fantastic and reasonably service from all short great stay repeatable,1.0
this felt more like a business hotel but was perfect for my two nights three days of sightseeing the area is unusual in that it essentially residential and not that close to transport links there is a lot of graffiti around the area but it more street art than tagging and some was quite good my experience at reception was great the lady was very helpful and took the time to explain the best things to do in barcelona which i found very useful i upgraded to a junior suite at reception as it only an extra a night i did regret it as the room was large with separate sections a big spa style bath two tvs king size bed and most importantly a nespresso machine the only thing missing was a balcony being on the ninth floor it was very handy to the floor pool the view from the pool is stunning and goes right around so you can see sagrada familia in the distance i enjoyed sunbathing and reading my book there the pool was quite small however i got the breakfast which was if you book in advance but not great the meats were not high quality and scrambled eggs mushy although the parties were very fresh and there was a good selection of fruit for it ok the room was spacious and very clean plus you can turn the air con up and a great stay and i recommend upgrading to the junior suite,1.0

we stayed at the corner hotel for nights at the end of june we loved it the hotel is simply amazing modern and stylish great lobby with casual lounge area for relaxation and drinks nice roof top pool and sun deck the room was small but well equipped and comfortable lots of storage space and most comfortable bed i have ever slept in besides my own great location with close proximity to major friendly and helpful reception desk thanks to roger and lynn who could be more professional ans sweet giving us directions along with a helpful map ensuring we wo get lost in a city and facilitating in our every need i could go on but suffice it to say i was very pleased with our stay i hope to be back for a longer visit in the future,1.0
the hotel is nice and clean rooms are a good size and the beds are more like the english equivalent to a king sized rather than a double as advertised the location was brilliant a minute walk to casa batllo and la pedrera la rambla is around a minute walk,1.0
can not rate this hotel highly enough we arrived earlier than expected and was greeted with such warmth and professionalism and unexpectedly they checked us in early and with room far exceeded our expectation for comfort and space considering it a star hotel boasting large beds excellent bathroom facilities storage and dressing table we had views spanning from the sea gothic quarter placa de catalunya to montjïc the pool terrace was in the sun all day and the bar has the best sangria we had in our visit called us to barcelona on my business the location of the hotel and the pool facilities enabled me my wife and i to both enjoy some time together so nice to be able to use the pool and sunbathe on a break location wise it could not get any better as it is central to shops cultural attractions our favourite restaurants and bars and just one minute from the metro station whose line services all of the beach stations we will certainly stay at the hotel again if i had been checked into a room that was noisy as other reviews suggest i would have asked to move as our room was very facilities in room but the hotel is flanked by excellent coffee shops which we frequented for breakfast,1.0

the location right next to temple bar district and some of the main sights dublinia castle crhist church is perfect for for a dublin visit the staff is very helpful and rooms are spacious and tidy darkey kelly the pub with direct connection to the hotel is also great there is a lot of live music and a lot of locals to meet however the pub is a backdraft if you are looking for sleep on weekends make sure to get a room to the back of the building then,1.0
the bed was very comfortable and the room was nicely done in that style that popular nowadays plenty of hot water from the obligatory rain shower head staff were friendly and helpful too did have time to sample breakfast unfortunately so ca comment on that,1.0

returned to dublin for a quick business leisure trip and once again the intercontinental was a great place to stay the hotel is bright airy and spotless and is classy without ever being or uptight the rooms are lovely with great linens and toiletries wifi is good pool is great bar is small but good and the good weather meant we enjoyed drinks outside and the restaurant has recently revamped its breakfast offering which was already really good staff all seem friendly and open huge shout out to the lovely lady who greeted us for breakfast,1.0
we really enjoyed the mercer the rooms are but the staff is what makes this hotel unique and superb the breakfast was delicious and quite beautifully prepared each morning we had a couple of with the broken but overall a great location to wander around the gothic quarter from,1.0
casa fuster is ideally located for visiting bustling barcelona we had a very nice room with excellent beds seaparate bath and shower dressing the roof top bar is also very pleasant without noisy music the swimming pool is rather a refreshing large bath tub cm of water x on thursdays there is a pleasant jazz session in the large nice ballroom well attended by locals the rather unimpressive breakfast is served in the large well decorated cellar staff is very friendly,1.0
this is so central and easy to get round from close to stations and even easy to drive out of athens from here as it is on the main road down to the motorway staff very friendly breakfast ok but nothing to knock you out rooms we had were spacious and comfortable,1.0
pros level from all employees experienced that they did the little extra to make our stay as good and comfortable as possible cons costs to get quality,1.0
we thought the fitzwilliam belfast was great but their dublin hotel was even better not to throw shade on belfast dublin is just a bit more sophisticated i was traveling with my two sons so we had three rooms and each was different beautifully decorated with all the amenities you expect from a star accommodation but each room with their own personality if you will staff was top notch the bar had an amazing selection of whiskeys and the bartender was well versed in his craft the location was perfect central to attractions shopping and some great eateries i relieved that i did not book a place in the very busy and overcrowded temple bar area this location was busy but much less noise i will definitely return to dublin and to this hotel,1.0
stayed a week in this lovely tidy with great facilities hotel walked to the beach and restaurants our room was overlooking barceloneta it was magnificent paradise in summer highly recommended,1.0
this is a very nice hotel in a great location in athens with very friendly and helpful staff the rooms are quiet the bathrooms are perfect size the breakfast was excellent the pool bar has a fantastic view of the acropolis,1.0
first time staying in a wyndham have a generally good stay as expected from its reputation and was particularly impressed by the breakfast choices however had trouble with the front desk almost every time i tried to just get a quick information never got greeted nor the staff initiated or asked just kept doing their own thing although i did get the info when asked after waiting for what seemed to be a long while the location is good some very good or restaurants in the walking distance and subway station right across the roundabout on the other side,1.0
we stayed at banks mansion for two nights the hotel is all inclusive which is still was its location about minutes from rembrandtsplein and plenty of places to eat and staff will go out of their way if you need help getting to amsterdam many the bed was sooo definitely stay again,1.0
as location is ideal hotel staff is very friendly check in was painless check out was automatic room was clean had electric kettle and note they should have also water and some creamer for the coffee by the way room was small but adequate only thing was that i could hear the people in the room next to me and needed ear plugs the walls seem to be quite thin if you luck out and get loud you could be in trouble did not take breakfast as it was very pricey shower was actually a bathtub with a shower water pressure was on the weak side no robe provided bed was comfortable price reasonable worked fine,1.0
we stayed for three nights in a standard room on a basis on the receptionist said i can offer you an upgrade which would include free breakfasts and a canal view my first thought was that this offer was a free upgrade but it transpired that this was not the case at all and we would have to pay a not inconsiderable supplement for the privilege needless to say we declined her offer the room itself was excellent quite modern furnishings spotlessly clean with all necessary amenities there was no outside view but we did have a window overlooking the main atrium the hotel itself is very central and within easy walking distance of the central station shopping areas and museum quarter we only had one main meal in the hotel bar and this was also of excellent quality the staff were all unfailingly pleasant and eager to than the cost of breakfasts which we had to avoid as even a continental breakfast would have cost us almost euros we would thoroughly recommend this hotel as an ideal base in amsterdam,1.0
food service cleanliness is all top shelf centrally located it is on the outskirts of plaka the parthenon and just across the street from parliament also near by the national archaeological museum which is a must see as well as the metro which is across the street,1.0
my husband and myself visited amsterdam last week for the eighth time i had booked a room via when we arrived we were given the tiniest room imaginable it was atrocious i could walk past the safe without banging my legs and we could not get dressed at the same time no room at all i requested a room change and was told that nothing could be done until the next day fair enough we enjoyed our day stayed packed and the next day was moved to a lovely basement room overlooking the canal with loads of space the hotel is modern and quirky at the same time they are generous with teas and coffees in the room and the majority of the reception staff are great one in particular was awful and grumpy great location and not noisy at all highly recommend breakfast in the café directly opposite cant remember what its called,1.0
great hotel in a great location with superb service and excellent amenities can not say enough good things about this facility the complimentary breakfast was great with many choices staff was excellent and very personable all spoke excellent english would highly recommend this hotel to anyone,1.0
always try and stay here when we visit dublin as the apartments are bigger than a hotel room for the kids staff are always helpful and pleasant to deal with only downside is the joke of prices of temple bar we stayed just after coming into dublin airport from portugal and the service you receive there verses here is so different we paid double the difference in temple vs portugal rip of ireland at its best that why staying here balances out the difference thank you for a great stay and see you again,1.0
we booked our stay with and somewhere the information got lost we booked standard room with breakfast i need my coffee in the morning but the lady in the reception was telling us no she looked down at us the breakfast is keep that in mind even if you book it may not register and off course that not her fault but there is no need to make costumers feel ridiculous really what is when you pay a night so it not about the price but the way they carrying themself the room is clean but definitely not the room was well made and good condition but if the staff can not understand basic communication with customers then you are in great loss,0.0
rooms were basic good value and fitted our needs during our night stay in athens the pool was refreshing after a day of sightseeing in hot temperatures we enjoyed the rooftop bar and the lovely view from it location was good,1.0
we stayed here a few nights at the beginning and the end of our trip to greece overall very beautiful hotel right across from the parliament building we had drinks a few times at the rooftop lounge and we had amazing views of acropolis the doorman was the highlight of our stay helped us get a text in the middle of a huge protest and helped bring our bags several blocks due to the closed roads amazing fantastic service would totally stay again if i return to athens,1.0
one can not choose a better or grander hotel than bretagne located in the heart of athens the hospitality and service is the epitome of class and perfection the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms grand the rooftop dining with its panoramic view of the city and the acropolis adds romance and splendor to the experience the buffet breakfast is a feast for the palate and the senses offering choices high price one pays is worth the expense,1.0
a great hotel in a perfect location the hotel was a two minute walk to the main central station ideal for our travelling to schiphol airport and return hour trip to german travel was made easy with online booking via trainline our room was a reasonable size very clean with a view to the station and canals the room was very quite all with double glazed windows the staff was very friendly and spoke good english we did not eat at the hotel but rather experienced the many restaurants within walking distance shopping museums canal boat tours are all minutes walking distance from the hotel we would definitely stay at this hotel again,1.0
comfy and clean hotel in a terrific location block from la pedrera in the eixample very nice and helpful staff rooms are pleasant yes they are small but to be expected in europe and who needs a big room when you should be exploring the wonderful city of barcelona the bakery is a great feature we usually got breakfast there instead of the hotel buffet more selection almond and chocolate croissants mmmm,1.0
i stayed in room from june checking in it was already quite late at night i had issues with my credit card and the hotel night team leader checked me in anyway and helped me resolve the issue with the bank the next day i found that very thoughtful of them the hotel room was very spacious and i liked the decoration the spacious bathroom and the toiletries provided had an excellent verbena scent which i loved while it is quite a distance away from the city centre the hotel does provide free shuttle to the parliament house area which is close to where the main shopping area is athens flea market definitely take advantage of this free shuttle and shop to your heart content at the athens flea market it was a walk from the hotel to the acropolis which i did you can not visit athens and not hike up to the acropolis buffet breakfast at this hotel is lovely selection of food and i especially loved the rich chocolate log cake the hotel concierge also helped arrange a to islands hydra poros aegina for me on my last day of stay the only drawback was i was not issued a receipt after paying the hotel concierge for the trip and when i reached the cruise ship i was asked to pay again after disputing and the cruise operator calling the hotel i was finally allowed onboard was the last person to board so if you use this,1.0
we chose the fitzwilliam hotel for its location and we did not go wrong you could explore the entire city on foot there are tramway works going on in front of the hotel which did not bother us at all however please make sure you pick the room carefully more expensive rooms overlooking the park maybe exposed to noise we were perfectly happy with our quiet courtyard looking room superior room the room layout is modern and smartly done i would have just preferred some extra storage space a lot of space is taken by bar perhaps a little refurbishment one day would make it more what makes the big difference in this hotel is the service and kindness of the team from until concierge service was very efficient and proactive porters tried to anticipate any needs breakfast service was fast and impeccable breakfast as a whole i would say and prompt check in and check out people made you feel at home and went out of the way to give you advice approach you in your own language only negative i would have to warn against is the pricing policy their website advertises lower rates when booking in advance but in fact we should have waited and booked last minute prices in fact go down and by quite a lot since we stayed in june i had time to do check this for other dates and it was the same thing well when you get this through brokers you,1.0
we had a wonderful romantic stay at this hotel in the last night we made a reservation at the hotel restaurant that we had to cancel because our baby had fever so they brought the dinner to our room wonderfully arranged we enjoyed it with magic ancient view,1.0
big hotel but lacks character its good has good facilities better for business trips really its a taxi ride to anywhere but this is really a problem and fairly inexpensive quiet hotel decent overlooks park if lucky or river which is being refurbished and the builders start early july close to aviva stadium short walk comfortable nespresso coffee machines in rooms good sized rooms can not really fault it except a bit pricey so has breakfast around the corner which was very good value the staff were all very helpful and friendly in fact we found everyone in dublin to be friendly and helpful we were lucky enough to have very good weather,1.0
a very comfortable stay we had there nice specious room look for their suite rooms good location warm staff they packed our entire groups breakfast since we were leaving early morning that i thought was a sweet gesture,1.0
we arrived two hours before check in and were offered an upgraded room straight away to compensate for the final week of upgrade works in the hotel reception staff extremely helpful in particular with regards to car parking under the hotel and how to access out of normal hours the parking was for the overnight stay there is a lift from the car park to the hotel just make sure to read the notices in the lift to check which floor to get off at we did not use the facilities as we had other commitments but both looked lovely our room was on the second floor lovely comfy bed immaculate no bath great nights sleep silent could not believe we were facing the corner of street upper so quiet plenty of taxis outside and other transport options available great location for sightseeing shopping nightlife etc will return here,1.0
beautiful hotel lovely location nice breakfast great buffet the hotel was not cleaning service in the room is not we had days no shower gel the other day we had no towels for two you can walk in and out nobody was talking,0.0
would definitely stay at this hotel again staff could not do enough for us really friendly and helpful great bar and restaurant loved the room really clean and comfortable with free location too,1.0
we changed our initial reservations from a hotel to try hotel ambassade as a smaller boutique hotel recommended by rick steves that will as one of the best decisions we made in wow it was a great experience located on one of the main canals with a great view of amsterdam historical architecture the location was close easy walking distance to quite a few attractions sites and shopping plus city transportation hubs food in the restaurant was the best we had in the city exceeded only by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff our room indeed all rooms as far as we could tell was spacious comfortable and beautifully appointed like most buildings of old amsterdam the layout is somewhat up down and stairwells are narrow and often circular so care is advised and proximity to the elevators is helpful what a great stay we shall return,1.0
we had a great stay at the hotel location is perfect nearly everywhere there is silence at the same time rooms clean if someone shakes a quiet room ask for peace from the were serviced daily we will recommend this zamawialismy co prawda dea oddzielne lozka a dostalismy jedno podwojne ale bylo duze i wysypialismy sie bez problemu,1.0
on first arriving you ca miss the general and continuous buzz of hotel guests lounging eating drinking talking and generally enjoying the public areas of the hotel artsy and funky this gem is right in the canal district centrally located they are very concerned about your comfort and offer extras like a breakfast bag you put your bag on your door and in the morning they provided basics like a banana oj yogurt and granola we had a canal view room and really enjoyed our stay it definitely has a shabby chic and super hip vibe,1.0
the hotel was a little difficult to find as we arrived by train and had to take two trams to reach our it also we had to pull our cases up a street to find the hotel entrance not noticeable from the end of the street the canal opposite had been drained and an underground car park was being constructed before putting back the water over the car park a very interesting piece of engineering we were not troubled by any noise but the crane movement provided interesting sight before breakfast very comfortable room the buffet breakfast provided a vast choice to accommodate every diet and quite the best i ever experienced hotel staff very helpful and suggested time bookings for those museums with long queues for entry they were right we would recommend this chain of hotels as the one in utrecht was just a good,1.0
my third stay at the w amsterdam great location and wonderful staff one of the bartenders on the rooftop cristiano sp was extremely friendly and attentive during my first stay i was traveling solo and it was nice to feel welcome he even recalled my name and drink when i visited a second time food at porter is excellent nice to have a grocery store in the building i look forward to my forth visit,1.0
we stayed at the hera twice at the beginning and end of our stay in greece in june initially we were so tired from the long flight it was a wise choice to have allowed an extra day rooms are small but well furnished comfortable clean beds and a nice view on the upper floors facing the street front the breakfast buffet included foods we have at home with local sausages bread and fresh yogurt and staff is friendly and helpful even after we blew a breaker with a power strip plugged into an adapter they also arranged a taxi to the airport both times we had to leave and made sure our second stay was at an upper floor with a balcony street roof garden restaurant was also amazing see the separate review,1.0
the room was clean comfortable with a good shower good pressure and hot water the breakfast buffet was varied and good the staff was friendly and helpful we were able to leave our luggage in a luggage room in the lobby when we arrived early and our room was ready yet they also offered us breakfast that morning even though we had paid for it,1.0
stayed at the hotel in the parnell wing july and must say that i really liked it here it was a walk to the parnell wing but worth the walk as it is quite new and wonderfully quiet for sleeping the rooms are clean and well appointed the check in was quick and easy with a lovely friendly staff i would encourage anyone to stay here as the hop on hop off bus stops practically at the door and it is within walking distance of all sights yet slightly away from the rowdy pubs of downtown the hotel bar and lounge are very nice as well,1.0
stayed at trinity city while in town for gig at croke park for only one night wish it had been more a slight mix up regarding payment at checkin that was dealt with swiftly and we were off to our room very nice indeed stylish well decorated with everything you need the most comfortable nights sleep we have ever had in a hotel we have noted the make of pillows and mattress and will be purchasing ourselves we sat out in the courtyard for lunch with the gargoyles and crocodiles in the sun delicious steak sandwich and beef burger the décor throughout the hotel is very quirky and fun animal statues huge mirrors chez lounges a piano beautiful fireplaces etc breakfast is spot on too buffet style but plenty of choice and very tasty poached or fried eggs need to be ordered on checkout we left our bags with phil the concierge a very charming and warming chap full of knowledge and jokes only a walk to grafton street dawson street and temple go to dublin as much as time allows and know for sure this will be our base every time from now on a jewel in the capital of the emerald isle,1.0
as i visit amsterdam on a regular basis i always stay in the swissotel the hotel go above beyond to cater for you as a member of the swissotel club the bookings are always quick i just ring up give my name my information comes up all the time transfer from the airport can be arranged if needed i always picked up by a nice driver waiting at the arrivals gate with your name on a card so your can not get lost the driver always has refreshments available in the car when you arrive at the hotel staff always friendly always ready to help i stay in city view suite which has a great view of dam square rooms are nice big airy with plenty of light coming in the suite consists of a living room a separate sleeping area the glass bathroom is really really nice hotel always leaves little gifts that always nice to see ever since i found this hotel ago i never stayed anywhere else i visit amsterdam times a year overall i would recommend the swissotel to anyone perfect location perfect staff,1.0
this hotel has an excellent staff always willing to satisfy and help guests the booking process was easy with excellent communication with the reservation is very good but on busy and noisy had connecting rooms a standard with king bed and a superior room with twins the standard is smaller does have bathtub nespresso machine and has only a small rooms are adecuate clean and modern pretty plain decor lacking of caracter and some amenities as robes speakers or docks to listen music there was an input panel with some instructions to connect the celular with the tv but connections did work we found the rooms uninviting and cold for hanging out or spending some time resting there for worst windows are locked so the feeling is quite musty view from the room was quite is also adecuate but with limited space to use small for good good lighting and a medium sized tv the complementary frigobar has beer orange juice coke zero potato chip bag and a tube of is average overcooked barely warm scrambled eggs cold pancakes and repetitive choices we asked one morning eggs and pancakes from the menu to avoid eating the cold overcooked ones and the server took them from the buffet instead of making new ones so we ended up skipping breakfast of the mornings we stayed there it available till hr we had room service in many opportunities which was good we also had lunch at city restaurant and drinks at the roof,1.0
everything was better than expected nice surroundings nice pool good breakfast and nice rooms the beaches are nearby glyfada center with nice shopping good restaurants and cafees are five minutes away the tram takes you to downtown aten,1.0
very convenient and clean with great location rooms are nice but small upper floors are very noisy since the rooftop point a bar opened if they turned the volume down a bit problem would be solved food in atrium greek bistro and elsewhere in hotel is excellent,1.0
when you look online you see so many different properties and it is hard to tell what is what but this place is amazing first of all it is close to everything very close it is right beside the river and the room was huge comfy bed gigantic bathroom with two sinks and both tub and shower this bathroom was bigger than my college apartment then the lounge was so stylish and comfortable and the food and drinks were great breakfast was large and all encompassing and the person running the front of the restaurant i think her name was savannah had a bubbly personality and stayed cool under pressure she was very impressive overall a great stay highly recommended,1.0
i stayed here for nights and loved the location and the vibe of the rooms were lovely and modern with an amazing waterfall rooftop pool and terrace was an added bonus as was the funky bar in the basement with live also a great bar next door too which had live flamenco one loved my stay and the warm welcome from staff,1.0
this is my first time staying outside of centraal so i was a little weary about it but it was so so much easier than i imagined we originally got a taxi to the airport once we landed which was quite cheap between the of us but on the way back once we had figured out the trains and it was so easy this hotel is literally stop from centraal and takes about minutes you can also get a pass for however long you there to hotel itself was so nice although we were gutted we did get a fancy graffiti room it was really modern and clean there was a modern kitchen fridge sitting area tv and two double beds i was confused when i knew our toilet was in our room but it was literally outside the door and so easy to hotel is great value for money and i definitely stay there again,1.0
this hotel is just off placa universidad and is a few mins walk from where the aerobus to and from the airport drops you off and collects which is really helpful there is also a metro close by which i recommend using during your stay not a good connection to the airport though maybe an easy min walk to la room was clean and quiet the air con was actually really good comfortable bed the mini bar was pretty good value especially compared to any of the shops only spanish tv channels and no facilities selection was small but everything that was there was fresh and also have a front desk and a really good luggage drop off option i would recommend this hotel as a practical and reliable place to stay with friendly staff no luxury but perfectly comfortable,1.0
only mins to llacuna station which will take you to the gothic quarter mins to glories to get anywhere else min walk to rambla de poblenou the family friendly las staff were friendly and always said hello the room was good there was a bit of noise from the neighbours but nothing too bad i experienced much worse all in all a great hotel do let the area put you off it as safe as the rest of barcelona stay attentive and you be fine,1.0
you would think being relatively close to a hotel would make this place business focused the wifi is practically useless no matter what on you choose rooms are comfortable and spacious but a bottle of water would be nice massively over priced for what you get and neither breakfast nor parking is check out process is pure chaos queue skipping and staff making a phone call while dealing with you is not what you d expect at a of the lifts was out of order and the signage to guide you to the reception was bizzare to say the the approach to the hotel there is no clear signs at night to guide you to the hotle or the car park when you eventually find the car park it is not obvious which way you should go in or out of it small changes here would make a big difference,0.0
a great little hotel in an excellent location close to public transport a metro stop is only two minutes walk shopping and tourist attractions rooms are clean and well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful,1.0
my wife and i stayed here nights at the end of may we would stay again without hesitation we had a room overlooking the canal herengracht i suggest booking early at least to months in advance the choicest rooms go fast and the hotel books up get the breakfast package breakfast is ample delicious and so convenient to have in the hotel staff is friendly and helpful everyone speaks adequate to good english rooms were clean and very quiet curtains were doubled to provide adequate darkness the hotel is located within walking distance to nearly everything in the city museum plane is a minute walk along a street packed with boutiques art galleries cafes and antique shops the flower market is minutes around the corner after an afternoon of museums and shopping it was nice to enjoy any kind of refreshment at no additional charge and did i mention the hotel is close to everything so you can pop back to rest a bit and venture out again will stay here again,1.0
for our second family stay at the royal olympic the impressions were the same and have even worsened this hotel is a bit deceiving for a but with a perfect location in the city center of rooms are comfortable clean quiet and spacious the wifi is working correctly only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand despite the easy control system this was much of a problem for one night but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel beginning with the reception hall arriving at the royal olympic does feel like arriving at a we arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time similarly the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our snacks to come a bit later on i also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected this was corrected only after we noticed is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the acropolis and the city center there is plenty,1.0
rooms are clean small but all you need some small maintenance jobs required but the hotel is still worth going to the location is perfect the staff are very friendly and helpful and cleanliness impeccable the decor is very modern and nice close to a the beach restaurants and shopping all walking distance,1.0
dublin seems generally expensive so we choose travel lodge as a budget hotel dublin stephens green is more expensive than most tl but is better than most tl as we had a very nice and large room and bathroom it is very well located just off grafton street not far from the liffey and temple bar you can walk to most places mins maybe to the guinness store house and jamesons distillery for kilmainham prison you will probably need transport and be sure to book in advance,1.0
the location of this hostel is really convenient right next to a major train station there is also a large common area for lounging the rooms can be a bit difficult to handle with so many people assigned to one bathroom but it manageable,1.0
we have stayed a lot in this hotel i wrote some very positive reviews in the past we always had great stays here we liked the location being recognized as mrw platinum members and as regular guests but none of it this time frans the parking is the same steady factor in this hotel and almost the only reason we like to come back to this hotel looks like that with the renovations completed the service in this hotel is gone rooms are very sober now i like the dutch touches but there is not a proper closet anymore more colors all grey and white no warm feeling anymore time our stay was not a good one asked for extra towels in the evening they never came there was still water in the kettle from the guest before when i wanted to make a morning tea there was no shampoo airco did not funtion properly i was either to cold or you had to switch it off which was not a good idea during hot days when i wanted to write down my complaints i found out there was no notebook we were not recognized as platinum members no upgrades whatsoever it felt more like a downgrade a room next to the elevator with all the noises that it brings being on that location normally we like to have a drink in their executive lounge this time t was hard to find a seat or a table way to busy,0.0
what to say this hilton is a great place to spend your time in barcelona the location is perfect well connected both to the beach and to the city centre as my stay was a work stay i enjoyed breakfast and lunch buffe with an incredible mix of choices for any taste and the well known spanish flavours the top roof is also amazing so relaxing and staff professional and kind in any occasion top rate,1.0
the hotel is quite old but very clean it is set in the heart of the city and is opposite over the bridge to the temple bars lots and f bars and good things to do a great breakfast as much as you can eat for have live music every restaraunts which is open fronted so you can get into the swinging city while you eat,1.0
they have a fantastic assortment for breakfast in a spacious restaurant service is excellent with a special mention for karla who is courteous polite and proactive providing great service little gestures like remembering your birthday and giving you a glass of cava to celebrate the occasion good value,1.0
my husband and i spent our first two nights in ireland at the wynn hotel on lower abbey street in dublin the staff was wonderful the bed was comfortable and the full irish breakfast delicious it is a lovely old hotel in a perfect location with both a restaurant and bar no taxi is needed to get everywhere you would want to go close to trinity college and street shopping pubs and restaurants,1.0
we stayed at the hi for a couple of nights and were quite happy with our stay first off great location to everything downtown or any of the busses to take you wherever you want to go the staff was very friendly and accommodating we arrived super early in the morning but they were able to take our bags and store them for us while we explored breakfast was included which was a nice display of eggs meats breads and fruits the room itself was clean and spacious enough the only complaint i would have would be we were on the second floor and above the underneath so we could hear people and music well into the night but we would stay there again we would just ask to be in the opposite side of the hotel or on a higher floor,1.0
this is a terrific hotel gorgeous lobby and rooms with a location that can not be beat the staff checked us in with warm towels and cold water after a long drive which was an unexpected treat would definitely stay here again and i recommend it highly,1.0
i seldom write hotel review but occidental atenea mar hotel made me spend my precious time writing about how awful we felt when we stayed there we were planning to have lunch at the pool and did a bit of sunbathing we collected the towels from the lady at the pool counter and we sat down at two empty sunbeds spent a few minutes to undress and settle down our things there then the lady came to us and said sorry if you would like to stay on these sunbeds you would have to pay she showed us a menu as follow for using one for using one sunbed one for using one sunbed one drink one burger or if you prefer not to pay you can move to the beanbags area on the floor and that is free she said oh well we certainly were cheapskates and we decided to roll over to the floor without spending a cent we did even want to buy our lunch as planned we discussed and decided that we would never spend a further cent at this hotel and would never come back again i have been travelling around the world and this was the first time i felt shocked and humiliated at a hotel pool as a beachside resort hotel occidental atenea mar hotel failed to provide the most basic facility sunbeds how about the couches in the lobby shall they impose some charges as well i did dare to sit there,0.0
we have stayed here several times usually just or days to adjust to the time difference the location right across the street from christ church could be any better the staff has always been excellent we love the rooms and the breakfast we will always stay here when we come to dublin,1.0
stayed four nights in late june with two other the net we were looking for an inexpensive hotel in the heart of the city off a main road and this is what we found it fitted our criteria perfectly sure there were some issues i understand it has the slowest lift in europe the beds are so spongy you can roll off them and my toilet bowl was difficult to access refer photograph while dated the our room was a good size however one of our group was quite small the staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast room was adequate it beautifully located in a quirky pedestrian laneway right next door to a wonderful beer hall is directly opposite a cute cafe which serves a great lunch and could be closer to highly recommended restaurants within walking distance of central station even with luggage well we managed it,1.0
i specifically requested a quiet room when making booking the possibility of a newly refurbished room had a bad feeling when there was a snigger about the possibility of a newly refurbished as we were getting a mid summer madness deal but was guaranteed a quiet room which was crucial for our stay confirmed upon arrival yes we will have a quiet room lying awake the last half hour due to a delivery van with carpet clean outside our wide we awoke often throughout night with street noise was told parking was minutes walk but never told it was clerys carpark drove around in circles to find it have to spend another night here very unhappy never again on first floor restless sleep with important day ahead yes it is what it says mid summer madness,0.0
we booked the and enjoyed a luxury stay in a beautifully designed room as the reviews on tripadvisor and various other rating platforms show the new rembrandt suite is one of the most popular rooms at the exchange and it is indeed when you seen the normal size of a reasonably priced in amsterdam moreover it was amazingly quiet and peaceful at nights we stayed at warmoestraat before which is only a walk away where the noise was horrible there were really friendly and always helpful people at the reception desk considering the prices i would liked a nice breakfast being included but one can not have it all,1.0
stayed with two sons i made a mistake when booked only one room these rooms can not fit three and after a long trip we came from san francisco i was exhausted and very frustrated when found out that we do have a place to get some rest two guys at the front desk did such incredible job offered me an option to cancel at no cost despite hotel policy of hours no cancellation fee if i find another hotel as well as offered another room with a good discount i decided to stay and boy i did regret fantastic location with everything around the corner beach aquarium restaurants min walk to the old city taxi spot right by the hotel etc plenty of food choices nearby recommendation though breakfast at the hotel is pretty good i highly recommend to explore options nearby i recommend starting with mr robinson cocktails food min walk dinner a restaurant in the museum across the street is amazing if you like meat,1.0
loved this boutique hotel it is well located in barcelona and i was greeted very warmly by staff upon arrival the rooftop pool is also great to hang out at the only thing i had issues with is using the room phone to call the front it was intuitive to me otherwise it was a great stay,1.0
stayed at the merrion on the recommendation of a colleague who said it was the best hotel he ever stayed at after staying two nights i put in my own top this has a great location excellent staff sumptuous breakfast and overall of the charts experience highly recommend,1.0
we stayed at the wyndham during our stay in athens and found it to be a very comfortable hotel it has the feel of a large chain hotel and all the services and facilities that you would expect to find in a star hotel the lobby is a generous size with a big seating area where you can wait the rooms are modern and very spacious with excellent bathroom amenities the bed was a great size and very comfortable we found the room to be mostly clean and the facilities in the room were sufficient coffee machine and strong wifi rooftop is great and you can sit up there with amazing views of the city of problem with this hotel is the location it is close to the main square and is only about a ten minute walk at best however to get there you do need to walk through some ghetto like areas which can be frightening however you can get a taxi from the hotel for a very cheap rate which will help avoid the surrounding,1.0
the hotel is well located in amsterdam central from walking distance of amsterdam central station and tourist area small rooms but good for short stay reception staff is very friendly and helpful left luggage area will be great option to store your bags if you got to leave late very small bathroom and it seems designing issue from the beginning,1.0
great hotel and service for a long weekend in dublin to watch in concert one of the best hotel breakfast offerings i have experienced and dinner was also staff and comfortable well appointed room not cheap but competitive with other star dublin hotels recommended,1.0
spent nights at the astor which is located in the historic area for us just perfect as we like to walk and explore and we certainly did close to everything and offers guests breathtaking views of the parthenon and acropolis hill from its rooftop open area the rooms are modest very clean and are wonderful and helpful and speak perfect is on the rooftop menu is simple fresh food in the panoramic restaurant you can enjoy drinks and a bite to eat in the panoramic rooftop restaurant and open area for lunch and dinner great place to unwind after a hard day exploring and shopping mihali michael will look after your drink order and also guide you to what to see whilst in athens,1.0
my boyfriend and i enjoyed our stay at a this hotel staff are very nice close to city centre minutes away in a tram rooms are basic but all we needed was air con by bed and a was nice the gym looks good did use it there was table tennis snooker and football game in lounge,1.0
very good experience with our children excellent service to give plenty of references for visiting dublin comfortable rooms plenty of space and clean the swimming pool and the gym are perfect for starting an energetic day,1.0
hotel is in a very good location walking distance to many of the important places to see and things to do stephen green is right next door and is such a lovely place to wonder the hop on hop off bus stops right by the hotel there are a lot of hotels and around so you be spoilt for is friendly and efficient we had a room on the top floor which was nice and quiet windows can open which is becoming more and more rare in hotels nowadays so that was things like the toilet seat being broken and no hot water in the shower in the morning were great but the bathroom has both a bar and a separate shower which is nice and spacious beds were comfortable enough so i had a few good nights sleep which is always wifi no parking i do think a very nice stay in a great area and we come back,1.0
excellent location adjacent to aviva stadium minutes walk to rds hotel easily accessible by car surrounding area quiet and safe courteous helpful and friendly staff looked for an early check in and was very pleased when same was accommodated breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice a little disappointed with dinner had steak which was rather tough would have expected a more tender steak for the price charged overall a very pleasant stay at the hotel willandudno be back again,1.0
the hotel is clean and the staff is friendly the location is quiet but close enough to the attractions the bar area was busy almost every night we were there this was a nice added bonus the rooms were spacious for two people and had a safe for valuables there is a wonderful coffee shop just across the walkway,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay we are a family of and we were able to really relax here after traveling from the states the staff was very accommodating and kind the food was excellent as well we highly recommend this hotel,1.0
stayed there twice for nights on our european vacation found it very comfortable and the staff were helpful and pleasant i would really have liked to have tea and coffee facilities in the room swimming pool was lovely but was difficult to get a chair,1.0
i stayed here with my adult daughter and had a great time the hotel is ideally located we walked everywhere it is close to the beach but also close enough to walk into town the staff are very polite and helpful the room was clean and had everything except tea and coffee which i would have expected for stars the roof top bar was great and lovely to return back to after a day of exploring my only real complaint is that the bar could open earlier so you could get beach towels and a drink they missing a trick here as lots of people had obviously gone to a near by cafe also people had saved beds which is incredibly selfish in a hotel this big with such a small pool the hotel should be clear and strict about having a policy for this employ someone to keep an eye and remove towels when the person has not been there for half an hour some towels were there for well over an hour,1.0
our stay could have started better we arrived very early and were given drinks advice about where to visit and what to do in the city and local knowledge whilst a room was prepared for is in a nice residential area with lots of local cafes and restaurants just off pg de gracia which is the very upmarket shopping area there are metro stops for three different lines very close by and some bus routes go right by the hotel the city bus tours highly recommended to get an overall idea of the city also very close is easy to get anywhere from here and nice to hang out locally in the decor very smart and designer style as was our room which was quite spacious there is a nice terrace and a a decent local supermarket just over a block very friendly and very minor room malfunction was sorted literally within minutes which i think is always the sign of top class place,1.0
excellent staff who made our stay very memorable we received a very warm welcome everyone gave help and assistance and we thought our room was lovely actually all the common areas were gorgeous highly recommend this hotel for service and its location,1.0
just home from a weeks stay at this hotel it was my wife and i first trip to barcelona and the hotel was perfect clean tidy and in a great location we were a minute walk from the placa de catalunya from here you can walk onto the tourists buses the rambla gothic quarter as well as stroll around all the shops along the passeig de hotel has a small gym but perfect for a brief session to keep on top of the tapas diet we adopted for the week however the best asset the hotel has is the rooftop terrace with loungers dip pool and bar that serves snacks and a great stay highly recommend,1.0
we stayed here on a trip to amsterdam and loved it so much we changed our last night in amsterdam in order to stay here again the beds are comfortable the hotel overlooks the canal and within a short walk about minutes of the train station the breakfast is great they even had soy milk hard to find in many places the rooms are wonderful the staff go out of their way to be helpful we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in amsterdam,1.0
we were a group of friends in barcelona for the weekend and the hotel was ideal for what we needed the nearest metro station was around a minute walk and taxis also frequently passed the front of the hotel on the main road we used the rooftop pool late saturday morning and it was really chilled with some nice views of the surrounding areas the hotel allowed us to use the iron and ironing board on the saturday although we could on the friday as it was already is we got back to the uk we realised we left a pair of shorts in the bathroom and after emailing the hotel they helped us arrange delivery of the item to the uk if we return to barcelona we would definitely stay at the hotel again,1.0
stayed two nights very good furnished in old irish i would say england but i think they prefer irish style surrounded by a very nice park and friendly staff rooms are large clean and provide with very comfortable breakfast and high speed internet connection for free,1.0
great location for walking around staff was wonderful rooms are spacious and clean if booking in summer be aware there is no ac they do have fans and the windows open so did get too warm however we had a room facing christchurch and with the window is open we heard the church bells all night i highly recommend the hotel but if booking for the summer i recommend a room not facing the church,1.0
if you want a quiet hotel that is convenient for the city then casa is perfect the room was spacious and the shower was really strong the towels were changed everyday and the beds remade staff were very friendly and helpful we asked for an extra pillow one night to find out they did have any left and were told to ask again in the morning when we returned the following afternoon the maid had made up the beds with the extra pillow for hotel is right by amstel station that stops at various points in the city and goes all the way to central we never waited longer than or minutes for a train because they are so regular another plus is that you have to activate the lift with your keycard which stops any undesirables wandering about too the room came with a full size hairdryer not a useless wall mounted one like most hotels shampoo and shower gel were also provided as well as tea and coffee making facilities overall we had a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to amsterdam,1.0
outstanding hotel best location in athens i definitely stay here again in the future very large rooms with great views of the acropolis and the zeus temple it is from main shopping district and all kinds of restaurants the hotel was very friendly and helped set up travel to and from the airport for me and my family,1.0

loud music until am every night no accommodations made to help filter the noise light curtain on window no air conditioner no sound insulation whatsoever at one point in the night i wanted to stuff the single bed mattress covers and pillows against the window to block out the noise all they gave was ear plugs our adult children were traveling with us and enjoyed the club the first night however they had an early flight out the second night and did get any sleep even though their room was around the corner from the was a real issue as we were aware of the fact that we had to park several blocks away with a discounted staff is courteous and very friendly rooms are dated but adequate,0.0
the room was amazing the concierge was phenomenal the restaurants fantastic the location unimaginable walking distance to the anne frank museum the canal cruise is informative and entertaining with arnold the canal homes are beautiful and the showers are great they arrange great individual tours as well mike was great for the windmills and fishing village,1.0
we stayed here two nights the first night after arriving in athens for our honeymoon and the last night before we left anthens at the end of our first night we stayed in the acropolis view room on the floor this room was the worst room we stayed in during our honeymoon it was very very small did work no hot water and old bathroom not what you would expect from a star last night we stayed in a standard room on the fourth floor the room and bathroom were much more modern and front desk service was good however they obviously push restaurants they work with they charged us euros for a miniature pringles chip absurd we stayed in hotels in mykonos santorini crete and this hotel was disappointing compared to the breakfast offered was very limited and again the worst breakfast at a hotel we had while in the price i would recommend trying to a find a better hotel as in my opinion this hotel is not a star hotel,0.0
we visited today for afternoon tea got a fabulous table with a view of grafton street the staff were excellent the food and service were fantastic our waitress ecatrina not sure if spelling is correct was professional friendly and efficient she could not have done more for us had young daughter with me and she also loved it the fantastic service star service thank mc hugh,1.0
loved this hotel service is outstanding and decor in lobby and the room is top quality what worthy of mention too is the superb location minutes walk from most of the top sites in athens will definitely return to this hotel,1.0
strategic place to stay the hotel is in amsterdam city near to station shopping center clubbing etc just walk a step you find everything you need the services is excellence but unfortunately there is no lobby are for parking a car,1.0
my family stayed in adjoining rooms in july for a day stay in amsterdam we were excited by the central peaceful location overlooking a canal and glad to be welcomed warmly and recognized as hilton diamond members and the rooftop executive club was truly star and but we stay in hilton for their rooms and while the amsterdam hilton rooms were clean and beds comfortable the decor was a bit dark and dated the bathrooms average at best and a glitch with the the televisions had them turning on in the middle of the night disturbing sleep the opportunity of this property is amazing and a bit of investment would yield dividends i sure anyway i would recommend it as a good convenient clean safe stay just not what i expect of a great hilton property until they make some investments,1.0
stayed here for two nights for our wedding anniversary in july we were a little apprehensive as with what to expect due to the hotel name but it was a fantastic stay there were students families and businessmen all staying here and we all blended seamlessly staff at the front desk we young enthusiastic and welcoming we even received danish cookies on arrival we were on the floor and had amazing views room was well appointed and shower room was a nice size too with good water pressure we dined in the connecting restaurant the pool on one night and it was great food and attentive staff and only for we stayed in amsterdam central quite late on our second night we would have eaten in the pool a second really would love to stay here again and would recommend it to any and all ages,1.0

centrally located close to every sightseeing spot sagarada parc guell las ramblas very clean staff very friendly available highly recommende for either families or couples and even a group of friends,1.0
lovely hotel in central athens with really friendly helpful staff the breakfast is great but we did eat in the restaurant for lunch or dinner the rooms and bathrooms are big and most have a balcony i think although if you looking for a view of the acropolis you need to request it our room was out the back of the hotel and looked onto an old disused building did bother us but might some people i guess there a stop for the sightseeing bus tour in the square right opposite the hotel and it a walk monastiraki station where you find a good little flea market and only another to plaka from there lots of lovely cafes and restaurants no pool and the gym is tiny but overall pretty good value for money and a really handy location,1.0
our stay at the ambassade hotel was the moment upon our arrival we were treated like staff at the hotel provided excellent service throughout our entire request we made was taken care of with total professionalism our bar and restaurant expierence were a bartenders and restaurant staff did everything to make experience highly recommend the ambassade hotel to everyone,1.0

we arrived in athens and stayed here for nights the rooms were very spacious and ideal for of us staying together the location of the hotel is excellent well placed for all the main attractions and nightlife a short taxi ride away the tour bus highly recommended stops just outside the hotel would definitely recommend staying here and would go back the next time we in athens,1.0
the different people at the reception were cut and dry did not like to give information not pleasant at all almost rude we arrived at pm extremely tired and were not welcomed by the person the hotel is old neglected walls and a horrible bathroom with a dirty white curtain in the shower breakfast with no bacon the safe did not work the pillows are hard i felt really bad there the only good thing was the location,0.0
the location of this hotel is perfect directly across from the port and right on the front step of the gothic quarter in addition to this though the hotel is beautifully presented and elegant we had a small room but it had lovely decor comfortable beds and a very spacious bathroom with bath and shower the hotel has an excellent rooftop bar and plunge pool to enjoy views of the port and barcelona waterfront we were also very impressed with the service particularly the friendly and professional staff and the complimentary bottle of cava that we received upon arrival it was a perfect stay in barcelona and we definitely return to duquesa again,1.0
the location may seem a little far away but this comes with a reward this place is absolutely quiet and you can get the best rest after a long day of walking amsterdam streets the beds are and the rooms do catch any external was good though not sure it was worth the unusual expensive price it has the advantage of being open until noon so one can fully recover after a wild night all in all i fully recommend this place,1.0
great location and cool vibe the hotel has managed to make a modern but comfortable and welcoming atmosphere greeted with cava local champagne upon arrival and invited to enjoy another complimentary beverage on the rooftop bar and we are off to a good start the staff was very nice our room was quite large and had a city view but was very quiet our friends had a balcony on the other side of the hotel with a view onto rooftop life and a peak of the shoreline extensive breakfast available loved the lobby lounging areas and books highly recommend,1.0
we stayed at this hotel and will never stay anywhere else in barcelona again service is beyond rooms are beautify and rooftop is to die for with only rooms this is genuinely a boutique hotel bliss,1.0
this was the second time my husband and i stayed at the hotel granvia nights in july and nights july we liked the hotel very much in but our time in barcelona was too short this year we decided to end our two week trip in northern spain and france at hotel granvia because it was our favorite hotel during our previous trip to spain hotel staff members were generally pleasant and professional i especially appreciated the young gentleman at the front desk who helped me get my laptop to connect with the hotel internet i will long remember the warm smiles of karen one of the staff at the breakfast and afternoon tea buffets she was very attentive to guests and i enjoyed talking with her briefly a couple of times when she was not too busy we enjoyed everything about this hotel very comfortable bed and room excellent breakfasts in a very nice area the terrace the computer and library area and the neighborhood the decor was very interesting and appropriate to the hotel history the location was ideal for us we could easily walk to many of the places we visited but the subway and airport bus were nearby when we needed them,1.0
this hotel was nice enough good location for the tram line and bus route from the airport hotel had decent enough standards what was exceptional though was being greeted by the man kevin what a character great banter and so helpful louise at the bar was also very kind and helpful in summary a good hotel made great by the people who work there,1.0
i took my year old nephew for five nights to barcelona and wanted a small boutique hotel in a good location this hotel was absolutely perfect from start to finish i forgot my tour guide and the wonderful concierge gave us a map and itinerary which was perfect,1.0
after days of being covered in sand on a beach i came into central barcelona for one night for a friend wedding which went on until am so i was in the room that much but gracias for the late check out i had to be near the placa catalunya for the wedding shuttle bus and this hotel is walk away it was also walk to the cheap and efficient and frequent every airport bus the staff were polite and helpful the modern room and bathroom facing onto a quiet lightwell rather than the busy rambla de canalettes was spotless the aircon and ceiling fan and safe were all in perfect working order upon returning to the hotel at i admit to having more than a snack at their generous snack bar which is more like a full buffet i slept through the official breakfast but indulged in the snack bar again while sitting on their secluded courtyard terrace for me this hotel was great value for money the only thing i did like was eating off of paper plates with plastic cutlery but i am not going to let that put me off of booking this place again for a city centre visit oh security is really good too book this hotel,1.0
what an amazing hotel if you are contemplating whether to book just do it the hotel is fabulous from check in to check out the staff can not do enough for you they ensure your stay is relaxed comfortable you have everything you hotel decor is contemporary very stylish we stayed in a executive room with a balcony it was well worth it the rooms are spacious have a balcony area where you can watch the bustling city the casa batllo was just across the road even though the hotel is on a busy road due to it being so central there is no noise at all the bed was so comfy the room was really clean fresh it felt like we were the first people to stay in there there are nice touches like chocolates on your pillow a complimentary bottle of sangria in the fridge the breakfast was great fresh fruit cereals hot food breads each day there was something special like a shot of beetroot carrot juice or a little salad the waiter or waitress would also bring round items for you to try which was a nice not hesitate book now,1.0
this was a very nice hotel for our group of people our process was efficient and friendly the room and bed were both comfortable the room provides a counter with television and desk area and a small closet there was a refrigerator with four bottles of water no charge the bathroom has a basin on a small counter with a variety of provided amenities toothbrush comb the has a glass door that covers only half of the opening so it was hard to keep water from running onto the floor during a shower the shower drained very slowly but the water pressure was strong and the temperature stayed consistent the free wifi service in the room and the lobby was strong and reliable we found only one electrical outlet in the room and one in the bathroom for charging electronics but we carry our own plug strip so it was no problem we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would be glad to return in the future,1.0
on arrival we were told where our room is up the lift and round the corner what was said is up the lift up half a set of stairs down half a set of stairs then up another set of stairs would like to be disabled in this hotel then when we did get to our room there was one set of stairs to the reception going that way would be much the room itself was standard double bed air con en suite however the bathroom stank as in like sewage it was as if the in the was not fitted the room had a window but outside that window about away was a window to another room the room also had a sharp rise randomly in the floor right where the bed was meaning it location of the hotel is right at the start of the red light district so good for stag groups etc but not glad i only stayed night but would rather next time spend extra money to go else where,0.0
my husband and i enjoyed our one night stay at this conveniently located hotel the rooms are spacious beds are comfortable and the organic breakfast is delicious highly recommendable for a short stay in beautiful amsterdam,1.0
we stayed here when we visit dublin to watch the hotel was very nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was excellent i would not have any problems with booking another stay at herbert park hotel also there are nice pubs and small restaurants near by perfect for a cold ale before bedtime,1.0
stayed here for a business trip very nice hotel with friendly staff good location for access into the city centre and elsewhere the only negative comments i have which are very minor are around the quality of the tv in the room poor picture and few channels less than freeview and the curtains which let in quite a bit of light around the edges early in the morning which meant i woke up earlier than i would have hoped,1.0
we stayed here on two occasions during our trip to greece both at the start and end of our trip the hotel was nothing too fancy and served the purposes we needed the hotel had which was essential during the temperatures the room had a small fridge that we could fit our water in which was also great the rooftop bar is nice and gives a view of the acropolis which is quite serene the breakfast is pretty standard for greece i did enjoy that they had a section with some greek breakfast foods such as the cheese pies and spinach pies we also took advantage of their laundry service which cost euro and allowed you to fill up a big garbage bag of clothes that were washed and returned the same day we did put anything delicate or special just essential items that we wanted the staff were friendly and helped us as much as they could the location was good nearby to all the main areas and sights my principal criticism would be the elevator it was ridiculously small and could fit all of us in it we stayed on the top floor so walking was an option in all we would probably stay here again if we came back to athens,1.0
a wonderful bakery downstairs at your fingertips everyday rooms are small but clean and adequate service is outstanding loved watching the bakers in the back making these delicious breads and sweets a truly unique place,1.0
we stayed here for nights as a family of children room was spacious kids slept on the sofa bed is very good and effective flat screen televisions on the wall infront of each bed mini bar available coffee machine only makes coffee no kettle or tea making facilities available several sockets available for charging devices though no usb sockets bathroom has excellent lighting and storage for many toiletry bags jacuzzi jets in bath was an absolute treat shower bath is a in only received toiletries on arrival not again towels good quality face cloths not available in room bathroom drainage did work so well but maintenance took care of that very impressed with the safe where electrical devices can be locked up while charging a very well thought through idea breakfast was a same same every single day not even the slightest variation in dishes being served dissapointment with the two greek pastry dishes very basic and really did impress us at all basic juice filter coffee and tea available any other beverages to be charged though no signs mentioning this anywhere we loved walking in to his hotel after a long day and it always smelled so fresh and clean cleanliness is staff are well trained professional and all so friendly except for one terribly rude young waitress who screamed at me and made a big scene at breakfast about me politely questioning why i was charged for my cappuccino the previous morning a friendly explanation would have done,1.0
stayed here earlier this year with my wife and the room and facilities were wonderful the location was the best but the price made up for it and my wife loved the bathroom everything was clean and comfortable what more could you ask for,1.0
beautiful and different from many hotels as it has lots of character located in a stylish and relatively quiet spot but an easy walk to the city centre beautiful courtyard garden for enjoying the summer weather but unfortunately often full of smokers room was very quiet with unique canal house features and bathroom spacious and beautiful check in was very good pause bar and cafe lovely but service was at times slow breakfast in jansz restaurant simple but quite nice pulitzer bar full of character and good no iron or ironing board provided in room i consider this a basic provision no matter how glamorous it may be,1.0
this is a perfect business oriented hotel in the heart of athens service is always good and friendly i particularly liked the prepared envelope in front of my door at very good idea breakfast is phantastic and the location ideal thus strong recommendation,1.0
i stayed this past week at the ac hotel barcelona forum while in barcelona on business this is a great hotel the room was spacious and very clean with a great ocean view the outdoor pool and bar were great and the service was unbelievably great clio rousomoustakaki and her colleagues in guest services were incredible clio arranged great tours found tickets to visit segrada familia when there were none to be found and made several dinner reservations at the most fantastic restaurants five stars and thumbs up for this hotel i will definitely stay here again while visiting barcelona,1.0
this is a basic budget friendly hotel that was adequate for our needs what it lacked in accommodations was made up for by the wonderful staff that offered assistance directions etc the only problem was that we were offered only key card which wa a little inconvenient we were concerned about the area initially because of the graffiti on the nearby buildings but did encounter any problems it was located right across from the archaeological museum which to me was the best museum also was close to good restaurants roof top area has distant view of the acropolis,1.0
not much to add to my previous reviews great location friendly staff and the building has charm and you like your hotel to be ultra modern and corporate then it probably not the place for if you want a hotel which reflects something of the character of the city you are staying in then you will love room was a bit warm at times but that is a problem all over ireland and the where hot weather is the exception rather than the rule so we do tend to do air are a short walk from all the city centre attractions which makes it an ideal choice if you exploring on foot,1.0
this was the third time we have stayed at the regente this time we stayed for days in june and july we booked in september last year in order to secure superior room which has a large terrace and lots of room the staff were as always superb and could not do enough for guests a special thanks to sandra the reception manager all in all this was as expected another excellent stay at a well run hotel in the city centre an extra special thank you to silvia the hotel manager for again making our stay so enjoyable,1.0
located around kms from the centre this hotel is in a perfect location as it is not far from the metro station amsterdam centraal is just metro stations away around metres and at the same time it avoids the crowd and commotion of the centre i had a room in the floor which faced the small canal in front and i had a majestic view of the beautiful city through the wide glass covering the entire length of the wall of the room i had a very comfortable stay during my days at the hotel and the complementary breakfast was very good there is a restaurant and a bar on floor terrace and on the ground and floor service and food was really good the place is a little open so we get the breeze all the time there is albert heijn dutch supermarket chain at a distance of metres the neighbourhood itself is worth a walk there are a few quirky little hostels down the road some old houses decorated with flowers and big gardens along the same road the small canal in front of the hotel is surrounded by joggers path so one can walk and jog around like many of the locals in the area do,1.0
you know what they say location location location this is the central hotel in one word it is the perfect location to explore all plaka has to offer street restaurants shops acropolis temple of museums and yes the roof top bar is all its cracked up to be cool view cool cocktails cool service you can also sit inside the bar with ac and still get the great view the elevator the elevator i can live with the smallness people max load what had me pulling my hair out was the pace slow rooms were modern and had a recent update which included marble shower wood floors and new deco cool little hotel in an awesome location,1.0
i have previously stayed at the w amsterdam and had a less than a stellar stay i thoroughly thought about rebooking it when the time approached for our latest vacation but i happy that i did as there have been major improvements since our last visit check in there was a line at check in however it moved quite quickly and there was a friendly staff member socializing and asking if anyone wanted water or anything in line excellent customer service upon arriving at the check in desk we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded our new room was not ready however and the staff member let us know that they could text us when it was available i was a little wary about this since we were not contacted during our last stay but still provided our number she also let us know of the new additions to the w gym etc since our last visit when our room was ready the staff did promptly contact us and we were on our way room we had a wonderful room with a gorgeous view of the city as with usual w standards the room was very modern and beautiful it had the delicious smelling bliss amenities and interesting reading material as well location the w is very centrally located and it was easy to get to many places such as anne frank house or our canal cruise concierge we had exceptional service when asking for recommendations,1.0
our room was clean and appealing the bed was comfortable and the bathroom roomy for getting ready it was inconvenient to have to use your key in the elevator with all your bags and luggage but i guess that adds to the security of the hotel the location is close to the bus pick up point metro and on one of the most famous busy streets of barcelona we really did have any issues other than it would have been nice to have clean towels after a long day of exploring the city you could get them but you needed to trade your old ones in at the front desk on a daily basis,1.0
this is one of the best hotels i stayed in i chose this hotel for it proximity to the rds arena the hotel looks out on to a vibrant area which is busy during the day with office workers but very quiet at night there are amenities close but the hotel offers many services and will do their best to source what you need we were surprised to find how wonderful the staff were and how eager they were to help us with anything the spa was the icing of the cake as it was the perfect relaxation after our flight our room was bright and the bathroom was a great side and both were brilliantly furbished great mattress i would happily stay again,1.0
very good location for our first trip to amsterdam super easy to find your way to many attractions walking from here and just a quick walk to the main train bus station water taxis also here for trips farther out note that the concierge has tickets on hand to seemingly all of the major tourist venues which can save time and money fair amount of decent dining options nearby as well rooms are above average for europe though you can hear some street noise very good lounge for rewards members,1.0
if you want a fabulous amsterdam hotel on a beautiful canal with excellent service and accommodation you will be very pleased with the andaz we have been to amsterdam a number of times and have enjoyed each visit but the location and ambience of this hotel are very special between the atmosphere of the jordaan district the nine shopping streets and with a short walk to the old center of the city you could not ask for a better location wonderful buffet breakfast free wine in the library an incredible open concept bar lounge serving carefully made cocktails and comfortable although somewhat quirky rooms not a problem and a very helpful group of young staffers should put this property on the top of your list,1.0
we have had one of the most beautiful afternoon tea experiences in dublin we were offered a great selection of teas tasteful open sandwiches and decadent desserts the service is just top notch kudos to all the staff especially cormac our tea connoisseur and michelle our menu specialist who took great care of our table,1.0
we stayed here for one night the receptionists are amazing very friendly and helpful they confirmed our taxi transfer and we got an amazing early breakfast would definitely come the room is very clean and min walk to the best restaurants and shops,1.0

the hotel is a little far from downtown athens but it accessible by public transportation it a pretty little hotel with clean bathrooms and facilities with one exception they do not maintain their wifi when i checked in they warned me that if i needed to use the wifi in the evening i could sit in the lobby the desk attendant would mind but there was only one couch by the wifi on every floor was too slow to even check in for my flight so i had to sit in the lobby this was not well advertised and if you travel alone or care about using the internet i do not recommend it,1.0
like in many other industries lack of skills and improvisation do not bode well for hotel eur night without breakfast in line with some of the cheaper but real for the same dates is around the corner and bingo you would expect a proper hotel management not some type of experience in the evening reception closes and check in is delegated to a clueless nice night guardian who only speaks spanish and takes pictures of your passport with his mobile phone ops also he has no idea whatsoever of the hotel facility room features etc some work done to remove the persistent sewage odor from the hotel modest air conditioning in the room only works while you are in so when we arrived we were greeted by room temp of degrees how nice no minibar if you are thirsty during the night you have to convince the night guardian to sell you a no the usual low pressure water from shower icing on the they close the nice roof terrace small pool when they feel like it with no real reason very light rain in the morning of july it then stopped at lunch time and in the afternoon and weather turned to sunny spells at no chance to access the roof terrace when asked the receptionist said they keep lounge chairs covered with plastic to avoid them getting wet and he told me it reopens at manager discretion likely the next day likely furnishing a roof outdoor terrace with,0.0
we had a great experience with the amsterdam all of the people working at the hotel made our night stay a rousing success food at goldfinch brasserie was wonderful afternoon tea was beyond our imagination with many summer foods being showcased in an unusual twist rooms were bright clean and location is convenient to everything in central amsterdam,1.0
stayed here last month with friends for a nice weekend in i had night shift the previous day i asked in advance if it would be possible to check in at am once i came to the hotel my room was available and i could have some sleep already lisa escorted me to my room and in the nice chat we had i dropped that i would like to be awake around apparently i also told here i always turn of my alarm when i finished night shifts indeed i at lisa called to my room and asked how i slept and if i did turned of my alarm wauw thank you lisa for waking me up as well she left a kind note with chocolates in my room in the evening the girl from turn down came by and asked us if we need anything no everything was fine and she gave us this cute amenities for some rest before going to sleep everyone in the hotel was very friendly helpful and nothing was impossible would definitely stay here again,1.0
we stayed at numerous hotels in amsterdam over the past years including the ambassade in the early after a recent visit the first week of july i wonder why we stayed elsewhere this is truly a magical place and the magic begins once you make contact with some of the best staff anywhere they will not only advise you on the best room for your needs but they will also make reservations at restaurants and provide directions to wherever you plan to visit the ambassade is located along one of the most impressive canals and those rooms overlooking the herrengracht will indeed be rewarding our room overlooked the canal but was also quiet breakfasts are a combination of buffet items and hot items made to order at night this room becomes the brasserie featuring dishes with a french canal house hotels can indeed be musty and dark not the ambassade with its sparkling interior and comfortable furnishings a rarity here is an elevator to service some of the floors and rooms if you have mobility issue be sure to ask for a room near the walked frequently to a vibrant section of town called spui ask a local how to pronounce it and has many restaurants and charming squares and streets surprises abound here in ansterdam and the ambassade is one of them the location service quality of rooms and food make this our choice in amsterdam,1.0
i decided to stay at this hotel on my first trip to dublin knowing i was in for a real treat this hotel is located in the heart of the grand canal dock or silicone docks with facebook headquarters and other tech companies in the area but if that does interest you the square out front on the water is a gorgeous view for recharging shops are minutes away as well the room was luxurious spotless and has a nespresso machine for coffee fans the staff are very friendly and welcoming and will provide you with anything you forgot at home irish people have got to be one of the friendliest folk i know but i could be biased i used the spa which had everything you need the rooftop bar was closed due to an event but they served great cocktails at the main bar fantastic but not cheap worth a revisit,1.0
this is a fine hotel rooms are nice clean and efficient the decor is interesting with a general wine motif in the lobby and other public areas the courtyard is comfortable and pretty the breakfast area is comfortable as a place to sit hotel staff is helpful breakfast is wonderful fresh fruits pastries bread and rolls jams cheese and ham and of course coffee and tea a delicious way to start the day the pastries are left out in the lobby for the guests to munch on during the day the hotel is convenient to the rest of barcelona it is a short walk or minutes to placa catalunya and from there to the gothic quarter as well as la rambla there is a bus stop right outside the door and two subway stations about three blocks away lots of restaurants nearby,1.0
recently my wife and i spent nights in clayton hotel cardiff lane the location was superb a short walk from the shops on grafton street and with the bord gas theatre next door the staff were friendly and the food was excellent the chicken stir fry was something else no need to go anywhere else to eat in the evening we made full use of the clubvitae leisure facilities well the pool and sauna so we really enjoyed our short break,1.0
a surprising find in the attractive area of plaka the room was plain and a bit disappointing on entry however everything else more than compensated super friendly greeting on arrival plenty of helpful information terrific breakfast and the very enjoyable four hour happy hour buy one get one free at reasonable prices easy walking distance to ancient attractions a handy super market at the end of the street there are plenty of places to eat in the plaka and we particularly enjoyed the gyros at the takeaway directly opposite our street this hotel could make itself even better by paying attention to a few easy to fix details in the room for example having two coffee mugs when two people are staying instructions on using the safe ensuring the tv is tuned and working and extra pillows in the room these were quickly fixed when raised but i feel i should not have had to ask,1.0
the apartment was delightful we had room and that had a terrace which got the sun around lunch time to around ish if you wanted sun from the start of the day the sun terrace and plunge pool on the roof was a lovely place to read a book and get relief from the heat in the pool it was not at all busy when we were there in the first week of july the kitchen had all the pots pans cutlery and crockery you needed to make snacks and light meals with the two ring electric hob microwave and fridge with icebox for ice a tray of which was ready for us when we got there the layout of the apartment was good and it was spotlessly clean with cleaners visiting daily we could get to the local train station av tipidabo in a minute walk and it took minutes to get to the place catalunya it was so easy travelling around on the metro system with a day travel card the hour reception staff were friendly and efficient and very patient and good humoured while i practiced my beginner spanish tend to go to barcelona once a year and we would gladly go back to this establishment which suits us down to the ground,1.0
staying here at the moment been here nights regularly stay in hilton hotels and various other stars around the world booked the hilton as one of higher rated hotels in athens and thought it was a good bet that it would be a good hotel with excellent hilton service unfortunately it is very disappointing the building does look great from the outside and the lobby area is average at best it was my wife birthday and emailed ahead to see if they could do anything to make our stay more special and asked if it would be possible to get a nice room with a view unfortunately the room is on floor right outside the noisy ice machine dispenser asked to be moved but rooms offered had no view and were very dark they said they had arranged a cake for her birthday when i flagged that i was hoping for something in the room but i was sure if they were just saying they had arranged something when i asked about it i asked for it to be in the room at as we had to go for a mealat nothing turned up when we returned from our meal the cakes were in the room but after a course meal we could eat them we asked for the cakes to be taken away the next day as they had been there over night and it took over an hour to come and collect the room is ok apart from,1.0
i was in dublin for almost a month for business and decided to stay at the herbert because of it convenient location to be honest at first i was a bit concerned before arriving because some of the reviews were mediocre but i have to say i truly enjoyed my stay it a great hotel especially for a long stay when you spend this much time at a hotel you really get to know what they do well and what can be improved first the many positives about this hotel and friendly service this hotel service staff to include those at check in and the restaurant were simply outstanding helpful and knowledgeable about the city and sites to excellent location far from the maddening crowds a bit out of the crowded parts of the city but only a minute walk to all the main tourist spots also adjacent to a beautiful convenient informal lobby dining set up with comfy sofas and chairs perfect for the business traveler dining alone or with and spotless dining areas and restaurants all within a five minutes walknow for some areas for improvement and there were only a few that i saw a makeup mirror in the bathroom little more variety for the hot breakfast while there was always plenty of food i would suggest switching out the mcdonald style potatoes for real home guest bottom line i would highly recommend this hotel the employees take pride in this hotel and it shows,1.0

it literally walk from amsterdam central station mins walk from the tour both that you can buy all your attraction tickets at and mins walk to the start of where the streets of amsterdam come alive my room had an awesome view of the river and the city truely stunning if that is enough there is a sky lounge located in the roof that serves amazing cocktails to enjoy with the stunning views of the city as the sun sets great place to relax after a hard day regards to it was but expected given it a hilton hotel the staff were friendly and helpful attentive to me every need the only gripe i had was that i wanted a king bed and i thought i got one but they had pushed singles together and out a king sheet on it i was there for business so slept in the center exactly where the gap was and woke up the next day with a sore back in summary if you can afford it a great place for a couple to use as a base to explore the city that is equipped with a relaxing bar to chill out in if you want to relax at the end of a tiring day if seeing attractions my room had door access to an adorning room so defiantely an option for families too,1.0
this hotel is in a really good location ten minutes from placa catalunya and two minutes from casa balto it has very friendly staff we also had a very nice room with a good city view and a balcony with a table and chairs the room was very clean and nicely decorated the bathroom was also clean and had a toilet and large mirror and sink it was a good hotel for a good price and it easy to get everywhere there a hour supermarket round the corner if you need anything and nice cafes around the area it would be a five if it had had tea and coffee facilities in the room,1.0
great boutique hotel right in the heart of barcelona by las ramblas very busy area outside with loads of tourists but is a little oasis of calm inside nicely decorated rooms a bit small but typical size for a capital city still very pleasant we had one of the suites with the outside seating terrace which was great very cool air conditioners in rooms which allowed us to get a very nights good sleep when it was hot outside lovely for a romantic break close to the gothic quarter our favourite area parking was not too bad using the underground sabas underground car park just off catalunya plaza and only about from hotel expensive to park though really liked the chain of hotels,1.0
the hotel if located in gothic quarter just off la rambla street a quite busy street with tourists and party staff was quite welcoming at our arrival and helped explain everything in detail the hotel has hours reception desk they also provided sleeping cot for was quite simple no eggs or meat there were some corners in the bathroom that were a bit rusted so a bit eyesore but everything was working fine just a refurbishment is due,1.0
i could fault my stay at this hotel the best thing about it is the location you can walk to royal palace dam square red light district and lots of great cafes bars and places to eat and shop nearby there a tram stop right outside too which is easy to get to all the other sights the hotel itself is modern and very clean the room and en suite bathroom was great and bed was very comfy i a light sleeper but did get disturbed at all despite the location being so central could fault this hotel would highly recommend,1.0
hotel is of good standard and situated close to city center would recommend staying if you are looking for an overall good hotel we had a room facing the back which was very quiet parking is good and close in the next door multi storey car you are looking for something exciting this hotel is perhaps on the boring side of things,1.0
my boyfriend and i had a lovely stay at hotel eden staff were really friendly welcoming and helpful the room we stayed in was very clean and comfortable the facilities were great and we had everything we needed in the room would definitely stay here again,1.0
had a great stay at this hotel located away from the bustle yet very convenient to sights restaurants shopping and train spacious airy rooms nice bedding rooftop pool fantastic breakfast but most of all the nicest staff from front desk to waiters to front door everyone was friendly and oh so helpful just the best i highly recommend olivia balmes by the way although i had a floor room overlooking the front entrance the windows are soundproof did hear a thing,1.0
this is a truly warm wonderful place where the staff are excellent and treat you beautifully the location is excellent for walking around and seeing the sights the food in the restaurant is truly excellent it is like a wine vault i loved the atmosphere very warm and comfortable the food was great and they easily accommodated my vegan diet with a gourmet healthy meal we visited both bars and loved both it seems the parlor bar is open for as long as you would like to stay how great is that but we did stay long just liked knowing we could it is a very traditional place i thought the rooms were very comfortable and traditionally decorated the funny thing i noticed is that if you want to blow dry your hair or curl it in the bathroom it really is possible this is common in england and ireland it seems the only outlet usually only accommodates a man shaver i look forward to going back if you are looking for something hip and happening this may not be the choice for you if you are looking for star everything you will be pleased,1.0
my husband and i enjoyed our stay very much the hotel staff were very friendly the breakfast was excellent the location was a little out of the city centre for our liking this did not cause us a problem as there were taxis outside the hotel resonantly priced to transport us wherever we wished to go,1.0
wow from location to a free upgrade fantastic staff amazing rooms roof top pool and bar and one of the best breakfast you could ask for certainly going back to the serras when i next in barcelona,1.0
the staff is professional and is always a pleasure to stay pool area is truly an oasis after a long day in athens when stopping in athens we go have been staying from the year like the area because we can walk to glyfada where you can find restaurants and shopping,1.0
the hotel met our needs it located close to the dam square the red light district and the central breakfast was very reception staff was took a room in the fifth floor it was basic room and very small but it did bother us because we spent all our time outside but if you plan to stay more time in the hotel room you should ask for bigger room,1.0
my daughter and i spent nights at the ambassade hotel the service was unsurpassed everyone was friendly polite and helpful with questions about the city there is a lovely library off the lobby where one can have coffee tea or a cocktail any time of day we had tea every afternoon after a long day of sightseeing the breakfast buffet was great plan on having that at least once our room was small but overlooked the canal luxurious bedding and modern updated bathroom would go back in a heartbeat,1.0

my wife and i loved this hotel excellent location for exploring the heart of amsterdam canals shops restaurants the hotel itself is lovely probably the most peaceful and attractive lobby and bar i have ever visited if you love modern art specifically the cobra movement the hotel is filled with little treasures that make it a lovely place to recharge after a day of exploring the city will return the next time we come to amsterdam,1.0
i say castle because it really is more hotel than castle our room was not ready at and we were asked to come back hour and it would be we ate in the bar there at the hotel where the food was good albeit higher prices as any hotel our room had a small section of the existing castle wall in it which was nice but our window view was well a solid wall it is absolutely beautiful regardless and the service is unequalled we caught a cab to grafton street euro to go shopping this is a major wedding and wedding reception destination and there were weddings booked while we were there and it was no problem at all a beautiful place to stay but not the true castle experience i would have liked,1.0
we stayed at the hera hotel for nights in july and really enjoyed our experience the staff were very friendly and accommodating of our constant requests for ice the breakfast had tremendous selection and the roof top restaurant was very good we booked a room with a view of the acropolis and i highly recommend doing this if you can the location was perfect for access to the main attractions of athens and there are a couple of great coffee spots close to the hotel we very much enjoyed our time here,1.0
after a long flight from san francisco and jet lag that was making it hard to function we splurged on a lovely tea so we could rest and eat the staff is so lovely they allowed my children to make substitutions for their children tea you can also get a milkshake for the children or hot chocolate instead of tea the room is beautiful the hotel is beautifully appointed and as travelers it was an added bonus that the public bathrooms are great we loved our sandwiches and enjoyed eating mascarpone and jam on the scones even though the setting is very sophisticated the staff is down to earth and accommodating we loved it it expensive but was a fun and delicious splurge it is right by green so we enjoyed a walk through the park after our tea,1.0

we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,0.0

we had a long weekend holiday to amsterdam to we had booked inner amsterdam hotel after days of research and it was located in the museum quarter in amsterdam city i emailed them the night before our arrival to check the rooms i booked were together and to confirm our time of arrival to my horror they cancelled allegiance g the hotel was closed due to fire regulations they had relocated us to the blue tower hotel miles outside amsterdam apparently according to the cab driver who took us to our hotel this happens a lot hotels get late requests for parties willing to pay s premium and move people to other had not been happy about being relocated to a hotel i did book but blue tower turned out to be a great stay the staff were very helpful and the rooms had a panoramic view of the city it just been refurbished and the work is ongoing the european breakfast was also great and runs later in a sunday the location was a down side and tram needed into the city but on s positive the tram stops are a couple of minutes away on foot definitely consider buying tram tickets from the hotel for the days you staying rather than in s daily basis and you save money the only criticism of the hotel was the wifi in our room was terrible loads to do in amsterdam galleries canal trips to appreciate the beautiful architecture shipping and,1.0
excellent hotel for all ages close to metro and trams and places to eat we got the transportation card which gave us quick and unlimited metro use and tram use for a specific number of days not until the end of our trip did we realize we could have gotten that at the hotel it would be a good idea to specifically and individually not with other information give guests that information when checking in and then telling guests where to find other provided information helpful for their stay,1.0
overall hotel experience is very good this was our stay here the reason we keep coming back is the magnificent backery the great restaurants and bars just walking distance,1.0
my daughter and i spent days in athens the hotel is wonderfully situated in the makrigianni district behind the acropolis the room was spacious with a balcony and air conditioning which was a must due to the heatwave of up to degrees it stayed at the whole visit the breakfast was delicious with many choices and lots of fresh fruit the staff was incredibly helpful checking on church times and suggesting a nearby taverno for dinner the most remarkable experience of all was the staff member who contacted our taxi driver after we had left for the airport i had lost my camera and i felt it had dropped in the taxi the driver returned the camera to my hotel and they mailed it overnight to my next location on the island of corfu incredible in a city of million people kudos to the taxi driver and the hotel staff,1.0
i traveled many destinations and would not recommend this hotel the entry to the hotel is terrible the front desk staff is untrained and is able to answer simple questions if you want to sleep comfortably i would not recommend staying here if you require a strong internet signal in your room i would not stay here if you prefer a cool room i would not stay here when heading up to the roof top bar i nearly fell into the elevator as a vacuum cleaner was left unattended in the elevator the roof top bar had grown men playing football that made it impossible to go into the pool without getting hit in the head the manager of the front desk argued with us regarding the city tax even though our book it receipt showed paid he insisted it was our problem to resolve and that we should pay again the beds are horrible st best see below,0.0

we spent three amazing nights at the one barcelona from the that was absolutely flawless to the food and the rooftop pool and bar we could not have asked for more the bellmen are absolutely great with a genuine hospitality oriented attitude and extraordinary professionalism the room was comfortable and classy beyond words the bathroom is gigantic with great amenities the bed is incredibly comfortable and they add a special touch by bringing you the number of bottles of water that you need which is always appreciated with a degree temperature the spa and the pool are great while the gym albeit small is well equipped the only minor dislike i had was with the restaurant staff as i felt they were not at par with the rest of the hotel the hotel is walking distance to la pedrera and casa batlò my friend and i like to walk and we had no problem walking from the hotel to the port or la sagrada familia there are plenty of restaurants around and it a very safe neighborhood i would highly recommend to stay at this magnificent property you will not regret it as it is worth every penny,1.0
i stayed july to july in this hotel with my wife i have been a diamond member for the last years and stayed at numerous hotel in asia europe usa africa here are my bad experiences with the service amenities and ambiance of this hotel when arrived no one assisted us with the luggage wanted to check in at the ex lounge told ca and should check in the arrival counter the staff was rude not polite and when requested for a upgrade to a suite was told non available lousy executive lounge someone sleeping in the lounge like a homeless person during day time and the staff was totally unaware the breakfast at the lobby was the worst that i ever experienced ate only one day i was promised to a junior suite on the night but the staff was not aware fully what going on however i got the upgrade on the night but the quality of the suite was not worth mentioning the room amenities were minimum i set of toiletries for guests no mouth wash reluctant to provide extra drinking water when i asked to show the written benefits that the hotel provides to diamond member none was available the duty manager said she will send one to the room but never done when i changed rooms no one assisted us to move my wife got a trolley herself and we arranged moving rooms hotel ambiance is not suitable for a hilton hotel and more like,0.0

this hotel is bang in the centre of the city only yards from the train station rooms are quite small but clean and very comfortable the staff could not have been more helpful and courteous and the cocktails in the cocktail bar were impressive all in all i have no hesitation in recommending this as a good city try to get a room at the front of the hotel so not overlooked,1.0
just returned from a stay at the westbury in dublin from the moment we stepped out of the taxi we knew we had chosen the perfect hotel the hotel itself has a contemporary elegance that was unmatched by any other hotel we stayed in on our day vacation the guest rooms are beautifully appointed down to the glassware and the food in both restaurants was extraordinary i can not wait to go back,1.0
the staff of this hotel was hugely helpful kind and respectful i was there with a group and the team accommodated us and helped us every step of the way i would stay there again in a heartbeat no complaints whatsoever,1.0
a minute walk from the hotel covered all and more of the tourist spots we wanted to see on our day stay and most were closer than that the food was good and there were plenty of restaurants nearby the only negative in that context was the coffee at breakfast which was so thin and watery that we had breakfast elsewhere on the other mornings the dwarf jar doors along was excellent and even had freshly squeezed orange juice as a bonus being in temple bar meant the hotel octagon bar was mostly empty and a bit bleak not helped by the air conditioning on cool and the barman appearing a bit bored but a quiet bar could be an advantage with all the other noisy ones nearby still we would stay again,1.0
a really lovely quirky place with great service and a lovely breakfast quite pricey but they often do deals well designed quite eccentric and the rooms are perfect very cleverly laid out it in a great position hard to fault and genuine value for money considering the quality,1.0

we booked rooms for nights for various family members the hotel was everything we could wanted all of the staff were friendly and professional the breakfast was excellent plenty of choice the rooms were large and clean with plenty of facilities the hotel was in a quieter less touristy area of the city but the metro was at the end of the street and close links to all of the major attractions best bit was the rooftop bar which was a great place to have a late night drink,1.0
this beautiful hotel with a historic past was a great base for exploring amsterdam spotlessly clean with daily fresh towels and bedding changed every other day close to centraal station trams buses canal boat trips restaurant serves good food for lunch dinners nice clean pool in the basement with a gym and a spa did not use spa downside was the breakfast we booked the day before so paid each but it was lukewarm and not that great so we did have another one upside starbucks across the road and we had breakfast each morning for only in and helpful staff,1.0
the grand hotel central is everything a luxury boutique hotel should be elegant comfortable central but most importantly the staff is the absolute best we stayed nights the recommendations for restaurants and attractions were perfect we got home late o e night and my husband asked the front desk if the kitchen made flan they did not minutes later there was a knock on our door and flan was delivered there was a taxi strike in barcelona on the day we left we would have had to take our luggage and get to the airport by bus but pau at reception offered to pick us up on his day off and drive us there saul canal is charming helpful and warm and he made us feel like family mauro torres and leo were also just so very good to us there is no where else to stay in barcelona not to mention the most comfortable bed we ever slept in and the greatest rooftop pool and restaurant love love love this hotel,1.0

i never written a review before but this hotel deserves it we have just returned from wonderful nights at the estherea having found the hotel after research on trip the moment you walk through the door you realise this hotel is something special all the staff are friendly and attentive and simply ca do enough for you there is a real sense of opulence and luxury about the hotel and attention to detail in both the lobby and rooms is fantastic nothing was too much trouble and the room we travelled as a family of adults and a child was amazing the beds and pillows are so comfortable and greatly appreciated after a tiring day exploring the city everything you ever need is in the room from hairdryer to nespresso machine others have commented on the size of the bathroom but ours was very large with double sinks and mirrors and a large bath and shower our room faced the orange courtyard but was quiet and very hotel is superbly situated and although we planned to use the trans to get to places this was necessary as everything was within walking distance even central station is only fifteen minutes walk with cases we took breakfast every morning and again this was superb wonderfully fresh squeezed orange juice hot food buffet selection of breads and amazing fresh fruit and chilled cheese and meat selection yummy something fir everyone the restaurant staff were so polite and extremely helpful we loved our stay,1.0

we had a one night stay here before our cruise out of the barcelona port and we were so very pleased with our stay we booked a club level room and were more than satisfied with how large our room was and how quiet it was even though we were close to the elevators we really enjoyed the extra amenities that came with the club level room and would recommend the upgrade to anyone who stays here we stayed at a different hotel on our return from our cruise but were much more satisfied with the value of the crowne plaza hotel and will return to this hotel next year when we come back thank you for the best hotel experience of our trip crowne plaza barcelona,1.0

after a couple of great experiences at the clayton dublin airport hotel we decided to stay here in ballsbridge for a couple of nights our room was not quite as spacious as the ones we have had in dublin airport but almost everything else was spot on we enjoyed an excellent vegetarian meal in the bar the gym is very well set up and i enjoyed the virtual reality running machines the beds are super to other hotels the buffet breakfast is expensive especially if you are vegetarian but the hotel is located close to some excellent cafes where we went for a morning meal unfortunately none of these were open on the sunday morning and we circled back to the hotel where we found we could order off the menu i do know if many peolpe do this as there was a lot of confusion from our waiter the food was typical hotel breakfast food nothing bad nothing amazing other than that our experience was great and the staff in general are fantastic,1.0
stayed here for one night during a short trip to dublin good location just a short taxi journey from the city centre staff were kind and welcoming and the hotel itself is just stunning beautiful rooms which are immaculately kept and breakfast had everything you could ask for including yummie pancakes i only wish we could have stayed longer,1.0
we booked directly through the site as i have read then when you do the hotel gives you the crappiest room i asked for a high floor bot thinking we would get it but we got which is the last level before the most expensive room get the one facing the cathedral epic it was a great location and the jacuzzi pool was small but perfect for us we had it all to ourselves and it gives you the best view of the cathedral they can also bring you food and dribks to the other side of the spa i was excited when i saw salad roll it is hard to get salad and veggies when you eat out in barcelona a lot of salads come with fish or something like that anyways we only stayed too days before heading to rome and it was great we heard a ton of free music from up on the roof including the kind they play when they so the catalan circle dance opera and a bunch more great way to relax and watch life go by,1.0

brand new bed linen fluffy pillows new bathroom appliances an immaculate room and a healthy and fresh breakfast location is great if you like upscale neighborhoods shopping stores cafes restaurants all within walking distance,1.0
our initial encounter with this hotel was not what we had hoped for since they could find our booking we had booked through secret escapes it sorted itself out and we got a normal sized room for two we had however booked a larger room which we got the following day the staff was very helpful so there was nothing to complain about the hotel itself is absolutely fantastic very large and with nice clean spacious rooms the larger room we got was situated on the top floor maybe in what had once been the attic with exposed beams the bathroom was exceptionally large with a shower and a on to the breakfast buffet amazing a wide selection of food very fresh and nicely presented a lot of staff who made sure there was plenty of everything we never tried the restaurant for dinner but the bar offers some very nice i recommend this hotel definitely it wo be the cheapest option but in my opinion worth the extra money,1.0
stayed here for nights for my son and we got a large family room which was a good size doubles and really large bathroom hotel is in a good location and you can stroll into la ramblas beach front in no time we were out and about most of the time but did find time to chill at the roof top pool one afternoon and we used the roof top bar early evening which was comfortable good views breakfasts were very good with loads of choice and even though it was really busy it did have a canteen feel about it the bar staff were friendly and the receptionists were great especially as there was a taxi strike on the day we left and she gave us correct and precise directions to get a bus which we appreciated i would recommend this hotel and be aware that you pay deposit or is that just the brits,1.0

i had a lovely stay in this boutique hotel located in close proximity to the sagrada familia the room was lovely and clean and the staff so pleasant i would like to thank veronica at front desk for her professional and kind service i would definitely come back,1.0
having booked this hotel as part of a package and then looking at the reviews in detail we were very apprehensive before we went regarding the comments about being unsafe however we really loved our stay in hotel alba the hotel is in that it is a little tired in its decor in places however the room was of a very good size there was a fridge chairs suitcase stand and a comfy double bed the bathroom was also of a very good size everywhere was neat and clean the rooms were cleaned every day with new towels and new bedding every day which was unnecessary but lovely all the same the cleaners and reception staff were very friendly and helpful we even got a little present of turrón as we left the location is superb minutes from the metro liceu and from las ramblas yes this does make it loud outside at night but if you do the same amount of exploring and walking as us in the you will sleep regardless plus the room has great air conditioning that we did even open the windows or use the balcony even with the weather being yes the side street is probably used for certain indecent activities but this is spain and the streets even this one is busy at gone and there are plenty of people walking about the hotel is keycard access only and there was always a friendly smiley face at the desk to great you when,1.0
we recently traveled to ireland for a two week stay and spent nights in the brooks hotel the rooms and bathrooms were a nice size for a city hotel with space for toiletries and luggage all staff were pleasant and helpful especially helping us with information and timing for leaving for the airport for our departure back to the states they were even able to tell us how us customs worked at the dublin airport which was different than my previous trips to the and europe the breakfasts were i lovely great variety and quality i would return,1.0
we had been looking forward to a short stay in barcelona and picked this hotel due to the modernist architecture which did not disappoint however it was missing the touches you would expect in a good three star hotel and decent four star service was slow from waiting to be seated at breakfast to replacing faulty swipe cards and failure to replace pool towels for afternoon arrivals the worst evidence of the complete lack of focus on the customer was that despite reporting a faulty lock which allowed us to have interconnecting rooms with our children this was not fixed and we spent an uncomfortable night listening out to ensure they were ok this could be a great hotel but sadly just scrapes into the mediocre category we stayed in far better barcelona hotels it a miss and spend your euros elsewhere,0.0
saint george was recommended to us by our daughter and son in law from the time we entired your lobby we were greeted with warm smiles and courteous service after checking in front desk offered us coffees while we waited for our room small gesture but very thoughtful staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in recommending sites in athens but best of all was our evening dinner and the incredible view of athens and the acropolis by night also a special thank you to our waiter kosta for treating us like royalty looking forward to visiting saint george lycabettus and staff in the near future,1.0
one of the best hi express i have stayed at it centrally located is almost brand new with big rooms walking distance to major sights in the city center could ask for any more would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in dublin,1.0
probably the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip around greece not only was the entrance of the hotel hard to find but the rooms shown in the pictures look absolutely nothing like what a standard room at the stanley looks like the management informed us that those are only the specialty suites it was outdated small and not renovated but thankfully after enough complaining we were upgraded to a bigger room but with the same outdated features the pool and rooftop bar are also highly exaggerated based on the photos and even with a discount card for your first drinks everyone gets as a guest you are paying more for beers than at any of the surrounding restaurants the bed was pleasant and it was convenient to get to the city center with a metro station out front avoid the taxis if you can they are quite expensive and the drivers are very rude the star rating is not justified with this hotel it is closer to a hotel,0.0
i really loved this hotel the rooms were small but really fresh and modern as were the bathrooms lovely big windows in the rooms overall quiet and charming service was great too i would not hesitate to stay here again,1.0
we stayed at the dylan hotel for the staff is simply great kind and very friendly the rooms are greatly had the chance to enjoy the bar before concert and the drinks are very recommend this hotel,1.0
we loved this hotel it got a boutique feel and the location is very convenient for everything you wo get this type of hotel with decent sized doubles and good star facilities at this price in the centre we like being away from all the crazy light area action but it easy to get to if you want it recommend the happy bull restaurant for gourmet burgers etc which is just a minute stroll from the hotel we enjoyed hiring bikes at the hotel and cycling around and through the vondelpark to the museum district overall a very good location for a relaxing break for couples would definitively return,1.0
location staff room and the breakfast were great recommend to everybody beach is mins shops and restaurants are around the a lidl is near pool is very small but who cares if there is a great beach,1.0
the location was great it was right in the heart of the city it was in walking distance of many food and shopping places as well as attractions the outside breakfast view was amazing and i really liked the food options in the morning the only things i was disappointed about was our view and service we asked for a view facing the acropolis which i know is guaranteed but we got a view of construction and buildings it took away from the romance they also did acknowledge that it was our anniversary the staff were helpful if you asked questions but most did seem to go out of their way to see how we were except the awesome staff member yiannis who not only helped us with our luggage to our room but also spoke enough english to ask us how our trip was and what we had planned for the day we tipped him because of this and he was so grateful not even expecting a tip he is a staff member that deserves recognition the outdoor pool was nice and i liked the seats in the water the seats definitely filled up though so get out there early afternoon to get a seat the shower was also nice and spacious i would go back to this hotel but i would just make sure to get a view of the acropolis,1.0
great hotel for the money we payed large rooms which we thought was good for a capital city the staff where very polite and friendly well situated for temple bar decorated rooms and bathroom,1.0
very comfortable rooms with views overlooking the city if you arrive by train in centraal it an easy drag of your bags to the hotel metro trams boats tour buses all stop at centraal so it is easy to get wherever you going and most transportation heads to your hotel at night breakfast buffet is above average excellent rooftop bar starbucks on ground floor,1.0
we crossed path with emirates crew members at the ac marriott forum barcelona we asked them how their stay was they said that their stay was good worth we assume that our stay was good worth as long as they stay with us at same hotel emirates has good taste and right choice where crew members can enjoy and get good value we loved swimming pool and quiet bar on the rooftop of the hotel the hotel is located next to marbella beach and forum shopping mall including grocery store of course the hotel is ideal for families big minus is not reliable computer center where business center is located on ground floor at ac marriott forum barcelona there is forever problem with computers and internet however our stay was good worth anyway,1.0
very nice room we stayed on fourth floor hotel clean and staff very a good location with easy tram link to city centre got o amsterdam arena to see very easily on public had one very small gripe and i mean small would put me off staying again is that the breakfast options are too healthy after a night out in amsterdam some unhealthy fatty food is desirable,1.0
excellent hotel very clean and modern and great location around the corner from the catedral although the staff were very helpful on the front desk and breakfast staff attentive and quick the bar was slow with the waiter servicing the pool on the floor room service and the bar after waiting minutes for a drink i gave up there is a need for dedicated bar staff and other services not just the one guy,1.0
good location great breakfast nice pool very competent staff decor a bit dated and tired but the rooms were very clean good bathroom quiet and peaceful sleeping nice pool and restaurant the only criticism was the very ordinary food from room service,1.0
really nice hotel amazing decor we had a balcony view which you could see the sagrada famila and it was also very modern and clean security at the door which is a nice touch staff are helpful cristina in particular and friendly beds and pillows are super comfy bathroom is a little strange sink is separate from the bathroom the only downfall is the breakfast the options are brilliant if you like cake and cheese peppers and cold meats but we did there was virtually no fruit or hot options so that was our favourite at all other than that i enjoyed our stay here very much,1.0
what a great hotel staff was top notch location perfect and the hotel restaunts are michelin rated for a hotel is a nice walk along the canal to the museums and shopping there a whole bunch of local cafes and such around the hotel spa was booked but the pool was be back,1.0
i have been to athens many times through the years recently stayed at the electra metropolis and could not have been more pleased excellent hotel great walkable location right near shopping and sights staff was friendly and helpful room was modern and good roomy size the best part was the rooftop pool restaurant and bar what a view will be staying at this hotel the next time in athens,1.0
we stayed at this hotel for two nights with only one day to explore the hotel it was on first appearances very large and quite impersonal however the staff are very friendly and professional and the room was exceptionally well equipped large and cool we were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room you quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual smoked salmon freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals if you want a traditional english breakfast the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the where to eat at night if you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again you will see a sign for vassilios taverna it is worth a visit do be put off by the area the food there was very good and very reasonable rest on your first night if you are not sure where to exploring from the hotel we had a taxi to the acropolis at and it cost if you hold a student discount card nus extra use it most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about which was some saving we also used the tram back to the hotel and then back into,1.0
this is definitely not a hotel the only good thing about this hotel is the central room definitely needs some restauration some things are just broken in the stayed in hotels that looked,0.0
i was not happy with the lack of cleanliness for this hotel the cleaning staff did not change the sheets or pillow cases once in my night stay even when i pulled the sheets off the bed and put them on the floor with the dirty towels they were put right back on the bed each time the bathtub was moldy and would drain the water neither did the sink the elevators did not work much at all i ended using the stairs for fear i would get stuck our window view was of a dirty alley and brick wall the breakfast was decent enough i would not stay again at all,0.0
the hotel has a contemporary elegant aesthetic the foyer is designed with generous space includes a fire comfortable chairs a large refectory style table for sitting working the foyer flows into the bar area i was surprised by the time around that is hard after after an early arriving flight the staff were outstanding professional and so pleasant if you can get a room with balcony they are the best i loved the bathroom overall spaciousness of the high level rooms the breakfast buffet had everything there is a fabulous japanese restaurant directly across the road,1.0
we stayed one night here in advance of a ferry trip and found it well located and happy to have our dog poppy which is always in all hotels which profess themselves to be dog friendly our room was clean and had a good sized bed there was a bit of noise from their bar next door but this was to be expected on a saturday had to leave early so missed breakfast but the kitchen had arranged for a packed breakfast for us to take ate in the restaurant and were allowed to take our dog with were friendly and helpful,1.0
we booked this hotel at the last minute as our airbnb was cancelled we had two kids and needed a hotel that can accommodate two adults and two children the movenpick hotel was within easy walking distance from amsterdam centraal train station our room turned out to be two connecting rooms the kids loved their room the view from our room was wonderful we will definitely stay here again when we return to amsterdam,1.0
i did not have one good nights sleep at this hotel and i was there for nights for a work course the mattresses are tiny i had two single mattresses put together to make a double bed they caved in the middle meaning i could not sleep in a flat position i made a complaint to reception and housekeeping told me that the mattresses had not been zipped up properly i tried the newly zipped mattresses the next night and they still caved in the middle i asked to change rooms and they told me they were full despite there being clear room availability online it was quite stressful because seemed to want to help and apparently is its a known issue that people accept so i just turned the mattresses degrees so at least they would cave in the middle but they were too short for the bed which brought its own issues given that a hotel should be geared up to ensuring its guests get good sleep i rate this as terrible a couple of my colleagues had exactly the same issues as me and the hotel did resolve it for them either no one checked in on me and when i mentioned it again on check out my time by this point the receptionist just said it was too late to doing anything unbelievable hence this review i would hate anyone to have the same experience as me and i would never book a mercure the rooms,0.0
we just left from a night stay at the garbi millenne we was a little worried about our stay before we arrived after reading some of the reviews but we found our stay there to be very nice the communal areas of the hotel are very well kept and clean and the consierge at the front desk is always very happy and polite the room we stayed in was a nice double the air conditioning worked well and quiet enough for us not to notice while we slept having a fridge in the room is great with so many supermarkets on the door step it easy to re stock with water and snacks daily take your own coffee if you like a coffee to start the day although the cups provided with the kettle are very skipped breakfast at the hotel and tried a somewhere new every day the hotel is in a great location and all the tourist areas are easy to get to be only downside we had was that the bed was not very comfortable and to hard for us but it a hotel and only a short stay so did let it bother us over all we enjoyed our start barcelona and would be happy to book the garbi millenni again,1.0
stayed here twice now and both times have been rooms are nice enough clean decent size and have everything you vat house pub downstairs is a nice of the night type place to have or before you set off however the true beauty of the hotel lies in the location right in the heart of templebar making the night life only a short walk away in all returning to dublin this is definitely the first place i would look to book,1.0
we currently staying at this hotel there a sign on the door that says it about to change names to chic basic probably should thought about that name a little however the rooms are spotless kudos to the cleaning staff there hotel in general is very clean there are no kettles in the room which we already saw on trip advisor before arriving but there are tea and coffee making facilities by the lounge area all free of charge we did have the breakfast it euros which is steep in my opinion you can have an actual meal for at the places a few steps from the friendly and location a few minutes walk to las ramblas we hired bikes from a shop nearby so used that to get around not that we needed to great transport links nd places arguably walkable depending on how far you like to walk so pleased with this hotel,1.0
we arrived a bit early but the receptionist was very kind and after a few minutes allowed us early check in and with kids this really helped very friendly at no hassle gave us good directions and advice the room was huge very comfy beds clean aircon was working breakfast was good and freshly prepared people serving were very helpful and kind my kids enjoyed the jacuzzi bathroom is huge and the toiletries are fabulous nice hotel when travelling with kids the hotel is not directly near the main attractions such as the acropolis but this is what makes it more affordable and it only a minute drive from acropolis area we highly recommended this hotel for the mins drive to plaka,1.0

great location on canal i had canal side room about minutes from central station so close to station if want to take train or bus to attractive dutch towns like gouda but away from seedier area close to main train station lots of restaurants on spuistraat side of hotel also a fancy food place pretty walk along singel and cafes on singel canal on singel side can walk to a supermarket alfred heijn north to just south of dam square on nieuwezijds voorburgwal or walk south to koningsplein area amsterdam takes farther to walk than you might think because of the canals and while i could walk to some areas personally i found too far to walk to museums but can take a tram easily but i think no where in amsterdam can you walk to everything in walking distance of the leidseplein which is one of the party areas of amsterdam but not so close the noise bothers had been worried because heard so much about noise in amsterdam but not a problem i was on third floor fourth in north american terms on canal side aside from friday and saturday nights between pm and when some noise from canal boats going by quiet both inside and outside the hotel firm had a superior room and fine for one person but would be small for persons desk tv refrigerator but only one desk chair and one sitting footstool had twin beds so obviously for two people i used the,1.0

we had a wonderful stay at the herbert park with its main drawback for me being its location although it is a walkable distance away it probably about minutes from grafton street otherwise the room was clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful especially lara at reception,1.0
this is a basic budget friendly hotel that was adequate for our needs what it lacked in accommodations was made up for by the wonderful staff that offered assistance directions etc the only problem was that we were offered only key card which wa a little inconvenient we were concerned about the area initially because of the graffiti on the nearby buildings but did encounter any problems it was located right across from the archaeological museum which to me was the best museum also was close to good restaurants roof top area has distant view of the acropolis,1.0
we arrived here after touring ireland for a couple of weeks and it was the perfect place to end our vacation the level of service is like no other upon our early arrival they noticed the ages of our daughters and gave them their own room connecting to ours at no extra charge they basically received a king room to themselves it busy season too so this was an amazing gesture the last few days here have been filled with the same kindness and hospitality i wish i knew the name of the woman who cleans our room she is the sweetest person derek who we spoke with before our morning trip to the book of kells was another stand out in my mind so sweet like he known us forever i could go on and on the location is just perfect near the best shopping and away from that awful temple area trinity college is a short walk as are many of the sites that are popular with visitors there is a pretty little catholic church almost next door where you can go for mass or have a nice breakfast and coffee in absolute peaceful quiet there are of course many great restaurants and the hotel can make reservations at any hard to get into place it simply one of the best sad we have to leave tomorrow,1.0
stayed here on my first trip to amsterdam hotel vondel was a great choice clean and comfortable room not the largest and only a shower no bath if that concerns you the receptionist was super friendly and chatty checking me in quickly and showing me to my ate in the hotel as was too tired to venture far and again the waiter was friendly chatty and attentive there is loads of menu choice but the pork i had was tasty and not too badly to the main road and tram stay again,1.0

the hotel is in a very central location and staff was very friendly and than that i would not stay again it had a strange smell in corridors and in the bedroom our bedroom had a small window facing the wall so it was very dark bed was extremely uncomfortable breakfast was of a low quality lacking any fresh produce barcelona has got fantastic restaurants and cafes so do waste your breakfast here,0.0
this was a great place our room was on the floor and we had a view of the mediterranean and city the room was spacious and had all the amenities i did note in both hotels we stayed in that they did not supply face cloths in barcelona i do know what the reason is we were about a min walk from the pier so the location was good we had breakfast each morning which was excellent,1.0

we really enjoyed our stay at praktik vinoteca it was close to walk to a couple of the gaudi buildings as well as only a few blocks from the rambla streets there were lots of shops around they let us store our bags with them when we were there before checkin and made an effort to get us a room as soon as possible they welcomed us with a glass of wine and the whole hotel was nicely themed our only complaint was that our bed while comfortable was made up of two twin beds and at times we fall between the gap i never been to a hotel that did that before it just seems cheap when they put so much effort into the rest of the hotel,1.0
you get what you pay for in a good way here its good value rooms are basic but exactly what you need clean and nice staff the rooftop was excellent not too busy great bar and nice bar staff to spend the afternoon relaxing and having a few drinks free bottled water throughout is an excellent bonus good hotel and would def come back,1.0

situated in the heart of athens you close to all that you need the parthenon is a convenient minute walk and the parliamentary building is a short minute walk parks and other points of interest are also close by the room was well appointed and had a nice kitchenette area we stayed in this room with four people and found it to be comfortable but would be perfect for two looks as though the hotel is new there are many great dining and bar options all within the immediate vicinity no need to travel if you want to stay local lots of shopping can be done close by as well would stay here again if we come back to athens,1.0
stayed here for nights bed and breakfast the hotel is very modern and has a complimentary shuttle bus service into the centre of athens our bedroom was adequately equipped and the king size bed was very comfortable we were disappointed at breakfast in cafe zoe on both mornings because the hot food was actually either cold or just luke warm fortunately there was plenty on offer in the cold buffet section but we would have liked to have eaten a hot breakfast the staff in the restaurant were a little on the slow side to ask us what we wanted to drink my husband prefers coffee and i prefer tea however tea was provided as a jug of hot water and a tea bag with a small jug of milk the waitress asked my husband twice if he wanted a refill of coffee but declined to ask me if i wanted any more tea it seemed to be too much trouble for them to provide the had dinner in the rooftop restaurant the first night which had panoramic views of the parthenon lit up at night which was very nice however expect to pay extortionate price as this was fine dining,1.0
almost everything was good the desk and the room service was excellent i think the breakfast was over priced unless you wanted to gorge yourself we had breakfast at a little bar mar i the cetre ville plaza ham omelette toast coffee jam euro each salads were great deserts not so good tirimisu nothing like came out of freezer still frozen in not comment on the pool or fitness centre as we travelled from canada and we do not want to lounge next to a pool when the beach is mins away,1.0

great hotel only negatives were they lost a bag and failed to put it in the taxi or find it imagine the cleaners binned it and that the blinds did work other than that great food and rooftop bar would stay again,1.0
the hotel itself is ok however for the room needs to be rennovated old fashion wood and no breakfast included for this price most important not helpful staff at all even if i am gold member of best western in conclusion i dont recommend this place you have another hotel in front of dante time better than that please note the incompetent staff is the most important thing,0.0
we stayed here for one night the hotel is nice and room was nice and clean including bathroom they offer rooms for ppl which was perfect for us it very central within walking distance are many restaurants the acropolis and direct bus service to airport that runs every and through the night price is also good with tasty breakfast included after it possible to leave luggage in a large locker downstairs for for as long as you like there air conditioning even though it on a busy street our room was quiet when we kept the window closed we were on floor go to the floor to admire a view to the acropolis would definitely go again next time,1.0

radisson bue amsterdam is all about location location location the hotel itself might not be anything special however if you wan na stay in the center of the city this is the hotel you should choose you can easily walk to most places in the center in just rooms are large and well equipped with bathtub nespresso maschine and so on a nice feature is the minibar which actually has a dedicated shelf to your own cans and bottles i really like this since the minibar prices are quite expensive and there and there is a kiosk right opposite the hotel our stay included breakfast which was nice but nothing to write home about orange juice was served in small shots glasses which i reallly dont like why not just serve it in a normal glass would i stay here again i depends on the price to be honest we booked through amoma who had a good offer but otherwise the hotel seems quite expensive,1.0

very nice hotel great pool excellent breakfast service in restaurant is very good special mention to lidiya who is an excellent host and great ambassador for the hotel thanks for the great service we had a family room with a queen and twins this was perfect for us with adults and kids rooms are very quiet about mile from temple bar and st stephens green so be prepared to walk for mins to get to the center of hallways messy during daytime as cleaners clean the hallways are littered with cleaning carts vacuum cleaners dirty laundry would stay again,1.0
the reception staff were very helpful and friendly they were very approachable and gave good advice regarding amenities in the area i enjoyed staying in the room decor which was modern and tasteful breakfast menu was extensive including gluten free rolls we spent most of our time walking around barcelona and taking in the sights however our room was a safe haven of peacefulness from the crowds outside,1.0

we originally booked a two room but we got upgraded to a suite upon arrival the hotel was beautiful and it was in a great location right across the street from stephens green close to the buses within walking distance to the train station and a bus from the airport drops you around the corner from the hotel at a fee we arrived before check in time we were able to leave our bags at the front a helpful doorman pointed out places we could go to kill time until the room was ready and the concierge called when the room was ready the room was ready before the estimated time they contact you before you arrive to see if you have any special requests the staff was super friendly and helpful the room was nice clean and with a great view it had a tv small living room two beds bathroom with a shower and tub and toilet in a separate room with door the pool was nice there was a musician at the entrance all around this was a great place to stay,1.0
we spent one night at the arlington hotel bridge after arriving in dublin en route to westport we chose this hotel because of the location and it ended up being a great choice if you want to be close to the action in dublin this location ca be beat it north of the river so a tad quieter than being in the temple bar area but just as convenient for accessing restaurants pubs shopping and many tourist attractions from the airport the hotel is easily accessible from any of the city centre buses both the dublin bus and air coach stop on street just around the corner from the hotel although the stop is closer huge perk that we did even consider when booking is that this hotel has fantastic amenities of its own the hotel bar and restaurant are lively with live music in the evenings it is also the location of the celtic nights dinner and show which hotel guests can take in at a reduced rate we also took advantage of the hotel breakfast which was great as had a great stay and would definitely stay again when in dublin,1.0

the floor boards in the room were broken there was a bit of a funny smell there was free wifi it is located by public transport so getting in to the main part of town is easy the breakfast was not like you would get in canada or the usa ie it not like a continental breakfast i stayed here as part of a tour if i go back to amsterdam i will not stay here,0.0

we are currently staying at this it is a very nice property and we are on the club internet is pretty stable but the staff here at the hotel are friendly and helpful with good skills which helps with global travelers we are staying on the club level which includes snacks and drinks throughout the day in addition to private lounge computers etc definitely the way to go if staying well worth the extra money they have a good morning breakfast buffet on the floor rooftop restaurant by the pool the only major drawback to this hotel is its a bit distant from the typical tourist locations that we wanted to visit while in athens we made good use of the local transit system though leveraging trains taxis and buses with the locals,1.0
from the moment we arrived till the moment we left this hotel we were made to feel arrival we were offered for an additional cost a room upgrade for a night and i can honestly say that this made our break bigger room combined with the excellent views of the gaudi house from our balcony was a nice was very nice with a range of hot and cold options and you were really made to feel like you were in a star on reception was fantastic and dealt with all enquiries check in and check had a real passion and enthusiasm for her home was able to give excellent restaurants tips for us which gave us the chance to try what we thought was the best tapas in definitely recommend and will be back in the future,1.0

i visited the skylon at the weekend for lunch with family we were heading to a big game in town so the skylon is an obvious choice for lunch have been visiting the skylon for many years the food and service was always great however a number of months ago they decided to no longer provide a carvery option for lunch that in itself is not an issue as long as the kitchen and servers can work together efficiently to get orders taken and food delivered you may have seen on my previous review since the upgrade that the service and food was very disappointing overall we hoped for a better experience on sunday but it was to arrived at and met friends who had got there before us their lunch order took minutes to arrive the food was only warm not hot our lunch took minutes to be delivered we almost had to cancel it as it was simply taking too hard to know where the problem is because there are lots of people serving in the restaurant my guess is that the problem in the kitchen the fact is the food was taking far too long to be delivered to lots of tables not just mentioned the skylon is well located to capture trade from people attending games and concerts in croke park however they do seem to be aware of this and are certainly not taking advantage of our food eventually arrived it was fine certainly no,0.0
the staff make this hotel they are all just rooms ours was floor have great views we were over the marina stunning food was great and service well downside only one it was v expensive oh and the pool and spa on the top floor is a must,1.0

i just returned from a lovely stay of five nights in barcelona and all in all i very happy with my decision to stay at the gates diagonal hotel the design of the hotel is modern and minimalistic which is very appealing to me and even though there are signs of wear and tear in the rooms the overall cleanliness and state of the hotel is perfectly adequate my room was clean and very bright with windows offering magificent views of torre glóries agbar the air conditioning worked perfectly and a window could be opened for fresh air a most welcome but everso uncommon feature in hotels nowadays the design is very contemporary and attractive but certain details ie the shower are designed poorly without taking function into account it was impossible to use the shower without soaking the entire bathroom the hotel has a nice roof terrace with magnificent views of the surrounding area and also a small pool and i did not have any drinks food at the hotel checking in and out was quick efficient and friendly and all in all the stay was very the lifts however were somewhat dirty and extremely slow so i preferred using the stairs during my stay the location is in my opinion excellent glóries metrostation is just down the street which means that all parts of barcelona are easily accessed the area itself is somewhat lacking in character and charm but is safe and clean with good transportation options and,1.0
a hotel hidden away in a leafy wealthy dublin suburb but yet very central at the same time great access to the dart railway line that will take you to central dublin in minutes this hotel has a lot of old world charm splendid accommodation a great restaurant and also great bar food large secluded gardens with seating to while away a sunny afternoon with maybe several refreshments of your choice secure car parking and a lovely part of dublin derek a true dub,1.0

a very pleasant stay at the sandymount a little bit out of the city by foot but only minutes drive so luckily we hired a car for our stay the room was however a little warm and lacked air conditioning not many british hotels have though so that is the only negative thing i have to say the staff were all friendly and the hotel in general was very plush the morning buffet breakfast was very tasty indeed piping hot and often a very good selection of everything would stay at this hotel again in future,1.0
we had our lunch in this hotel last july pm after our civil wedding the hotel is gorgeous elegant and the staffs are very friendly especially the fello who is in charge to serve us in the restaurant the restaurant name is wilde the service is fantastic they looked after us really really enjoyed the food very well presented and tasty i had rib eye steak and the best steak ever they gave us a memorable experience and was so fully satisfied and thankful we booked there esp that day we got married,1.0
although the rooms are small it was a great location with a wonderful staff the hotel was in a great location it was close to the museums and the tram the breakfast that they offered i the morning was very nice you can order off of a menu or eat from the brunch area they had a wonderful assortment of beverages our room was on the third floor and was very quiet the halls and elevator were small but manageable,1.0
stayed here with a friend and we had a superior room which was nice because we each had a single bed the room was well stocked and included an nespresso machine which was great in the morning there was a lovely rooftop pool and bar as well as a gym staff was super helpful with any question we had location is also close to the diagonal metro station which connects to and lines easy to get anywhere in the city there was also a gallery market next door to the hotel on weekends,1.0
i think this hotel is too pricey for what it offers it is placed in a very dirty and crowded zone the rooms look old and need updating the room assigned to me smelled like someone had smoke in and it is a was extremely noisy the hotel and outside super noisy all the time i do understand the prices we pay compared to the quality of the experience it speciallymakes me wonder who works there and if they can be trusted as they do not have respect for the comfort of guests the sheets had little wholes in many places the floor was scratched a lot i sensed a really bad smell in the halls one of the receptionists was cranky and moody when people requested things that do match what he wants but are normal people requests i sense some entitlement here that needs them to be reminded of who paying i mean if they ask for so much money they should care about people and listening to them i do need rudeness or crankiness if i paying for a service if you do like your job please change it i insist that the price is too high,0.0
triple family room very spacious three full single beds which is a treat as many hotels provide a sofa bed for the third guest very clean good quiet nights rest left hotel too early to have breakfast in a quiet area with plenty of choice to eat and relax,1.0
thanks again to all the staff who took great care of us at the shelbourne hotel my wife and i had a wonderful stay chris at the front desk was extremely helpful in ensuring we were taken care of before our room was ready and this was much appreciated after a long flight also i like to recognize pawel in the saddle room for his phenomenal customer service and recommendations on within the city the room was clean and comfortable with many amenities i stayed at many hotels and a few star hotels through europe and the states and by far you all are number one in my book,1.0
whilst not in the most salubrious of locations the stanley is right for the price our spacious room was one of the refurbished rooms and it was very clean comfortable and quiet the front desk staff are efficient and very welcoming providing top notch personal service to all guests despite how many check ins they were dealing with commendable unfortunately i did really get the same vibe from the roof top bar of variety and choices in the buffet breakfast served in the sun filled livingston room and there seemed to be a greek barista on hand to personalise your coffee order so great start to the handy to the metro and there a bakery conveniently located on the corner downstairs if you looking for a clean economical hotel and not too fussed with location you ca go wrong with the stanley,1.0
we had a company conference few years back at this hilton double tree this time was passing by and decided to stay overnight at the hilton double tree amsterdam centre wow how the management has changed they are driven by text book service we ordered room service as we do signed for the food which arrived quiet late when we opened the tray the pizza was not what we ordered and naan bread missing with curry called the room served immediately the man was arrogant and abusive telling me we got the right food he will come and check and put it right about mins later called him again he was not going to do anything about it by now food had gone cold so we told him we have left all the food outside the room take it off the morning went to check out and the receptionist charged us for the room service which i challenged that we did not eat and have returned the food she said we had signed for it therefore we have to pay for it we should have complained last night and given the room service time to fix the issue hello listen to me i have just told you we waited mins for the room service to come back i spoke to another manager she seemed a bit sympathetic but that duty manager came out he was the same we will investigate the issue hello i am paying for something i did,0.0

we enjoyed our stay at the hotel the rooms were well air conditioned it was over degrees outside and the hotel staff was friendly the room itself was clean and adequate though not large the hotel is a walking distance to most sites and attraction to minute walk everywhere although during the very hot summer months it can be a tough walk the bus is very close by though the only disappointment i had was that the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was quite ugly where many walls and stores were covered with ugly graffiti,1.0
clean modern hotel steps from gothic quarter the staff provides very good service and the rooftop are lovely the food in the restaurant was of mixed quality but the view and the lovely breezes were worth it the location really ca be beat and for the price i felt the quality of the room and service were very good i would definitely stay again ps the pool is about knee deep i think it just for decoration and for guests to dip their feet at the bar no real pool there is a business center set up in the lobby as well a very large and comfortable lobby lounge area,1.0
i been staying here since june and have to say it brilliant kate and the team work hard to ensure that we are happy food is good value and well cooked taylor in the restaurant is super enthusiastic and always working hard shuttle bus to airport is handy have used other hotels around here this is the best by miles stars well done guys,1.0
stayed in various types of rooms in the doubletree if you can book an executive room they are the best and you have access to the executive lounge which is free breakfast and free snacks later on in the evening free unlimited alcohol wines and champagne so obviously that a great perk you can take up to room or just relax in the lounge the breakfast is like the main breakfast served outside the lounge but it was good enough for me the hotel is lovely and the service is great you receive a cookie when checking in and if there are any delays with your room they will leave something in the room for you usually a bottle of prosecco courtyard access room is good in the summer better than a balcony rooms are clean and maintained well sky lounge is the best place to relax during the day amazing view of amsterdam very chilled environment and good customer service bike hire is super cheap and it great to get around and explore apple mac in each room and in lobby free wifi throughout the hotel i recommend this hotel it suited for everyone families and couples there a wonderful restaurant and starbucks within the hotel i been so many times because it so good i going back in two weeks,1.0

this hotel was beautiful and most staff were kind and helpful breakfast was good setup at pool conducive to many relaxing areas and hammocks behind were a good napping spot we were on first floor so had a view of pool but kind of wish the beautiful sea was in sight as well maybe on other floors also wish coffee was available in room staff spoke at least some english relaxation was key here,1.0
upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and the appearance of the hotel was to very high standards the check in staff were very friendly and eager to help we had arrived far too early for our check in time which we were aware of anyway but they allowed us to leave our bags in a safe room until it was time to come back the hotel is located within about a minute walk from the city centre including countless bars restaurant and shops the room itself we could fault at all everything was clean tidy and very spacious the beds were comfy the bathroom was a nice size and it had everything we the last day of our visit we had a flight that would leave us hanging around for hours so after taking a walk to the shops we went into the hotel bar and took the weight of our feet for a couple of hours to which we were approached by derek who was very friendly and made us feel very welcome with being in the bar absolute pleasure to talk to and chat with the rest of the staff in the bar all seemed hands on and in all the clayton hotel on cardiff lane is definitely somewhere i would recommend someone to stay at it a modern classy hotel with everything you could possibly ask for in a hotel,1.0
fantastically thought out and appointed hotel for amsterdam tiny architecture and interior spaces the room was small but cleverly designed making it functional while cozy and comfortable reception bar and dining areas are well laid out connecting spaces and style successfully hotel staff are friendly lively and eager to please located close to central train station it an easy walk to hotel and central to everywhere else,1.0
after much thought my daughter and i decided to meet in athens greece for our first european vacation my daughter lives in south korea and i live in new jersey we thought it would be the perfect vacation we planned it for months and decided after much investigation to stay in the melia in athens greece our flight transfers and all of our plans went perfectly except for our choice of hotel there were many issues with this hotel the internet did not work well the room was not very clean the shower was moldy the blow dryer did work and when it was replaced we could use it in the bathroom we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it but that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced an electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet that what the management at the hotel said this worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open he said he had to check something n the basement this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by for more than five minutes i happened to return to the room to find that situation when i went to the management at the hotel they tried to tell me that the room was unattended when clearly it was the man who left,0.0
movenpick was a top hotel in a very convenient lkcation to end the long day of being a tourist in amsterdam helpful staff and it was very close to where we finshed our cruise would highly recommend it,1.0
my partner and i stayed here after much research at the end of june for my were disappointed from beginning to end the hotel was top customer service is second to the moment we arrived with a warm welcome and a glass of prosecco nothing was too much trouble the room itself was spacious light and airy and kept spotlessly clean on a daily basis on my birthday we even had a bottle of champagne left waiting for us in an ice bucket in the for making it a great up the great work,1.0
we arrived at the sir albert greeted by a glass of prosecco and warm and friendly welcome i had booked this as a special birthday treat for my partner and had emailed ahead asking for a bottle of bubbly and a small birthday cake to be put in the room the hotel topped this off with balloons and a birthday note the room was lovely and spacious for amsterdam and very high tec lots of buttons for lights etc but not too complicated for this technophobe the hotel is just outside of the centre but with a very interesting market a stone throw away i have to mention the staff who went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable any request was met with a positive and the breakfast here both the service and food are definitely above standard every choice under the sun including hot cold and even eggs benedict should you fancy it the sir albert also has it own restaurant which although we did try it was packed every night and looked lovely all in all a wonderful stay thank you and we will be back,1.0
booked this hotel for a last minute trip in december and throughly enjoyed the stay the staff were lovely helpful and very accommodating when we arrived i was disappointed to find that two twin beds were pushed together for my partner and i i had specifically booked a double bed through expedia however i called down to reception and they were eager to help and we were moved to a different room i really liked the design of this hotel especially as we travelled around christmas it was very comforting to arrive to the fire after a cold walk the bathrooms are lovely too with a fantastic shower i would also like to add that i could hear anyone in the surrounding rooms during our stay which made us feel at ease and more like home,1.0

whatever o b hotel staff and management has been doing they must keep doing it everyone was great and very helpful daily breakfast was very good the hotel location was close to everything it is true that there are a lot of graffiti in athens however we come from la and did not really bother us downside of our stay the tv was not working however we were too busy for the most part doing a lot of outdoor activities that we did not bother to have the hotel fix the problem we def will come back,1.0
we stayed nights in this hotel the hotel is just a few minutes walks from las ramblas the hotel room was quite small but clean and had a large bathroom the view from the window was another buildings wall but that did bother much as we did spend much time in the hotel room the rooftop was great with a small pool to dip into the sangria at the bar was excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,1.0
stayed here for one night and thankful it was only one night the rooms have no and our two rooms were so different although they were right next to each other on the same floor because we had to sleep with the windows open we heard a barking dog all night long since the back of the hotel backs to some backyards of a residential neighborhood the breakfast dining room was extremely warm as well to the point that unless you wearing shorts and a you are sweating,0.0
i have stayed at this hotel for nights i booked a room for single the room was unexpected you can not imagine how small it is with no view the breakfast was under the average limited swimming pool gym located in different hotel so if you wish to use them you to poor wifithe best thing hotel at the centre exactly is the shopping district so everything is walkable no need to take transportationalso metro close to the hotel about mins to reach,1.0

i stayed at the maldron smithfield for nights whilst working in dublin i thought the hotel was hugely over priced up to per night the sink was cracked very basic toiletries a squirty bottle of lux poor quality towels cheap tv walkers not a make i am familiar with very limited channels on the tv of them colby trouser press and iron with a completely worn out cover i thought the breakfast was very average and understaffed kept running out of stuff and having to ask for it to be staff were the one highlight they were very helpful and efficientfor the money paid i would expect an awful lot better i am glad work was paying as i would spend my own money to stay here,0.0

location and reaching there the hotel is situated opposite the artis zoo and near the amsterdam business school there are tram stops near the hotel but i used the connexxion airport shuttle takes around minutes and euros for return trip hotel it is essentially an old building it would have been interesting to have an insight into its for the hampshire manor is a converted hospital accessibility the hotel does have two elevators but none for reaching the reception desk from the street there are several steps and as a small individual i do tend to struggle with cases my room was on the same level as the reception but i had to negotiate another flight of steps room comfortable and exactly as in the photos i am not necessarily a fan of dark decor but it better than the manor red theme it overlooked a construction site which also meant that i had to leave the blinds closed when i was in the room the bed was twin not double but it was comfy you do tend to hear especially people talking on the corridor and noises from other bathrooms i could hear someone using an electric razor in the room tea and coffee facilities an electric fan heater under the window and a safe do note that the instructions in it may be different from those in the us there is free wifi but it is not particularly strong enough for example to make calls via whatsapp the,1.0
wow what a great you going to barcelona and would like to stay at what i would call centrally located hotel pick this hilton the staff was welcoming and helpful without coming across as being less than genuine special kudos to the server in the restaurant wish i could recall her name she was terrific she was the only dark hair female so she will be easy to service check staff also very good and host working the lounge also went out of her way to greet and make the hhdiamond members staying on the fourth floor feel taken care off the only minor problem occurred at the lounge when i tried to get a glass of cold water and all the cold drink holders were locked the lounge attendant called for the keys and a grumpy older gentleman came to unlock the fridges but not before complaining about how those fridges were locked at a certain time and then open much later he was quite loud about that to the point that the lounge hostess had to apologize for this persons lack of hiltons that i have stayed before usually have the fridges open for guests to get cold bottles of water or juice do see why this hilton locks the room was clean comfortable and the worked very well bottom line great place to stay,1.0

stayed at this gorgeous boutique hotel in temple bar dublin extremely helpful and friendly staff each time we went to reception they would ask if we were ok for directions to anywhere and very helpful for tourist information very convenient location to the night life in the temple bar area beautiful room although the mattresses could do with an upgrade as they were a bit uncomfortable but that was the only thing to find fault with in this lovely hotel very clean and modern decor and attached to oscars bar which was also lovely,1.0
i stayed at the petit palace barcelona for nights with people rooms and it was utter disappointment to start off you walk into the lobby and everything is very dark the furniture the walls and a lot of the decorations were either black or very dark which is not appealing for a hotel it gave a sort of muggy look and scary really the hotel rooms had a lot of issues such as doors not locking securely tvs not working and leaking from vents the maid service was also unacceptable after being out all day we stopped by our hotel room around and the room was still not done after calling the front desk they mentioned the maids were gone for the day and the best thing they could do was give us fresh towels just towels i thought that was unacceptable overall although the petit palace barcelona has a good location it does not compensate for the lack of service given to its pros about a walk to las ramblas and main area about a walk to the sagrada familia walk to two different train stations,0.0
the rooms are clean and comfortable our room was a little warm we could not control the air conditioning the elevator was a little scary as it bounced when it approached a stop they have a really nice breakfast which was not included in our reservation it is a person we bought it and we very pleased with it it had fruit pastries eggs cold cuts cheese it is far from the old town and most attractions we had to take the metro to get places it was bad to take the metro very easy the is two blocks down the street there are also lots of restaurants in the area most of the staff was friendly and helpful one or two were not,1.0

the hotel is located roughly min from the hotel in the financial looks very modern very lean and new located along the river only to min walk to sooo many pubs service was excellent check in was easy we landed in the morning but they held our bags until the room was available we had a room that overlooked the river it was descent could hear much traffic the room was fantastic beds were comfortable along with the pillows great sunsets from the higher only complaint was that we requested ice times and nothing was ever brought to the room we did eat at the restaurant but it looked very nice one night they had live music in the lobby area we only sat down there once for some drinks after wondering around all day we did have time to use the gym nor the pool area,1.0
we stayed at the divani palace in early july the room was clean not that large for two and a kid and a bit outdated the staff was helpful and friendly but very little english the rooftop restaurant was ok but street restaurant there much better a very short walk to the acropolis and the plaka the area seemed very safe and friendly overall we really liked the divani palace and would definitely stay there again,1.0

the hotel is located right off of the main street and the green hop on hop off bus is a two minute walk away even closer is the airport shuttle which is practically right outside the door of the rooms were fine although i have to say the tv placement in our room was very odd faced a wall and viewing from the bed was at a sharp angle all it would have taken was a bracket mounted on the wall to make the television accessible i mentioned it and i was probably not the only one to do so based on the reply about wiring i got not all rooms have this odd tv placement however and we did get a little bit more room than ones that were like a corridor our view was the shaft but we did not pick the hotel for the view but of course that would have been nicer with only one exception the staff were all polite and welcoming and responsive to any questions about the city we would stay there again,1.0
on our trip to bcn we had a fantastic experience here interesting how a hotel can have such wide ratings we never had a negative experience once there the location is fantastic steps away from what i believe are many of bcns best restaurants our room was modern sparkling clean and had a monster bathroom which is rare in europe the staff were helpful so many times and we stayed weeks with other friends who fully enjoyed it the restaurant was exceptional in the evening thou it hard to eat there more than once when there are so many options within min walk the breakfast was extensive the pool is small but has a great view of the city the pool area was always crowded so seats were had to get start with a in their tiny street patio before heading out each evening,1.0
it is a bit far from the city but close to metro and tram stations it will take you about minutes by tram to get to the city if you plan on doing day trips recommend delft if you have time by the way it is two metro stations away from zuid station and another one whose name i forget those are nicer stations than centraal to plan your day trips anyway the hotel itself is clean and the staff is professional breakfast is good though the same every day which i say if it is broke do fix it one very minor pet peeve with the place queen sized bed actually comes with two twin sized blankets on top so even with a queen bed you have enough continuous blanket for as if you were sleeping on a twin,1.0
overall this is a correct place to stay the location is perfect at about minutes walk to the rambla and the surronding is nice the night live is plaisant with many small palces to stop sit and enjoy a refresment peoples living there are nice to speak with and happy to help when required as i stated in my comments about the hotel rooms are small clean and the personel is excellent,1.0

for me walking into the ashling hotel is like walking into a country hotel you get that warm welcoming feeling its in a quieter part of the city beside huston station the general manager alen can be seen early in the morning welcoming his guests walking the property checking everything is set up for the days business ahead and greeting people as he goes the management team have their briefings and you can see they are happy in their work there is always great banter amongst them its a home from home with in the bar lounge area with the lovely couches and pleasant service is always friendly and polite and the team get to know their regulars the food is good with bar food restaurant available they have a great mix of business regulars individuals groups and corporate its a super location to meet friends or business people with the luas outside the door,1.0
i would like to leave a comment about your hotel i have to say that i am really disappointed we are the very first room in the hotel as soon as you come up the stairs for the reception i can hear every single conversation in the reception and doors slamming all night long it says in your website that we have air con and hair dryer that not true the air con if you need to adjust it you have to go to the reception and they would change for you during the night i was hot and then cold and i did want to go the the reception at in the morning to change my ac as you can imagine the hair dryer we have to go the the reception and get one that is shared with at least or other rooms there are no windows at all nothing was saying in your website about the absence of windows there is barely a door between the room and the toilet which is very uncomfortable the shower is awful the doors barely close is very small and some of the functions are not working the tv is literally so high almost on the sealing that if i am in bed i can not see anything i can already tell you it the first and the last time i will be staying in your hotel,0.0
we booked this hotel for nights for our anniversary owing to its spectacular reviews on tripadvisor and the stunning rooftop terrace it did not arrival we received a warm welcome from elena on reception elena informed me that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a nice gesture and very much appreciated she also changed our reservation at city restaurant as our flight had been delayed reviewed separately there are two elevators one solely for guest use opposite reception and one for guest and visitor use to the sky bar which is just right of the reception the other staff in reception seemed to leave us alone the executive room was very spacious with an enormous bed and a beautifully designed walk in shower and separate hand wash area sadly no bath a friendly welcome message regarding our anniversary was accompanied by a bottle of cava again a very welcome gesture the room was designed to a very high specification with black slate in the wash area and wood effect flooring in the sleeping area with lighting to give a relaxing ambience gilchrist soames shower products were also a nice addition having read reviews regarding noise i can say that we slept very well throughout our stay in room and was undisturbed through the night especially with the excellent air conditioning system complimentary refreshments water cola orange juice beer and crisps are provided daily from the in room fridge the cleaning team are the unsung heroes of,1.0
i made my booking via booking com we stayed for nights in this hotel from to july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you do mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a that contained some sort of a at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next i had to check out the next day before o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or it,0.0
electra was an amazing location for us located very close to plaka and syntagma square we took the metro from the airport and walked minutes over to our hotel the best part of the hotel is the pool amenity whenever we were not exploring athens we were relaxing by the pool and suntanning while having amazing views of the acropolis and lycabettus hill from far away the buffet was good enough what more can you ask for in the morning overall i would most definitely stay at this hotel again,1.0
this hotel was close to omonia metro the area is that great but the hotel was a little jewel in this area lovely clean rooms hairdryer flat tv toiletries free wifi beautifully decorated breakfast was basic self serve but adequate and i do think you can do better for the price the staff were very approachable friendly and helpful when i had a problem with a refund,1.0
stayed for nights in dublin at this wonderful hotel just south of st stephens green this was an ideal location for the iveagh gardens which was the purpose of our arrival at the hotel we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in early without comment we had expected to just be able to leave our bags until check in time we stayed in a superior room which was large well appointed and very quiet everything was spotless including the bathroom although it could have been improved with a separate rather than over the bath room included a coffee machines with pods provided mini fridge with water alongside the usual tea bags and hot chocolate was very good with a full breakfast buffet labelled to show that the sausages bacon etc were irish produce good selection of homemade muffins cakes scones and croissants there were also a menu that you could order from which included things like french toast pancakes and omelettes the only thing that could have been improved on was the wait time for someone to come back and check if you did want to place an order but i am being very picky is brilliant for the city centre and just round the corner from one of the airport shuttle be visiting again,1.0

i stayed here for a company offsite with my team for a week my entire stay was absolutely lovely and the staff was more than accommodating and pleasant they were able to check in me early which was greatly appreciated as this was an organized function sometimes things have gone awry or do run smoothly but at clontarf everything ran incredibly smoothly and the food and drink provided for breakfasts and lunches were fantastic the dinners were amazing and again i ca say enough of how lovely and accommodating the staff were aside from that the rooms were comfortable and the property was beautiful thank you so much for a wonderful stay,1.0

royal ramblas is located at the end of las ramblas near plaça de catalunya it is basically the times square nyc of barcelona the staff was amazing extremely helpful and friendly as soon as we arrived at the hotel we were able to check in they provided us with a map of barcelona in addition to popular sightseeing tours we can purchase as soon as you leave the hotel there are so many things to do shopping sightseeing eat there were many small cafes and restaurants nearby including la boqueria market so we did not have breakfast at the hotel we stayed in two connected rooms family of the decor is modern and the windows are soundproof the rooms and bathrooms were very clean i do wish the shower had a door instead of a curtain but that just me being picky the bathrooms can use an upgrade we were located on the floor so we had no complaints in terms of noise from the busy streets i would definitely stay at this hotel again highly recommended,1.0
firstly i have to say that the hotel is very well appointed however we feel let down in many critical areas the room was euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had no windows it had a roof light and very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box the explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room so the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people do need a view we were disturbed after by housekeeping offering a down service we did take this up with mr zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time available if not we have to accept the windowless box again i guess i genuinely felt very uncomfortable about this lack of window it made me very anxious and i not the handicapped partner really upset and disappointed westin gold member and loyal to the brand no longer,0.0
i ca review the property because we ended up cancelling our stay but i can review the customer booked this hotel for a trip with my partner to visit my year old grandmother we booked it quite last minute and paid for our night stay and due to booking so late we booked as did expect there to be any reason to cancel less than one week after booking and a week before we were due to stay we were advised that my partner father has terminal cancer with only a few months left to live which was completely unexpected and therefore i contacted the hotel immediately to see if we could receive a refund as we could understandably no longer service i had received from our flights provider and car rental had been exceptional as they fully understood our predicament and offered great support as we had booked a room i received a blunt response saying in no circumstances would they need to provide a refund i asked the hotel is we could potentially keep to use at a quiet time for the hotel later in the year but they said i had to confirm the dates we be travelling immediately to do so i explained that we do not know exactly when we will be able to travel given that we do not know how many more months we will have with my partner father and need to be available are caregivers for him so i can not,0.0

we stayed here for nights and had a great stay our room was quiet enough interior room remember that spain builds and decorates with stone tile and wood hard surfaces sound carries easily in these situations our room was clean and comfortable to move around it the beds were a little firm but good for me and my daughter you ca beat the location it in the middle of everything it so easy to just wander and get lost in the history and ambiance of the area lots of little restaurants around to eat or drink parking in this area is not easy we had to park in the underground lot by the cathedral of barcelona it pricey by the day but you can purchase multiple days in the garage and it gets more reasonable for days once we parked we left the car there even though you get a pass that allows you to come and go traffic getting to the barri gothic is heavy i would definitely stay at this place again,1.0
stayed here for the weekend of the coldplay concert it is super modern seriously could not complain about anything rooms perfect on site restaurant perfect staff perfect and all within a short walk of everything will definitely come again,1.0
visited athens for a family holiday abd athens hilton was the best choice we made it is by far he best hotel and service anyone can find in athens great location great food great service the rooms are minimal but functional the pool area was fantastic and their spa was an amazing experience,1.0
we stayed at this hotel for four nights as a family of four we stayed in a suite and had roll away beds added to the room and still had plenty of room the service was impeccable the linens were beautiful and the artwork in each room and in the corridors were inspiring most of all we loved how the hotel treated us and took care of our every need a few things to consider before staying there the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader the pool on the roof is very small so the photo is a bit misleading having said this our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city in addition it is much quieter to stay in the gothic quarter than in a hotel that faces a bustling street but this means that a taxi can barely squeeze through finally there is the price tag it is definitely luxury pricing but you are getting what you are paying for,1.0
just returned from a fantastic weekend in amsterdam staying at the recently refurbished kimpton de witt lovely dutch designer touches rooms modern clean and in wyers is excellent also had brunch and evening meal over the must try the chicken bar is a bit of a hidden great place to wind down and relax after a hectic day in amsterdam,1.0

we stayed here for a short city break and found the hotel to be an excellent choice every member of staff we met was extremely helpful and friendly breakfast is of a very high standard with a wide choice available the hotel including bedrooms is designed in a quirky almost industrial style with concrete ceilings and exposed ducting yet is extremely comfortable spotlessly clean with spacious rooms good air conditioning and enormous shower rooms although the hotel is situated some distance from the centre it is in a quiet area and only minutes walk from the nearest metro and trams at amstel station giving easy access to all areas of the city we would highly recommend,1.0
antonias is the man to look out for he will help you with absolutely anything you need and be dead cheeky about it breakfast is huge delicious and free try the tomatoes air conditioner works like a charm when you can figure out how to turn it on it just a wonderful place to stay at a wonderful price and honestly if you really afraid of the neighborhood as some reviews have suggested do go to athens neighborhood is fine and close to nightlife without it being a noisy distraction,1.0
after careful research i chose el palace for our night stay in barcelona before boarding a cruise ship i was not disappointed gorgeous hotel fabulous breakfast buffet wonderful rooftop views room was comfortable elegance we even went to the cigar bar in the basement where my partner enjoyed a special cigar the staff and atmosphere makes you feel aristocratic also i have never stayed at a hotel that has had such a lovely smell throughout was it the fresh flowers the location great with walkable streets tapas bars i could have stayed a month or more,1.0
we loved the location of this hotel just a few minutes walk from temple bar and trinity college and the hop on hop off tour buses the staff are very friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet is tasty and there a lovely resident lounge downstairs with cozy sofas and a fireplace the bed was comfortable and there is even a menu offering different types of pillows we enjoyed the hairy lemon pub and super miss sue awesome fish and chips both of which are literally around the corner from the admittedly minor the website photos are misleading the lobby was darker and had just a couple of armchairs no sofas the classic room was much smaller than it appears in the photo we could barely walk around the showers were less fun because the shower curtain was hung less than inches from the wall a curved shower curtain rod would transform the whole the shower was in a deep bathtub and there was no grab bar on the wall my had difficulty stepping in and out of the tub they tried holding onto the towel rod but found it was already disconnected from the wall apparently previous guests had the same problem and pulled too hard on the towel bar hotel gets the major things right and is a good value i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and to stay here again on our next visit to dublin,1.0
my husband and i stayed at europark hotel for nights the staff were all lovely and incredibly helpful the room was larger than i expected and it had a true king bed it a little removed from the business of la rambla but it only a short walk over there and is also very close to la sagrada familia the reception desk had great restaurant recommendations and provided great maps with helpful and clear directions the breakfast was lovely and very convenient for days where you have an early start we relaxed in the evenings by the pool which is small but there was always seating and we never felt like it was too crowded,1.0
i enjoyed the proximity to the national theater as i was attending an event there for three days also relatively close to the major sites the rooms were clean and everything was in working order the staff was also very friendly,1.0

this is a really nice hotel located in a perfect location just off la rambla the staff were all lovely with really lots of useful information available my room was small but well furnished with some nice touches including a welcome basket the only thing lacking was the absence of electrical power sockets my travelling companion and i both like to charge our devices and this was not easy the rooms were very clean and well maintained with good wifi and hot water breakfast was also good for the money and the barista making fresh coffee was really nice some more high fibre cereal would have been good but the yoghurts and croissants were really nice i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value centrally located hotel for a reasonable price,1.0
we had a wonderful lunch on the roof of the hotel i was nervous about the dress code and made my son and husband wear long pants despite the degree temperatures i was frustrated to find upon arrival that there were all sorts of guests wearing shorts tank tops sandals etc i am fine with people dressing how ever they like for lunch but was irritated that we called and were told my husband had to wear long food and service and view were outstanding we had hoped to sit outside but the extreme heat prevented that we were able to go out on the balcony for a wonderful view i am sure dinner is even better highly recommend,1.0
great location right in front of gaudi casa bastlo good facilities well laid out room balcony with great view over the vibrant city friendly helpful staff absolutely no complaints a fair price too,1.0

walking distance everywhere dam square red light are very close also close to transport for example tram bus train the last stop of the train from the airport is within walking distance in my opinion one of the rare quality and friendly hotels in the center,1.0
nothing happens for a reason we were not even supposed to stay in athens but after our flight to milos was cancelled we had to quickly find an hotel in athens for the lucky were we to find this gem first the service was just great we felt welcomed as we stepped on the restaurant floor there is no hotel reception very friendly but yet very room we had the room on the floor so we had this huge deck with a nice little place to sit outside with a nice overall view you ask for a nicer room the bed was really comfortable nice bath little kitchenette the room was extra location we stay long enough to experience the city but it is really centrally located it is located in a little street with some bars and restaurants so it can get a bit noisy but we mind it and being on the floor kind of cut down the restaurant we ate at the restaurant for a late dinner and it was great we went with recommendations from the waiter and were not disappointed a lot of items on the menu did look only sad thing is that we were there for only one short night as we needed to leave at to take the ferry but they were nice enough to bring us a full cabaret of things yogourt fruits croissants etc for breakfast the night before so we could eat even if the restaurant was not opened,1.0
this quaint hotel is in an easily accessible area for the subway or taxis the architecture is absolutely gorgeous and has been restored beautifully the rooms are a bit small but well done the outdoor patio for dinner was a real treat never got to use the rooftop pool as we were so busy but it was lovely great views great staff very helpful,1.0
hotel is located just above st excellent location for walking to attractions the hop on hop off bus was located just a couple blocks away ate in the hotel restaurant for two nights very satisfied,1.0
stayed here whilst having a weekend in amsterdam celebrating a in was smooth and efficient and the six of couples were given rooms next to each rooms were clean comfortable and well staff were pleasant and bar with fantastic views is worth a i feared we would be too far out of the centre but it proved to be the perfect minutes on the tram from the stop outside the hotel and you in the thick of things but when you done you can leave the madness behind,1.0
the first time i stayed at this hotel was on a friday to saturday as soon as you walk in this hotel feels very homely the staff are welcoming and friendly i had special religious requirements and the staff we able to accommodate these while being very respectful my stay was so nice that i came back a second time the following week where i stayed for a few more nights the hotel is conveniently located close enough to downtown dublin so you can walk there while being far enough to avoid the hordes of tourists the rooms are comfortable and clean i had one issue with plumbing and the response of the staff was excellent they moved me into another room and provided compensation for the inconvenience this is a professional outfit and yet at the same time personable i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a convenient friendly and comfortable stay in dublin a special mention to brian garvan at reception who helped out with recommendations for places to eat and visit also ann marie marcela and laura deserve a mention for being so responsive to email enquiries regarding reservations prior to and during the stay,1.0
i love hotel casa reasonable pricing for overnight stays room was spacious clean and had everything we needed lovely bathroom and shower beautiful architecture and lovely big windows in all the rooms but what really made this place were the people all of the staff were very welcoming and friendly and the hotel has a reputation for being good for partying which is perfect for me after a heavy night out the staff were happy to order is a pizza that we ate in the lobby at there is also a rooftop bar with stunning views across the dam overall i would recommend,1.0
we paid for a room for the concert on arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded to a suite when we arrived at the room it was quite small the only thing to suggest it is a suite was a larger bathroom otherwise the room was dark really hot and stuffy we put the air con on when we left the room and when we came back it was warm sleeping was unbearable and we could contact any of the hotel services in fact when we came back all we could see was security at the front lobby and nobody at we asked to speak to a manager the next morning he apologised about the air con and was aware they had a problem with it in the hotel no gestures were offered and guess what does not include breakfast it is disappointing to see these hotels totally rob people when an is will never be back here again the shelbourne is the place to stay,0.0
arian hotel is a great hotel acropolis views and restaurants right down the street close to idion square it may be a little hard to find but once you do you are in for a treat staff is great and the top floor garden with view to match breakfast prided and is also great you will not be disappointed,1.0

really enjoyed our stay here it a very clean hotel with great facilities we brought our bicycles with us and used them to explore amsterdam it takes about minutes or so across a wonderful park to get to the main part of the city and there a few convenient bars in the park should the need arise to take a break during the city commute we found the staff to be helpful and friendly and the constant free coffee in the lounge area is very we were able to store our bikes in the underground garage for no extra charge car parking is free only if you book your reservation directly with the hotel,1.0

we arrived at the brooks hotel after a hour flight from the states absolutely exhausted and a nice young man at the desk greeted us and informed us of places to visit on the map he gave us he also said there was a lounge downstairs for guests who wanted to take a nap before their room was ready or just to relax my dad wanted some coffee so he asked at the front desk and they brought it down to him on a platter what amazing service we were able to get in around as the young man had put us as a top priority and the room was fantastic and clean the room staff was super friendly and the head maid actually checked on us to make sure we made it to our room okay breakfast was the only part of this trip that could use some work simply because the head of the separate restaurant where breakfast is served is quite stuck up however the restaurant as i said it separate from the hotel so does not take away anything from the hotel great staff who are friendly and always on hand would absolutely stay again we were absolutely spoiled in great hospitality and the rest of our hotels for the rest of our trip in europe had high bars to reach to come close to the brooks hotel,1.0

we really enjoyed our day stay at the clemens hotel the staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was amazing we loved the balcony connected to the lobby and the breakfast was quite filling the long stair case leading to the lobby and the street noise on saturday took some getting used to but overall we were very pleased and would stay at this inn again,1.0
this hotel is modern ultra clean trendy and has ten chanderliers in the lobby what more could you ask for oh and not to mention the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in i absolutely recommend this hotel for stay in amsterdam i booked four rooms for a hen party and the location is fab it is about a minute walk to the station and for you can get a hour pass which you can use for trams metro and buses grab tram to city centre or metro no changes just jump on the hotel has a lovely breakfast too which i recommend is well worth doing although there is a supermarket round the back of hotel italian restaurant called happy italy is right next door for a nice meal too the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and everything was so clean and new my friends also loved the hotel especially the drinks menu in the bar which was so good for the money cocktails for yes please the hotel was not in any way rowdy either just a lovely big hotel with all you need i do want to fault anything as there is no need but just to let people know there is not a kettle or tea in the room the most amazing bed ever makes up for this and the bar in the lobby sells gorgeous coffee for so you will be fine if you are considering booking this hotel click enter and,1.0
arrived late evening and was quick no issues hotel is nice clean and comfortable room is big with a comfortable bed and pillows we eat food in the bar on the first night and it was nice but limited enough selection breakfast was included in our room rate but there is a nice coffee dock in the reception area that serves lovely coffees scones fruit etc prices reasonable there was air conditioning in our room as we were on the floor but the unit was extremely noisy when it was on without it the room can become extremely warm and stuffy hotel is within walking distance of st stephens green comfortable shoes advised if walking overall had a nice experience staying here if in dublin again for a concert and prices were reasonable i would consider staying here again,1.0

my mum and i spent a few nights in the inntel when we were in amsterdam and we were very pleased with the location and the quality of the rooms i was disappointed that there were no biscuits or treats in the rooms except ones to be purchased at extortionate prices but i think this tradition may be more uk than european we chose to just have our room and got our breakfast each morning at a lovely little cafe on the corner it was a cheaper and healthier option,1.0
i honestly loved everything about the hotel from the staff to morning breakfast the location was excellent to explore the city from definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone i know heading off to barcelona,1.0

since it very difficult to find a parking spot near the canals which are extremely beautiful the location of the hotel is good to drive to zaanse schans in the morning coz there are also limited parking lots,1.0
so i was here on a conference the hotel was usefully placed right on both the tram and underground metro lines and within walking distance of where i needed to be very comfortable high tech rooms lots of glass including glass from the bedroom area to the bathroom area fine for me on my own or couples but this was a twin room and if you do have that sort of relationship with your roommate it could be awkward breakfast was absolutely stunning good enough that i really felt no need to go for the brit standard cooked breakfast i was there for days and was able to try everything nice pool area with the pool just about big enough to allow proper exercise i was put off slightly by the cool crowd who were there being beautiful on saturday afternoon alongside a dj not my scene and i felt quite uncomfortable but at other times was really very pleasant expensive bar on the top floor probably standard for hotel prices definitely stay there again the rooms breakfast and pool outside peak times make this well worth it and being slightly outside the centre was a problem with the transport links,1.0
we had already got a great price for this hotel through a price comparison site for night and arrived excited to be staying in such a nice hotel the website stated that we could check in from however the reception said it would be before the room was ready so we left for a few hrs disappointed we could not get to our room however when we returned the same receptionist apologised again for the confusion and informed us that our triple room had been upgraded to a junior suite sweet i have never seen anything like this on my otherwise budget travels in many hotels it felt like we had won lottery every member of staff was courteous and professional taking time to explain the room and the facilities on offer the roof top bar with amazing views was fabulous but so were the prices thank you casa foster for making the last day of my kids holiday truly memorable,1.0

my husband and i visited for the last night of our week trip to the netherlands it also happened to be our anniversary we were greeted kindly and check in was smooth i was impressed by the brand new remodel that the hotel just had finished it was probably one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in it was fresh and modern the room we stayed in was a little small but i did mind i absolutely loved the design and modern touches applied to the rooms after arrival we were provided a bottle of champagne with a nice note congratulating us on our how thoughtful the bed was absolutely so cozy and comfortable robes were provided and they were very comfortable one problem we had in general with staying in amsterdam was the noise we were so relived with this hotel as it was so so quiet we slept so well we almost missed our flight the next day room service was good but i have had better meals i really have no complaints our stay was perfect and i would love to come back,1.0
after cruising with old friends our mediterranean cruise ended in barcelona decided to stay on for more nights at casa fuster hotel where we had stayed once before was as good as we remembered our room was spacious linen and bed very included a good shower separate jacuzzi and a bidet and toilet towel rail although i never found out where one switched it on breakfast was wonderful served in a very spacious and calming had a wonderful snack on our arrival on the roof top with terrific views our last night we dined at the galaxo restaurant one of the eat meals we had in many years on our travels the very best be going back there soon as o can plan another trip,1.0
we are world travelers best hotel we have ever stayed at the concierge staff was amazing thank you carlos juanra carmen blanca and fred the house keeping manager sara made us feel like family very hard to find these days we will be back barcelona was a great city the entire staff and the food was just amazing thank you all the seijo,1.0
charming hotel great location friendly staff and lovely view got off on a bit of a bad start as we took rooms and although our kids individual rooms were fine our room that was bigger had everything fine except that it was very very hot trouble with the air climate the next day we were moved into a much bigger and better room a suite i think with a beautiful view and a perfectly cool and crisp atmosphere no more complains from there on the staff were nice and friendly breakfast was served in a beautiful restaurant with a lovely view again downside maybe was the noise at night from the young holiday makers over the it did bother me much i loved the view and the ambience,1.0
hotel was very good excellent service and great rooms the breakfast is great and parking very handy location spot on only a quick dart into town or the beach a min walk east loved it only thing was we thought the bed was a bit hard so used an extra quilt which they were quite happy to give us,1.0
lovely hotel has been updated lately lovely furnishings bright and spacious rooms clean and was efficient breakfast is buffet coffee and toast served breakfast area is bright and staff are friendly and helpful would definitely very good location for dublin perhaps only could be parking we been lucky every time we stayed early afternoon to get parking at back of hotel however not sure if there is a lot of parking in this car park or if you would have to pay for parking,1.0
we recently staid at the lansdowne hotel to which we were greeted in a friendly manner by the receptionists despite the outdated interior of the building and the room being quite small the place was spotlessly clean as was the bathroom points on to our dismay though there was limited parking available to which we did not know about and we had to drive down the block to try and find parking spaces until the morning we ventured down into the den bar which was lovely and cozy and the bar staff were so helpful and friendly,1.0
i stayed at the student hotel because for reasons i can not explain expedia offered my stay for free after i booked the airfare must been a glitch on someone part but i jumped on it reviews were positive and i was very intrigued the space is always bustling with life and there are more than just students that stay there lounge areas in the lobby are cozy and active there was never a time while i was there that i did not see someone playing ping pong i was fortunate to meet a fellow traveler and we ended up touring the city together for the week i stayed in room was a deluxe room i believe so perhaps it was larger than different rooms i ca be sure on the floor it is on a corner had two large windows that overlooked the street a bit noisy sometimes even from up there and had a great view of the city there is a large support column in the room that makes getting to the window a bit awkward i know the building used to be a printing place but that was a big deal also a couple of other room notes housekeeping comes every other hand towel and one large towel in my has no curtain is open and will get the floor a little wet for outlets conveniently near the floor in the base of the bed so you may charge phones as you sleep are very thin,1.0
my wife i were travelling around europe on our honeymoon were fortunate enough to stay at this hotel during our night in heard from greek friends that athens can be a bit sketchy to walk around in that you must constantly be on guard but i found the neighbourhood around the hotel to be quite pleasant as there is other tourists locals about full of places to eat a grocery nearby of course still be cautious like in any country yet still enjoy the surrounds as it is brilliantly located within walking distance of stores the acropolis mueseum the read reviews that the service at hermes is excellent that has changed at all courteous very helpful we were even given a small gift of wine local sweets as a gesture from hermes to greet us on our honeymoon this was a wonderful surprise that we room we were given was humbly small yet cosy enough for a couple was modernly decorated we did expect the hotel to look as good as a star when we spotted entered so we were free offerings were water tea coffee available for till at their lounge area beside reception there are seats a selection of reading material in this lounge to compliment a cup of what you fancy also we were encouraged to visit their sister hotel hotel plaka rooftop for a drink a nice view of the parthenon so that was great to in all we had a great time for exactly what,1.0
loved our room amazing floor to ceiling windows accommodated all four of us in our located and easy to get everywhere honors lounge is good but way to crowded lobby was also too crowded the small spaces to accommodate our stay causing a very very scrunched feeling was the only reason i took off one concierge service worth it to boom your stuff with them instead of trying to do everything on your own they were very helpful and got us in all the attractions we wanted to see,1.0
really well situated hotel if you want to ferry catch or just dip into the delights of a dublin visit or visit the aviva stadium which is literally next door to the hotel ample parking pleasant staff and certainly the amenities were well staffed and provided good food and was well presented and good in quality with nice smiley staff which is really important to us in a morning refurbished rooms were all very acceptably appointed we experienced a little night time sleep disturbance from outside noisy people but as a city centre venue there was nothing out of the ordinary in our opinion,1.0
stayed at the westbury to celebrate our wedding anniversary and while the staff were friendly our room was very disappointing i had stayed at the hotel before and had a lovely room so that what prompted my husband to book it we were visiting family in dublin and my husband booked the hotel as a surprise my husband paid euro a night for a deluxe king room and the room was shappy there were stains on the carpet and chair and the bathroom was outdated with mold on the tub we have stayed at numerous upscale hotels and have never had a room like this we had a view of what looked like ac units and a garbage area and he booked it directly with the hotel the door to the room was directly beside the bed which was awkward when paying these sort of room rates you expect a better experience we had to wait for the room to be ready which was annoying as we went in after normal checkin time sadly i will never stay at the hotel again,0.0
very nice hotel the included breakfast buffet was exceptional the food in the lounge was very good and the service was good we discovered early in our weeks of traveling ireland that the weather is such that air conditioning is rare none of the star hotels we booked had air hotel is at the outer edges of downtown so it is quieter than the downtown hotels we arrived the day of the concert so the city was very busy and crowded it is close to the guiness factory and only a minute walk to the heart of downtown,1.0
a lovely historic place upon which to end our stay in ireland beautifully renovated and presented obviously very popular watering hole for the locals road into the carpark could be a little better signposted as it looks as if it is not actually a road but in fact it is bedroom was tastefully decorated and the bed was large and comfortable small bathroom but lovingly decorated and quite adequate,1.0
stayed at this hotel with my family booked rooms found human faeces on the bathroom floor in one of the rooms still waiting on gm of hotel to call me back duty manager changed the room which for me should have been automatic and a free dinner which is very ordinary given price i paid for rooms i sure they will reply now did even refund the one room one would assume they would way too late not what you expect for a star hotel considering so many other star hotels do not book here how unhygienic and how badly to handle my complaint human faeces very disgusting i rarely post reviews however always read them i hope this helps others please check out other star hotels in athens i would hate for another family to have their last day on their holiday be spoiled like us,0.0
the hotel was simply beautiful from the building to the interior design our room was simply gorgeous with a wonderful small balcony observing the street free coffee and croissants every morning are a great way to start your wish the bed was of a better quality was the most comfortable but simply ok,1.0
we stayed at the divani palace acropolis twice each time for two nights on our way to and from the greek islands the hotel can not be better situated for all the sights the rooftop bar has incredible views of the acropolis the hotel is within close walking distance of the acropolis the acropolis museum etc staff were always very friendly and helpful we booked an executive room which is a grade higher than the entry level deluxe room the room had air conditioning and free wifi that both worked relatively well the only downside to the room was the twin beds that are standard in executive rooms as a couple we would have preferred a double bed,1.0
the hotel is star and therefore relatively basic but there was nothing to complain about and the location is excellent our family room was very sizeable it was at the back of the hotel so the view was not great at all but it had the advantage of being amazingly quiet considering the proximity to the heaving busy la roof top terrace bar with glass fronted foot pool was a real treat there are views all around barcelona city and down to the port with the palau guell gaudi designed rooftop directly opposite personally i would have thought that this premier location could be turned into a much more expensive cocktail bar but it was certainly a very pleasant addition as it did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on that but would definitely stay here again if visiting barcelona,1.0
we loved this hotel just returned from five nights at the casa mimosa with two teenagers we had a king room and the kids had a standard with two twin beds their room was small but lovely and perfect for them our room was quite large certainly by european hotel standards the beds were incredible our rooms faced the street which i think i would prefer since the garden although lovely can be very enjoyed the rooftop lounge and plunge pool it was surprisingly not busy even though i think the hotel was full while we were there and has fantastic views of la padrera sculptured roof the staff at this hotel deserve mention the front desk staff was super helpful and housekeeping was perfect i had a snafu where i left a bag in the backseat should have put it in the trunk of the taxi that dropped us at the airport i realized it about minutes after being dropped so the taxi was long gone my only hope of getting it back was that the hotel would be able to reach the driver since they had booked the taxi for us believe it or not when i called him the hotel concierge facilitated tracking down the driver who came back to the airport and the bag was returned to me service above and beyond my expectations we would stay at casa mimosa again in a heartbeat,1.0
i do write reviews but i had to for this hotel because i was extremely are hhonors members checked in on around for nights we paid a lot of money for a king executive suite on high floor river view and mind you i had to pay in advance we ended up with a room on floor out of floors with view of train tracks and buildings one of which is an abandon building with graffiti on it see pics if this is what they called a room with a view i can only imagine what a room with no views looks spoke to the same agent at the hhonors desk who checked us in about the room that was assigned to us instead of being apologetic she automatically stated it was our fault she stated we picked our exact room online when we checked in via the app wrong when i checked in with the hilton app unlike other hilton properties this hotel does provide you with the option to pick your room maybe she needed to be better trained on her customer service skills and knowledge of how her hotel app few hours later the manager called and gave us an option to move to another room in the morning however it would be in a room with a smaller bed once again why would you offer me a room that is not what i had paid for in advance therefore we told her we do want it,0.0
our family enjoyed a wonderful days in barcelona and we loved our stay at the sheraton four points the hotel was wonderfully situated and provided easy access to all the tourist sites while giving you a local experience in their emerging neighbourhood the surrounding restaurants were excellent and within a few minutes walk from your room while the rooms are modestly appointed they were clean and perfect for resting at night and parking suitcases during the day while you explore the city lastly the staff was excellent front desk waiters etc were all interested in making our experience positive i was very happy about our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time touring while visiting barcelona,1.0
i would recommend sercotel amister to anyone looking to stay in barcelona for a short break we stayed there for three nights it was perfect for a short getaway it about minutes from various different metro stops and you can get to the quite easily the staff are friendly and the hotel is modern i liked the upstairs bar area although it could benefit from some more sunloungers we were treated to a little bottle of prosecco on arrival which really made us welcome,1.0
my partner and i booked this hotel for a last minute trip and were so surprised at the quality and location of the hotel since our first trip we have returned and will continue to use this hotel for our travels to dublin in the future the staff are very accommodating and down to earth as well as rooms are very modern with a comfortable bed and amazing shower i have no faults about this hotel each time i stay it amazes me and i look forward to returning,1.0
from the concierge to the check the people were fantastically helpful room and hotel were amazing we did get to use the rooftop or pool but did check them out and will absolutely return to try them along with the restaurant location is fantastic too we loved everything about it,1.0
i travel weekly for work and there is no other hotel which compares to the high standards friendly service great atmosphere stellar drinks and luxury beds and room as the ink hotel amsterdam the staff are so welcoming a really great experience and the location just ca be beat at ink you are in the center of amsterdam with all attractions and amenities at your finger tips if in amsterdam there is only hotel for me,1.0
we really loved this hotel for all the right reasons the location was excellent for walking to all the tourist attractions the front desk was knowledgeable and friendly the room was good size for two travelers with lots of luggage and the morning buffet breakfast was outstanding with way too much food to sample everything the fruit selection consisted of so many varieties that everyone should be able to find something they like it was all so very healthy except for all the processed meats which one did not have to take since there were so many other healthier choices the staff were all very helpful when vantage tour group concierge and guide was remarkable,1.0
wow a great hotel if you are looking for somewhere smart but not in an ostentatious way then this is the hotel for you tucked away from the hustle and bustle but not too far to walk in what we would describe as a trendy up and coming area modern quirky and a great place to stay we loved the feel of the hotel right from stepping of the pavement friendly accommodating staff who spoke good english sorry our spanish was so bad just the type of place you would want to be seen in a lovely room with an amazing shower that i need in my life for days of the year not the we stayed a hand written note welcoming us on arrival the latest edition of a glossy fashion magazine to read on the desk bluetooth speakers comfortable beds controllable air conditioning great lighting a good choice of products for all those things you forgot to pack good quality towels and linen lots of considered touches that we enjoyed we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends we are now looking to stay at another hotel in the chain for our next break good value for money too we had a great stay thank you,1.0
loved our stay room was quiet and beautifully appointed we also thought that the size of room and bathroom were larger and more luxurious than other hotels we had stayed at in europe staff very welcoming and were very helpful location was incredible within walking distance of most things yet out of the hustle and bustle of las ramblas we would recommend this hotel to our friends and family,1.0
everything you could expect superb service from check in to check out dining was fantastic rooms were spacious and immaculate the artwork on display was an unexpected find i would highly recommend to anyone,1.0
stayed overnight at the ballsbridge ready for an early ferry crossing back to the uk the hotel is bright and clean the rooms spacious and very clean and a top notch american bed we wanted to experience dublin so took off on a hike towards temple bar its a good walk what a great cosmopolitan atmosphere the next morning we had to be at the port so wondered if we could get breakfast as they opened at they are very helpful and opened at we were not the only people to take advantage of this early opportunity now this is a proper breakfast just wish we had more time to enjoy the experience one downside is car parking euros is it me car parking should be included if you are paying euros for a night,1.0
i am in this hotel on business at least once a month i do always stay but usually conduct meetings in the bar area staff are absolutely outstanding and let face it that what makes a place great they love to see regular clientele and always make me feel welcome to be back at brooks excellent coffee and a varied lunch menu the rooms are super clean they are small but well equipped this is an excellent location for a hotel about a minute walk from grafton street i look forward to my next visit,1.0
located in the fashionable eixample district it is extremely convenient to all the major sites and attractions it is very close to the ramblas and within easy walking distance of the barri gothic and el born regions and tons of great restaurants in the eixample and those districts there is a metro stop a half block away so there is easy train access to anyplace in the city by our choice by price our room was small but not by european standards it was clean the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern with a great shower the staff extremely helpful making restaurant reservations before we arrived and reserving and printing out our reservations for the sagruda famili and the predera the rate was comparable or better than similar and lesser hotels so a reasonably good value we can think of no reason to look any place else but the hotel granvia when booking a room for barcelona,1.0
i do see barcelona as one of the nicest city and keep coming time i chose granados and stayed i really love being in water i decided to take the duplex room with a privat pool on the terrace of the second meter long and only have to share it with your direct i loved that the beds were very good too and it was just like having a second the roof there a real nice bar with another pool aswell and it a nice cozy place especially in the early entire hotel had a real nice feeling very warm and area where the hotel is you find some small restaurants and shop and the metro is about min staff was very friendly and helpfull and i definitely recommend this hotel in beautiful barcelona,1.0
great location located right in the heart of the city we took the bus from the airport which was approximately an hour and minutes while a cab would have been minutes we got off at the last stop and it was approx an min walk to the hotel check in was easy and the front desk concierge was friendly the room was basic just what we needed and was clean great rooftop bar with a stunning view of the acropolis the acropolis was also only a minute walk away we went at in the evening and it was too hot which was nice breakfast was included and was pretty good you must try their homemade spinach and cheese pie spanakopita it was delicious,1.0
clean nice hotel pool was a nice treat in the hot weather balcony faced the pool with a slight view of the acropolis but only had one chair in room safe did eat here as it was way too expensive lots of nice dining options close by very convenient for the acropolis,1.0
the reviews of this hotel are outstanding but there is definitely room for improvement my fiancée and i stayed for nights the room was true to its title tiny a little too tiny for our suitcases and clothes there was also no full length mirror just one mirror in the bathroom and the room and hotel in general were incredibly dark so much so we could see where to put our key in the door the fact that there were only dimmed lamps in the room resulted in dodgy makeup application not a good look the bed however was incredibly comfortable and i would love to order the pillows so very soft the rooftop and cooling off pool was lovely and basically our own private rooftop until friday hit this became busy and we were happy we had plans to get out and about there was also very loud music on the thursday night until very late whilst the hotel is seemingly trying to tick the every soho house type boutique box going perhaps a few little friendly touches to make the rooms more practical lights and mirrors would enable every guest enjoy the experience not just bachelor men i felt young single and very much intending to mingle men was the target audience for this hotel,1.0
as you walk in the door a warm greeting from staff receptions staff them happy to help food great breakfast fast and no q dinner good food staff happy to help bar staff knowledge good nothing to much trouble general manager always available upon request and alway around hotel keeping eye upon the operation thank you clayton court the best so far this year,1.0
great hotel very comfortable quick walk to train station and a stop for the airport coach beatrice in reception was particularly helpful and kind even letting us use her phone to make a call highly recommended,1.0
great night break with friends in their extra large triple room fab stylish room super comfy beds and plenty of space relaxing chairs great having a separate toilet and wonderful deep bath to soak in we over looked the courtyard so lovely and quiet had fun operating the coffee machine they kindly sent us someone to show us but apart from that could a thing,1.0
great location in a quite area that is close to everything our room was way beyond very large room with a view of the canal the staff was incredibly helpful myrthe and simone were outstanding this hotel has our strong recommendation,1.0
great location clean minimalistic room which is pretty typical in spain great shower front desk staff very helpful with food recommendations and any questions we had bakery was awesome and smelled soooo good only complaint was very poor internet in our room to be fair we were on floor so we sat in the lobby and had a coffee or water when we needed online not a big deal,1.0
the hotel was not worth the money building was old and requires major renovation electrical installation in the room was scary overcharged for breakfast and double room that i never location of the hotel was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful,0.0
a perfect location a spacious modern room and a beautiful hotel the hotel itself is made up of a variety of buildings all joined together after the fact and all surrounding a central courtyard it takes up an entire city block and it bordered by canals on two sides very pretty and very interesting i would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat,1.0
we stayed at for nights at the beginning of june we were two adults two teenagers and an infant we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the hotel is very modern with all the amenities that you need we were in a bedroom unit and had more than enough room for our family it is also well located about minutes walk from syntagma square it is easy to get to from the airport by metro but most important is that we were able to walk to all the major sites in athens we were also close to the shops of plaka and were surrounded by restaurants and places to spelling at the front desk was very helpful he helped us arrange restaurant reservations transportation and gave great advice on touring and visiting athens we were served a wonderful breakfast every morning in our room we would definitely stay there again when we return to athens,1.0
just had a night stay this timeusual great service at check inrecognised as ihg member with free drink and snackslove the new carpets that are being layed on all floors so happy you chose to replace old ones only thing i noticed this time was lack of attention at check out by the trainee on dutybasic thats it its always nice to maybe get asked if everything is ok with stay but maybe i am just expecting too muchwill be back soon offcourse,1.0
we stayed just a night but were impressed with service and availability of the roof top restaurant was excellent for food and the view on the was large and pleasant but bathroom was a bit old and would need to be morning we were going to piraeus to take a ferry and the hotel told us that we need minutes by took us minutes to get to our boat and almost missed it our taxi drivers did careful when you plan your taxi drive to port,1.0
central location is an added plus views from the roof top breakfast are spectacular you can easily walk to the plaka flea market metro station and upscale shopping is just a block away very accommodating staff regardless of your arrival time,1.0
i visited nh collection amsterdam doelen the hotel was a lot better than other hotels i had stayed at in amsterdam the hotel is very stylish it central and close to all major attractions the breakfasts were concierge was not very attentive and not always available when you were looking for them book a superior room with a view without a view they face the street and are a bit noisy,1.0
having booked a one week for a tour we decided to start and finish our holiday with three extra days in amsterdam the six days enabled us to visit the many places of location was one tram stop from sloterdijk station which made our journey to a and from the airport easy the tram stop outside the hotel also made our visits into the city easy we were so pleased with our room that we asked for the same room for our second stay the breakfast was the best we have ever experienced in all our travels it had all choices imaginable and such friendly helpful staff we also found the staff on the reception desk could not have been more helpful and forthcoming with useful information,1.0
the staff was very friendly and the breakfast choices were great that where it ends the rooms were run down with stains on the carpets cracked tiles in the bathroom old and stained sink and beds absolutely disgusting the price per night was crazy at per night we shortened our stay from to night and checked into a local marriott hotel instead at half the cost,0.0
stayed two nights in barcelona before our cruise this hotel is just minutes away from las ramblas many restaurants in neighborhood s well grocery stores andante is a very safe clean and highly functioning hotel staff is fantastic very friendly and speak many languages if you are looking for a clean and nice hotel near las ramblas and cruise port this is it highly recommend,1.0
super central and very modern we enjoyed every minute in this hotel the bakery is outstanding as well we sure coming back on our next trip the price is unbeatable and the workers are very kind,1.0
we stayed for a long weekend in in a junior suite which was well appointed our only complaint is that the air con would not go below our room overlooked the atrium so if we opened the windows it was very noisy for any voices echo in the space a man came to try to fix the air con but failed the weather was not hot when we were staying weeks ago but due to he air con problem we were too hot and uncomfortable at night i note this has been a complaint of others guests and management need to sort this have given a star recommendation as the location is great the room was otherwise good and above all all the staff were most particularly want to highlight that upon our departure i left a purse containing uk sterling in our room when i got home i realised my loss and rang the hotel the room attendant had found the purse and it was returned to me intact free of charge i have written to the room attendant to thank her for her honesty apart from the problems i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel,1.0

welcoming staff good location pool was a very nice addition since it was degrees in july rooms a bit tired but otherwise all are few good restaurants near by and lovely shopping street breakfast was return again,1.0
stayed in this hotel at the end of june and was very happy overall with check in room and breakfast for me the only small issue was the fact that it was a good minute to the nearest metro but that not the hotels fault,1.0
people really friendly whatever whenever works here fine w amsterdam pay you back your loyalty to the starwood is cosy nice environment breakfast is a bit small for a spoiled traveler in asia so europe is different therefore is good hotel is separated in two buildings what gives you an additional nice atmosphere drinks a great wonderful view and all in all a stay in w amsterdam is a remarkable stay,1.0
we went to athens for a wedding and decided to stay somewhere that was quiet but with good access to the metro to get to the center of town golden age is only a minute walk from the train station and it is in a safe residential neighbourhood the service is excellent we had a problem with our room and they immediately took care of it the breakfast is fine would stay here again,1.0
my wife and me stayed at the w hotel for the weekend we been to many hotels we have seen for a long time such a we designed hotel starting from the lobby reception the rooms the restaurants and even the spa and sweeming pool amazing the staff was very polite and helpful and the room was very comfortable the hotel is also located very close to the dam do miss the roof bar with the city spread all overin short this is the place for staying in amsterdam,1.0
stayed here for a long weekend hotel itself was clean and staff were very friendly even had security a short walk from the beach minutes lots of lovely shops and cafes on the way to the beach however central to the bars restaurants beaches and on buses absolutely no concerns and would return to this hotel,1.0
minute walk from the acropolis and the parthenon which every one needs to see in athens minutes walk from la plaka which is very worth it alot of very good rooms are okay and the staff is very friendly the breakfast was excellent the hotel does have a pool or a would still recommend it,1.0
we booked this hotel based on proximity to metro station although it looks close on the map it is actually not that easy to walk to with suitcases the room was terrible dingy curtains half falling off the tracks outlook onto dusty abandoned building the bed was hard the pillows flat worst of all though was the fact that the walls are paper thin we could hear every word from next door especially when they broke into a fight care factor zero from night manager it is in a really dodgy area with lots of homeless people in the street on the positive side the bathroom was clean way over priced for the standard of the room would recommend not staying at this hotel,0.0
taking a step off busy dusty and hot syntagma square and entering the cool and elegant lobby of the king george feels like travel in time outstanding staff with the right mix of restraint and charming support rooms are historic but practical and with lots of charm which does include the small wear and tear which gives a classic place its patina breakfast on the floor with the panorama of the acropolis is a memory that you should seek out and cherish we loved every minute of ithighly recommended,1.0
very nice hotel design and comfort of the room was excellent breakfast was very good staff were exceptional check in and check out was very slow due to computer use issues great location and great views from the top floor,1.0

the king george in athens was our last stop of a day trip through austria and greece we had a lovely stay at the king george the hotel is beautiful and perfectly located in the center of athens close to the plaka parliament syntagma square and an efficient metro system that takes you wherever you wish to visit in athens our rooms were on the small side but service was very good staff is very attentive to needs and respond very quickly our daughter was ill during our stay and a doctor was dispatched within minutes dinner at tudor hall with an suberb view of the acropolis unforgettable,1.0
we stayed here recently for days and totally enjoyed this hotel normally you would not expect a hotel located next to a major railway station to be so good but the double tree hilton is very good our room is not overly large but it has everything we need and to be honest you only end up sleeping in your room the best thing about this hotel is the top floor with the amazing outdoor bar and eating area it has fantastic views toward the main part of the city with nothing better than enjoying that view at sunset with a nice drink in hand its location is also excellent for exploring amsterdam easily and there is a good restaurant district very close to the hotel,1.0
good location friendly staff wonderful breakfast we stayed here for two nights i left my sunglasses behind and they helped mail them to me at my home in the states thank you they arrived today in perfect condition,1.0

my husband and i stayed for nights on a weekend in july we were impacted by the construction on weekdays the hotel was an easy euro taxi ride from the airport we arrived and they far exceeded my expectations by allowing us to check in to our room at that bonus points the room was spacious modern and totally clean the bathroom was also modern with a large there is which turned out to be more useful than i thought in ireland given the cool weather but they were our best nights of sleep because it was cool there is not a concierge but everyone at the front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations it was an easy walk to the city center and most attractions yet away from the bustle of the city each morning we needed a cab and ordered one the night before which worked out perfectly the cabbie even asks your room number to be sure it your restaurant was phenomenal for dinner did eat breakfast here and there is a small shop with any extras you need or there are grocery stores nearby the safe was big enough for a laptop i would stay again though hopefully could get a better price we were there weekend,1.0
we stayed four nights at el palace hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the staff were extremely friendly and showed us our way around the town it also located in a good position away from the super busy tourist areas yet close enough to walk the hotel was also really clean and room service was done few times a day most of all the lobby area is gorgeous we would definitely stay there again,1.0
i booked my stay last minute on the day i was travelling the reservation person i dealt with stephen was so helpful and friendly we got a great rate for bed and breakfast perhaps due to how late we booked when we arrived the hotel was quite busy but they had every desk open we were checked in by a lovely duty manager unfortunately i forget her name on the day we stayed the weather in dublin was very warm this hotel does not have but when we got to our room they already had the blinds closed and a fan running to cool the air i hadnt stayed her before but i will definitely go back,1.0

stayed at the schoolhouse for two nights and really enjoyed the experience the hotel is located about a twenty minute walk from the city center and is situated in what seems a nice area of dublin our room was a good size and had a large and comfortable double bed we enjoyed a very good breakfast in the hotel and had a dinner in the bar the food on all occasions was very hotel bar is frequented by locals and tourists and has a really good atmosphere and serve a great pint of guinness the staff were all pleasant and friendly the hotel is kept clean and in good condition if you are looking for a trendy boutique hotel then look elsewhere but if you are looking for a hotel with a bit of history with great people and offering good hospitality then the schoolhouse comes thoroughly recommended,1.0
we had a pleasant stay the staff is really nice and has your listening great atmosphere in this hotel a few steps from the montjuïc park and min from the metro the only thing that bothered us a little was that there was no fridge in the room i would come back,1.0
we greatly enjoyed the food at this restaurant and would recommend it to those who are seeking some quick bites the view from the outdoor cafe was interesting as we overlooked the pool and a grand sculpture which i am still unsure of what it is called the cold soups were served in test tube type dishes and they were really good we had the beet and the cucumber soups the dishes were on the smaller side but that was fine with us i had the taco and loved it,1.0
the hotel is located just a few steps from the center of barcelona which is great the staff was extremely kind and they helped us in everything the room was clean and the bed was made by the time we got back so i loved it the only thing that bothered me was the noise because the walls were thin we heard the people in the room next to us and we also heard the scooters from the streets anyways i give stars,1.0
the hotel is very well placed in barcelona its quite close to some of the attractions such as magic fountains as well as metro would have preferred if the spanish architecture is represented more in its interiors recommend,1.0
the building is georgian and i liked the location reception area and the sitting areas the breakfast included fresh fruit salad and a variety of breads and full irish breakfast was very well cooked and presented and the menu offered a choice including smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and also my room small i was comfortable and everything was clean i had booked a single but the room had a double bed which pleased me i did see that there were spacious double rooms available,1.0
the doubletree hilton amsterdam centraal station is located right next to the main amsterdam train station and is very convenient from the airport by direct train in less than min and for taking the regional and international trains to other cities in the netherlands or in europe there are also many trams and buses that depart from in front of the central station so getting around amsterdam is easy from the hotel the rooms are modern but on the small side but they are very efficiently and effectively set up with a small storage cabinet for some clothes and the in room safe a work desk with a mac computer that also serves as the tv and a small coffee table with low chair for an additional seat i have hhonors gold and so enjoyed an upgrade to a king deluxe room with a nice view of the city center and also had complimentary breakfast at the buffet restaurant the buffet had a very good selection of food including some asian options vegetarian sushi chinese congee with chinese fried doughnut one can also order eggs and omelettes from the wait staff but i would probably skip that and just go stick with the buffet as the omelette i ordered was not very good and a bit dried out the location does mean a bit of a longer walk to areas of interest such as the dam square but the trams are plentiful and frequent and not expensive to take and,1.0

location could be better walk out the front door to stephens green grafton street and hop on the luas tram staff are lovely and i regularly meet people for coffee in the lobby its so relaxed and chilled out the bedrooms and conference rooms are really good,1.0
the hotel itself is great we had a junior suite which was quite spacious for european standards nice updated bathroom comfy bed huge balcony with a wonderful view of the acropolis the location is fantastic as well very central and within close proximity to most main areas of the city the only downfall was the service it was terrible but not what i used to front desk is just there to give you a room key or take your payment waitress at the hotel restaurant upstairs was the friendliest nor very quick to take our order calling room service was good but when we just needed some extra coffee pods or towels etc it was forever and we still could get what we needed all of the time only one gentleman downstairs bellman was extremely helpful throughout the whole trip it a shame because such a good hotel could be great with just some tweaks to their customer service,1.0

this was a really bad hotel double room is tiny and so uncomfortable that gives you the impression that someone tried to make your life difficult on attach the related photos there was a thing instead of a wardrobe i can not even describe it look the photo and remember that this is for persons was no bedside table instead they had tiny recesses on the bed wood where you can put a glass maximum nothing shower had such a topology that it impossible to control the temperature without being under the water yourself photo hairdryer rubbing broken knob is unworthy to mention what about a team of ants walking on the wall above your breakfast photo charge you even for photocopies photo the room price can not excuse any of the above i was not expecting a luxurious stay i was expecting something just basic this was not basic at i asked frontdesk if all the doubles are same as mine and they said yes do hope for better luck just do go,0.0

this will be our first time going to this particular hotel when we have visited amsterdam before we stayed further out however as it our anniversary my husband suprised me with a hotel in the middle of dam i was generally looking forward to the trip however when contacting the front desk i had spoken to different members of the management staff to confirm my reservations they were very polite on the phone and via email however the actual customer service for a hotel was rather disappointing they were unable to confirm my reservation and made no further am due to visit in the next few days and hope the experience in person will exceed my expectations rather then the past communication i had,0.0

the room was terrible it was so small with no sunlight and ages old carpet the pictures on trip advisor and other party sites are deceptive there might be some rooms which are better but the room that was offered to me was not at all i would have booked if i had seen earlier me and my friend arrived here at around midnight and as soon as we saw the room we decided to leave the receptionist gave us another room to check out but it was no different so we asked him to cancel the reservation and give us our money back which was around he said due to their hours cancellation policy he could do the money back with all these back and forth by this time it was and since we paid so much already we stayed in the night we stayed in with a suffocating feeling the whole night and the old smell on top of this there was only a thin sheet to cover no comforter or anything and the bed was like a box spring so disappointed not how i wanted my vacation to start i would not recommend this hotel,0.0
hotel centrally situated although we arrived very early in the morning the reception staff were able to hold our cases pending check in later all staff extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean and our twin room was very spacious i did email prior to arrival for a high floor but unfortunately enddd up on the second floor at the front which was very noisy through the night with people coming and going but you are in a city centre so it can not be helped would highly recommend,1.0

we only stayed one night but i wish we had stayed more this hotel is gorgeous in every way the roof top pool was busy and a bit hard to get a sun chair but that is all the complaints i have about this hotel the roof top bar and restaurant is stunning with great ambiance and views if you are looking for something special and a bit up market this is the place we had drinks downstairs in the bar area which was very old worldly with lots of charm i would recommend this place to anyone,1.0

we stayed for nights in preparation for a river rhine were situated on the floor facing the river and were able to watch all the river traffic pass view was nothing short of room size was good by european standards with all mod cons including minibar cable tv with movies facilities was a good size with illuminated makeup mirror and hair liked the fact there was an ironing board and iron in the room it makes all the difference if you have been on the road a reception and concierge staff were extremely polite and and bar staff were cheerful and is a gym and massage facilities tram stop to the city is away and there is a hotel shuttle that you can use as is a bike friendly city so it is no surprise to find the hotels have bikes for hotel is close to the waterfront central station science and maritime museums and the city centre which is tram stops would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
been to barcelona before we stayed at a hotel nearby so we already knew what to expect with the location the area may not be the however we preferred to be in the residential part instead of next to bland buildings lots of street art mismatched houses love it if that is not your thing then use google view prior to booking stop complaining about location we had our baby with us felt safe in the area when we walked a few minutes walk to metro shopping centre waterfront such a handy location you away from the bustle of city centre so it quieter but easy enough to get to the staff were really friendly helpful we honestly would have left them all a tip if we had any money left hotel room was fab very clean spacious even with our baby crib in it only issue we had was the people next to us were noisy for a couple of nights so it must be thin walls of course i can not fault the hotel regarding how our behave but i suggest maybe allocating families together if possible the swimming pool is quite small but did the job for us plus the views from the of the building are amazing degree view of barcelona and you can see the la sagrada família hear it ringing in the distance fabulous we felt very welcomed was sad to leave,1.0
this hotel gave us a warm welcome taxis queue outside the hotel which are cheap triple room was spacious cocktails in the rooftop bar were too strong to enjoy pool was was great selection of buffetgood location near to paramou metro,1.0
i was sceptical about booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews but decided to go for it for the location oh boy did i make the right decision not only was the location so perfect but the hotel itself was lovely also the location is snack bang in the middle of the old town the gothic quarter with everything that you could possibly want right on your doorstep the buildings in this area including the hotel are just stunning and exactly what i expected of barcelona there is a place called reial which is a square of gorgeous restaurants and bars which is a minute walk from this hotel and this turned out to be one of our most favourite places in barcelona the hotel was a little outdated which is the reason for giving it stars rather than but we had a gorgeous floor length window which was stunning when we opened it the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful when we asked about which buses and metros to take the metro is only a minute walk from the hotel also and this can take you stop away from the beach which is also a walk if you would rather walk overall i was very pleased with this hotel and would definitely return if i came back to barcelona i had a lovely time,1.0
great location right off syntagma square within walking distance to bus and metro and many attractions the staff was friendly and personable especially appreciated leonidis and vasiliki at the front desk very helpful with bus and public transportation information always a friendly and personable greeting very adequate buffet breakfast every morning rooms are clean beds comfortable always clean towels the first impression of the room is that it is sparse looking like a college dorm room after getting over that first impression room was very adequate for our needs as visitors in athens enjoyed the hotel courtyard for food beverage and relaxation not a super luxury hotel but for the price a good value and very comfortable location we would stay here again when visiting athens the staff here is great,1.0
such an amazing hotel with all commodities the pool is not really amazing and it can get really hot in there however the strong asset for this hotel is its staff everybody is extremely nice and smiling and welcoming from reception staff to housekeeping also the hotel is located just min driving from town centre and has a great shuttle service for his guests,1.0
we stayed at the castle hotel for two nights before a trip around ireland with a bus tour the castle hotel was the best hotel of our entire trip the breakfast satisfied the whole family including my two teenagers our flight arrived early but they were able to secure our luggage in a facility while we toured dublin it a short walk down to most of the sights and one of the hop on and off tour bus stops is right across the street,1.0
the westbury has been my home from home for almost five years now and remains my first choice for overnights in dublin centrally located it is convenient for shops restaurants and most business venues alike the rooms are decorated to a high standard although some can be a little small which is to be expected when you are in city centre locations the gallery bar and dining areas all tingle with a magical atmosphere especially during the latter half of the week and there can be few finer places to meet for a drink at the sidecar bar for a touch of gatsby in dublin front of house food beverage and concierge teams are all first class they usually anticipate my needs are prompt courteous and efficient so well done all the only minor downside is that the gym is a little small so if that matters to you plan for another activity like a city walk highly recommended,1.0
nothing ostentetios just pure class excellent location service and anything else you should expect to see in the star hotel nice beds excellent tea service and the star michelin restaurant next door,1.0

my wife and i always prefer the smaller boutique hotels when we travel and this one did not let us down most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional though small they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure the staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat shop and when to do what i believe there are only rooms at this hotel we had a floor room with a small balcony overlooking la ramblas the room was probably entry level thus very small but we have been in smaller you can hear the metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms we heard it on the floor but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep maybe because we were so exhausted every evening the floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites the roof top bar is very quiet as it is primarily hotel guest the pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails nice place for a drink before you head out for the hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area you are in the center of la ramblas and in the heart of the gothic quarter so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the la boqueria market which is almost next door you are also a very short walk from the,1.0

walking distance to major museums a great park and the canal cruise is right across the street we stayed one night after our cruise the room is spacious we had a nice view of the canal the coffee maker worked well wifi is free but make sure to bring your own adaptor for switch otherwise there is no place to plug a usa charger they did not have one at the reception we could purchase one for if we wishedthey stored our two suitcases for us for the night the breakfast was not included and was expensive,1.0
hotel balmoral hb is in a prime location for shopping long walks delicious paella even more delicious sangria and of course very close to la pedrera casa mila nearly every staff member i interacted with at hb was welcoming and accommodating our needs and requests the cleaning services were impeccable the cleaning staff was so generous and we never felt pressure to leave at a certain time or not return to our room at a certain time these amazing people were like ninjas great work i would highly recommend a stay at hb and be sure to include the hotel breakfast in your purchase the food is delicious with a wonderful mix of spanish cuisine like spanish omelette and my favorite pa amb tomaquet and classic european favorites like nutella and croissants plus this hotel has central air which is quite a luxury in european hotel and particularly important for fussy americans traveling during the summer months what a bonus wonderful facility location staff and experience,1.0
we stayed at the toren for a night trip to amsterdam and found it to be the perfect choice this boutique hotel location is wonderful on the canal side in a quieter area of the city but only a few minutes walk from some great restaurants the tram at westmarkt and just around the corner are the canal cruise boats the hotel is located in two beautiful old buildings about a minutes walk apart not a problem plenty of umbrellas provided to cope with any showers what makes this hotel stand out from all the others are the staff who are brilliant efficient courteous and ever helpful they even remember your name and the drink you ordered the previous night in the bar staff are an hotels most important asset and this hotel is rich in had a room in the annex building on the first floor overlooking the canal the double glazing kept it quiet and the aircon cool the stairs are very steep as you would expect but there is a lift if needed the room was a good size perfectly clean and interestingly decorated we had a jacuzzi bath in the room which was wonderful and relaxing and could be curtained off also separate shower great nespresso coffee maker free to use or kettle for tea did watch tv but the wifi connection was very fast the highlight was the extremely comfortable bed with a topper great sleep breakfast is served in the main building in another,1.0

it is a really updated hotel wich me and my friend loved we were just in amsterdam for one night and only stayed at the hotel for some hours to sleep so we didnt get to see as much as we would like to but we loved the big size of the room the fact that there was a bath tub and the room design was cool we will book our next stay in amsterdam here,1.0

we just spent nights at the elegant hotel estherea and were positively overwhelmed by everything this small hotel is lovely rooms are wonderfully appointed and uniquely decorated staff is quick knowledgeable and delightfully helpful the value for the price is awesome the tea room has all kinds of tea coffee fresh juices and gourmet light snacks available as is their beautiful bar the drinks and bar food were delicious and affordable too i recommend their mojito we found we liked their bar better than any other bar around and this hotel location is primo close to everything but on a quiet canal in a lovely neighborhood just one block away from restaurants shopping public transportation and two blocks from the amsterdam museum blocks to the flower market please do stay there we do want it to be booked solid the next time we try to make a reservation just kidding but we will always stay at hotel estherea in the future,1.0
the location while being able to use hilton points was the main incentive for us staying here during a long layover in dublin the location is ideal the hotel is within walking distance of most major attractions including the temple bar area just across the river however because it is just off the main tourist drag the location was quiet we took the bus in and back to the airport and the street stops are within a few blocks of the hotel the room was decorated similar to the photo in a modern style while comfortable and containing all the amenities we needed i found the room somewhat spartan but this did not affect our high opinion of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and provided some ideas for dinner locations outside of the hotel very satisfied with our short stay if we return to spend time in dublin i would plan on staying again,1.0
me my wife really liked this hotel from europe standard huge rooms great interior and lovely very helpful snd well stayed in a jounir suite which was we could have stayed longer,1.0

i only stayed at this property for a short days after a week in ibiza the hotel rooms are a bit small but very clean and well equipped situated perfectly in the gothic quarter very convenient to restaurants and shops as well as a good place to meet up for tours what really stood out with our experience was the doorman alonso he was the most distinguished and helpful of all the staff at this hotel from our experience it was very refreshing to find such professionalism in this day and age kudos to grand hotel central for putting such a wonderful team together i will definitely return to this hotel in my next visit to barcelona,1.0
my fiancé always finds fantastic hotels to stay in all over the world and banks mansion was no exception the staff were wonderful as soon as we walked through the door they offered is drinks and let us relax in the well stocked all inclusive bar whilst they checked us is we were given a map and lots of recommendations the room was very comfortable and had everything we needed as well as a trio of spirits drinks breakfast was very nice and plenty on offer i would recommend the omelette the hotel is within walking distance from the centre and other places of interest there is also a selection of resteraunts near by we will be staying at banks mansion on our return trips to amsterdam,1.0
we enjoyed our stay very much at this hotel itself was ideally placed it was very clean and well presented with some lovely period features and the dining area was very nice our room was clean but only thing we did like was it was an internal room with no window except to a service shaft which was very noisy the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful and i would recommend this hotel,1.0
yes the location is quite good walking distance to nice restaurants a nice shopping area and even the metro is close by the rooms are decently sized and clean and the morning breakfast was good the only reason the review gets two stars and not one is because the first couple of nights my stay was actually pleasant but from the third it all went downhill extremely from the third day i stayed nights i had a group of boys staying on the same floor as me their rooms were spaced out on the floor one or two at the side of me and another down the hall they used to get ready to head out i guessing to party around in the night so for a good hours i could just hear them walking in and out of each others rooms doors slamming loud talking in the corridor the sound proofing is appalling they even used to open the back windows and talk and move stuff around in the room this used to go on till about and restart when they got back in around called the reception the first night this happened the person at the desk visily said he would look into it and the noise did get toned down but the group also did head out for the night so i manged to get some second night the same issue continued and this time it was louder so i went down to the reception the person,0.0
this hotel was a great choice apparently taxi drivers frequently strike there so having a central location where i could walk everywhere was a life saver the view from my room of las ramblas was great if a bit noisy breakfast was terrific it a bit dated but overall a great hotel,1.0
loved this boutique hotel stayed two nights in a room overlooking the placa so much fun to people watch from your private terrace a bit noisy but that part of the experience the restaurant has great food and great service the concierge was very attentive loaned us a converter for our phones booked us at a superb flamenco club just one minute away highly recommend you will not be disappointed opt for drink and show only eat dinner elsewhere will definitely return one day many thanks to all the staff for their hard work and being so friendly,1.0

the staff at holiday inn express are exceptionally welcoming warm and friendly and always helpful megan and alejandra especially the rooms are cleaned daily the rooms and the hotel are designed simply they are warm comfy and welcoming the lobby also has a wonderful area with couches the beds in the rooms are comfortable the location for people who eat kosher is terrific being a few minutes walk away from local stores and restaurants all kosher as well as supermarkets with kosher departments in them the location of the hotel is great as well in the sense that there is a tram and metro that pass very close by and they can get you everywhere most importantly the city center and the central bus station if you keep kosher the hotel gives a kosher breakfast notice that the kosher area is opposite the non kosher area so if you see a hog picture you are not looking at the right foods for you the kosher breakfast is sufficient but not much more it includes slices of bread cut up cucumbers and tomatoes a boiled egg slices of yellow cheese fruit and some spreads honey jams butter drinks include juices and i think that more or less all if you do not keep kosher there is a much wider variety of foods for you i saw muffins of different sorts and all kinds of pastries looks good as this hotel is marked as an express hotel it is aimed for business,1.0
we visited in may i can not praise this hotel highly enough if ten stars were possible they would easily get them we visited with a poorly relation they accessed a wheelchair when required at last minute and looked after our relation as if they were looking after their own dear family member perfect rooms coupled with a fantastic restaurant brilliant brilliant staff central location this is one of the exceptional hotels in europe never mind amsterdam,1.0

my partner and i along with two friends recently enjoyed a day holiday in ireland we started just north of shannon in doolin and then drove south along the coast towards kinsale then we drove north east towards dublin our last stop before heading home to boston we stayed the the morrison by double tree hotel we initially thought it was an older hotel especially by outside however it is quite modern and fully furnished with everything a hotel guest would need we loved it here and will definitely be back,1.0

i spent nights in the nh krasnapolsky and i can definitely recommend this hotel first and foremost the service was amazing the staff were on top of things and very hotel location is right on the dam square so you are literally in the middle of amsterdam with a lot to do for those of you who will come by train from the airport it is a minute walk at most from the train decor was clean and well maintained the hotel breakfast was wonderful as well with many choices to choose from for those of you who are into hotel gyms this hotel does not have a gym they used to but after renovations they opted to remove the gym what they have done to compensate is to allow guest to use the gym at other nh hotels the closest one was a minute of the nicest aspects of the nh other than the location was the bar as it was run very professionally and had a very large drinks menu so definitely a must if you want a nice cocktail prior to an evening out on the room i stayed in was a bit small but being in the center of amsterdam that was expected the bed was very comfortable and it was very quiet at night so one could get a great night in all i would definitely recommend staying here especially if you want to be in the center of the city you will not regret,1.0
my husband and i stayed here in june and it is by far our favourite hotel in dublin the weather was fab the weekend we stayed so we spent a couple of hours at the amazing rooftop bar eating drinking and chillaxin in the sun unfortunately the restaurant was booked out for the time we needed evita was on at bord gais and we were going to see robbie williams at aviva so we had room service the rooms are large and well appointed with fabulous views over the square and water the staff were all very friendly and efficient and the breakfast was fab too did get to use the pool but will definitely be back,1.0

my partner and i wanted to visit a nice rooftop bar at la ramblas for our anniversary and my birthday we had heard that terraza la isabela was popular as our family members are regular customers at the hotel and we have had many friends that have visited your hotel and we got there we went to the reception at hotel but there was no greeting and the man at the desk did not look up he completely blanked us which was extremely rude we then got his attention and asked where the rooftop bar was located we went towards the lifts and another man asked us what we were doing we said to him we were looking to go to the rooftop bar he then grunted at us then looked me up and down before telling us and putting his hand up in a dismissive manner there was no explanation and i was extremely offended by this we were both dressed appropriately so we were very shocked the service we experienced at this hotel was disgraceful and i would discourage anyone from going here this ruined by birthday and our think the staff at this hotel need to go on a customer service course and learn some manners,0.0

the royal olympic is a lovely comfortable hotel that is located in easy walking distance to the many of the major sites in athens its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant which i shall review separately with breathtaking panoramic views that include the acropolis and the lycabettus hill the rooms were comfortable and well maintained although not we stayed at the hotel and both the beginning and the end of our trip both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool although our second room had only a stall shower but no bathtub as had been in the first the swimming pool was another welcome feature though not very large it was clean temperate and enough for swimming short laps there were sunbeds which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel as well at patio chairs and tables the staff was uniformly courteous and helpful and finally the price which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was quite reasonable though perhaps not the institution that it purports to be the royal olympic is certainly a comfortable place to stay when visiting athens,1.0
hotel is nice and is clean bathroom is great good location but im purely giving start for service it is appalling and disgraceful i rang for new towels and a iron the receptionist said they would bring it to my room after minutes of waiting i went down to the reception to see where it was she rudely told me she has no more iron left to borrow and she did not even apologise i am usually a easy going guy and do not expect everything to be perfect but when you pay for a four star hotel you expect good friendly service and manners also for a four star hotel there is a kettle but no tea or coffee there should be a iron in each room or at least a sufficent amount of irons you customers can borrowshame on hotel catalonia you should get your staff to learn hospitality,0.0
we stayed there for nights with two kids we had a junior suite which ideal for a family of four the hotel is really nice close to the beach and to a shopping mall there is huge playground in the mall where kids can play the executive lounge has a kids area for the children my kids preferred to have breakfast there because of that is very nice in all areas of the hotel we did try the definitely recommend this hotel to anyone teaseling with their family,1.0

i stayed at volkshotel for nights a couple of weeks ago this hotel has its own unique style of retro feelings i booked a standard room but was upgraded to the sir standard room at the corner with two large windows of city view which was excellent the room was cosy functional and fun it makes staying at a hotel is not only about sleeping but has some positive feels to it i especially love the large long desk by the window that i can eat read and put everything on it i did not use the hot tub on the rooftop but it seems fun there are many spaces on the ground floor to meet and hang out overall staying at volkshotel gave me some new experience it not the most luxurious nor the most inexpensive hotel but it definitely a fun comfortable one oh did i mention the wibautstraat metro station is just outside the door of minutes of walking making the traffic super easy,1.0

easily a star grande luxe very best hotel in athensit is always an experience to stay in a truly grand hotel in any european city as we have a great tradition in europe when it comes to such elaborate full service days sometimes it is still a good experience and sometimes it is a disappointing experience but rarely is it a great experience so many grand hotel properties are in need of serious investment and so many operators are only interested in squeezing profits out and putting as little investment as possible back the financial problems suffered by greece all so well publicised i a tired grand hotel instead i have experienced a hotel that could put some of the grand hotels in london to shame this is a truly grand hotel with service to match and everything is immaculate the public areas the accomodation and the staff what a lovely part of this hotel has been fitted out with taste and in an exquisite manner with total attention to detail arrival is excellent reception is excellent the french guest relations lady could not have tried harder and the introduction from the butler was as good as it better than the butler service at the plaza central park nyc where they simply say hello and let you know they exist here they meet you at reception on arrival are very proper but not stuffy none of the team here are stuffy show you to your accomodation ensure everything is perfect,1.0
our family of traveled for vacation from the states rooms were very good size for european hotel rooms unfortunately we needed two rooms but this was not a large inconvenience as our children are and the staff was extremely helpful and made checking in and out very efficient car parking was very close only downside was the distance to downtown min walk to the nearest off bus stop we managed this several times but would have preferred to be a little closer however taxi service and local buses are very close hotel appears to be more intended as a business clientele vs families but was not a hindrance we noticed that other tour companies were present during our stay overall experience was very good,1.0
this clean modern located hotel has a few quirks which were hardly noticeable the first few days but which did become troublesome with a longer the good stuff so many of barcelona treasures are within walking distance and the rest are reachable by bus or metro in the nearby square a wonderful department store a half block away was perfect for finding toiletries gourmet food and gifts a top notch vegetarian restaurant is just a short walk away the hotel staff members are kind and the stuff that may rankle over time the breakfast gets monotonous we supplemented with purchased items the street is narrow and very echoey and barca street life is lively so unless you can live with artificially chilled air sleep will be disturbed the sheets and towels are this hurt my skin and even though the very helpful senyora allowed me to select sheets by feel and smell one day when i mentioned this the next day it was back to the same i really hope the hotel can correct some of these things because it is otherwise such a fun and pleasant place and good value and if you stay or even nights you may not be bothered by them at all,1.0
a beautiful hotel in a great location delicious food and staff anxious to please we would certainly stay here again the decor is what i imagine a hotel in india might feel like we upgraded and had a courtyard room lovely atmosphere,1.0
walking distance to almost everything in dublin and we really enjoyed the downstairs went there for lunch dinner had the very reasonably priced euro buffet breakfast every morning which was great and a few times just sat at the bar drinking a few cocktails and listening to some traditional irish music room was basic but a decent size and comfortable we absolutely stay here again,1.0
very nice hotel with beautifully refurbished and clean rooms friendly and helpful staff located in the center of barcelona bus stop to get to the airport just around the corner and pivot point for public transportation right in front of the hotel,1.0
we stayed in an executive king room which was a decent size and we appreciated having a mini fridge and small table with chairs staff was responsive and helpful when we could not get the tv to work and some of the lights also when we stopped at the front desk with any questions the bed was comfortable as well we managed to use the fitness center of our mornings before setting out for the days tourist stuff which was nice to be able to only problem we ran into with the hotel was when on our or of nights we had bottled water chocolates and the newspaper appear and we had not had those things the first nights we then checked more info on their website and determined we should have been getting those perks all along we mentioned this when we checked out and had a discussion with the about this and that we expected a reduction to our room rate for those nights we had not had the perks she did take off for nights and gave us a big box of chocolates to take with us and said she would contact us once she had a chance to explore what went wrong and when with the housekeeping staff we never heard anything further from her however we would consider staying here again as it was a comfortable hotel,1.0
our family booked rooms in july and stayed over for nights at hotel to discover barcelona we greatly enjoyed our stay at hotel the location is perfect we could easily walk to most places of interest and find restaurants walking distance the children loved going to the pool after a long day out and about to relax and cool down the rooftop bar had wonderful vistas the staff was really welcoming and knowledgeable nice lounge area fantastic spa the hotel is very well maintained and very clean on our last day we were treated to a gothic quarter free tour by the hotel which was really interesting only downside was getting a bit of street noise since it is in a lively area overall we would highly recommend this hotel and would love to come back ourselves,1.0
i think that this place offered good value nice location close to beach and restaurants and bars also close to metro station i would stay here again thanks to the staff at the hotel enjoyed my stay here,1.0

we stayed here for a few nights a year ago we loved the location right near to the museum and the canal boat trip loved the local people they were so friendly and helpful the hotel was quirky and the room was clean and big enough with a comfy bed the breakfast was vast and so enjoyable in a great spacious restaurant the town was beautiful with large squares and outdoor dinning with great restaurants and coffee shops i love holland,1.0
as a family of we stayed in a bedroom bathroom apartment at this small hotel and we were thrilled with our stay what a great little hotel perfect location excellent helpful staff beautifully appointed rooms faultlessly clean great bathrooms well equipped modern cool and comfortable can not rave about this hotel enough you can walk everywhere from this location yet it is quiet small balcony breakfast hamper with local products served in our room each morning and a welcome drink on our arrival it really is fabulous and i would recommend it to anyone thank you for a wonderful stay,1.0

this hotel is well located in barcelona within easy walking of most gaudi sights and la rambla the decor is really stylish and the bathrooms in particular were not only well designed but really attractive the rooms were a good size wifi was fine it has a small pool and patio area when the heat of barcelona becomes too much the hotel also introduced the concept of a time for wine with a happy hour which was lots of fun although often it was hard to find the staff who were promising to provide the wine,1.0
we had a wonderful stay there was of us and this hotel was roomy for european standards there was a water park wit large pools that belong to the adjacent hotel but we had use of within walking distance to center city i t was a great stay and the staff was hospitable,1.0
quite a good place to stay nice architecture rooms creative notes in every corner friendly and warm ambassadors who are energetic well located near the tram line and also the canteenm sells the day ticket trams,1.0
one to avoid and i do say that lightly stayed here as it was adjacent to the iveagh gardens and a dropkick murphy gig we were attending with good friends on the face of it a half decent hotel but let down very badly once you scratch the surface no aircon the rooms are melting at best but if you manage to negotiate the safety clasp on the window you can get some air into the room but then the million seagulls keep you awake from the crack of dawn which in july is obviously early just as the brain is beginning to accept the squeaking seagulls the hotel offers a new alarm call tap tap tap on the door so i open the door to a sheepish eastern european girl who is already walking away down the corridor sorry i just checking rooms forgive me but that cheap cheap cheap check out is actually noon so why are you waking us up never ever again disgraceful city centre hotel,0.0
we stayed for three nights as a family of four with two children the hotel was extremely accommodating they put us close together and made sure the boys had a frosted glass door on their bathroom we were able to check in early to one of the rooms helping us feel a lot hotel is quirky with great and unique design features really fun the rooms are really comfy the beds reminded me of the hypnos beds used by premier inn really comfy there was a choice of pillows and there loads of plug sockets mirrors and lighting there a nespresso machine and three free pods each day as well as english blend tea bags sweeteners milk and sugar however if we went back we might bring some of our own pods as we could see any in the local shops there also a free spacious safe which gives you good security really impressive there are two supermarkets about a ten minute walk away with a full range of goods to buy and they near the tram stop which takes you into town we bought a three day pass about euros each which gives free travel on trams buses and the metro get the number one to central or the to anne franke ate out breakfast at the de vondel tuin in vondel park minute walk is great and dinner at beer oslos was fabulous but i do a separate review on those the pool was lovely and warm for,1.0
my daughter and i stayed at this hotel last week and we liked it quite well it was clean the staff friendly and the breakfast was good and we didnt need to stop for a lunch break as breakfast was filling the view was great too we were on the third floor and we saw and heard lots of seagulls and life going by on the millenium and ha penny bridges which were directly opposite the hotel the location was great you could go nearly everywhere on foot as it is very near to nearly all the attractions one negative review for people who tend to have dufficulty sleeping is that there is a pub under the hotel so there is a lot of noise till about in the morning however when one books one is told when booking that there will be noise in the evening till the early hours of the morning so one knows what to expect in our case we both slept well as after a long day of sightseeing shopping and ending the day with a beer or two we were usually tired out all in all we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to be within easy reach of main attractions,1.0
convenient hotel for access to the rai a nice stroll to the expo centre or the train hotel has a business hotel vibe to it clean professional not too fussy the room was small by international standards what you would typically find in london clean and comfortable bedroom and bathroom with all the usual amenities including an iron and ironing board the lobby area was large which was useful as i arrived with a crowd of other people i never managed to eat at the restaurant but it looked nice with modern décor and a large selection on the menu,1.0
great room super location friendly staff can walk almost anywhere in city centre from here lovely breakfast with a big selection of traditional and healthy warm pool great showers,1.0
very nice hotel in athens the location around the hotel do look that great but i thought it was very safe walked around in the night with no problem and people who lived around there were very nice the hotel is clean and very comfortable and the bathroom was nice too,1.0
it was not our first stay at cassidys it was our but the first with our two children and years old the family room was big enough that all of us have space to relax everything was clean and we had enough towels and toilet paper for all of us the staff was always friendly and helpful everything is so near you do need a car thanks a lot and we see us again,1.0
not a bad hotel but when your flight gets cancelled and you let the hotel know that you will be joining them the following evening and you arrive to be told that they have given your room to someone else and the only room available is a double and of you are travelling so my partner had to sleep on the floor the first night of our stay so not a great start rooms were clean and tidy food was good to plenty of choice even for gluten intolerant people,1.0
on our first visit to dublin we chose the clontarf castle hotel because of its historic features and reputation for service once we arrived we saw that the hotel had nicely integrated modern decor with the castle walls and interior our room one of the few junior suites was warmly decorated and spacious with angled windows that overlook dublin also appreciated the helpfulness of the staff especially one who late in the evening tracked down and delivered to our room two long extension cords so my wife could plug in a medical device at her bedside staff in the restaurants were less attentive but helpful once we approached them with requests i recommend the clontarf castle hotel for dublin visitors with a proviso that visitors should be prepared to take a taxi ride from the hotel to get to attractions in central dublin,1.0
casa camper is truly special and unique i spent nights here and it became home i had the corner suite and it was incredible space comfort light filled and the most heavenly bed did i say the bed yes that bed is the best i have had in all my team is amazing and they make a stay at this property feel full of warmth just incredible enzo francesco valentina morgan isa and so many more i can not remember everyone name but truly the team here is a gift plus the pepe manager of the hotel is so breakfast is excellent and the wonderful team member from argentina who prepares the meals is so so kind and will get you anything you want eggs pancakes whatever the rooftop terrace of this property honest bar and hours snack area really make casa camper feel like it is your home this is my new home when i return to barcelona thank you casa camper team,1.0
a wonderful hotel great for the sights in the city very friendly and helpful staff we booked a twin and got a room with double beds the room was very clean and comfortable huge irish breakfast with smaller options for us wimps breakfast is served in murrays bar which is attached to the hotel and is very comfortable we were served by bernie who is a wonderful lady and made us very welcome this hotel will go on my favourites list for any further trips to dublin,1.0
stayed nights for the concert at corke park lovely hotel very clean and spacious rooms had dinner one first night and food was excellent and great value very friendly and helpful staff would definitely stay again,1.0
the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,0.0
of staff who i encountered were very friendly everything was explained fully regarding room keys breakfast times etc the room was extremely clean though not the largest i have ever stayed in i am dairy intolerant so there are often foods that i cant have on the morning i stayed for breakfast i encountered anushka a wonderful chef a very young lady who couldnt be more helpful she baked me an alternative to the usual sweet pastries which make up part of a european breakfast nothing was too much would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
so the lobby is gorgeous and the staff very nice and efficient but the rooms a disappointment it reminded me of a dorm room there is no closet as such a rod with some hangers there a built in tiny sitting area with a table that is small and uncomfortable my deluxe room overlooked the roof and air conditioning ugh if that was my view i guess the standard rooms overlook the dumpsters the executive lounge is nice but not big enough it seems every one can get it and there were kids running around everywhere awful the person working in the evening does have enough help so it takes forever for things to be refilled and she runs it like a military operation when dinner is over and desserts come out heaven help the person who goes up to get a piece of dessert you be told to sit down and wait also this is the first executive lounge that does offer bottled water i am a platinum rewards member so i stay in marriott a lot and know i just do was working properly in our room one evening causing it to drip all night on the stone floor it was a danger zone in the morning to not fall with towels at a premium in this property it was tough we reported it to the front desk at and returned around in the evening we were instructed in the morning to check at the front desk before,0.0
the westbury is in an excellent location on grafton street near trinity college upscale and souvenir shops gardens museums and churches the staff food and services are incomparable and the rooms are well appointed and immaculate highly recommend you stay here if you plan on going to dublin we will be back,1.0
we checked in for one night at this hotel at about the just went off when we called the front desk we were told the technician was at home and would not be able to attend to the issue until the following morning when we asked to be moved we were told the hotel was full when we asked to speak to the manager on duty we were told she is not answering her phone we ended up suffering through the night at c or degrees beds are saggy and wifi weak what a terrible place lacking any sense of customer service the only saving grace is the location but for the money i am sure we can do better,0.0
excellent offering for the cost great location and friendly staff to add the welcome is friendly the rooms clean modern and tidy and everything works well i have no hesitation is recommending this hotel and am staying again later this week,1.0
located only min from the airport and a shuttle available to get you there and back on arrival the check in was easy and fast we let them know we needed a shuttle back in the morning so they wrote our names on a list the room was a little bit on the tiny side the dresser drawer opened and hit the bed before it could be opened all the way its a little inconvenient when the blow dryer was attached to inside of that drawer just a weird set up we had to put the room key in a slot in order for the lights in the would come on just a small room overall had to jump over the bed to get back and fourth with people in it along with large suite area is large and it was very busy that night the service was still very good it was already late so we did try any food only dessert we ended up bringing our second drinks to our room,1.0
we stayed in amsterdam for nights and had the best time at this hotel very clean well looked after hotel service at the desk and the was fantastic rooms were perfect and close to the van gogh museum,1.0
very helpful staff location is outside the city but very well connected to central through bus and tram the rooftop is really cool staff is polite and knowledgeable there is a kitchen available to make your own breakfast,1.0
opted for this hotel as it appeared to offer very good services for the price and was well located on the metro system was not disappointed as this hotel is lovely and provided all that we needed the rooftop pool was a nice bonus as was the free spa entry albeit with restricted times the reception staff all spoke good english and were very friendly and helpful the rooms were large and clean and were serviced daily the bar area with snacks available was clean and well run and the prices were not expensive the metro was a minute walk from the hotel and very easy to use we used it every day to get about the only possible issue could be that you are not in the centre of the city but this was not a problem for us,1.0
really nice hotel with friendly and helpful reception staff great location further west of the main city centre but we enjoyed being away from the main bustle still walking distance to metro and connecting bus routes as per previous reviews we seen there were no facilities in the room which is always nice to have we did have an iron either but used the iron room downstairs in the hotel on the first evening to iron all our clothes which was fine also the wifi inside the hotel worked ok for us useful to be able to message home we visited during heat and the air conditioning in the room was excellent and really cooled us negative was the very thin walls our room had a connecting door to the room adjacent to us and on the first evening we overheard a long intimate exchange which made us feel quite uncomfortable would be happy to return for future visits to barca,1.0
the hotel is really nice and with easy access to public transportation airport city center and hop off busses the public bus to the city center is only minutes and then minutes walk there is a very nice square with restaurants pubs and small store near by the hotel the hotel is an old well preserved castle with nice rooms the hotel staff is accommodating and friendly the breakfast is great and worth the extra euros the wifi works great all in all a great experience which we would like to repeat and definitely recommend,1.0
i just returned from a stay at the el palace hotel i was most impressed with the staff who truly tried their best to make our stay enjoyable my favorite was amal from guest who went out of her way each and every day she worked during our stay to ensure our stay was perfect and that all of our needs were met she was so very welcoming and warm and helpful amal helped to make our trip extra special i also so enjoyed guiseppe who works in the winter garden restaurant he was so friendly and enjoyable and made our dining experience fun,1.0
fantastic hotel staff were great and very helpful surroundings and decor lovely the room was great and comfortable absolutely loved it at this hotel highly recommended to anyone has concierge too so your bags are taken care of they are all polite,1.0
stayed in the mecure hotel amsterdam city as a couple july for nights i have no negative things to say about this hotel it modern clean and stylish our room had a beautiful view over looking the canal and we had the perfect nights sleep in a cosy king sized bed our room had a large flat screen tv with english channels an espresso machine and a kettle with a selection of teas a mini fridge with free soft drinks and bottles of water which was refilled everyday again for free the staff were excellent and very informative was quick and easy and the staff gave as very detailed information about trams and buses which was great the reception staff even ordered our takeaway for us and booked a taxi back to the airport for a good price over all great customer service the hotel is near amsterdam city centre but we were aware of that when we booked the hotel is only a minute walk to the metro and then a minute ride on the tram to the city centre quick and easy we bought a day tram pass at the hotel for it runs every minutes until half past at night and so the location of the hotel really was a problem over all i would recommend this hotel and really enjoyed our stay in amsterdam,1.0
i had to stay here when my easyjet flight was cancelled i arrived very late and was sweaty and exhausted and annoyed but despite this reception were friendly and helpful as easyjet hotel of choice they are probably used to dealing with frustrated customers unfortunately when i was there all the electronic keys had stopped working so you had to be escorted to your rooms to have them unlocked am sure they have that fixed soon the room was odd seemed like a studio with the bathroom sink in the middle of it they provide separate shampoo and conditioner soap and body gel which was very useful given my unexpected visit the bed was big and nice and clean however pillows were the lumpiest i seen and i almost could sleep because of it another thing that stopped me sleeping peacefully was that walls are paper thin i hear could anyone talking outside in the hallway and there were a few loud excited people who woke me up the tv is enormous but has the volume fixed to quite a low level so you ca go above it this makes sense given the lack of sound proofing but was a little too quiet for me to hear the breakfast was very nice quite a small selection but really good quality nice spanish tortilla and chorizos nespresso coffee overall it was fine but the noise factor would put me staying again even though the transport links are very good right next,0.0
enjoyed two nights at this hotel booked two rooms for a family of four both with balconies overlooking the courtyard nice to have a pool available for a swim after visiting room size good staff very nice would easily recommend to other travellers,1.0
what i like about the hilton brands is that you always know that you will have a pleasant stay in a comfortable room this hotel is no exception the staff is friendly and the rooms are nice and spacious and a great bonus for hilton in europe is that you get washcloths and an iron in the room which is not common in europe,1.0
the hotel is in a very central location and staff was very friendly and than that i would not stay again it had a strange smell in corridors and in the bedroom our bedroom had a small window facing the wall so it was very dark bed was extremely uncomfortable breakfast was of a low quality lacking any fresh produce barcelona has got fantastic restaurants and cafes so do waste your breakfast here,0.0
while this hotel is quite a walk from the it was clean and comfortable and the room was large the property is well manicured and the structure is historic we ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a nice steak staff were very friendly and helpful,1.0
we spent nights at the american hotel in amsterdam in late july it is a very nice facility in an excellent location it looks a bit out of the way on a map but it takes only about minutes to walk to dam square assuming you do stop in the shops along the way about to the museum district canal boats are right there and restaurants are plentiful near the hotel a starbucks dunkin donuts for those who must have american stuff our room was pleasant and no street noise felt safe to walk all around would definitely stay again staff very helpful,1.0

we wanted to stay in a hotel in dublin but knew we be tired at the end of our two week trip and possibly out of travel funds so we opted for this hotel with its good price and convenient location the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being so busy the room was clean and quiet we faced inside but the location is definitely the best part of staying here it so close to all of the restaurants stores and sites we loved being in the heart of the action the front desk arranged for an excellent cab driver to take us to the airport extremely early in the morning as we drove out of the neighborhood we could believe how many people were still out partying and walking the streets which reveals our age our stay at the drury was a great way to end our trip,1.0
we stayed for nights at the corner hotel the building has undergone a renovation and has a luxurious modern feel the decor is really quite lovely especially in the reception and restaurant areas we had a room at the front of the building on the floor superior room which was very bright airy and peaceful there is a rooftop pool on level which is a really nice space and a great place to unwind after exploring barcelona on foot there are plenty of restaurants cafes and bars nearby we had breakfast at a local cafe each morning but it worth mentioning that most places do not open until so if you an early riser it might be best to eat breakfast at the hotel why did i not rate the hotel stars the room is very small indeed and does feel pokey the water pressure in the shower is terrible and there no iron for guests to use only a paid laundry service on the whole however this is a decent hotel and i would return,1.0
we chose this hotel over many others given the great reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed location was fab a short walk from the main centre attractions travelled from the airport using the train and metro which cost pp received a warm greeting with a cold glass of cava room was clean and tidy and very modern pool area is small but what we expected given city centre location staff were excellent and keen to help with area to sunbathe if beds were taken concierge service excellent my only criticism would be the the cost of the drinks for a small glass of coke and for cocktails would certainly stay again,1.0
my friend and i stayed for a weekend break the location of this place is excellent being in ths heart of the city centre with it shops and restaurants and only a short walk to the infamouse talbot street if that where you are heading the airport bus service drops off on the same road so the airport transfer could be simpler staff at the hotel are very helpful and knowledgeable check in is a breeze if checking out you can stow your luggage for a few hours safely it basic but it clean and comfortable we were in a room at the front of the building it was a bit noisy with people walking past outside but it was worth it from our perspective to be situated so close to everything would stay again,1.0
easy to resume everything was just amazing we travel the world but this place is just the best ever in all aspect chapeau service cleanness of the room the hotel in general the valet service the employees the concierge everything is just wow,1.0
very disappointed to have had such an experience when you pay around the rooms are new and a confortable bed and big the room service is very good level and people very kind the plates could be more elaborated for a they remain very the breakfast is the service must be ameliorated you must run to have your coffee and your bill to in this category of are supposed to serve you the orange juice too the room cleaning service is a real disaster due to which i would never suggest this hotel or come back pillows which smell floor not cleaned coffee which is absent paper absent people who enter to the room despite the privacy laber put outside too many mistakes for a hotel of such a category very disappointed,0.0
catalonia born is the ideal place to stay in comfort and style in the funky el born area super comfortable beds spacious bathrooms clean and well decorated it does the adage good things come in small packages proud the rooftop pool is tiny but offers respite from the heat and crowds our balcony could fit two people standing but overlooked the glorious street below the courtesy buffet daily has a small range of fresh and healthy food salads sandwiches something hot a soup yoghurt milk drinks good coffee snacks to recharge the batteries a lovely touch we could find an airbnb we liked in this super location the extra we paid for this quiet hotel was worth it as we found barcelona an exhausting city highly recommend if it fits your budget,1.0
we stayed at the corner hotel by chance our other hotel would accept a late arrival so we needed somewhere reasonably priced for our first evening in barcelona i found it by chance on tripadvisor and was sold by the good reviews it certainly did guy working on the reception desk was very welcoming and helpful googling some food recommendations for us for a late night bite to eat his suggestion turned out to be the best meal we had in barcelona our room was clean modern and felt like brand new and the bed was so comfortable i never wanted to had breakfast the next day thinking it was included in our room price it was so that was an additional price but it was very good and our fault for not checking the hotel even has a rooftop pool which is a nice bonus on a hot day as the location is central and not near the beach a few more sun loungers would be good summarise we had a very short but very sweet stay at this hotel and i would almost certainly recommend it to anyone coming to barcelona i glad we were able to stay there,1.0
i booked my stay last minute on the day i was travelling the reservation person i dealt with stephen was so helpful and friendly we got a great rate for bed and breakfast perhaps due to how late we booked when we arrived the hotel was quite busy but they had every desk open we were checked in by a lovely duty manager unfortunately i forget her name on the day we stayed the weather in dublin was very warm this hotel does not have but when we got to our room they already had the blinds closed and a fan running to cool the air i hadnt stayed her before but i will definitely go back,1.0
the best thing about hotel niki is it location to tour ancient athens it is more than adequate it did have some repairs that cropped up but handled well it very good that they have capable and patient front desk staff and a maintenance guy on call day and night to deal with things we had to move to another room but effie was extremely helpful as was the maintenance man and the cleaning staff person all that made it very tolerable to stay there the cleaning staff keeps things nice and clean the breakfast is a full buffet of choices with the traditional fresh tomatoes feta and black olives and greek pastries anastasia the lady tending the breakfast was fun to talk to tip her she works hard effie at reception desk really went above and beyond to help us with changing reservations giving us two favorite places to eat helping us get our room problems solved and arranging coffee and early breakfast item when we had to catch a very early flight i recommend this place for all of these reasons,1.0
visited for two nights after a close friend recommendation hotel is front to one of the main canals as many of the old buildings in amsterdam the arrival was perfect as they we expecting us and after short check inn we were presented to our lovely rooms you are also offered one of four aromas scents for your personalized ambiance in the rooms the hotel is small and has the feel of palace with modern elegant decoration it boast two main restaurants one brazerrie and one international with two michelin stars its also has a small very coozie bar perfectfor a date or nightcap breakfast is also fantastic with a buffet of high quality ingredients and some to order items such as eggs or pancakes only drawback some rooms dont have a door in the bathroom so if you are in the bath all is know in the room last staff is highly trained fluid in english and attentive to detail cost is high but if you can paid for this luxury option it worth every euro highly recommendable,1.0
my wife and i stayed here the first three nights of our honeymoon and the location ca be beat when visiting athens we were able to walk to lunch dinner and the shops around town in breakfast was included with our booking and i would highly recommend it there is a great selection and a lot to pick from including mimosas the staff was very friendly and helpful our only reason to not give it a perfect was because of the misleading photos of the views they show pictures on their website of a view of acropolis from the hotel but we were unable to find out exactly where that view came from do think it was this hotel again though the location is perfect high recommend this hotel,1.0
very happy with this hotel decent size friendly reception who greeted us kindly informed us about the area called a taxi for us etc great location as well only about minutes walk to la rambla and gothic quarter etc clean and affordable deserves much more then stars,1.0
we spent one night at the arlington hotel bridge after arriving in dublin en route to westport we chose this hotel because of the location and it ended up being a great choice if you want to be close to the action in dublin this location ca be beat it north of the river so a tad quieter than being in the temple bar area but just as convenient for accessing restaurants pubs shopping and many tourist attractions from the airport the hotel is easily accessible from any of the city centre buses both the dublin bus and air coach stop on street just around the corner from the hotel although the stop is closer huge perk that we did even consider when booking is that this hotel has fantastic amenities of its own the hotel bar and restaurant are lively with live music in the evenings it is also the location of the celtic nights dinner and show which hotel guests can take in at a reduced rate we also took advantage of the hotel breakfast which was great as had a great stay and would definitely stay again when in dublin,1.0
a very nice hotel comfortable beds are important to us and the bed was wonderful they even had king size bed for us we had to arrange for this ahead the location is prime centrally located close to what we wanted to experience in dublin i would highly recommend jurys inn it was a great stay,1.0
went for meal with work colleagues very disappointed with reserved tables which were unsuitable asked for other options really did like the attitude of the supervisor well think she was and found she had a very smart attitude and a comment was a made that i did not like about the numbers for the booking service improved when another waitress took over but we were not asked if we wanted another drink when drinks came order was partially wrong after us having to ask for another drink the food was bland and deserts only ok i have eaten bar food in this hotel and it has always been really good so it hard to understand how the restaurant food was so bland overall stressful experience felt like we were high maintenance even though we are not definitely wo be back on a work team night out considering we were spending over euro one expects more and should be made feel welcome we were asked if everything was ok but i did feel this was genuine i will return to bar as service and nibbles always good but wont be returning with work colleagues as was unfortunately embarrassed for recommending this venue we had another corporate meal night out last week and went elsewhere your staff need to up their attitude to get repeat clients back as i say the waitress was actually friendly and nice but the supervisors attitude was not good the only positive thing about the night was,0.0

second time to stay here in years we love the bang for your buck and great location the staff is always friendly and helpful plus the place is clean good variety at breakfast and lots of seating the rooftop bar or lounge has an exceptional view of the acropolis right behind the hotel is one of my favourite areas psiri which has so many great tavernas and a great area to hang at night and have a drink or coffee ermou street which is where most of the name brand stores are is only a few blocks away every thing like monastiraki plaka the metro are so close to get to plus the athens market to get a few snacks are within a couple of minutes,1.0
very nice hotel with rooftop pool wish there were more seats by the pool can be use the restaurant so ca tell you how it was but the seating outside was not available for food service only drinks we woke up in the middle of the night because the staff was clearing dishes not a good time to do that but mostly very good and convenient to sights bus taxi etc,1.0

hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating we had several issues with our first room including an ugly view of the apartments next door where we could see the tenants sitting outside their balcony and inside their apartment we asked to change our room they ended up changing our room from atrium view to an executive city view this room was much more spacious including the bathroom and had a beautiful city view plus we ended up on the floor instead of the floor the higher up the better the view also i recommend a visit to the rooftop for a wonderful view of the acropolis either day or night on our check out day we had to leave at to catch our flight which meant no breakfast for us since it opens until anyway my husband asked demetrios bell boy if there was anyway we could get some breakfast to go he was so helpful and managed to get us two bags with various breakfast items like a continental breakfast that helped start our day thank you to everyone at wyndham grand athens special thanks to sofia rigopoulou reservations constantinos front desk demetrios bell boy and everyone else at wyndham next time we visit athen we will definitely stay at the wyndham,1.0

the hotel boasts quality in everything from service to material room with good beds something characterized by hotel age but clean and well service both at the reception bar and restaurants restaurant filigrana is definitely worth a visit roof terrace is unique with its spectacular views and beautiful furniture from here you can see la fontena magica with its spectacular light wish for a bigger hotel gym but otherwise forward to my next visit,1.0
stayed one night while visiting for a concert hotel is well located for the temple bar area friendly front of house are quiet clean and tidy nothing to stand out as exceptional or worth the price asked though room was average size nice bathroom plenty of tea and coffee comfy bed did eat at the hotel so ca comment on the food bar was good good in all just average for the price charged,1.0
if you want to be in the heart of the old city but do want to pay for a four star option musik boutique is the hotel for you you a very short walk from the cathedral and tons of places to order tapas we were also able to make the minute walk to the beach one day the hotel will let you use its beach towels so no need to pack those overall it a rather clean hotel the turn down service was we checked in we found a puddle of yellow liquid in our shower the next day there was a leak in the ceiling above the shower which better explained it i told the gentlemen at the front desk after both occurrences that was the only real unpleasant part of the if you book with an ota that has you pay up front make sure the representative at the front desk does charge you again when checking in this happened for my stay and the situation was rectified when i pointed it out,1.0
this hotel was a great find in the city of barcelona we were so well located to shopping restaurants and bars city sights and the beach we took public transport to and from the airport which was so easy we were also able to walk a lot which is a great way to discover the city we felt nothing but safe throughout our stay they have a hour desk and you have to buzz in during the late hours if you wish they can keep your passports in a safe free of charge while the furnishings are older the hotel is very well kept the room was clean we stayed in a private room with a full bathroom our room was basic two towels two bars of soap and a fan what else do you really need though all staff at the hotel were more than helpful a special thanks to marc antoni was so kind and friendly on a future trip to bcn i have no doubt where i will be staying,1.0
very comfortable bed in a nicely decorated room with a great coffee machine nice big bathroom the room was cleaned very well and restocked location to see the sights in a very freindly city where everyone wants to have a chat with reception staff were really helpful and knowledgeable in how to get aboutand what to house restaurant looked good but we had a reservation already booked elsewhere so did was included in our package and was we return here yes without a doubt and have recommended it to friends looking to travel to amsterdam,1.0

our family stayed here in june in a family room just overnight as we were heading off on a cruise the next rooms were modern and ar conditioned clean and walking distance to las within a few minutes walk of the metro which we used the next morning to visit sagrada buffet breakfast did not have a huge variety but was good for us given our early morning start the quality of what was offered was the price a good choice for us,1.0
we stayed one night as a stopover before heading to spetses so did get to make use of any of the hotels facilities spa rooftop pool etc the location in elevated upmarket kolonaki suited our purpose as we were looking to explore the city this time whilst not far from town this area does offer a breather from the full scale madness of central athens we were warmly welcomed found the front desk crew to be outstandingly helpful efficient our room was in the new eco chic wing was spacious enough pleasantly but modestly decorated in a muted palette of beige white airy light with a balcony but not much of a view we slept well suffered no noise pollution the bathroom was fitted out in contemporary minimal style was fine though the silly vase like basin is a classic case of form over function we did eat as there is a superb restaurant right next door but we did have drinks in the floor bar the views are astounding surely the best in the city drinks are pricey for the privilege of such vistas but it worth a visit decor is a little dated up here as is the case in many other areas of the hotel from a decor perspective the hotel struggles to scrape a star rating for the price paid though i was more then happy with our choice the fantastic views excellent staff made it a winner for our brief visit,1.0
first stayed here in returned again for one night before joining a cruise same high standard of service lovely breakfast on a high floor to overlook the acropolis fab rooftop pool with bar and sun loungers to enjoy the magnificent view thank you to the lovely staff on reception who booked us a meal at kuzina to return where we had eaten a memorable meal on their roof top in it was just as good this time i would highly recommend this hotel for any stay in athens,1.0

room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,0.0
this hotel is just amazing you ca fault it the pool area on a saturday has a free pool party which is good busy but a good atmosphere even the standard room is lovely they went out of their way for my boyfriends birthday food is so good and taxis from hotel are easy to come by as they have a rank outside the hotel checked in at due to flight delays and even at that time staff are so helpful and friendly no other option of hotel in barcelona this wins hands down and will be back,1.0
we had our annual office summer bbq in the spencer hotel on friday july and it was absolutely brilliant from the initial booking and organisation right through to being looked after on the night the staff in the spencer could not have done more for us they were so pleasant friendly and went out of their way to ensure we were happy nothing was a problem for them the service was excellent and the food was top would highly recommend the spencer hotel for any events,1.0

staff was quite helpful in getting us tickets beforehand and helping us get around on metro breakfast pretty good except scrambled eggs a little to salty for my taste great room big bed and bathroom would stay again,1.0
worst breakfast i believe i have encountered anywhere in the world particularly in light of the star rating inattentive staff busy but not serving very poor cooked food quality undercooked bacon sausage with gristle unappetising scrambled eggs toaster not functioning resulting in long queues and wait time teapots leaking etc etcmanagement need to observe this towers experience and make rapid improvements,0.0
my sister and i arrived here after a long day of flying from the dublin airport it was an easy bus ride for a walk to this hotel i had requested a quiet room so we could get plenty of sleep and get over our jet lag as soon as possible we were given a room on the top floor facing the back which was perfect we had a nice view and occasionally heard church bells toll the hotel manager was charming and helpful in her suggestions for wonderful nearby restaurants staying there nights was a perfect amount of time to walk through the city and see the sights,1.0
overall this is a fine hotel the rooms are comfortable clean and attractive the bathrooms while not large are nice indeed a great shower and easily accessible the bed was large and quite comfortable only thing that keeps this from being a is that while helpful staff attitudes always felt like they were doing you a favor by engaging you i asked for help on a transportation issue at one point and got the distinct feeling that i was asking for something completely outrageous which i was and i really did need to be reminded four times that smoking was not allowed in guest rooms i do smoke never have to be perfectly fair the concierge did give me a really great recommendation for a restaurant for dinner perhaps on balance that makes it other comment i make on this is that if you book this hotel please keep in mind that it is quite literally right on dam square and that means that once you walk out the door you in the middle of a massive flow of people particularly during peak summer tourist season upside you a five minute walk from pretty much anywhere in amsterdam including centraal station,1.0
i had never heard of this hotel but it is a part of the ritz carlton brand which summarizes the service stars from to staff make every effort to provide service staff will greet you in halls etc stars on the beach many restaurants near boat tours at the doorstep the hip on hop off bus stops outside the hotel metro stop is a short walk through a park cabs easy to get casino and clubs walking distance rooms clean nice amenities good bed tip opt for a club room the club is wonderful meal servings wine and beer snacks nice view great staff made our trip a true vacation stay here again would not stay anywhere else in barcelona,1.0
even though this hotel is in the center of the city it is conveniently located across from a tram stop and has professional and friendly staff the rooms were very comfortable and the food including delivery to our room was great i definitely stay here again well worth it,1.0
no problems at all very clean very nice atmosphere degrees hot outside perfect quality air condition in reception really helpful and not at all in the fake smile way would stay again any time,1.0
the hotel was a good choice for the price great expansive breakfast buffet and central location if you have a car it is definitely a nightmare to navigate the alley to arrive and depart each day the room was large by eu standards there is small quaint bar in the lobby but your are in amsterdam where pubs and cafes are in abundance i recommend venturing out the location in proximity to the sights is top notch less than minutes to dam square redlight district and tons of shopping and dinning,1.0
we love every part of this hotel i love the design tooooo much we stayed at the little house room which has bedrooms so it fit us the staffs were very nice and me feel so breakfast was good everything perfect,1.0

the highlight of the melia is the rooftop swimming pool restaurant we ate dinner there overlooking the acropolis and went swimming the next morning as room was very well appointed and comfortable the air conditioning unit made some very loud noises in the middle of the night but we were given a fan to keep cool,1.0
this was definitely not grand looks nice on the outside but very dirty on the inside this has to be the worst service i have received in greece breakfast was the worst and even when i stayed in cheaper hotels the breakfast was better cutlery and cups were also dirty got abused by the night manager that stunk and needed discinfectant and a bath the managers did care as he is so busy anyway avoid this place,0.0
i spent a delightful few days in this historic hotel that was completely updated about ten years ago and is now a marriott renaissance property the public rooms are beautiful and elegant the food and service were excellent at the restaurants the hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming my spacious floor room had high windows that looked out over stephen s green and beyond the bed was extremely comfortable the beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub shower and commode was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving the room had plenty of lighting a good work desk and plush comfortable reading chairs soundproofing was excellent and i never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly service the hotel has a great location two blocks from the natural history museum and the national gallery of ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and was disappointed when i had to leave the shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent dublin hotel the westbury a century property that does not have the same level of elegance warmth or beauty the combination of history comfort and grace makes the shelbourne an extraordinary place they clearly value their guests and make them feel special it was a wonderful introduction to dublin and really deserves six stars,1.0
this hotel is hip and trendy definitely a quirky hotel for someone who enjoys having an experience that is a different from a regular corporate hotel from the moment you enter the hotel you feel taken care of our process went smoothly and since it was our wedding anniversary and we booked through expedia with privileges they upgraded our room and sent up two glasses of champagne the location is excellent if you looking to hop on the train across the street you can also catch a direct train to the the airport just be careful to purchase the correct ticket look for the yellow machines and be careful not click on bus ticket the night manager ivar croes was especially helpful one evening after exploring this beautiful city he welcomed us back to the hotel and was kind enough to give us a personal tour of the hotel including the art exhibit he took providing excellent customer service to another level needless to say we will be back soon,1.0
our cruise started in athens so we decided to come days before to explore this hotel is exactly what we were looking for great location beautiful design esthetic clean and nice rooms do miss the roof top restaurant with views of the acropolis the food was delicious service was way too slow but it vacation so no real rush we had a suite and it was the perfect size with a sitting room so if you want a little space i would recommend this type of room,1.0
probably one of the most amazing hotels in the world definitely the best one i ever stayed in the room was airy clean and comfortable with windows overlooking parts of the city we had breakfast in the hotel and the food is simply put delicious right outside the hotel is part of the canal making it even more spectacular the staff is incredible kind and helpful leading us to the best places to go to see anyone who goes to amsterdam should stay here because it is definitely worth it,1.0
i had a single room which was small but adequate the room was clean and comfortable the irish breakfast was excellent the location of the hotel is across from the side of christchurch i found it to be a very good location i found the bells of the church to be a nice part of the ambiance,1.0

the hotel is alright for what it is it close to the shopping center but about mins away from tourist attractions and the beach the shower was a little impractical it was nearly impossible to take one without soaking the whole floor the front desk team and the rest of the staff is friendly and tries to be helpful when they can however the manager anna was an incredibly frustrating person to deal with on their check out card it states that check out time is am we were confused as standard check out time is noon we asked the front desk staff to clarify if there was some sort of misunderstanding but he confirmed am as in midnight with no where else to go the night before our flight we had no choice but to book last minute accommodations at a hostel for the trip was booked through our travel agent and i reached out to her just in case she was unaware about this oddity to my surprise she emailed me back saying she had spoken to the front desk and they confirmed checkout as noon we spoke with the same front desk staff member from before where he apologized for the mistake but offered nothing to help us other than a complimentary breakfast but only after we became insistent we asked to speak to the manger who was in to the next morning around with the manger anna had to be the most frustrating experience of my,0.0
we really enjoyed the hotel breakfast and the bar on the roof the staff was very helpful and friendly the location was nice during the day but it was a little sketchy at night not far from metro station and good shopping,1.0
what can i say i intend to lay out this review in the form of the meal i ordered but never received from the hotel in case you did notice that was the first negative point starters upon entering the more like a hostel because of the am raves and appalling hygiene i found myself the room as the staff were busy to show me to my room the first thing i noticed about my room was the carpet which had mould around the edges which when i informed a member of staff about i was greeted with the message that all our carpets are like that for the course of my review i received dirty towels in my bathroom and of course by bathroom i mean the bathroom which was communal for around family size rooms over my three night stay but of course it was my personal error as i should have known replacement towels are not complementary and would set me back to top it all off comes the dessert on the other half of the queen size bed i on was a yellowish stain which was later identified as urine by a member of staff who i caught the attention of whilst she walked down a corridor doing nothing instead of cleaning the people whos bookings keep them employed i can see i am not the first to leave such a disgruntled review of travel and i sure i will not be the last,0.0
very close and handy to main ancient sites with friendly and helpful staff great view of acropolis from floor window good breakfast traffic busy outside front of hotel but not a sound from our room facing the other way,1.0
the hotel is centrally located a relatively short walk from the airport bus at syntagma and from the restaurant area in the plaka wifi is good rooms are spacious and beds comfortable there are a variety of offerings for breakfast which can be taken inside or at the outside garden the rooftop restaurant and pool one level lower also provide views of the acropolis there is no shade above the sun lounges around the pool though which is a bit hotel and its facilities are what one would expect for a hotel of this type our room had limited views of the acropolis,1.0
the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was good no tea or coffee making facilities in was very easy to do using screens at reception and there was a member of staff available to help and to provide a map and explain the time that breakfast was served were given a voucher for a free drink at the restaurant attached though we did not take this up as the food was very hotel is conveniently situated for easily getting into the centre of amsterdam or exploring the area the overtoom has lots of places to eat and drink and an albert heijn to grab groceries if required vondelpark is very nearby and is a pleasant place to walk trams and stop very close to the hotel and take around minutes to take you to centraal station,1.0
loved this hotel and look forward to staying there when next in barcelona the staff were friendly and helpful the room was quiet clean with comfortable beds and a super bathroom with great wine theme decor was original and the quality of the welcoming glass of wine surprisingly good,1.0
well let me start by saying that this is the first time that i am writing a review when i have checked out of the hotel i a hilton honors member and one of the reasons i picked this hotel is because of the benefits that come with it let me just say that if this is the reason you are coming stay away this has to be the worst service that i have ever experienced in any of the hilton hotels poor management me highlight some of the negatives no bellman to help you with your luggage stayed for nights and i think i saw just one randomly check in time is at i came in at and was told that my room was ready to come back in an hour came back at really annoyed to learn that it still was ready did get the room till they must have called housekeeping or times to ask if it was still cleaned check in was poor never got keys so had to make the line awful i travel a lot this has to be the worst i had a family suite sofa bed that my son slept in was horrible you can feel the bar complained spoke to a supervisor and stated all my complaints said he was going to have management call me i never received the call i asked him for a power adaptor and never received room was not adequately cleaned no complimentary concierge service leon,0.0

we stayed here with two teens for nights this hotel is brand new cool stylish interior very comfortable and spacious rooms not a given in europe so this was a delight we updated to a suite which was even bigger modern and spacious bathrooms separate toilet shower and bathtub rooms were quiet and elegant hotels is a great location if you prefer a little quiet and want to walk to the sites having been to amsterdam before we really enjoyed having the close proximity to everything yet ebbing able to retreat the hustle and bustle of the city it can get a little much so we really liked this location a lot easy walk to quality restaurant but we loved our in house restaurant so much that we opted to eat there twice for dinner an indonesian fusion restaurant with authentic indonesian cooks my son loved the fried rice dish so much he asked the chef to give away her secret tips and showed how how to cook it that was at the end of her long shift we were impressed that she had the patience to teach him breakfast buffet was varied and typical european spread with fresh breads cheese meats fruit cereals and many other yummy treats we could have stayed all morning just for that we loved this hotel so much that we are considering going back there on our way through other european stops great find did i mention the staff super helpful friendly and fun,1.0
our initial disappointment at a very small and narrow lobby was quickly replaced at the delight of a very convenient location comfortable room and free snacks with beverages almost throughout the day at the catalonia square my husband and i were there for nights and we will certainly not hesitate to stay there again for when we next visit barcelona the front desk staff deserve a pat on the back for going above and beyond their call of duty with a friendly demeanor at all times and the welcome bottle of champagne and fruit platter was the cherry on top,1.0
this hotel is located in the old kinda part of downtown amsterdam great location near canal and train station walking distance to a lot of shopping restaurants are very close to hotel as had breakfast included but dinner was available at this hotel this month i guess or so rooms are clean but there is a lot of dust on the night stands the price is a bit high we had a room with queen bed for euro per is good,1.0
not our first stay at cassidys and wo be our clean room on the ground floor no view other than a motor bike stand but then again i did pop to dublin to stare outta a hotel window great breakfast with plenty of choice of well cooked food and i especially like that the eggs fried or poached are cooked fresh to convenient for sightseeing taxis and shopping in real shops i do count grafton street with shops with jaw dropping prices i prefer the likes of henry street just down the road with all the high street names and real world turned the back bar into a sort of bistro looks nice but i did have time to try it a decent pint of guinness what more can you ask,1.0

i stayed here with a friend for nights and as the title of my review suggests it was just right good location a couple of minutes walk from amstel station where you could get the metro to centraal or a tram into the museum district etc the room was adequately sized comfortable beds good shower clean and had a hair dryer we did have much interaction with staff but when we did they were polite and our room was cleaned daily the coffee was lovely slightly higher priced but nothing that would be expected of a hotel near the centre of amsterdam food was tasty and the coffee was fabulous we only ate here once as we mostly ate when we were out free wifi and a water foundation were both helpful there was really anything locally but we spent all our time in the city so this made no difference to us and to be fair we did really explore the area if you are looking for a comfortable reasonably priced base when in amsterdam with easy access to the main city then this is just right,1.0
i spent nights with my family at this hotel it fantastic and i never thought this was what i would get kids love the swimming pool and there is free parking value for money and will always recommend it to people visiting barcelona the hotel is working distance to the national museum and plaza espanol quiet and lovely atmosphere minutes drive to camp nou to la rambla and to the beaches i rented a car but there are metro and buses to everywh,1.0

visited this hotel on a work trip i would definitely go again food was devine had bed breakfast and evening meal drinks on the pricey side service extremely good only downside for me is that as i was in a single room so had no coffee or tea making facilities as the room was to small they did state that i could ring reception and they would send a pot of to my room i did not take them up on this but did miss not being able to make some whenever i wanted would i stay again a resounding yes in fact i am in discussions with my husband about a trip for the two of us and if i can find a deal then we will stay at this hotel,1.0

in cities like amsterdam its about location and to have a nice hotel in the center of it all nh collection barbizon fits that bill close to amsterdam centraal and rental car areas we did a day trip to zaandam and zaans schans by just walking to the train station and taking a train instead of spending euro on a tour near all the historic sites and main squares and restaurants laundromat right near by plenty of restaurants for breakfast near by to not need hotel breakfast great service and conciergecons wifi did work with our macbook computers in our room on floor noise at night you are right in the center of party town with am crowd hanging out right in front of your room if you are facing the canal side and have your window open,1.0
i do no like the side of the river the hotel is on most of the time i spent in dublin was on the other side so i did not like the location the check in and check out process was mechanical as if a robot was doing it this is the only hotel of i stayed in on this trip where i was not asked how my stay was i think the young man who checked me in only spoke to tell me my room number the room was so small that either my husband or i had to sit on the bed while the other was up moving or we would bump into each other ironically the bathroom was very large the room was clean although the carpet looked filthy to me and quiet,0.0
my family stayed in amalia hotel in athens for nights in june of we just looking for a place we can stay in athens for a short staying while doing some sightseeing for that purpose i think this hotel was perfect its location is really convenient it about minutes of walking distance to acropolis although it felt a lot longer under the blazing sunlight with degree it right across the street from the national gardens and just a few blocks away from the parliament building if you want to see the of the guards and literally a few blocks away from a thousands of restaurants cafes shopping places etc and it you want to ride one of those double decker tour buses the stop is right across the street from the hotel too there is a train and bus stop right there too we thought that as far as location is concern it just as good as it for the hotel itself it very clean nothing really bad to complain about however there were no bell boy services when we got there we had to lug all our bags to our room via a smallest elevator i ever seen in my life not a big deal but the sheer size of that elevator always brought a little smile to our family on each ride felt like that elevator belonged in disney land in some kids theme park room is an ample size and bed is just bed we all slept,1.0

my friend and i stayed at this hotel this weekend mid july the hotel is modern clean and located in a lovely part of the city away from the main hustle and bustle but with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful and the facilities were good the buffet style breakfast was really good value with an excellent range and quality of food there is a shopping mall located right next to the hotel which was very convenient it can be difficult to get taxis from directly outside the hotel despite a taxi rank just opposite we had to wait over half an hour on saturday afternoon for one to come even after the hotel staff had called through for one overall a lovely hotel with great facilities i definitely stay there again,1.0
this hotel is one of the best i have stayed at in amsterdam easy to get to using the shuttle ferry at the back of centraal station did know this at the time of booking at took a taxi the long way round very easy check in and shown to our rooms by a knowledgeable guy the rooms are great i had a lovely view out the window with complimentary binoculars good selection of records for the record player as well the lifts were a fun experience as well different themed ones my favourite was the disco ca comment on the food but it looked good bar prices we reasonable for the location look forward to staying here again,1.0

being only a minute walk from placa catalunya and las ramblas the hotel is in a perfect location when we arrived we were told that our room had been upgraded for free we still not sure why so we now had a premium club room with a queen size bed and free croissants in the morning the rooftop bar and pool were great with a very chilled atmosphere we did eat breakfast at the hotel as it was quite pricey however there is a shop opposite the hotel open hours selling anything you need the room was very clean spacious and equipped with tea and coffee and a hot water machine one thing i say is that the room was a bit dark the window was quite small and the lights were very bright however we were not bothered by it as we did spend much time in the room apart from at night the wifi is free but like with a lot of hotels it was very slow during peak times would definitely recommend this hotel for couples as it very peaceful and easy to get to,1.0
we checked in with no problems at all and the staff were very helpful they gave us maps and lots of information about places to visit told us about the tram and bus services which were only a few minutes away the tram service was very easy to use the room we stayed in was basic but adequate and was overlooking a canal the facilities in the room included a large tv safe free wi fi and a very large shower the bed was large clean and comfortable breakfast is available in the hotel although we did not have one there is also a bar with a variety of drinks plenty of seating areas and all the staff were very friendly and helpful we would recommend this hotel,1.0
we arrived at zafolia after a day cruise we chose this hotel as we wanted room space and a pool the room did not disappoint it actually was more roomier than we expected it was clean and stocked with toiletries the roof top pool could do with some upgrading there were never enough pool lounges and we had to make do with the chairs by the food area we ate by the pool and the food was basic but yummy the kids were happy with the breakfast buffet however we needed to keep in mind we had just come off a cruise i was disappointing that the cold food was not kept cold enough for our preference otherwise for a basic buffet it was get to the hop off bus expect to walk minutes this was perfect however we got used to the walk in the heat and decided that the room was worth the walk restaurants near by were a little bit of a challenge however we looked up trip advisor and navigated ourselves around the streets and eventually found the ones recommended these were great overall a pleasant experience,1.0
this is a great choice if you are looking for somewhere centrally located the acropolis is five minutes walk as is plaka highly recommended to reach anywhere further afield taxis are readily available all the staff were polite and helpful we especially appreciated the in assisting with luggage and calling taxis we only stayed the one night because we had just come off a cruise and were returning home the following day if we were in athens again we would stay at this hotel,1.0
the staff was very friendly and gracious they treated you as if you were royalty concierge was extremely helpful with great tips front desk personnel were very freindly location is awesome across from grand central station and most all attractions are within easy walking distance,1.0
stayed here for two nights close to attractions and buses easy to find and bus from airport just stops around the corner staff are friendly and helpful very clean and tidy beds are comfy also restaurant down stairs is pricey and would be my only complaint,1.0
a nice hotel located within walking distance to shops bars local sights the room was clean a reasonable size and the bed comfortable staff were helpful with advice maps etc the only downside was a flight of stairs up to the lobby which is difficult with luggage and no porters to assist,1.0
we have just spent a few nights at radisson blu park hotel and it was an amazing helpful staff informative and through our stay everyone made us feel very special and room was well designed spacious with comfortable beds and excellent bathroom was great internet covering all over the enjoyed very much the breakfast buffet which was generous with all kinds of options from light to heavy and everything in best part of the hotel was the pool area with great drinks and stunning views of the city where we also had a delicious dinner the food and the service were both at the highest levels overall everything was fantastic and we could not have been more pleased with our entire stay thank you radisson blu athens till next time,1.0

couples stayed here for nights after finding on what a beautiful hotel decor is stunning rooms are typically narrow but lovely and treats staff are brilliant and will help with maps tickets tours restaurant bookings and airport a little on the pricey side but well worth to walk to from centraal station and very close to dam definitely stay again,1.0
good experience underground free car park is handy room is standard fit but was clean only two small issues the room was very warm on the top floor and hard to regulate temperature without opening the window which then made the room noisy also there was a light bulb missing from a table lamp,0.0

good hotel in great location nice clean room and bathroom we stayed on the second floor on the street side and it was noisy so book a room higher up or away from the street house keeping not as attentive with replenishing supplies we had to ask the concierge for shampoo and body wash,1.0
you ca get a more central location then this hotel everything is within min walking distance from shops parks transport pubs restaurants etc once you step into this beautiful property staff are welcoming you with warm smiles and make you feel right at home you forget your even in the city i loved their signature white tea aroma that filled the hallways the bedrooms are incredibly spacious and inviting decorated in warm tones their heavenly beds do not disappoint either and their waterfall shower is amazing staff went above and beyond during our stay had some food and drinks in the mint bar highly recommend the pesto chips i previously enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea here which everyone needs to experience staff take the very best care of you and ensure you are completely at ease by providing a personalised service breakfast is amazing even if you are not a guest i would recommend spending your morning enjoying their buffet selection and fresh coffees i was disappointed to leave as it felt like home for me but i will absolutely be back for another stay,1.0
stayed for nights in the old house in the middle of the hotel we were made to feel very welcome on arrival and the room was quiet and very comfortable we dined in the adjoining restaurant on one evening and the food was very recommend this hotel,1.0
from the moment we arrived we could have felt more welcome beautiful hotel rooms and the service both at reception pool bar fantastic the whole hotel was pristine and the rooms were beautiful stylish well equipped,1.0
nice hotel with spacious rooms much larger than usually found in barcelona location is great to go to the beach while still quiet because it is not too close to the hectic city center we checked in late and ariel was great in fact all front desk staff was super friendly and helpful we also enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the morning and the rooftop pool which is a bit small but so cool definitely recommend,1.0
we booking this hotel for nights because it had a great star rating and it was well priced once we arrived we realised how bad of a mistake we made the hotel is rundown for the outside but the lobby makes it looking like it could be great lady at the counter was abrupt and rude the lady with the glasses is the nicest one of them all the bedroom had stains all over the floor and curtains smelt really bad and the bathroom had pubic hair on the floor which was so gross we decided to eat at the rooftop bar because we just flew in and did feel like walking to get food only to wait and how and no one shows up we ended up walking into the city and eating at one of our favourite restaurants we can back and though we would just watch the sun set with the acropolis we were there for two hours then a lady turns up and asks if we want to order we say no because we went out to eat and she said if we did order anything we would have to leave as it only for paying customers umm what we paid to stay at the hotel my boyfriend decided to just get a beer and she looked at me and when i said i still did want anything she gave me a death stare and snobed me off never seen someone so rude the first nights,0.0
stayed in this hotel for a few nights for my boyfriends birthday in july and it was perfect rooms were really spacious and had one of the biggest and most comfortable beds i ever had the pleasure of sleeping in it is a little walk from the centre of amsterdam but there is an underground tube stop just outside the building nothing like the british underground everything there is so clean cheap and on time and it cost like for unlimited travel for hours this included all the trams and stuff in town so was the perfect way to get around al hotel staff were friendly and inviting and rooms were spotlessly clean would definitely stay here again,1.0
we were very lucky to find a place in this hotel it just perfect excellent location extremely comfortable rooms very kind team and a remarkable breakfast my family and me had a great time here and we would stay longer if we could,1.0
asked for a double bed or twin beds with double sheets got confirmation prior to arrival but once at the hotel we were given twin beds with single sheets which were still not changed to double sheets in spite of asking reception staff as well as the cleaning staff,1.0
we had a very nice stay at the schoolhouse hotel in dublin we stayed here for nights and it was a very good jumping off point for exploring all of dublin while still in a quiet neighborhood about a minute walk from trinity university that takes you past beautiful merrion square park the staff were very kind and friendly and the breakfast every morning was hearty and tasty the room was clean and quiet and the bed was quite comfortable it was certainly a more expensive option but it seems that lodging in dublin is expensive on the whole would highly recommend for anyone looking to explore dublin while not wanting the heavy tourist scene downtown,1.0
the davenport hotel is located near the center of dublin ireland just a block north of merrion square it is also located about a block east of trinity college and several blocks south of the river liffey it is also located next to the house were oscar wilde grew up it is now some type of small college the hotel is located about miles from dublin international airport or approximately minutes by taxi longer if you are in rush hour stayed here for nights in late may with my wife and youngest daughter and thought the hotel was nice and also thought it was in a great location near many major tourist attractions we paid a night for a triple room one king size bed and a twin bed which i thought was pretty reasonable breakfast was not included and was euros per day per person i thought the lobby and bar area were nice looking and i also liked my hotel room the carpet and furniture were updated in addition the room was above average in size the front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given only complaint was the poor breakfast service the main breakfast room was full so we had to go to the bar area where the guy working there was lazy and would not help us i thought he was a dishwasher or cleaning person we had to walk back into the other area and ask,1.0
one of the best things about the stay apart from the lovely room excellent breakfast convenient location gorgeous building and the swimming pool was the staff they really made the stay special and were focussed on the comfort and happiness of their guests at all times really helpful friendly and accommodating especially for my grandmother for whom they were able to source a wheelchair at very short notice which enabled her to join us on excursions around the city we would not have been able to make otherwise huge thank you to them for making the stay so special,1.0
the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,1.0
thank you for making my birthday exceptional everything at the hotel exceeded our expectations the communication prior to our visit the bubbly in honor of my birthday the cleanliness and comfort of the room the breakfast and our check out all was a delightful experience you made us want to return to athens,1.0
i stayed at hermes hotel for the two nights i was in athens before heading down to kefalonia and could have been happier with my choice hermes was very modern updated and right in the center of plaka a minute walk from the acropolis and center city not to mention the staff was very friendly and accommodating a wonderful experience all around i would recommend hermes to anyone staying in athens,1.0
after reading the mixed reviews on trip advisor not sure what to expect the location has to be the best in amsterdam located just off dam square walkable to everything in the heart of the city restaurants attractions shopping trams train etc staff is young and energetic lots of staff always around to help both the duchess and mr porter restaurants are upscale and well laid out restaurant staffs are efficient and pleasant full european breakfast is vast fresh and well prepared rooms are nicely decorated and spacious only high praise for this w,1.0
this is a nice hotel in a historic part of the city dating from it was apparently only the third hotel in barcelona although i do know if the other two are still there i did initially realise it was that old though as it feels like a modern hotel other than a slightly quirky layout the staff are pleasant and lots of letters of thanks are on show in the reception area our room had balconies overlooking the square below which was a pleasant feature the accommodation was functional and comfortable we got the impression the walls of our room were a bit on the thin side when we were awoken by a couple loudly showering and leaving at approx we got a discount of for paying cash which was a nice bonus for good value basic accommodation we would stay there again and recommend to others,1.0
the hotel is excellent and their staff are really friendly the historic building is really beautiful like enjoying a piece of medieval history it is in the middle of historic barcelona and close to all the important sites,1.0
perfect location the hotel was comfortable and had a nice breakfast they decorated and had a party atmosphere for st patrick day terrific spot on the parade route that you can view from their windows great time,1.0
i recently was at fleet hotel and was very disappointed with the we arrived we were asked if we wanted the breakfast the next morning for euros a piece i asked if i needed to pay for it that night and the desk clerk said no but they would put our names done my daughter and i got an ally room where the noisy from outside was ongoing we tried to close the windows to buffer the noise but there was no air so the room became extremely stuffy the inside noise was just as bad if not worse the walls were paper thin and every time a door open and closed it vibrated throughout the next morning when we went downstairs for the breakfast we told the hostess what room we were in and i proceeded to get my coffee and plate of breakfast food by the way the canteen was extremely noisy as well the hostess comes over and states that we had not ordered the breakfast at that point i had had it i went to the front and told them that i would be checking out of the hotel a day early due to the lack of sleep due to the noise that my daughter and i dealt with the night before as well as the embarrassment in the canteen when we thought we had lined up the breakfast from the night before they refused to credit our account told us what did we expect from,0.0
affordable accomodation small room but very clean and modern with small balcony directly across from a subway station as well as in perfect location not too busy but in walking distance to la rambla friendly and helpful staff,1.0
a very small intimate and well kept property located several km from the city center but just a few meters from a subway station that will bring you there in minutes our room was large unusually comfortable and equipped with electronically operated black out drapes the staff was attentive but not obtrusive we chose not to eat in its famed restaurant and we were directed by helpful staff to several options nearby we found this property a slight bit overpriced but not outrageously so the quiet and care made it a reasonable value,1.0
beautiful and funky hotel very friendly staff who are more than helpful to recommend places to visit or eat we enjoyed our stay here and found in a good location room was spaceful and very funky bathroom was very nice overall a cool place to stay,1.0
friendly helpful staff great location min walk to plaça catalunya and la ramblas walk from port breakfast croissant and hot drinks ice lolly on arrival overall completely satisfied with our stay and loved every minute,1.0
visited here for one night yesterday for my wife birthday the hotel is a ten minute walk from street so a bit of a trek after a night out especially with heels on says the wife upon check in we were met by antonio who was very polite and friendly the room was great very spacious room which is or was a room for disabled persons my wife mentioned to antonio upon check in that it was her birthday and when we returned to the hotel later in the afternoon there was a happy birthday note along with wine and chocolates which was a lovely touch very comfy bed and very clean one slight issue was the cleaners were very noisy from quite early and we wanted a lie in hardly mattered though fabulous hotel and we would definitely recommend and would visit again,1.0
whilst rooms were breakfast excellent our holiday was ruined because on out of nights our sleep was constantly disturbed by revelers on our floor doors banging people running in the corridor and loud shouting when reception was approached both during the night first thing in the morning they showed little concern and even appeared to be amused no apology was given ironically a card is left in each room with a quote from the dalai lama sleep is the best meditation what a joke,0.0
booked this place for our trip to athens got it as a steal the best cheapest way to reach from airport will be to take the express bus right side of departure gate and get down at syntagma square last stop this is almost an hour drive and take a taxi kms to the hotel not many know this hotel by name due to its location you need to specify that its on aristogitonos lane alternatively you can take the airport to monastiraki by metro mins ride and min walk to hotel careful if you have lots of luggage as this station is filled with few people who bombard tourists pros of acs colourful budget rooms with basic amenities top floor ones offer a good greek breakfast loaded with bread cheese served from early you can book your hop in hop off bus tickets at self service tea biscuits at the great location to access and enjoy local food street joints hard rock cafecons of acs very poor response to they are under staffed probably offseason may be location does get lonely at night as its in between a market,1.0
the location is central the hotel is basic and clean the room was completely adequate very small but so what the staff were pleasant and efficient there is nothing to complain about for a reasonable price in central dublin just off stephen green,1.0
this is a modern well run hotel the room was modern air conditioned and clean with a comfortable bed the wifi wrks well and the hotel is only a short walk from the harbour and las rambla the only downside is that it does not have a bar but i would certainly stay again,1.0
if you would like to see the whole of amsterdam from a treetop view this will be a nice place they have outdoor seats and you can enjoy a very nice view but be aware of the weather before you decide to go there they serve food as well and price is on the higher end take note it is not for budget travelers you can walk in and no reservation is required overall i enjoyed my time there,1.0
the hotel is star and therefore relatively basic but there was nothing to complain about and the location is excellent our family room was very sizeable it was at the back of the hotel so the view was not great at all but it had the advantage of being amazingly quiet considering the proximity to the heaving busy la roof top terrace bar with glass fronted foot pool was a real treat there are views all around barcelona city and down to the port with the palau guell gaudi designed rooftop directly opposite personally i would have thought that this premier location could be turned into a much more expensive cocktail bar but it was certainly a very pleasant addition as it did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on that but would definitely stay here again if visiting barcelona,1.0
great location easy walk from amsterdam central and lovely quirky hotel in old town plenty of staff around to help if needed rooms are a generous size clean and have everything you need breakfast was nice each morning ours was included in our booking but do think it would be worth the euro price tag though usual breakfast fare both hot and cold the front desk sell tram tickets for days and are very helpful with ideas of places to go and also orientating you with the area coin operated laundry just around the corner had a great stay here,1.0
stayed here while at a conference hotels which try to be different can often end up just being odd and lose sight of what matters nice stay but not here on the other side of the main canal from centraal station getting here involves using the foot ferry a great way to start the hotel itself is in an old office block but brilliantly converted the bar area is a club with dj relaxed atmosphere and amazing burgers and beer reception staff very lifts are all themed including a disco lift complete with light up floor and glitter ball on the ceiling the rooms are a little small but packed with everything you need mine had a guitar hanging from the wall and a turntable next to the minibar plus a choice of vinyl very comfy beds powerful shower and dark curtains so once you wanted to sleep you could block the world of the best hotels i stayed in,1.0
the hotel is situated at the edge of the city and only metro stops from the main train station the front desk staff was always friendly and gave some great tips on where to eat and what to do they also hooked me up with a hair dryer for the duration of my stay the hotel itself is like a big college dorm with ping pong pool tables a tedex listening pod and lots of cozy hangout spots on the main floor the rooms are rather large for amsterdam this is my visit to the city and this is by far the biggest room i had and though there is it is set to go no lower than it was not so hot the week we were there so this was a big problem but sometimes you just need it a bit cooler the other issue with the room was that there were very few electric outlets there was one by the tv and one in the bathroom but none by the bed how can this be i wonder how students actually live there during the year with only outlets the bed was mediocre kind of hard and not all that comfortable but it was okay for a week the bigger issue was that the blinds at the big full wall window had a gap in them and since there was no curtain the sun would come in and blind me in bed early in the morning which was great,1.0
the place maybe was luxury and presidential in other times now in you have to pay if you want wifi in the room ok the hair dryer was from too and the toilet didnt work we arrive at the hotel to do the check in and the staff was very unpleasant with us to do the check out we arrived hour late and they want to make us to pay the extra day only for hour late we understand that we were late but euros only for hour and the negative attitude to make possible understand our position was very unfear unpleasant and disappointing we have to come back in days in this hotel because we have already made the booking but i dont think that i can change my mind about them we dont recommend this hotel not at all to anybody i hope my experience was helpful to everybody i can assure i will never come back,0.0
we stayed in the central as it was one of the very few hotels in dublin available now we know why it was its tired and worn out small old fashioned rooms with no double glazing to block out the street noise which continues until after the general decor is old and worn the curtain in our room was splattered with what appeared to be liquid makeup and the standard of cleanliness in general was wouldnt recommend staying,0.0
what a gem modern hotel with very spacious rooms and super friendly staff we loved the location far enough away that you are in the thick of the tourist spots but still close enough to walk around definitely recommend,1.0
the front desk staff is so very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful experience they were lovely spoke english and helped with tours and information the hotel is a min walk to the beach close to great restaurants and public rooms were comfortable and very clean i would definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to others,1.0
hi we stayed at this property for nights check inn june check out july merits location of the hotel is perfect it has two entrance just outside of its main there is a canal and the view is very beautiful and if we use the other entrance which open from its premium hotel we enter into street area the street has lots of bars and pubs also tram stop is nearby it offers lots of breakfast options everything could be found staff of the hotel is good it has a beautiful bar and music is good de merits rooms are small refrigerator is missing i think travellers can book this hotel its value for money,1.0
felt very welcome and cared for the food was excellent and staff extremely attentive i would recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to spoil themselves the best place to enjoy barclona and placa reial,1.0
although we had booked a room for nights through email and a phone call to confirm our booking we arrived and to our disappointment there were no rooms available because clearly they had overbooked the hotel they blamed one of their employees who apparently was fired but somehow had managed to book us a room and confirm it excuses let me mention that the room was somehow booked for the next nights after our arrival whereas by email we had agreed other dates,0.0
always love to stay at the westbury when in dublin which is fairly often last week was no different just love to sit in the lobby with glass of wine in hand people watching the are all just perfect kudos to a job continuing to be well done,1.0
we stayed for nights in early july overall the hotel has a hip vibe and is clean and very had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine the front desk staff was attentive and careful what you ask for my wife wanted a tub so we requested the tubbie room one of the only rooms with a tub it is on the top floor in the back building and requires a flight of stairs to get to once you are out of the elevator inside the room there is a very small entry that is dark and the light switch is hard to find and another very narrow spiral staircase up to the attic where the room is so no matter what you have flights of stairs to get to this room in the room there are several beams going across it at a height of less than if you are that tall you will have to duck several times when walking across the room the tv is obstructed by those is no closet or dresser only an open structure with of pole space and a couple of hangers there is no place to put suitcases the lighting in the room is door to the bathroom is translucent and unfortunately the toilet is right beside the door so anyone in the room has a full if cloudy view of whoever is on the toilet and what they are doing the bathtub is a claw foot type and is out,1.0
though the lobby is indeed large and relatively luxurious we were given a remarkably small room nights with a very small window and an airconditioning making noise outside in a tiny courtyard not suitable for two people and we thought really too expensive the hotel is well located but please check the size of your room before you book,0.0
brilliantly located and the staff could not do enough to please rooms are clean comfortable and spacious i really enjoyed my time here and i look forward to returning also had a lovely dinner at cleaver east,1.0

my wife and i stayed in july for nights the room was nice but not very clean the coffee cups had been cleaned since the last guests and the mini bar food was covered in dust we had a picnic in vondel park and requested a couple of forks and spoons from the staff but they would not help us and told us we had to go to the supermarket to get them we also asked the front desk to mail out a postcard for us already had postage just needed to be dropped in the mailbox and it was never biggest issue i had was with the way they handle do not disturb we were out late and wanted to sleep in so we switched on the do not disturb light this was days out of our there instead of housekeeping just skipping our room they had the front desk call us we were trying to sleep hence do not disturb but they insisted on double checking that we did want to be disturbed this is the opposite of what the phrase do not disturb means,0.0
beautiful hotel location room size amenities and restaurant all excellent agree with other reviewer about the night noise though especially if you are there in the summer and need your windows open to keep it cool staff was very nice and we would stay there again,1.0

a nice hôtel to recommend the room was a little bit small but very clean the breakfast not very diversified only slices of cheese butter and jam but in général good very delicious bread the staff at the reception really helpfullthe location of the hotel si excellent we will come back in january,1.0
stayed here for nights last week and was disappointed the good point is the location lots of restaurants within walking distance of all metro station virtually outside the hotel but even as a base this hotel falls short of reception tiny bar in corner of reception never saw it being used this is a shame because after a days sightseeing its nice to have somewhere to sit and relax there was no atmosphere as its in the reception theres a small amount of chairs that need replacing as etc most reception staff helpful the younger girl on in an evening doesnt speak english or french so there was no way of communicating our problem to her so we gave up a hour reception needs staff fluent in more than one language everytime we passed reception she was on her mobile rooms were small with inefficient air conditioning all buttons had been removed on the control panel to prevent people turning it up as the room was small it was very stuffy there was no option of opening the windows as the traffic noise the room needs updating the beds were very hard and cheap quality and we were woken numerous times by doors banging loud noise inside the hotel and drilling on one would expect making facilities in a was a disgrace didnt even bother going on the last day it is in the basement in a small stuffy airless room with no windows there are only tables and no,0.0

the new hotel is a good choice when you wish to skip the large chain rooms are quite small with trendy furnishings you can not find a better location for shopping restaurants and historical sites roof top restaurant was lovely and the staff was very friendly,1.0
this was our third stay at the grande bretagne over the years it is as good as it has ever been ther hotel is nperfectly situated on syntama square the heart of athens the parliament is just across the street with its colorful changing of the guards ceremony the acropolis the plaka the agora and other notable historic sites are within reasonable walking distance despite greece financial issues the city is and clean the hotel has two pools a gym and of course a restaurant visit the rooftop in the evening with its wonderful view of the acropolis a nice touch is their afternoon iced peach tea and cookies for the asking the rooms are not large by us standards but well sized and nicely appointed with tasteful traditional furnishings we prefer the rooms facing the courtyard away from the noise and bustle of athens,1.0
soaking in a jacuzzi with a full view of the acropolis unbeatable blissfully quiet next to the pedestrian alley of the acropolis area no car noise great breakfast with home baked bread and cakes,1.0
the serras hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel overlooking the marina i can not say enough about the staff they were friendly and helpful with every detail we received a glass of champagne upon arrival and found sweets at night in our room the rooms are amazing contemporary with a classic flare the showers are uniquely equipped with aroma therapy infusions absolutely relaxing do miss the rooftop pool and bar drinks are fabulous as well as the views,1.0
this hotel is located directly across the street from the centraal station we walked to most sites in the city but took the direct train for euro to the airport the staff is super friendly and the sky lounge was a popular place in the had a harbor view and could watch cruise ships coming in and out of the harbor,1.0
we booked a two bedroom apartment absolutely brilliant we were near street right in the heart of the city we will definitely book staff were extremely helpful and pleasant the only problem was having to walk quite a way as the apart ent was not in the actual hotel,1.0
excellent hotel good facilities rooftop pool brilliant all staff polite and friendly no complaints only downside is hotel a little out of the city centre but metro stop across the road which we used constantly i would indicate location average which the markers below wont let me do,1.0
i am a big believer that a hotel serves the trip i do need fancy or endless amenities as i expect to be travelling the totally fit that bill the location in the southwest corner of stephen green made just about everything south of the liffey accessible within a minute walk the room was spacious and clean and the hotel bar was a good place for a final drink so long as your day was ending but midnight which was rare there was also an excellent food truck set up across the road after each night for a late night only issue we had was being there in july we found the room very warm and the ac not very effective opening the windows did he trick but we were on the front of the hotel with a busy street and team line below us that said we generally managed pretty well keeping windows open most of the day and closing them our few hours of sleep but the morning were warm all in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay again,1.0
we spent nights at this everything was absolutely perfect location helpfulness of staff communication when booking was always prompt breakfast selection was absolutely wonderful clean room but and this is beyond the hotel control on each of the nights of our stay weekend and weekday there was street noise that reached our canal facing room that ended between midnight and am i not talking about typical car noise i mean loud booming consistent music and yelling as if it were in the next room if i were to stay at this hotel insist on a room that faces the backside of the hotel if this can not be guaranteed book somewhere else it could possibly be noisier during the summer months,1.0
i had dinner at byzantino restaurant could not finish my meal after taking small bites i was feeling tired from jetlag i requested to have it in a to go box from my waiter he said that i could not take my leftovers to my hotel room he said he can have it delivered to my room but in a plate how am i suppose to place inside my small refrigerator to keep chilled very disappointed i just wasted my money i never heard such insane reasoning from a major hotel chain such as hilton that i have ever talked to the manager on duty mod before posting he was not helpful he left before we came to a reasonable resolution to my embarrassed to be a hilton honors gold restaurant supervisor approached me and offered to adjust off the main course from my bill that the simple resolution i was looking he did exactly what the mod should have offered to me before walking away the mod failed to make this hotel guest happy by mishandling this situation,0.0
this modern hotel has large rooms a small gym and spa and the highlight its rooftop bar restaurant and pool there are uninterrupted views of the city and its landmarks this a high end wyndham we also dined on the rooftop here we had an amazing cod with miso and a goats cheese is no doubt the hotel is busy but manager panagiotis intzidis and his team were very attentive,1.0
love this hotel this is the second time i have stayed here now and will definitely be back again room was gorgeous everything was spotless bed was so comfortable staff are really friendly cant wait to book again,1.0
i choose three star hotels because i want to save money but i always concerned about quality and safety hotel denit worked great for me the room was relatively small but clean and well maintained the shower was fully updated the linens were crisp hotel and surrounding street felt perfectly safe hotel denit is on a narrow street just off the main square in old barcelona placa de catalunya and only a block from the wonderful la rambla street notably because it is on a narrow street across there is at least from the floor just the building across the street this was not a problem for us however as we spent our time either walking the city or sleeping in our think you can book hotel denit with confidence,1.0
lovely hotel it was about minutes on the tram into amsterdam but it was nice to sit and see the whole city also it meant it was quiet at night rooms were lovely and the spa downstairs was a lovely way to relax after walking all day get you second wind and go back into city we had breakfast included and there was plenty of choice,1.0
we arrived for a night short break for my birthday upon arriving in room there was a very thoughtful gesture left by the hotel manager which was much appreciated thanks again the room itself was a fair size and nicely presented this room overlooked the vibrant rembrandtplein square and it was good to open the bay windows to soak up some of the atmosphere you could argue that later in the evening this position could be a bit noisy but this is to be expected and the hotel do kindly provide earplugs if required this wasnt an issue for us however the hotel generally is clean and tidy and we found the staff to be polite and helpful we agreed that we would both come back without hesitation,1.0
stayed here for nights friday saturday the hotel was in a good location welcomed by a friendly receptionist be aware you have to leave a deposit on arrival for bar purchases etc as we were a party of ladies we had a triple room the room was large and very clean although we could hear our neighbours so not sure how soundproof the rooms are it didnt really bother us as we literally only slept in the room there was much in the way of natural light again not really something that bothered us we did pay the for breakfast instead choose to visit local cafes much more reasonably priced we used the rooftop pool and bar the cocktails were great as was the snack highly recommend this hotel as it is in a great location for exploring the beautiful barcelona the rooms were comfortable and the staff really helpful,1.0
we chose this hotel online and were delighted with the location close to everything and easy to walk to some attractions anne frank house the hoho tours are everywhere and great to finding things trams are right there if this is your choice walking distance to the cruise port be prepared that this is not an american hotel about like a holiday style stayed night and night the first room was rather small no facial tissue or wash cloths provided no clock in the room the buffet was expensive euros per and rather skimpy on the food check in quick and easy with wonderful desk staff healthy snacks available for purchase in the lobby free computer use for guests we are not smart phone people so this was great for sending a quick message home rooms very clean and our second room was more the size of a small american hotel room with a larger bathroom and shower still no wash cloths or tissue i would stay here again for price and location,1.0
this is a stunningly beautiful property with well appointed and spacious rooms we stayed in a one bedroom suite that was very spacious fully renovated overlooked the canal and was very quiet the bathrooms even had towel warmers it is in a large historic building where queen beatrix was actually married it is an absolute must stay in if you are in amsterdam and looking for luxury and superior service we had the pleasure of being greeted and accommodated by a well trained guest services manager roel backus who extended himself graciously to my family and especially to my daughter to ensure that our stay was perfect which is was the buffet breakfast is a must try even if you are not staying at the hotel the variety is plentiful and quality is very high there is even a nicely sized swimming pool steam room and sauna which is unusual in european hotels but added an extra level of privilege and relaxation yes it is expensive but it is well worth the price you will pay from top to bottom and i highly recommmend a stay here a special thank you for roel for taking care of us and making us feel welcome at his property we hope to have the privilege of returning here some day,1.0
really lovely bar food in cellar bar very well priced and wonderful staff great location for meeting with friends and a wonderful choice of drinks would recommend it for groups as a few lovely alcoveswill be back,1.0
if i am back to barcelona i will visit this hotel again definitely i recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit barcelona but the noise of subway train was little bit annoying when i tried to sleep because i can feel and hear when the subway train comes near,1.0
my husband and i wanted a quiet getaway but unfortunately on saturday the construction started at am i had asked for a quiet room and indeed inside the hotel it was but the construction noise is very loud the bedroom was comfortable and the only downside was the safe that did not work and we found the towels not up to a star standard staff around the hotel very friendly,1.0
trinity city is a very nice hotel in a great location they are building a floor so keep in mind that they start drilling pretty early during the week the staff was extremely friendly and helpful go see gary and radi at the bar,1.0

great hotel with a great location stayed here for nights and had a wonderful time the rooms are nice and cosy they have everything that you need staff is very helpful and friendly they will tell you what all to visit and how to get there breakfast is ok nothing out of the world but just basic food it has a mcdonald right outside and handful of restaurants around the main airport line metro is just steps thanks for the awesome service,1.0
what a nice hotel the beds and linens are top notch the hotel itself carpet and halls are a but dated but the staff makes up for this every restaurant recommendation they gave us were perfect indian dutch italian we asked for directions to the museum and got roundtrip street car tickets right there as well as museum reservations as well this btw saved us countless hours in line at the van gogh museum another thing they recommended a great bike rental company which we used and the great doorman of our hotel as we rode by let us know our bike seats were too low and he came across the street to adjust them for us i regret that i forget his name but we gave him credit for us looking like locals all the other tourists riding around with their bike seats at the same level as their knees their personnel in the club level happy hour lounge are delightful it a bit warm in there though breakfast is also pleasant thank you,1.0
very clean and comfortable staff treat the hotel as their own home they care deeply about the facility and services they provide everyone goes out of their way to help you wo have a better experience anywhere,1.0
everything was on point here refined to excellence we had a suite and it was worth every penny the bed was beyond comfort and the hotel is perfect in every way highly recommended the main restaurant was closed the day we went there but le bouchon was a nice way for us to ease into our week in barcelona,1.0
the hotel is in a great location close to lots of amenities restaurants bars and plenty if shops the staff were always friendly and very room was really nice i would stay here again and definatly recommend it,1.0
the location is great but we found the facilities lacking they do really have a restaurant but share an entrance with the pub next door which provides their meals the single beds were extremely uncomfortable the room was hot we had to leave a door open to draw to draw a draft from the small window and the two fans provided barely moved any air the first refrigerator in our room had the plug cut off they replaced the plug and the light worked but it did cool so they brought in another one that barely cooled we had been told we have a the view was of other roofs and exhaust vents that made it so noisy we wanted to close the window but could because of the heat and some one was apparently recycling glass nearby because several times we would hear what sounded like someone dumping a barrel full of bottles the sink had two faucets so the only way to mix the water to the desired temperature was in the bowl of the sink which we thought went out over years ago some of the staff were great but some were rude on sunday we tried to call the front desk several times with no answer when we went down they said our phone must not be working but then called us moments later also on sunday despite being out of the hotel from about until after our room was not cleaned otherwise the cleaning was,0.0
stayed five nights with my wife during a professional nursing research conference hotel public areas and room very clean and comfortable was a bit hectic with many conference attendees checking in at same time hotel is in docklands area but has restaurants pubs etc within short walk epic museum a short walk property is a good minute walk from city center temple bar area trinity college bed very comfortable restaurants and bar all good but i would rate breakfast buffet as average at best noise level a problem in our room late night guests or i can not compare to other hotels in dublin but i would suggest review of a wide variety of dublin hotels prior to booking to get a sense of other properties,1.0
we spent two nights at the cubik and could not be happier with our hotel choice having never been to barcelona we were not sure where we wanted to stay we knew we wanted to be close to the gothic quarter and la rambla but not in the heart of it accomplished that we arrived very early after disembarking a cruise ship while our room was not ready at the front desk staff where very welcoming with water and champagne they took our bags and put them in a secure area so we could explore the city without worry the front desk also helped us book tour bus passes schedule a visit to la sagrada familia and book tickets to museu de design de barcelona to see the exhibit dave bowe is the front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful after spending most of the day exploring the city we came back to get our room we checked in a very spacious superior barcelona room on the floor it was a corner unit that faced the street via laietana at first i was concerned there would be a lot of street noise at night but the windows are so thick we could not hear anything from there we checked out the wonderful roof top bar and pool it was a nice little oasis on a hot day which gave us some time to relax after a day of walking in the hot sun what we really liked about this,1.0
absolutely great hotel location is ideal rooms very clean and spacious most importantly the staff is excellent patricia and sara at the breakfast were wonderful and made our stay extra special highly recommended,1.0
the condado is a three star hotel but in my experience it should be four star there is nothing to complain about staff were courteous and helpful even to us non spanish speakers rooms were clean and bigger than i thought i was going to get breakfast was good as well everything you need for continental and cooked breakfast was updated by staff all the time and i have to compliment the gent who looked after the breakfast as he never stopped cleaning tables and keeping the food at the breakfast table up to date also the reception was very clean and had fresh iced water for anyone to use the bonus for us was the unlimited supply of bottled water in fridges on all floors all i can say is thank you for a good stay and thank you to the staff member who found my money belt,1.0
the location of this hotel is excellent for what we wanted the staff were lovely nothing was to much trouble they really are a credit to the hotel right next to the metro station so easy to access the main sights will defiantly book this hotel again,1.0
this was my second stay at praktik garden and i will definitely be back the hotel is ideally located metro station within walking distance the hotel itself invites for lazy afternoons on the terrace staff is most helpful muchas gracias,1.0
not in bussy downtown but an upscale area with good options to dine out metro station is a few hundred meters away the rooms are typical nh style dark wood and the breakfast truly great as in all nh hotels i stayed in this year the service was very attentive also recognizing your status right from the beginning,1.0
the hotel is located in one of the busiest streets in athens on the top of the hotel the pool overlooks the entire city with all the mountains is a nice bar on the roof and in the lobby with food options good prices also the breakfast is amazing with fresh baked goods and good variety of food,1.0
we were made very welcome in this hotel the staff were lovely and made our stay very hotel was very clean and tidy and we had no problems at all when we stayed location wise the hotel was about a walk to dams square and was in a nice area which was quiet and the area had a few pubs there was a big street market outside the hotel on the weekend this was really nice and sold a huge amount we would stay her again,1.0
this hotel is beautiful and the quad room is quite spacious we arrived really early after getting off of the cruise ship and they held all of our luggage while we went out for a day of sightseeing the front desk gave us a map and helped me navigate how to get to the picasso museum and take public transit to montjuic there is a lovely afternoon tea reception with cookies and little sandwiches we were also surprised to be invited to an hour long rose wine tasting on the patio in the evening we had some great conversation with the other hotel guests and enjoyed two glasses of rose and a cava fun free wifi but our ac was very well though the breakfast is quite nice i like the cured meats and churros with chocolate,1.0
placed right off the river liffey tram station and near the guinness storehouse the location is ideal easy stroll down to the temple bar area as well rooms are great spacious and lovely reception greeted us well and although our room was not ready they were able to get us checked in so that when we returned from our first day full of jet lag we could just grab our keys and head to the room baggage storage available and safe,1.0
we very much enjoyed to stay in this charming hotel with a perfect location in a quiet although central area thanks to the friendly staff and to the owner very short distance to good restaurants akropolis and most other interesting parts of athens,1.0
i stayed here with my adult daughter and had a great time the hotel is ideally located we walked everywhere it is close to the beach but also close enough to walk into town the staff are very polite and helpful the room was clean and had everything except tea and coffee which i would have expected for stars the roof top bar was great and lovely to return back to after a day of exploring my only real complaint is that the bar could open earlier so you could get beach towels and a drink they missing a trick here as lots of people had obviously gone to a near by cafe also people had saved beds which is incredibly selfish in a hotel this big with such a small pool the hotel should be clear and strict about having a policy for this employ someone to keep an eye and remove towels when the person has not been there for half an hour some towels were there for well over an hour,1.0
for business or leisure our room had a view of the acropolis nice the hotel has several bars and restaurants we loved the galaxy restaurant at the penthouse what made it special for us was not only the excellent quality of the two dinners had there but the waitstaff especially grigoris the consummate professional with a great sense of humor stood out in the lobby level dimitri aka tall guy was outstanding with his professionalism and helpful and pleasant we ever go back to athens this would be our hotel of get to the hotel here from the airport it is fixed fare of euros each way the express bus costs euros for seniors so does the metro best to avoid of pickpockets,1.0
this hotel is just as the photos show lovely rooms we had room right on the corner with nice views down to the river liffey yes it was noisy at night if you had the window open but that why you stay in temple bar for the night life once you have a few refreshments you do hear the noise staff were lovely and friendly we arrived early so went for breakfast and were called when the room was ready which was an hour before listed check in time,1.0
this is a very special hotel the location is superior the decor is amazing and different every square inch of our room was decorated we had a car with us and chose to pay for the car to be picked up and parked for our two day stay knowing how difficult big cities are to navigate this parking option was so much easier than we could have was our first visit to amsterdam and based on reviews chose the garden view room with a spa bath tub located in the main building when we arrived we were upgraded to a canal view room mice surprise i would highly recommend a canal view room with the tub what still amazes me is how quiet the hotel area was big city and quiet usually do not go together but in this magical location it staff were so helpful and nice they really made us feel special and offered great advice in regard to restaurants and activities we were there during the of july and we received a free cocktail to celebrate the usa the special cocktails are excellent especially the gin and tonic there is a courtyard behind the hotel that is a nice place to relax outdoors we noticed there were several small buildings out side of the main hotel with rooms leading out to this courtyard i would not hesitate to stay in any of them i think this hotel may be the reason i fell in love with amsterdam,1.0
front desk staff very helpful and friendly i encountered many problems during my stay that should never happen at a hotel with this rating and the air conditioning one has no ability to adjust the temperature only the fans i found this quite shocking again for the rating and price regardless even with the fan turned at maximum and the temperature at minimum the room temperature was still way too warm on maximum the fan was too weak to adequately cool the room in addition again quite surprising is that when you remove the room key that powers the lights the air conditioning shuts off as well at the end of the summer day when you come in all hot and sweaty from touring around the room temperature was unbearable and took hours to cool staff was not quite competent three times during day stay i had to call the front desk because either the soap was not replaced the shampoo or conditioner was not replaced my bathrobe was not replaced etc again this should not happen at a hotel that supposedly is rated this the final straw my room safe was broken this was verified by the maintenance person the next day someone came to fix it i still could not get it to work turns out the instruction card on how to use the safe was completely incorrect when i showed it to the hotel worker he tore it up and threw it out,0.0
my family and i stayed here for a total of nights during our trip to ireland we completely enjoyed our stay here we had a triple room and it was very spacious and clean the breakfast has a variety of hot and cold items enough for everyone the location could not be beat we walked into the city with no problem we did not use the tram line but it was very close and would have been another good option we would definitely visit again if we are ever in dublin,1.0
there is a good convenient transport with metro downstairs there is a hours open bread shop factory and the hotel pool can have a great view of the arcopolis and the breakfast is buffet style and provides alot of choices,1.0
last week we stayed for a couple of days for holidays and we could relax after a visits to barcelona museums and places this hotel is perfect if you want to make a break at your staying in this city we could enjoy its swimming pool which was perfect after a tired day staff was not only very helpful but also gave us advice where to go or what to visit room big and very comfortable specially its bed everything was clean and breakfast was very tasty we recommend it,1.0
the meeting rooms we used two over days and both were terrible the rooms were dark as no windows as in basement with marks and damage on the walls and ceiling i would book these again the hotel seemed fine however we did not stay,0.0
i booked a single room and it was very small but otherwise not bad the desk staff were very pleasant and helpful the pub adjoining the lobby is lively and has good music too on the whole my stay was with the room were that it was very small for the price the shower door is too narrow and the lamp by the bed is too low for reading the lift did not work when i arrived but it was fixed the next day also the tv info provided in the room was out of date and inaccurate,1.0
took my mum to see aerosmith for their final tour and found this hotel through we managed to secure a great deal the hotel is very clean and decorated lovely all staff members which we spoke to from reception through to the bar were very welcoming and a meal before the mum had a burger the best burger i have ever tasted and i had the thai curry great value for money and great food with a great was clean and pleasant no complaints if i was to return to dublin would definitely visit this hotel again,1.0
the roads to the hotel are a bit confusing but there are sign had booked valet parking and that all went smoothly there were bottles of water in the car for our journey home which was a nice corridors were quite dark but the room was bed was so comfortable and the air conditioning kept the room a nice temperature the breakfast was lovely good quality produce the staff were helpful and friendly,1.0
would highly recommend hotel granvia for a stay in barcelona the hotel itself is beautiful and very well maintained they have a very nice patio area where we sat one evening and had tapas and a beer the rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are great the shower is amazing and having traveled a lot of places in europe that is always the case the only tiny complaint i have is the ac did work great we were still pretty warm in our room during our visit in july the wifi works great was very pleasantly surprised by that the hotel seemed to be very centrally located and we had no problems getting around would highly recommend to stay there and we will be back thank you,1.0
good hotel great location with good tram links to the beach and marina cracking rooftop views from the roof area comfortable room friendly and knowlegeable staff the only real downsides were an event on the roof terrace on the sunday that restricted our access to this part of the hotel on our last day and a sticky toilet sliding door that did close properly,1.0
stayed for nights excellent central location on main street for access to metro hop on hop off tours airport bus that came with downside of noise at night which did affect my sleep room was clean bathroom was very tight on space and i could see difficulties emerging for customers who may be obese as hard to close the door pass by the toilet to get into the shower breakfast room was clean also fresh fruit of bananas apples and oranges fruit juice water of cereals croissants and bread for toasting were available for guests never met staff members in breakfast room but staff on front desk were friendly and have no hesitation recommending this hotel for a city break just try and reserve a quieter room,1.0
we arrived at the conrad after a flight around noon and thankfully our room was ready the bed was so comfortable and breakfast was included with our stay the staff was always willing to help us make reservations or help us get around dublin plus it in one of the best locations we definitely recommend this hotel in dublin,1.0
about two blocks from the ramblas and a metro station staff not that friendly but usually responsive great breakfast provided rooms are small view except of the open courtyard shaft in middle,1.0
service and facilities were excellent the staff made us feel at home the front desk staff who checked us in did get his name unfortunately saw that my sister and i were so tired from our travels and did his best to get us a room asap beds were comfy hot and cold shower available basic amenities were provided excellent location as well just a few minutes from restaurants bars and cafe and the beach there is a bus stop right outside and the metro station is just a few minutes walk away we loved our stay here,1.0
we had adult daughters stay here recently during a family vacation i booked this on another discount website and got a great deal for such a quality hotel the room was lovely and the decor was early it is not modern nor is it meant to have modern decor and they take pride in this gem well cleaned each day and the complimentary mini bar is a bonus top quality products in the bathroom and a good night rest each night for nights we did not use the restaurant nor the other amenities there is some construction going on in the canal but a hotel can not be held responsible for that and it was a bother even with the open windows facing the canal we would stay here again anytime and recommend it to others if you like to stay in a star time piece of a hotel,1.0
hotel mirabello is located at omonoia square which is the city center of athens and nicely accessible to metro and bus routes the hotel is in a small building but the rooms are of decent size and was very clean and the breakfast was of good quality but the space was quite small and at certain times it could be difficult to find an empty table overall i was happy with my only downside was the method of payment i booked from and i chose to pay at the property but the property had charged the first night without my consent it had not been indicated that the first night is charged in the booking and i was a bit upset about this confusion,1.0
beautifully decorated comfortable rooms in the perfect location for walking to shops temple bar district restaurants and to tour the town staff was very helpful with providing directions and offering suggestions on what to do and see would recommend this area for families with children as it is in the heart of the bar district but definitely ok for older teens and couples,1.0
room was of a decent size and clean outlook was very good but then we did go there to stay in room looking out of window the staff on reception were brilliant very good at their jobs felt that safe hire deposit was a bit steep at euros we did take credit cards so was out of our spending money i think would of been a better price to ask the was returnable so safe hire cost nothing but it meant euros was tied up until last day cant comment on food as we did eat in lack in communication reguarding the amount of milk we were left there was of us first day little pots left we like each there is very little milk in pot reception were happy to give us more day we left a note please leave us more milk we were left pots not even enough cup of tea of us so we had to get more day note ignored again we said please leave us pots again pots were left was frustrating would of been better left too much surely they must realize those pots of milk hardly contain any other than that moan which was annoying hotel was good,1.0
loved everything about this hotel modern clean room nice breakfast buffet friendly staff the main attraction for me though was the rooftop area where i spent most of my time in athens it has a view of the acropolis a small pool with some sunloungers bar and restaurant perfect for just spending the day in the sun or to refresh before or after sightseeing in town everything we had to eat or drink there was nice and not too pricey as for the area around the hotel yes it looks a little dodgy however the only area i think one should really avoid at night is the omonia square a few blocks to the north other than a few offers to buy certain substances i did experience anything out of the ordinary in the immediate area around the hotel,1.0
state of the clontarf castle for days july through the had the bridal suite was absolutely spectacular frederica luke elaine all of them were awesome they made us feel like queens the food was spectacular the ambience was out of this world and the high tea was absolutely delightful i would highly recommend staying at the clontarf it a fabulous place walking around near the boardwalk by the sea is an awesome sight to see i will return to clontarf,1.0
my husband and i stayed here before and after a mediterranean cruise out of barcelona we used a timeshare exchange and could have been happier with this boutique hotel the staff provided us with complimentary bubbly upon our arrival while we waited for our room we showed up early and they accommodated us the entire staff was very professional and so friendly and helpful our interaction with josep clara and rafal was delightful they gave us recommendations for some delicious tapas and paella within walking distance and directions to attractions our room was on the floor very clean comfortable and modern we loved the view from the negative edge pool on the floor and it had a nice bar there as well the staff sent up a lovely complimentary plate of goodies to our room one afternoon we had requested a call on our day of departure and a live person called us to wake us up not an automated one the breakfast buffet is definitely worth checking out too to sum it up we ca wait to return,1.0
i booked this hotel at at night and checked in minutes later due to my other hotel being really average i chose this hotel because of the location it is a few minutes walk from the main shopping street buses train a girl travelling on her own it is a great hotel because of it location i would stay here again the staff and cleaning staff are really friendly and very helpful breakfast is included which is good it nothing special but it fine i have been having fruit and yogurt because it gluten free but there a lot of other is an amazing absinthe bar across the road down a lane way full of locals which is great the bed in the hotel was not good at all i could feel every spring having a terrible bed in a hotel is the worst because after a long day of walking and sightseeing you want to have a good sleep these beds do allow that the pillow was fine very spacious room with a large window bathroom is fine everything works they give you fresh sheets every day and mop the floor so it is very clean no kettle i thought that was unusual i like to make tea in my full length mirror aircon was great wifi works best at the door and the window i stay here again but the beds really let this place down if you love a comfortable bed then you might want to look,1.0
a very good the room had great standard was clean and had a wonderful view sadly not too friendly staff on the rooftop also its not very far from dam by taxi tram or one of their rental bikes other than that i would def recommend ramada,1.0

the hotel is sadly no longer the elegant good service place it used to be bad service and poor food in the restaurant but in particular nasty insulting baggage clerk in the storage room i checked out at am and then realized at am that i had left my belongings in the room safe i returned to the front desk and the helpful assistant asked the baggage clerk david to accompany me to the room his reaction was one of great anger at being disturbed although he was not busy and when i insisted and after more than hour he accompanied me insulting me all the way up in the elevator and along the corridor how could you be so stupid do you know how hotels work you are wasting my time i got my belongings as the safe was still locked but i am very disgusted that somebody like him could be employed there who else has he insulted i bet i am not the first and management does not seem to care dublin has many good hotels so there is no need for anybody to subject themselves to such insulting behavior,0.0
this was our visit to the ashling hotel it is a few minutes walk from heuston station in a quiet location tram takes mins into dublin shopping district hotel is lovely comfortable and spotlessly clean all staff are excellent we received an anniversary card and chocolates for our anniversary which was a nice touch i would definitely return again,1.0
this hotel is located on the west dock behind the central station about a minute walk reception staff were friendly and helpful i was given a choice of rooms and opted for a view away from the dock but bigger and higher up the bed was comfortable with a good duvet the room had a digital safe iron hairdryer minibar and tea and coffee facilities the shower was powerful and large a good range of toiletries was supplied in the room everything was very clean the hotel bar does good cocktails and has an outside area on the dock breakfast was a very high quality buffet really liked this hotel and would stay again,1.0

the junior suite comfortably accommodated all three of us a king sized bed and a separate area with single beds the king sized bed was so comfortable with really soft sheets i slept so well on those nights that we were there it had a big bathroom as well the hotel is about mins away from a big mall diagonal del mar and very near a number of bus stops the area is quiet and less crowded because it is quite far about mins by bus or metro from the city center and all the touristy breakfast spread was delicious and ample and i have to highlight the service that the staff delivered they were very accommodating and quick to deliver whatever it is you needed the food was immediately replenished,1.0
would take this hotel again without hesitation just outside town city center easily accessible with tram very clean small kitchen with utensils our comfortable home for three days staff is outstanding,1.0
my wife and i travelled with another couple from canada we spent the last night in ireland at clontarf after touring kms over days this was a great way to finish our great trip the castle has a mix of modern and traditional to the property which really makes this property work the way it does the pub and restaurant were amazing and the food was atmosphere was perfect as soon as we arrived and the décor suits their theme for a castle ca think of anything to improve this recommend to friends and would return when travelling back to you for a great experience,1.0
sir adam is so new opened in december that the cab driver didn t know how to find it of course i should have taken a cab i should have just taken the ferry from the train station right across the harbor which runs constantly i ve stayed in lots of boutique hotels but this was among the best in terms of design also during the checkin process i experienced something new the person who checked me in offered me a drink and then when we were done with the registration process they personally escorted me to the room with plenty of explanations along the way my room overlooked the harbor with big picture windows and the view even from the floor was great the was room was overflowing with storage so even two people shouldn t have a problem finding places to store their luggage and clothes i loved that the shower and toilet were in two separate spaces and the bed was super comfortable on the weekend it can get to be a bit of a scene down in the lobby but it gives you lots to look at my experience with the restaurant there was mixed so my advice is not to stray too far from the burgers and chicken wings one weird thing is that all the seats at the bar have their backs to the beautiful harbor views and instead look into the kitchen weird my only criticism is that the hotel service did always,1.0
after disembarking from our oceania cruise we spent eventful days in barcelona to cap off our vacation the hotel bagues located on la rambla was a perfect location for walking around the front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the restaurant staff was excellent as was the food we were supposed to have a car pick us up at the hotel to take us to the airport and we asked the front desk staff to please confirm it for us turns out that our flight was moved up an hour so they had to call the driver and ask him to get there earlier i think everyone at the front desk got involved in this task from finding the number to waiting on hold they were terrific i sure i may have missed some names here but thanks go to avelino jorge anastasia fabio nicolas soungalo the friendly doorman and eder and marco the restaurant staff heartily recommend this fine establishment,1.0
the hotel was great and staff very friendly and helpful but ubication of hotel is horrible there is a lot of pakistan and afganistan imigrants they are all night screaming like fighting so i felt not secure and comfortable there,1.0
checked in today first time in dublin very well located walking distance to the bars and restaurants nice friendly staff the bar needs extra staff though just one guy trying his that not good minor rang room service for milk carton to make it on its way one hour later nothing i got fed up of waiting and went a restaurant called into front desk to ask them for the milk still waiting on this is a nice hotel ultra clean and well maintained but i got a feeling it under staffed will try the breakfast in a he if i do comment take it as good,1.0
very enjoyable in all aspects staff decor location staff could not have been more accommodating very clean and contemporary only floors small location was accessible by walking to all main thoroughfares cabs were easy to flag down would highly recommend,1.0
fantastic facilities and convenient location for the beach and tube into town the service on reception however was desperately slow and understaffed there was no que for hhonurs members which is unusual,0.0
this hotel charges star prices and does have star location is great for the tourists right near all attractions you to tick staff are friendly and helpful full marks there the lobby and surrounding areas are impeccably clean and kept again full marks the pool was nice although was too deep the rooftop had fantastic views and the food on offer in the breakfast buffet was only reason this hotel lost a point with me was due to the inconsistency in the rooms the deluxe room which we stayed in was nice and reasonably spacious but it just too much of a down grade from the more expensive rooms the bed was just joined together and not made together two beds made separately but joined together with a king cover over the top the bathroom was in need of an update also this can be seen from other customers overall it was a great stay would i stay here again probably not but i probably would stay in the same neighborhood of athens either again so is not really the hotels fault that i would stay there again,1.0
had a wonderful stay here the rooms are nicely designed and have everything you need the breakfast was excellent every day and all of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly great food and drinks at the bar too which we had after arriving at about some people unsure about the location i say the location is only an issue if you never been and would like to be more central and close to the touristy areas but i like to be a little bit out of the centre and love oost the beautiful frankendaelpark is only a minute walk away and it about minutes to walk to amstel station to get a tram i think which goes pretty central if you wanted to be more central then you should looked at a map before booking and chosen a more central hotel duh,1.0
even if you do want to stay have a drink at the rooftop bar the acropolis is in direct view oh and the greek parliament is just across the square which means you can watch the changing of the guards without having to deal with the crowds or giving up your drink,1.0
stayed here for nights in july the location is next to museums and across from the canal which i could see from my room i was able to pick up a canal cruise across the street it is also on the same block that holds the most expensive strip of shops in amsterdam good for window shopping even though the street is a bit busy the hotel is quiet the rooms are a pretty good size for europe the bar is open all day for snacks and drinks breakfast is just ok but plenty if you are not looking for fancy and want to just get your day started the staff was friendly and check out easy,1.0
was in amsterdam to see last weekend stayed at the doubletree centraal station excellent location access to shopping old town museums and mins trains ride to the amsterdam arena super friendly staff early checkin after a hour flight was breakfast was dinner at the steakhouse was had a good time,1.0
we stayed for three nights at roxford lodge hotel the place was nice and quiet and in a very lovely neighbourhood our room was quite small but we asked for a very quiet one facing the backyard there is a bus going to the centre just outside the lodge hotel but we prefered walking,1.0
i recommend that you include breakfast we booked at the last minute so the price seemed high we hope that you have a flexible price policy with advance booking but in general everything is fine especially the location,1.0
a very good travelodge on the outer edges of the city but a good walk in and the busess stop right outside and are every few minutes so no problem with getting in and out no cafe onsite but a cafe a few doors down that does a really good breakfast and was reasonably priced,1.0
was headed to barcelona for a convention and decided to arrive a week ahead of time whenevr there a convention in town prices seem to be very high found this place in a great location blocks away from passeig de gracia at a great price the hotel exceeded my expectations the decor is beautiful chic trendy modern and full of art breakfast was very good and enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful terrace beautiful tree in the middle you would never think you in the city sitting on that terrace the room was very comfortable nice bathroom however my room was on the floor and quite noisy people in spain seem to go to bed at am so i could hear people partying outside i went to the front desk after trying to sleep in that room for nights they right away changed my room to an upper floor at no additional cost very helpful and friendly staff also right near the hop on hop off bus stop la pedreira which was great would recommend this hotel any time,1.0
from the moment i first arrived at the hotel i knew i would have a great stay i was warmly welcomed and the staff recognised my expedia status and were able to offer me an early checkin which was rooms are clean and was adequately sized for me the rooftop pool area was always kept clean with plenty of towels on offer i read someone else complained about the drink prices at the rooftop bar i thought they were too bad especially given the costs of running it staffing it amusing aspect was seeing and speaking to people who did realise it was a hotel when booking they first appear a little nervous and apprehensive but you soon notice them relax and enjoy themselves i would recommend this hotel to all my friends gay or straight,1.0
loved the location quick easy check in and bell service to help with luggage the rooftop restaurant lounge is over the top very special the breakfast is free but not very well staffed or organized they only have one automatic expresso maker for the entire hotel breakfast so coffee is hard to get and refill food variety is good as is quality not crazy about my single room very dark bathroom really small best location in athens so worth the stay would upgrade the room,1.0
service and facilities were excellent the staff made us feel at home the front desk staff who checked us in did get his name unfortunately saw that my sister and i were so tired from our travels and did his best to get us a room asap beds were comfy hot and cold shower available basic amenities were provided excellent location as well just a few minutes from restaurants bars and cafe and the beach there is a bus stop right outside and the metro station is just a few minutes walk away we loved our stay here,1.0
so in may i was taken on a surprise trip to barcelona by my now husband and we stayed in hotel and this is where he proposed so now fast forward later and we are just married there just over weeks so we thought it would only be right if we went back for our well i just look this place and it will always have a special meaning to me we stayed here for nights and it is even more gorgeous and luxurious than i remember perfect location just step outside the doors to the lively hustle and bustle of la ramblas the roof top bar is a must to quench your thirst while taking in the city view i could have easily sat there all day drinking mojitos they are a bit pricey at but definitely the best in town the staff are so friendly and welcoming they really add to the experience and the breakfast there is no way any one could leave there with an empty stomach as the range they have is unbelievable and champagne for breakfast what more could a girl want already planning on making a visit back to my favourite spot in barcelona,1.0
came here for afternoon tea with my wife the food was brilliant the tea vibrant and tasty but above all else the staff were impeccable every single staff member greeted us with a pleasant smile and made us feel like we were dining on cloud the girl serving our table was particularly good service like hers would really makes us want to visit again great customer service like this is a true commodity to any establishment be back for sure,1.0
stayed here for one night for a work trip great location staff helpful and knowledgeable and then beds weresuper comfy just what you need when away for work one point the air con was not great so the room was hot but if that the only problem your onto a winner definitely stay here again,1.0
we stayed here one night in a single room and a double rooms are large clean and the are thick so i could hear anything from outside right outside the hotel you got the canals and tons of bars and nice restaurants and cafes very close to rembrandt reception staff is friendly responsive and very professional i feel safe in this would definitely stay here again,1.0
stayed in july with a friend hotel is excellently situated and has good bar food rooms are a bit tired but the price was reasonable for central dublin at night the room was very hot though that would be my only real complaint watched the traditional music and dancing show one night which was great overall a good place to stay and would stay there again,1.0
as regular travelers to barca we had the b hotel on our radar for some time the rooftop infinity pool and bar the perfect location in plaza espana great if you are making your own way from the airport and the obvious funky vibe and great design well we were disappointed we stayed for my birthday at the end of june and we had a fabulous time the rooms are modern and cool with tea and coffee and nice modern bathrooms and great communal areas but above all the staff make the place extra special the reception staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the bar staff at the fantastic rooftop are brilliant fun i was very touched to find a lovely card and bottle of cava waiting for me in the room on my birthday and the fun continued by the pool with family and friends later ca recommend the b hotel enough and my daughter has booked to go there later on in august if you want a quality hotel great terrace pool food and a bar look no further,1.0
stayed as couple with friends over the weekend in our opinion this star hotel offers more than other that i have seen it may not have the latest technology or the hyper modern rooms but it clean decent size of rooms and bathroom and the reception staff attended to our not so many needs we did not use the restaurant but coffee is great our room was facing the do know what the reason was but our rooms were insanely hot although the outside temperature was not hot at all all in all great place on foot to city center temple bar grafton street in minutes max we will come back,1.0
this hotel has everything one needs its located just near christ church and dublin castle its an easy walk everywhere a pet peeve of mine is the breakfast extortion game many european hotels charge where it costs euros when all you want us a cup of coffee and a croissant this hotel allows you to order a la carte in the lobby lounge w wonderful respite about from the scavengers picking apart the room was clean modern and the bed was very comfortable the only thing is that housekeeping tended to make up our room late in the day between which meant after a long day out in the city we sometimes returned with a room unmade and being tired we had to call down to find out when they could clean it could have been the location of our room at the end of the hallway,1.0
i think said it all great service in every area of the hotel even before we had a great time and if we go back to dublin in the future we will be there for sure outstanding experience,1.0
we had a good stay at this hotel the lobby is very impressive the staff were overly friendly but still professional the rooms were clean and comfortable the buffet breakfast that was included was good too,1.0
we stayed in july to celebrate our thirtieth wedding anniversary this is our fifth stay and each time we have enjoyed the friendliness and helpfulness of all staff the hotel is very centrally situated and everywhere we wanted to go was a silly walkable although we did make use of the hop on hop off bus and boat our rooms were in the amsterdam wing where we hav stayed times before and is one of my favourite parts of the hotel the breakfast room is amazing and the breakfasts themselves are wonderful with an amazing variety of food available at the end of a busy day it is great to sit and have a coffee while watching the world go by in dam square this is a really great hotel with great staff,1.0
we were a family of travelling with a one year old so finding a place was very important while i would consider this place to be a family hotel in the sense that there are a lot of activities if you have young children they provided such great amenities for our baby that the stay was extremely comfortable and relaxing we arrived really late close to midnight and were still able to check in with a portable crib already set up and ready to go for our son it was the cutest crib too by the way in the style of bus our son slept so well in it as did we because those blackout shades are amazing they also provided extra towels and baby bathtub and baby bath kit for us which was great the room was comfortable with a king bed water kettle which came in handy for making our son meals and a nice quiet balcony overlooking the courtyard the entire balcony was encased in glass so our son really enjoyed waddling out there to look outside and eat his breakfast they even provided swim towels for use at the pool which was really nice my husband got to go and enjoy the pool on the roof and really enjoyed having drinks and getting ice cream on such a warm day the staff were really nice responsive and helpful when we had questions or requests and were very accomodating to our needs as we were travelling with,1.0
we stayed here for nights on a weekend break the hotel itself is really nice i was very surprised it was so cheap the location is great with lots of great restaurants around try cu cut across the road some of the best tapas i ever had you are in walking distance of las ramblas minutes if that where you looking to go very close to tube stations etc the hotel room itself was so so nice all done in very high quality bed was very comfy and the decor in the room was just very nice our room was quiet very relaxing air con good and high quality towels and sheets etc the reception area was also very nice staff were attentive and friendly but not they would say hello when you walked in but were then asking lots of questions etc we saw the roof terrace very small with a small pool but it looked very nice we did go up there in the evening but i imagine it nice for a drink and open until but could get crowded we did actually go down to the restaurant but heard music from there as we were heading out one night it sounded good event would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back,1.0
stayed one night at a hugely overpriced rate got back to hotel at about midnight got to sleep at about made complaint at about to night manager mark who was very nice it must be said about the noise as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably i was aware of the nightclub when i made the booking and was prepared to be awake till around but is ridiculous nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle room faced onto the street and the windows are not double glazed the noise from the street coupled with the noise from the nightclub was deafening on checkout i refused to pay the full fee and without even coming to meet me and apologise the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount now while i appreciated the gesture the reduction only brought the charge down to the nightly rate which in my opinion is still overpriced this is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night and only get a little bit of sleep not for anyone who is going to bed,0.0
we stayed for nights following a baltic cruise our first night was not pleasant as the room was really too small for people should be a single room and lacking air conditioning my wife took ill on the second morning partly due to the heat we think too weak to tour or even vacate the room to allow the room to be cleaned the staff could not have been more accommodating we had requested a move to a larger room and they let us occupy it as soon as it was prepared after the previous guests checked out and it had air conditioning a real godsend much larger and more comfortable i had breakfast at the hotel the first morning but we very much enjoyed a cafe blushing just around the corner the next days the hotel is in an absolutely ideal location close to museums restaurants and parks and on a quiet street we would recommend aalders hotel highly,1.0
highly recommended this hotel has a home from home feeling spotless and staff are naturally friendly and helpful food very good location amazing we stayed because we were attending the man utd match in the aviva the staff were able to manage a large crowd in their stride,1.0
stayed at the morgan august bank holiday weekend the hotel is amazing very chic and stylish our room was great huge bed with floor to ceiling windows which made the room so bright the bar downstairs is very lively during the evenings which suited us fine the staff were absolutely amazing so helpful and friendly they were quick to recognise each time we approached the bar to make sure that we were waiting too long even though it was packed anna was very lovely and tolerated our drunken behaviour she deserves a medal definitely recommend the morgan and ca wait to stay again,1.0
the hotel is extremely professionally run and modern staff are very attentive and we loved the fact it not a chain or a huge hotel the pool is on the rooftop and quite large in comparison to other barcelona hotels we thoroughly enjoyed our time here the only down side would be it a tiny bit further out this may not be ideal for those who like to be central,1.0
i spent nights at the corner hotel during a business trip earlier this year and quickly fell in love the hotel is beautifully designed and the service is impeccable the rooms are spacious and comfortable much like having an apartment of your own in the city the sound system in the room completes the experience if you should like to venture outside of your room the roof features a small pool and great view as for exploring barcelona the hotel is close to rambla de catalunya and the gaudí houses on passeig de gracia and a lovely walk to la rambla and the gothic quarter or the sagrada família in the other direction what more could you ask for,1.0
the rooms were lovely and fun with a basketball hoop breakfast disappointing and unorganised and some staff were as helpful but for location it was perfect to get to everywhere you need a tram stop just round the corner,1.0
what i expected no nasty surprises and good price as compared to other stays in amsterdam was disappointed that we could not upgrade to the letter rooms especially when myself and my husband went up on the deck to look at them and they were not occupied would have been a nice experience also there should be more than one member of staff at reception when you arrive at a hotel after a long plane train and boat journey the last thing you want is to stand in a queue for minutes to check in all in all a pleasant stay if you plan to just have somewhere to lay your head down which for us was perfect,1.0
our stay at amsterdam was very was reasonable rooms very spacious and the service excellent and the location of the hotel is ideal will surly consider staying there again for our next trip,1.0
we stayed in clemens hotel for days in july the location was awesome near all sites the staff was friendly and very helpful they are available all the day for any stairs were many and very tiny but the staff take our luggages room was narrow but we enjoyed the weather in the small recommended,1.0
my wife and i stayed in the last week of june for my birthday and retirement complimentary champagne was a great touch thank is a lovely hotel it is a beautiful building and well worth having a good look room was large with a well stocked free bed was probably the most comfortable bed we have ever slept toiletries were good breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices also had a lovely view from our staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble especially rex and you all so much,1.0
run down in need of repairs no charm except the reception area and overall lackluster experience at best roof was leaking from the upstairs shower in a waterfall elevator down all day busted furniture in room wet paint signs left up for days when dry anyway dirty towel reused it was a horrible stay in an amazing city that brought our overall trip down a notch there are so many charming options in dublin look elsewehre,0.0

we have stayed at a number of times now over the past five years and it has always been a pleasure great location great staff great facilities great hotel highly recommended if you are visiting barcelona,1.0
the decor and rooms at this hotel are beautiful and the reception staff were very professional but we did have a few gripes first of all there was no corkscrew or bottle opener in our room so we had to ring and wait for one to be brought to us secondly they have disposable out cups for the coffee in the room which might seem not much of a great deal but i prefer to drink out of china my biggest however would have to be about the breakfast which i thought was very average also after ordering cooked to order eggs and bacon our plates were left on the side waiting to be brought to us for at least five minutes and were uncovered with two waitresses talking to each other directly over them i suppose i should have asked for them to be cooked again as they were cold when they got to us but as were in a hurry we did overall a nice stay one night before a cruise but i would stay there again,1.0
this hotel is brand new and beautiful right near central station and damrak great place to be beautiful rooms and very accommodating to our dog truly recommend this hotel for anybody traveling to amsterdam,1.0
nice modern hotel close to dam square km approx and central station if you are taking metro then get down at waterlooplein station and walk for minutes if you are walking from central station it would take around minutes depending on the route you the metro cost me and my wife around euros hour pass on the way back we took taxi a merc and it cost us only euros so i suggest taking taxi unless you decide to were exceptional may be the best in all the accor hotels i have been to very helpful professional and had checked in online and we had the room ready they were kind enough to accommodate our request to change to a canal view had a great spread eggs sausages croissants hot chocolate cheese cold cuts etc and they serve breakfast from am to pm yes in the afternoon decent ibis sized rooms nice lounge next to reception minutes walk to red light is a bike rental shop and super market near the hotel,1.0
hotel is in a good location close to glyfada and not far from downtown athens sufficient activities close to the location prices are fair rooms on the floor are the nicest hotel and rooms were clean roof garden rooftop was the best feature with live music once a week and quality choices bartenders and senior staff were friendly and outgoing they are the best,1.0
this hotel was really comfortable located in the centre of amsterdam just minutes walk from the train station the room was comfortable and provided with kettle tea and coffee making facilities hairdryer fridge with mini bar and a small snacks basket it was a good area for restaurants and bars and was close to the red light district the staff were also very helpful there is a breakfast service available in the morning room but it is just as nice to eat elsewhere,1.0

the w brand is very good at designing hype and trendy hotels this hotel is an is such a cool vibe and i really loved the indoor area unfortunately the rooftop pool was closed due to maintenance then to bad weather both times we we could give it a try the service is also very good we went for breakfast a bit late the buffet was closing but the lovely waitress brought us la carte pancakes fresh juice and hot chocolates and told us only happy when my costumers are full what a nice touch you really should ask a room with a city view and not atrium view as they are much much much nicer,1.0
have just returned from a night stay friday to sunday doing my research before choosing this hotel really paid off what an absolute gem of a place fabulous location not a touristy area but so near to centre little delay on checking in but then given a great room on the floor a very spacious twin bedded room with curtains air con safe in wardrobe plenty of storage flat screen tv with many channels in different languages full length mirror and very comfy beds big bonus were the doors opening onto a sweet little balcony with table and chairs and views down the main road the room was very quiet at night slept really well free wifi worked fine good lift to all floors bathroom was also spacious with bath and shower good water temp and pressure windows opened which is always good when it hot nice toiletries served till what a spread selection of hot foods cold meats and cheeses fresh fruit cereals yogurts cakes and pastries rolls and toast huge selection of hot drinks and very nice fresh juices all fresh and replenished right up until all staff so friendly and helpful happy to advise on buses and metros fontana metro station mins walk handy supermarket and ice cream parlour on the way this line took us to nearly all the places we wanted to visit got to know it really well stops to centre of city had ordered bcn hola day card before leaving so just had,1.0

this is a star hotel and this classification tells you what to expect it is clean service is ok not exceptionnal comfort is average single beds rooms are larger vs other european hôtels we had a mezzanine people narrow staircase no lights so you ca read except if you keep the overall lights open one particular point you can not throw paper in the toilet breakfast is included but standard a good thing you can prepare your fresh orange juice you can make your cappucino other good thing hotel is very well located walking distance from the parliament acropolis very near syngrou subway station one negative element noisy during the day because of the traffic clim is also noisy it may disturb your sleep this is a very good ratio,1.0
stayed for three nights room clean and comfortable toiletries kettle and towels for the pool included in the room together with the best hotel hairdryer i ever had did have breakfast as i thought per person per day was too much instead had lovely croissants in the local were friendly and helpful with good recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to eat our thanks to lucia who recommended a great restaurant on our first night pool small but very pleasant hotel is situated in the centre of barcelona so is perfect for getting to all the major tourist attractions would recommend this hotel,1.0
i had a short stay here the rooms were small and comfy slippers and a robe were provided the check in and check out process was quick and easy they were very helpful in securing an early morning taxi for me to the airport i was disappointed that breakfast was not included in the room rate,1.0
my husband and i loved this hotel it modern and attractive with a bar and swimming pool on the roof our room was a good size and the service was excellent we had to leave early in the morning to catch a ferry and at checkout without our having requested it we were handed a breakfast to go nothing fancy just a sandwich and an apple but a thoughtful touch as for the neighborhood it certainly is a fancy one but we always felt safe at night and during the day there are some really great discount stores i bought a pair of italian leather sandals for e it just a fifteen or twenty minute walk in one direction to the plaka and the acropolis and the same in the other direction to the national archeology museum i highly recommend it,1.0
not a star hotel but very good location is truly fantastic for eating drinking and site seeing service was tremendous hotel is a bit dated plenty of space in the standard queen room with a small sitting area and a large bathroom shower is great but finding the right temp is like finding where track begins on a record,1.0
we booked a family room with rooms interconnected it is a classic and charming hotel with swimming pool and bar on roof top not busy that gives you a great city are spacious and very clean breakfast buffet has many fresh and good choices location is excellent it on busy commercial street you do hear any noise though from hotel rooms with lots of shops bars restaurants and walking distance to casa batllo and la pedrera if you come with a car there are public parking garage book online in advance to pay a lot less just min take a cab if you have little kids to avoid walk they are cheap and air conditioned so far all the cab drivers we met are all honest and did not over charge look up google map suggested distance and price you all have a pleasant stay like we did we will definitely come again for this beautiful sunny and friendly city,1.0
i have stayed at this hotel times now over the space of years it location is amazing it the cheapest hotel on dam square the staff are helpful and polite although when you call to reception they do take a while to deal with requests the staff always keep a record of you so they appreciate repeat custom and it goes a long way to be greeted as a returning customer something you do expect them to do they store your luggage and let you check in earlier than advertised when they can it always clean basic but above satisfactory cleanliness,1.0
my second visit to athens brought to the amalia best on the wonderful reviews and read and the people are true my previous stay was close by at a popular star but i wanted to try something different and i impressed the property is located well to trains buses and taxis shopping is a two months minute walk to everything first impression on checkin around was friendly and quick the staff are open and want to help i had a superior room on the sixth floor which had a large balcony and king bed parents a note that the balcony has a low height barrier and i suggest kids should be supervised the standard of the room is good and clean including the bathroom and toilet the breakfast spread is well done and would be similar to a star buffet i liked it so much that i booked again to visit in day on my way back to the city,1.0
we spent six nights in this centrally placed hotel a good location for the fira conference centre and for walking around the city we paid a premium for a room with terrace only discovering on our arrival that it was positioned at the end of the rooftop swimming pool area screened from the pool users by some pot plants which were only knee high this meant that there was no privacy whatsoever people passing by to the bar could look straight in some yobs actually threw their lit cigarette ends over on to our sun beds burning the cover and one end was flanked by the back of the bar where the sound of empty bottles being thrown away was a regular feature this was very the management quickly replaced the sunbed covers for some stained ones which again was very nice and inappropriate for the standard of hotel the room itself was spacious and comfortable with kettle and fridge there was a large bathroom containing separate shower and what looked like a large round spa bath in a separate area but which turned out to be just a bath in an unlit space opening the window in this space was impossible as it overlooked the sunbeds on the pool terrace bottled water should have been supplied daily but we had to keep on asking for this breakfast was astonishing in its variety of food on offer the breakfast hall was huge so one had to walk a long way,1.0
situated on the canal away from the crowds this hotel permits good sleep our room was a good size the bathroom actually had a bath and there was a fridge safe hairdryer and ironing supplies the decor was modern all the staff we encountered were very pleasant and they responded to a problem i had with the safe extremely quickly it is only a minute walk or short taxi ride to the central attractions there is a gym which we did not use or you could along the canal path,1.0
my family and i spent one of our best vacation right here in barcelona and we could have picked a better hotel it is clearly a hotel in every sense of the word and the staff were if ever there was a rating for staff services everyone performed at their best throughout our past four days here helpful full of attention huge smiles immaculate attires professional and so warm the owner of the casa fuster should be so proud that his hotel runs so well and his guest so well looked after we will come back to this lovely city and we will stay at casa fuster and we will highly recommend it to all our friends and families who are headed this way,1.0
the view is to die for not to mention the food we spent a lazy afternoon relishing greek cuisine and sipping wine here the weather changed from hot to cold to wet to hot and cols again all within minutes worth a halt,1.0

my friend and i stayed here from july and found the hotel staff very helpful our room was just a comfort one but was very clean and adequate for a base for our sightseeing around another mirror full length would be helpful in the bedroom especially for two ladies trying to put on their makeup the breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed sitting outside on the sunny terrace every roof top terrace bar is great for a relaxing drink in the evening so all in all i we were impressed,1.0

we spent night on july we arrived about but could gain access to our room until reception staff offered to store our luggage so we could go straight out to sightsee so perfect arrived back later in the afternoon and were given room on the ground floor which overlooked the amstel canal room the biggest room but nicely decorated and modern lovely bathroom with plenty of towels toiletries and a good hairdryer and always plenty of hot water only down sides was the door between bedroom and bathroom was frosted glass so bit unusual but suppose that modern and there was a slight smell of dampness in the bathroom slept ok lot of noise from the street and people coming hotel at all hours biggest letdown was the breakfast we went along at no pastries croissants scrambled eggs left i asked the waiter if these would be replenished he shook his head and moved on we settled for some toast and a boiled egg there was some bacon left but it really did look appealing check out was at but again they stored our luggage till we in all a nice hotel staff were friendly and helpful and i would return again would just make sure i went earlier for breakfast,1.0
hotel is located in a great area near central amsterdam stayed here for a business trip hotel was recently updated rooms were clean and comfortable took a while to get checked in but the remainder of the stay was fine very pricy each night had a different rate which was interesting breakfast was not included in my rate so i purchased it separately at a discount,1.0
not a good place to stay if ur over tall bathroom is way to small ca even dry yourself after a shower without opening the bathroom door rooms very small as well no bar fridge or aircon very disappointing,0.0
i am currently staying here and this place has been nothing but a was very expensive for a four star yet shower gel is just a basic pump style thing that you get at a budget get a measly five bits of tissue conditioner coffee was told what is with the kettle is what you get and nothing else only tea uncomfortable poor breakfast ca believe i paid extra for thisonly positives are that the room was always left clean and the inside of the hotel is quite modern and disappointed and there no chance i ever recommend this place to anyone,0.0

this hotel was great the level of service from all the staff was fantastic from start to finish we really enjoyed our stay here the room was wonderful bed comfortable and bathroom very nice as well the room was a tad small but sufficient we had the king standard room the hotel is apparently several old residences turned into a elegant hotel and it showed this place was truly first class and the service from everyone really set the tone i used hhonors points to pay for it and felt that was a good use,1.0
wonderfully refurbished hotel in modern design featuring lounge bar restaurant and library areas that are not only accessible to use but give you the impression you are surrounded by unique pieces and furnishings in an art gallery the rooms offer a luxurious feel yes even the standard rooms and the staff are simply delightful and accommodating in every way this was our first visit and we did eat in the restaurant however we certainly look forward to doing so next visit the bar is a lovely pre and post dinner spot and all of central amsterdam is minutes away by foot highly recommend this glorious hotel,1.0

absolutely loved this hotel prefect location just opposite the passage de gracia metro however we found that most places could be walked to pool area is fab for relaxing and taking in views of the whole city book directly with the hotel and get the best offers half price breakfasts which are incredible and a free drink on arrival the only thing we found was our room wasnt ready until which meant us havin to wander around lovely barcelona for a while as we wait but this was due to their late checkout you dont have to checkout until which worked for us on our last day very just something to keep in mind when i go back id maybe ring the hotel beforehand and try get an early room if you are arriving early,1.0

we stayed for three nights at hotel praktik vinoteca it one of the best hotels when considering the price that we ever stayed staff are so friendly and knowledgeable about local restaurants etc they even printed off train timetables for us to get back to the airport nothing was too much trouble and all members of staff went above and location was great off a quiet street but so close to all the major attractions with some great local places to eat the winebar is a great such good value too our room was small but we expected that perfectly functional too with a lovely big comfy usually like to try new hotels when coming back to a city however we will definitely come back to this one next time we in barcelona would recommend it to anyone,1.0

it is a beautiful and cozy place in the central area everything is so thought of all the small and big details are so pleasant at some point we felt like staying in our room instead of sightseeing yes it that good staff are very friendly and helpful were nice to inform us about the taxi strike in kitchen is amazing but if you are up for a dinner better reserve a table in do expect it to be a quiet place on a friday night,1.0

let s start with the positive parts the location is great the pool area is wonderful the view from the rooftop is breathtaking and the reception is professional and service minded beside this it s hard to say much more positive our rooms were smelly a bit runned down and not properly cleaned the sides of the bathtub were dirty and there were hair in the corners of the bathroom the elevators are small and slow the staff at the breakfast were rude and the client computers were old and outdated could be that the hotel has been renovated in but nothing seems to have been improved changed since then,0.0
trendy modern yet cozy and clean hotel which is relatively central located nice and helpful staff i asked for a room with a balcony and got a really nice room with cozy little balcony had two great nights of sleep at this hotel,1.0

loved our stay at the marker everything you looking for in a stylish boutique hotel impeccable service we arrived early from before our room was ready were able to store our bags and take advantage of the pool shower room to freshen up surprisingly spacious room compared to many european boutiques gorgeous huge bathroom brunch is pricey if you just need a pastry and a coffee hit a local coffee shop very trendy rooftop deck amazing panoramic views meant to take advantage of the complimentary car service but happened to be booked when we were looking to a min walk to the historic dublin core but just cross the liffey and jump on the light rail if your feet are tired will stay here again when we return,1.0

we stayed at hotel curious for nights the staff were welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble our room was very small but your in barcelona so we were hardly in it it was furnished well and clean the breakfast had enough choice for us and we even had the choice of an early breakfast on the day of our hotel is in a great location being just off les rambles i would recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to barcelona,1.0
really nice hotel with great staff service hotel is slightly outdated but due to the age it is very had great friendly service from the entire staff and especially from fernando in the bar area he offered great wine selections and made us feel very welcome,1.0
if you are a regular visitor to amsterdam or are handy with a smart phone this is for you it is about half an hour walk from the train station or get a tram if you are a smoker of the herbal kind there are coffee shops near by but not as regular as you would closer in to the city this was the first time i have been in this hotel and at the time it was getting refurbished excellent could hardly tell there was workmen in the building or if you fancy a little walk the arena hotel is situated in the beautiful oosterpark,1.0
this world class hotel is an unexpected delight impeccably managed with discrete service and understated elegance the hotel is now undergoing a barely perceptible that is sure to put it in the same league as paris bristol and london connaught sumptuous indoor pool that rivals the pool at the ritz in paris quiet drawing rooms where tour groups mercifully would feel out of place for those accustomed to privilege who value tradition and luxury,1.0
although a bit tricky to find initially it location is great just around the corner from a metro station a short walk to la ramblas very clean room was lovely included a small kitchen area including a fridge also a free safe staff very helpful you are able to leave your cases if you arrive early or fly later than your checkout time would definitely stay there again,1.0

nice hotel and well located for aviva stadium a short walk to the left when coming out of the hotel leads you to and a few shops if you go straight ahead you have a walk of about minutes to st stephen grafton street and you can enjoy the georgian of shops and restaurants along the way our room for people was well fitted out and had most things that are required but no mini bar to keep drinks cool the bed was a proper bed beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet overnight our room overlooked a construction site which became noisy at there is no air conditioning but a fan was provided fixtures and furnishings were generally good quality although our room had a stain on the carpet shampoo and shower gel are provided but not conditioner we stayed room only at a price of euro which was annoying when our friends stayed a few days earlier for a price of euro wifi was good we decided not to have breakfast at a cost of euro each we walked elsewhere and had breakfast for the of us for a total of euro the bar was expensive euro for a pint and a vodka it is a nice hotel but would only stay here again if attending the aviva stadium and i think that when there is an event at the aviva the hotel puts their prices up,1.0
we stayed in a family suite with our two teen daughters lovely room great linens large modern bathrooms staff is attentive and location is excellent just a block from plaza cataluyna and the rambla a block from passeig de gracia and close to the gothic quarter lots of taxis and public transport options are plentiful in the area but especially liked ciudad comtal in the corner nostrum for quick to go options and coffee and vinitus for tapas all are easy walking distance,1.0
as part of the beach week organised by my parent and to enjoy with my daughter i though was good to show to her other great cities in the plan was to get a week end in barcelona and then drive to the beach after looking for hotels the petit palace barcelona was a great choice centric well situated and with a great price check in was speedy and very efficient the staff were friendly and their suggestion of restaurant was excellent with a very helpful booking done by room well equipped and spacious with confortable beds and a great airconn needed on a hot breakfast times were more than acceptable and the offer wide and well stocked,1.0

my boyfriend and i where very unsure on where to stay in dublin we came across this hotel in our research and thought it would do rightly it was a very good choice to say the least the room was so spacious a lot more space than many other hotels we have stayed at the rooms were very modern and had many accessories the little things such as the fan the iron and the complementary bottles of water came in handy during our stay the wifi connection throughout the hotel was very good and we were both able to browse from our room but when we had difficulty booking our tickets for day trips etc online we were able to make use of the hotels computers which are located in the lobby the staff were simply fantastic so helpful when we wanted to know how to get here and there and gave us ideas on different activities to do throughout the day we did have an evening meal in the hotel but the breakfast was the best i have ever had in a hotel the location of the hotel was great min walk from the stop and in mins we were in dublin city centre for a little of i would definitely recommend this hotel for couples families and individuals as it caters for everyone,1.0
i stayed here for days on business the rooms are ok bedding to a high quality but the rooms are little out of date the service is good and the bar terrace is great with good love music from a marriott perspective they need to improve marriott on line check in no requests are answered and no one ever answered any chat messages,1.0
i returned home last night from a night stay at the silken gran hotel havana i have to say this is probably one of if not the best hotels i have ever stayed in the reception staff upgraded our room to a junior suite upon arrival this was situated on the floor just below the pool and rooftop terrace area the room itself was absolutely stunning everything was fresh and contemporary and most importantly impeccably clean towels robes slippers and even a towel to take up to the pool were provided there was also a fridge in the room which was very useful to keep items such as milk and water in although the bar and pool was situated directly above us this was not a problem as noise levels were minimal the only thing i would say about the room is there was a view only a wall to look out on again this did prove to be a problem as the view from the roof terrace is amazing you can even see the impressive w hotel and sea views in the distance we had breakfast and a couple of evening meals at the hotel and they were delicious and in comparison to restaurant prices around barcelona very reasonable as for the drinks there is a good selection of cocktails and of course sangria i visited with my mum and she would highly recommend the mojito sin for a refreshing drink at the end of a day exploring the,1.0
i stayed here for one night to attend a concert in dublin we had a package that included valet parking no other parking on site and breakfast the hotel is lovely located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance i love this part of dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre we were greeted at the door and check in was friendly efficient and exemplary the valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when i realized i had left them in the car great service the hotel itself is not overlarge but is welcoming with cool décor every staff member we passed greeted us the room was big with superking bed king for us travelers style interior design quiet and sumptuous the bed was really comfy so much so that i checked out the brand of mattress so i can buy one for home we had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles we also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience the breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites it was great i will definitely check out his hotel every time i get back to dublin and hope i get to stay,1.0

if you want to experience afternoon tea with a difference i highly recommend clontarf castle fusion afternoon tea it is an unique experience and i was delighted to partake on sunday july as a final treat and to end a perfect few days stay in dublin with my daughter we had booked for and i was pleasantly surprised at the seating area were the tea was to be served it added to the overall experience large comfy chairs to sink into table at proper height and beautifully set glass was the theme and crockery was all glass not the usual vintage theme which is used in most establishments so different and refreshing cormac the bar manager approached our table he introduced himself in a very professional manner but he was friendly which is also important he helped us to sit back relax and look forward to what was in store he had wit him a wooden box which stored all the samples of teas in glass storage jars he proceeded to explain the origin of each tea and we were able to smell each one it was better than wine tasting he gave his recommendations but the final choice was entirely up to ourselves michelle was in charge of serving our afternoon tea and kirsty also helped michelle explained how the afternoon tea would be served savouries first and she described what was in each treat and she did the same for the sweet section she was very helpful and,1.0
the property is located in diagonal mar which is not very centrally located but everything is a bus ride away considering how small barcelona is very typical hilton stay in terms of the lobby room and facilities not feeling the beach club located in the hotel though as a hilton diamond member lounge chairs at the pool were free however the hotel could not reserve these chairs for us and we had to be present to reserve them ourselves considering how pack the club was on weekends this is nearly impossible unless of course you go down in the morning saw a couple of drunk in the hotel lobby and lift area as well certainly not something you would expect in a hilton but overall a pleasant stay,1.0
of all the hotels we stayed in greece so far corfu santorini mykonos and athens this is by far the cleanest and most comfortable hotel we stayed in with this trip we stayed at pricier hotels in corfu and santorini but this hotel is by far the best great service as well if you have children and require rooms the hotel has connecting rooms,1.0
i expected much more from this hotel having seen the photos and in light of the price i paid the room is ok size but beds very uncomfortable the hotel seem to have no proper walls between the rooms and awful sound insulation you can hear the person next door sneezing the blinds made such noise that each evening and morning it was disturbing as guests would put them up or down the roof terrace is nice but the pool is expect to have a proper swim although it does serve the purpose to cool down in a hot weather all in all disappointing experience having said this the staff is really nice welcoming and friendly,0.0
this hotel is absolutely great we enjoyed our stay very much the hotel is absolutely gorgeous the best part was knowing the hotel was built over years ago the bartender gert was an absolute gem very friendly definitely knows his history and loves this great city these are the little things that make a stay more memorable,1.0
i was taking my daughter and two granddaughters on their first trip to europe cruise on mediterranean to italy decided to spend days in lovely barcelona first chose and reserved two rooms beds bathrooms and sea view a year in advance all confirmed and then reconfirmed upon arrival one room ready exactly what i wanted adjoining room was then given away while we waited for luggage offered apologies and then a suite suite had no sea view only beds only full bathroom i was supposed to sleep on a sofa bed and rollaway we let my granddaughters use the suite i went back to original room offered free cocktails with dinner and that was it by the way is near hospital so sirens all night service at meals was excellent but would never use hotel again,0.0
we stayed at this hotel for a short break in december and it was brilliant the room was perfect the beds were so comfortable and the hotel staff were so helpful could ask for better service we asked the concierge for a recommendation for dinner not only did they recommend a beautiful restaurant i wish i could remember the name of but they also called and got us a table we knew we were in for a treat the minute we walked through the door it was an italian restaurant just across the road from the hotel on the main road in whole a wonderful stay convenient for everywhere in amsterdam,1.0
we stayed for a night to take in the sights of dublin and be near to the airport the hotel is situated by the cruise dock at the point the next stop down from spencer dock in the dock quarter the team terminates at the point so you can use the tram or have a good walk along the river liffy on a sunny day there are also city bicycles to hire along the liffy promenade the gibson hotel stay was on the floor and overlooked an inner garden at present there is a lot of development happening in the port which is exciting for the city but can be noisy ask for an inner room and high floor and you will sleep like a baby the decor service facilities both hotel public areas and room and the all important bed was five star and super modern the breakfast is buffet and provides for healthy and gluten free and out was excellent the staff are very well trained and so is a special hotel rate for guests parking overnight so do take advantage of and quirky the gibson is a must go to destination for dublin city,1.0
vam tastar el menú desgustació a la terrassa de i va ser una experiència magnífica el cambrers van ser motl simpàtics i atents el menjar boníssim i les vistes espectaculars segur que repetirem aquesta experiència a la nostra ciutat we tasted several tapas on the hotel terrace and it was a great experience the waiters were friendly and attentive great food and spectacular view of barcelona surely we will repeat this experience in our city,1.0
i was here for nights and i paid nearly euros a night at first i was given a room which was on opposite side of the street it was very small and it had no window so i asked them to change it then i got a room that has a balcony to the street but the ac was not working fine and it was hot i asked them to have a look at it the second day and they fixed it i was happy with the service it was a best western class so i was not expecting something extra i heard the street was a place for prostitutes before and the polis cleaned it up however locals told me to be sharp when i was going back to the hotel at night i could see weird and junky people when i walked to a museum close to this hotel but nothing bad happened,1.0
the fitzwilliam hotel was recommended to me by my clients when i went to dublin on a business trip the room was lovely the bathroom was spacious great food fabulous location friendly staff i had a wonderful experience,1.0
very modern clean comfortable family hotel not very central but easy access to the tram which will get u to the museums quickly the stop is in front of the hotel ask the staff and get a pass right in the hotel lobby breakfast downstairs is with plenty of choices only wish it had a fridge in the room nearby market albert heijn has anything you need one of my concerns was the noise from nearby highway but with closed windows you sleep soundly enjoy,1.0
perfect location just a few meters away from the shopping streets temple bar and city sights the rooms are nice and clean only negative thing was that the room was quite small i love the fact that there was bathtubs in the bathroom nice after many hours of shopping the breakfast was good and the staff was polite i will definetly go back next time i visit ireland,1.0
we had arrived in barcelona on the second leg of our daughter school orchestra tour we were a bit early for as we wanted to go up to parc güell staff were happy for us to leave our baggage and later what a surprise on our return we had paid for a city view but found ourselves upgraded to a clock suite incredible view of plaça espanya the av de la reina maria cristina and the museum nacional de the evening we made our way up to the roof terrace for drinks and to watch the spectacular font màgica de montjuïc we watched the music and light display from up close but the view was truly found the staff friendly and accommodating room was immaculately clean and very special,1.0
we booked a night stay for our wedding anniversary and picked this hotel as it is just outside the old town but within walking distance the check in was efficient and we were upgraded to a room with a small balcony the room was clean and the balcony had very comfortable wooden benches with cushions the bed was very comfortable and large unfortunately i was unwell the day after our arrival so did not get to experience amsterdam itself but what i did experience was the hotel staff at their best i needed a dr on our night and the night receptionist was able to advise my husband regarding this and also advised of the option to go to the walk in centre rather than the cost of calling a dr i was unable to leave my bed so the dr was called he was english speaking and very efficient the receptionist then telephoned for a taxi to take my husband to an atm and then the hospital pharmacy all in all not the short break i had expected but the hotel was excellent and telephone twice the following day to see if they could do anything i would be happy to book this hotel again and hopefully next time be able to enjoy it,1.0

if you are looking for a luxury hotel centrally located in dublin then stay at the westbury was it my favorite hotel in ireland not really while the decor was and service was excellent it lacked some of the charm that i had experienced at the older hotels in ireland it really is a lovely and romantic hotel great location near some good pubs and shopping comfortable room,1.0
this hotel was very welcoming and had nice rooms it is a short walk from the acropolis temple of zeus and olympic stadium it a good value for the money the complimentary breakfast was excellent,1.0
can here for a day break before my husband undergoes surgery and wont be able to travel awful hotel dirty and dusty room hairs in the bathtub mould on the room wall and bathroom and worst part the ac in our room does work,0.0
this was by far the best hotel we stayed in throughout our weeks in europe check in was very very informative and welcoming and all the staff were only too happy to answer any questions we had and give great suggestions on things to do and places to go another great feature of this hotel was the open bar in the lobby area which is all included in the rate and also the mini bar overall our experience was fantastic here and would definitely stay here again when we visit next time,1.0
only stayed one night but is definitely the place to make your base when visiting amsterdam easy reach of central station and good cheap parking under the hotel the bar is perfect great in the sun and maybe even better after sun set,1.0
we stayed at this very central hotel for a friend birthday bash it a very athens kinda hotel which suggests its elegance of the good days the hotel itself needs very little sprucing up minor details yet would make a great change other than that it perfectly clean quiet comfortable and extremely convenient for everything one needs to do in athens situated minutes away from suntagma sq metro station means you wo have to walk a lot in the heat the staff are nice and they gave me the quiet room i asked for my experience was demanding but i still felt very welcome word of advice for hoteliers and housekeeping renew and replenish toiletries even if your guest is there for the weekend it makes them feel thought of thank you njv plaza,1.0
o b was a great hotel we loved the ambiance and attention to detail they greeted us with water and drinks the staff was friendly and the rooms clean and modern the location was great as well walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants it felt like home away from home,1.0
this hotel is situated in the heart of athens right next to the acropolis and museum we spent nights there the breakfast was had a surprisingly large selection for one that had no extra charge staff were friendly and the scenery around there was fantastic definitely recommend for a future stay,1.0
we have just enjoyed a wonderful night stay at this exemplary hotel everything was perfect from the moment we arrived at check in to be greeted by one of the many friendly staff members and enjoyed a hot towel and chilled cava while we checked in the room was excellent with a bottle of chilled cava and local delicacies waiting a very comfortable hypnos bed excellent and plentiful malin and goetz toiletries and an excellent user friendly shower each night a delicious little sweet treat was left by the bed a lovely indulgence at the end if a hard day sight seeing breakfast was i particularly recommend the organic avocado sandwich we dined at the restaurant and had a lovely meal where amongst other delights we had the best potatas bravas in barcelona another night the hotel booked a tapas bar for us when we were undecided as it started to no problem as the manager gave us a glass of cava while we waited for the rain to stop then sent us on our way with a map llamber turned out to be an excellent recommendation the roof top bar was intimate and the cocktails delicious the position of the hotel by the born district minutes from the ramblas and overlooking the harbour was very highly recommend,1.0
i am writing reviews a few years now and i tend to not leave one if it too for the price i paid for this room i was giving single beds in a room the room had a damp smell in it disgusting the most disturbing part was when i put my toiletries down i noticed thick hairs all over the sink and tap nobs the bathroom was not cleaned no wonder there was a bad smell they need to change the shower curtains as well because when there left up too long they reek and this is the first hotel i actually stayed in where they were going to charge a late check out i had to rush my things out of the restaurant staff were very had a nice pint of heineken,0.0
we stayed in a triple room the room itself was pretty basic but functional not as clean as i would have hoped a few stains on the bedspread particularly for the price but we recognize this was a middle of the road place having a refrigerator and ac was helpful it was a little warm for ireland when we traveled location is really the icing on the cake for this hotel walking distance to many things and within view of christ church cathedral while the church view was lovely be aware that you can clearly hear the church bells if you a light sleeper i gave four instead of five stars because the noise from the pub in the basement of the hotel can be loud and late particularly on the weekends it kept me up a bit but overall the hotel was nice and staff were kind i would recommend,1.0
we liked this hotel in barcelona as it was very central and the breakfast was good we got a room facing the square with a balcony which we loved and surprisingly it was very quiet good for families the checkin process was super quick it is a block from the ramba and mercardo,1.0
had a cancelled flight and wanted to find a hotel in athens to see the acropolis great find at innathens they were so accommodating and helpful also there a wine bar right next door wonderful way to end to a hectic travel day they even packed us a nice breakfast for our early flight out the next morning great service,1.0
this is an older hotel and we were with a tour group so our rooms were run of the house which usually means not as updated and sometimes without much view that being said it was very comfortable and clean everything was in working condition and beds were comfy wifi worked well and was free our breakfast had numerous choices that were well displayed and tasty the location of the hotel is great for exploring the airlink express bus the airport is just blocks from the hotel recommended,1.0
recent visit from hotel reception is very modern and check in was painless the rooms were nice and had safe included the bathrooms were big and came complete with bath shower along with douse shower as separate pool area on the roof was nice of an evening although do expect to swim as very hotel between offers complimentary soft drinks pastries and coffee which is a really good touch there is a bar which serves reasonably priced is really good as recommend the hotel,1.0
we stayed here for days last week centrally located in the heart of rome nice rooms with soft beds and great the breakfast buffet is top notch with a great variety of fruit cereal fresh bread and a host of other items the desk was very friendly and helpful with our stay and getting cabs thanks for making our stay enjoyable,1.0
we had the displeasure of staying at his hot er place you could call it while on a transfer from athens to beirut we had to walk up several flights of stairs and wake the reception guy up so he could check us in he checked us in topless which was in our early expectations of the place the room was cheap and big however the next day we discovered several cockroaches were on the ground beside us when we woke up we had a fan to help air the room but to be honest we were happy to leave the room at any chance we got we were planning to stay there again on our return transfer back to dublin but we cancelled and booked another place which was a lot better avoid if you can unless you are happy sharing with uninvited cockroaches otherwise you love it,0.0
this place had gotten fine reviews in my home country but i was still surprised how fresh and clean the rooms were this place is in a good location for exploring dublin and is great value for money only complaints would be that there no elevator and that the pillows were a bit too hard for my taste but hey all in all this is a excellent b b highly recommended,1.0
this hotel is fantastic as it is situated a few metres from the main train station and you can catch the number tram straight i to the city centre modern clean and swanky rooms the bar and facilities are superb will be back again,1.0

hilton restaurant burnell has undergone an amazing transformation its redesign merges perfectly elements of new and old dublin and is a dining experience all will remember whether your stay is for business or pleasure this hilton is situated as a gateway into the city the townships of malahide and howth and destinations worldwide,1.0
great stay with hotel ilunion in barcelona if you like swimming you can use the pool or you can go to nice beach only from hotel you can also visit a well equiped gym for free and there is a possibillity to borrow a bike for or have a breakfast for eur i think unfortunately we did not used this service but i can reccommend you the clean modern with wifi free water and nice view hotel staff is always ready to help you the distance from the city centre is not small but you can always take a bus which goes every minutes,1.0
we spent nights at this great hotel which is in a perfect location near all shopping and museum when we arrived we got a rather small room which was fine but the very next day we asked for an upgrade and two very helpful staff members bojan and victor were fantastic helpful in making our stay in this wonderful hotel to a fantastic stay i can very highly recommend this hotel in dublin,1.0
the staff at the hotel were very friendly to my children and i along with our friends who were also travelling with us the hotel was booked well in advance and although i was given the disabled room i had requested for my friend this was quickly dealt with my daughter needs to have some medication stored in a fridge and the staff were kind enough to have a mini fridge delivered to my room on the second day to stop me having to constantly run down to reception for it and the food she required for attending the riverdance summer school the restaurant staff were very friendly and my son made friends with the restaurant manager all staff were helpful ensuring our food was cooked correctly and that we were happy with it the club vitae was open to us as guests and the pool although only metres long was adequate for my son to practice his swimming the gym facilities looked good although we did not use them the only gripe i had was when i wanted to book an additional room for the saturday night the room rate quoted was very expensive and i felt they could have taken into account the nights we had already booked and paid for car parking is available at a secure public car park a minute walk away and a discount ticket is available from the hotel reception however like all car parks in dublin it was quite expensive,1.0
the plaka is simply wonderfull a lovely spacious room and bathroom with akropolis view very friendly and accomodating staff delicious breakfast and excellent coffee a fabulous rooftop with bar lounge chairs and best of all the view of the unbelievably central everything is nearby and despite this central location there almost no noise in the room,1.0
we stayed here for nights very comfortable stay we were concerned it maybe noisy but we were pleasantly surprised as our room was very quiet room and beds clean and comfortable bathroom very clean the bar attached provided some night time entertainment will definitely return,1.0
rooms were the usual great hilton quality and layout most of dublin within walking distance location near the luas was an added bonus pub next door was excellent and it seemed to be a local hot spot,1.0
stayed here as it was close to the aviva stadium i honestly could fault it will definitely stay again when i in dublin spotless food was great and staff very personal would highly recommend to anyone,1.0
great hotel so when we booked was in town hotel prices were outrageous in the middle of the city and after some research ballsbridge area kept popping up so glad we chose this hotel the people were amazing the room was perfect and the area was a great place to end out nights m i highly recommend staying here when we go back to dublin this will be our go too,1.0
a very clean hotel rooms not over big and no view but it is in the middle of a city the staff were exceptional easy to get to as it near the metro the continental breakfast set us up for the busy day ahead we even had a foot massager in our room great after a days walking free wi if came in very handy definatley worth considering and yes i would go again,1.0
we stayed here in june before we boarded our rhine river cruise down the romantic rhine river with avalon cruise lines it was an excellent experience for staying in europe the first time everything was just perfect especially the check in breakfast and concierge advice and service it is very convenient to the city and tram service we would absolutely recommend staying here the night before your cruise we want to go back soon,1.0
the hotel is well kept and staff are very friendly and helpful it close enough to the airport like most things it just a tram ride away it tram rides away from central amsterdam and there is a tram stop outside the hotel the hotel has a strict no and no alcohol policy i was disapointed that i could not buy an alcoholic drink after hours of travel the mini bar in the bedroom is switched off so you can only drink the tea or coffee left in your room however there is room service and non alcoholic drinks can be bought from vending machines in reception or the bar the room was a nice standard and the bathroom is very nice you get a nice little selection of shampoo etc so do worry about bringing your own a good place to stay if you want to be away from the city centre,1.0
my friend an i stayed here at the beginning of july or believe our room was or the hairdryer is good i have long thick offer amenities in the room but they also have things such a sewing kits and razors if you call is a safe and fridge in the room was clean good size view was off the hotel and hotel pool across the road we were planning on being in the room didnt find it that noisy but i was back in the room till or later each hallway did smell a bit of sick but i was too fussed as it was a second walk in and location sometimes could be hard to find taxis and there will be a small queue of people waiting for the hotel to flag one down however do not wait just walk to one of the main roads and flag one down metro station is minute walk away i would say is more of a minute gripe i have is that if you checkout they only have a toilet area to change etc at all hotels i have been to in the uk and abroad have always had a shower area for your to get ready for your flight once you have checked what we paid it was a great,1.0
great location for walking around staff was wonderful rooms are spacious and clean if booking in summer be aware there is no ac they do have fans and the windows open so did get too warm however we had a room facing christchurch and with the window is open we heard the church bells all night i highly recommend the hotel but if booking for the summer i recommend a room not facing the church,1.0
i yrs old and this hotel was great so not just for young people the room was comfortable and very clean just metrostops from centraal station it was easy to get to lines and took the shuttle bus right outside the hotel to get to the airport euros,1.0
this hotel was wonderful it was very clean with modern amenities and a friendly staff it was reasonably priced and exceeded our expectations the location was central to all of the must see attractions of athens i would definitely stay here again,1.0
charming classic hotel with elegant old world interiors and large spacious suites rooftop pool and terrace where drinks and food can also be ordered enormous bathrooms with high spec modern walk in shower and large jetted had a junior suite for nights stay and found it invaluable having a sofa to collapse onto after hours of walking the gothic excellent breakfast buffet laid out in a charming room which appeared to be a garden room plenty of choices and excellent attentive found my cappuccino a tad too strong so they were very happy to make another one and next morning i found they had remembered how i liked it you like older style stately hotels but with excellent service and larger rooms then this one is an excellent choice not too far to walk to a most helpful doorman who was always on hand to advise the best route to take to get somewhere very useful as there was a taxi strike on whilst we were there so this made walking the main mode of it was quite hot also i should state that the was excellent as we like a cold room for sleeping did not let us down every staff member in this hotel was utterly professional right down to the nightly turndown definitely stay here again,1.0
great food options for breakfast and lunch with options very friendly staff this hotel is in the financial district off of the river the rooms are a bit small business to the lobby and rooms are modern ca say enough about how great the staff is minute walk from temple bar,1.0
this hotel is a major dump some of the staff not all there was one young man who was so helpful in finding us a taxi after telling us that uber does have enough cars there were so rude and disinterested they should really find another job the room had lights that were broken some hanging out of the ceiling one of the night tables had a handle pulled off so they simply drilling another hole to the right and put another in the shower was built for people tall and the floor of the bathtub was so slippery that my year old niece fell and thought she broke her leg it is a terrible hotel pay a little more and stay somewhere else,0.0
the hotel is on a main bus and tram route the rooms are well appointed with a view over the city the staff were most helpful and booking to all the museums was made so easy walking amsterdam from this central hotel was a pleasure,1.0
we stayed nights in this hotel in barcelona from the to the as a family with kids in rooms everything was very clean breakfast very good and the hotel staff very friendly and bit far from the big shopping area or the harbour km but the metro is very close and with the support of the reception we managed to reach all destinations with the metro hotel to recommend and we will go back for certain,1.0
at the hotel for nights no temperature controls for the room came back at still no housekeeping service for the room no bottled water on arrival or mini bar food not great not great value for money nice staff as a whole would not recommend very far from town centre to min walk,0.0
i booked this hotel last minute as surprise and it did not have wanted to stay here since it open on arrival parking was so handy and the easy access to the hotel was just in was super fast staff were so polite welcoming and helpful even offered to carry my luggage to my room for room was beautiful light bright and airy lovely touch was the over the docks bed was very comfortable and bathroom was spacious with a rain stop is right outside the door and is less than euro to street return and takes less than dined in the restaurant which was lovely breakfast is served in the same place the next is a buffet and it was fresh and plentyful,1.0
the spencer did not disappoint great location away from the temple bar bustle but close enough for a nice walk to many sites step out to a roomy fairly private balcony with views of the harp bridge greeted us with rose petals and chocolate artfully sprinkled on the bed modern and nice bar in lobby,1.0
very nice hotel with nice room and very good service from the staff nice breakfast the wifi is good no top but good it is a good idea for the value for money i recomendeed it to all of you,1.0
the room was quite fine two of the beds were alright and the third was quite uncomfortable the location was wondrful in a middle of a beautiful street next to la rambla you can enjoy all the special littl stores minute walk from different train stations the hotel staff was quite lovely and helpful overall recommended,1.0
very friendly staff we had a room in the attic clean and room is very basic but all we need is a bed and a clean own bathroom the breakfast was more than enough especially considering the price,1.0
our first time in amsterdam so we had a bit of trouble finding this place after taking bus in from schipol we found another hampshire hotel who gave us directions they assumed we were in a car so the directions made us circle the block sidewalks and streets around this hotel were under construction so access pulling luggage was a bit challenging but we soon got used to situated close to canal cruises out front door restaurants shopping and transit we were disappointed our room only had a view of an inner courtyard until we realized this meant the room would be quiet it was and with the comfortable bed sleeps were good maid service was a bit slow on the first day due to a large number of checkouts but improved on the next two nights desk staff were friendly and accommodating throughout our stay we would stay here again,1.0
worst marriott property i have stayed at as a platinum lifetime elite i have visited many marriott branded hotels in my travels other renaissance hotels stays have been perfect there was nothing right about this stay with my family rooms let first talk about customer courtesy at the front there was none with the employee that checked us in nothing that we had requested and was confirmed happened rooms were not on the same if you had planned ahead in assigning the rooms this would have happened we were then told although our reservation confirmation said breakfast included that only people would get breakfast and the other would have to i never get upset but the manner in witch this was told to me was shameful almost yelling at me of course i backed away no sense in disputing this with that person when we got to the room again not on the same floor the exhaust from the kitchen was blowing up in front of our window and there was a smell in the room so they were able to move us to the same floor that one of the rooms was on wonder why we did get that room to begin with however this room had no chair to sit in but it was near the other room the smell of sewer was throughout the hotel especially on the floor and our room the hotel said they can do nothing about it there were just too many missteps,0.0
we stayed here one night as our main hotel we were spending a few days in was booked out for the first night this hotel was really a great surprise we thought it would just be a corporate business hotel feel but the service was warm and welcoming rooms spacious and the japanese restaurant a must try,1.0
the service received from vanessa whilst staying at the clayton was excellent despite being busy the service was efficient and friendly the room itself was clean well laid out and with everything you need including the best bed i stayed in,1.0
we spent one night in athens and the hotel location was great the room was a good size and nicely furnished the bathroom was not well laid out and difficult to manoeuvre the shower was located in the narrow bath and it was extremely slippery and only had a shower curtain which constantly stuck to you the room was not very soundproof and every time someone left their room you could hear every noise breakfast was pleasant with the usual yoghurt scrambled eggs assorted cakes and hotel reception smells of cigarette view from the rooftop bar is fantastic,1.0
we had a pleasant stay here there are canal tours that depart blocks from the hotel and there is a lively atmosphere near there with shops restaurants and a casino however it is much less hectic around the hotel than the central station area which is great after a long day we received breakfast and lounge access with nice afternoon snacks and desserts being marriot gold the rooms were modern and recently redone they are small but we did not spend a whole lot of time in the rooms anyway it was great to find a hotel with double beds difficult in europe which makes it an ideal place to stay with our small kids would gladly stay here again,1.0
my wife myself and daughters visited this hotel in july for nights rooms only basis hotel was immaculate very large rooms with modern decor coffee machines terrific very large bathrooms with walk in showers location is terrific the tram stops right outside the door to take you to all areas of amsterdam only downside is hotel doesnt have a bar to have a nightcap if getting train from airport get off at lelylaan station its just a short stroll from there,1.0
very nice room however the ac was out of order large room and the bed was very comfortable breakfast is good busy hotel just a minute walk from st stephens green and grafton street air coach operates from outside the hotel directly to the airport,1.0
went to a concert here last saturday to see coldplay and the place was run exceptionally well the only downside was the cost of beer or wine as they have you inside they can charge what they will but it was very well run and with people leaving was no problem,1.0
nice rooms close to public transport beautiful park at the back side good and helpful staffs hop on stops of cityscape sightseeing is available next to hotel min walk to beech hill campus through aviva stadium indian restaurants near ravi kitchen kerala restuarant jewel in the crown try it,1.0
stayed here for nights with my mum for my birthday honestly this place has hardly any faults we were greeted by a friendly security guard by the doors and a helpful polite multi language speaking lady who checked us in with a whole hotel smells lovely probably as a result of the spa in the room had a inch tv in it although we only had english speaking channel room service was excellent and our room was tidied up every day electric beds and air con with black out honestly me and mum felt like we were posh enough to be there the rooftop pool and decking made us feel relaxed and secluded towards the end of the holiday it did become noisy and rife with what seemed like a school trip but ca fault the hotel on that did notice no life guard or staff on the roof though which may have been spa is mainly a water experience with all kinds of different pools this was peaceful and free for guests in the mornings which was a great way for us both to start each day the buffet restaurant always seemed to be closed however we may have just missed opening hours as we were exploring the city every major fault is location me and mum love a good time and it was a while away from most lovely bars very close to the football stadium definitely visit to all staff who were extremely helpful especially our friendly,1.0
prior to my stay i knew i would love this hotel due to the attention and detail the concierge team provided me they arranged from airport pick up to acropolis private city tour as i arrived to the hotel the location was amazing across from parliament house and walking distance to most of the key sites you would want to see in the lobby is a grand decor marble lobby yet with a cool modern twist the david bowie portrait as you walk in put a smile to my face the staff is top notch from the doorman housekeeping and front desk i booked the grande suite category facing with a view of the acropolis the decor is traditional and had all the amenities you need when staying in a luxury hotel i loved the deep soaking marble tub a must after walking all day in the heat of athens the sister property next door is wonderful and we had signing privilege i used the barber shop and ate dinner at the roof top of the gb hotel king george hotel you will always be my home away from home when in athens the general manager name is tim ananiadis and i must commend him for a fantastic team,1.0
highly recommendable for location nice hotel people at the desk are helpful room has everything you need the pub next door is a bit loud but one is so tired in the evening that it does really matter because you fall asleep right away,1.0
i stayed here recently for nights and had a brilliant hotel staff were so friendly and helpful with recommendations etc the rooms are amazing and the beds are so comfy could not fault anything with the stay and this is definitely my choice when i am in dublin thank you to all the team at the intercontinental,1.0
if you looking for a central hotel with a great bed and friendly staff then you should consider harding hotel this felt like a hidden gem to me after the terrible b b in galway my room was spacious the bed queen sizes and oh so comfortable my view was another hotel which was ok since i was out most of the day and really need my room to be place i can relax and get a good nights sleep the room was a bit outdated in style and the tv is tiny but i do care much about those things i checked in late at night and walked through temple bar to get to the hotel so i was worried about the noise level since the hotel was pretty close to the tourist trap thankfully it far enough from the central area that you wo be disturbed by drink tourist boy was i surprised the hotel is in front of the beautiful christ church cathedral and near the national gallery and walking distance from sights like trinity college and merrion recommend this hotel if you focused on being central getting a good nights sleep and need a bit of space in your room,1.0
this hotel is in a great location a quiet residential area but an easy walk to the metro that connects you to the entire city the staff was friendly and very helpful the room was exactly what we expected and the breakfast was great on the day we left our train did not leave till the evening the hotel allowed us to check out leave our bags and pick them up after one more day in barcelona we were very happy with our stay,1.0
we chose the hoxton mainly for the location which meant we could walk everywhere we had a top floor roomy room for nights with fantastic canal views with a very nice shower and a comfortable bed but i suppose overall the room was quite basic the interior style was very much along the lines of soho house a basic room and the pig chains with fewer frills and nothing wrong with that our only real negative was that our roomy room wasn t particularly roomy as we were in the eaves we had restricted head height on one side of the bed which became a bit annoying after a while overall though this hotel has a very happy and relaxed vibe with a sense of fun you can t fail to have a nice time in amsterdam using this as a base and we d definitely be very happy to return,1.0
my husband and i stayed at hotel for nights in june we both loved this hotel here some highlights staff very accommodating helped with restaurants museums and tours but a bit surprised they do have a conciergelobby area spacious and elegantlocation perfect area right on las ramblas within walking distance to many great restaurants short walk to the gothic quarter minute walk to the waterfrontrooms stayed in one of the least expensive rooms available the classic it was larger than many rooms we had throughout europe great bed and pillows nice wood floors marble bathroom big window faced an interior courtyard nice and quiet restaurant only ate there for breakfast which was included with our room excellent variety of dishes eggs cooked to orderrooftop bar and pool a nice touch lots of lounging sofas beautiful view of the city spa area what a treat an oasis on the basement level had an indoor pool usually i do like indoor pools this one was really nice very with a nice atmosphere steam room and sauna and small workout room did have any spa treatments but my husband used the workout room and we both swam and used the steam room every single day so relaxing and a nice way to end a bust day of sightseeing,1.0
we booked this hotel although the price was hiked up as were playing that night but we normally receive a good experience as a regular hilton user i was disappointed to find the price to be hiked so highly having paid around a night in orlando manchester and leeds recently but this hilton charged per night we contacted the hotel before confirming the booking and explained we had to be somewhere by could we check in earlier than the stated on line or we would have to book else where and we was told that they would do their best and it should not of be a problem on arrival one member of staff could not of been more difficult the first lady was trying her best and was going to speak to house services but then a lady interrupted and took over and pointy blank said check in is at and nothing more could be done it was only after complaining hard that they agreed to try and took our telephone number saying they would ring us when the room was ready and that they arranged a cleaner to go straight to our assigned room and repair it after two hours we had received no phone call so rang the hotel and again the second lady who took our call was rude and and snapped that check in was not until i reminded her that she had stated she had sent a cleaner to the room to prepaid it,0.0
very nice hotel with excellent location walking distance to shopping and lots of restaurants in the areawe stayed in an apartment supermarkets and breakfast cafes very close by if you do want to use the hotel restaurant nice pool area for relaxing or cooling down after a hot day in the city,1.0
my sister in law contacted the hotel on tuesday july to inform the hotel that she would no longer be able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances she was advised that she would not be able to amend the date or be issued with a refund as she was under the impression that the booking had been fully paid for she offered me the room as she did not want to let the reservation go to waste i knew i would be travelling late and called the hotel to query the latest check in time and when the residents bar closed i was advised that pm was the latest check in time and pm was the closing time for the residents bar this was misinformation as my husband rang straight after and was advised that you could check in at any time and the residents bar in fact closed at a much later time we explained the situation over the phone and was told to come on ahead when we arrived we experienced the most unpleasant check in i have ever experienced we were met by an extremely rude member of staff who really should not be dealing with the public in his mannor judging by his dress code and age i would assume quite a senior member of staff as the first point of contact to the hotel please retrain this man in customer service when my husband was trying to explain the situation he kept rudely interrupting saying,0.0
we stayed for the second time in six years in this lovley cozy and comfortable hotel located close to the the acropolis museum and some lovely was clean and beautifuly was great will definitely be back,1.0

this was our first visit to amsterdam and the nh was our best pick and we are very pleased that we made the pick we arrived late due to a very late flight staff went out their way to ensure that we got dinner as it was our first stay in this chain of hotels we received a room upgrade we enjoyed it from our perspective with the activities we had planned the hotel was in an ideal position close a pick points for both the bus and the canal boat the rijksmuseum van gogh museum and others were within easy walking distance as was the heineken experience we walked from the central railway square through dam square and back to vondel park and the hotel with ease paying close attention to hundreds of cyclists who have no regard for anyone the road construction in front of the hotel was a bit of a pain but we got round it there are numerous tourist restaurants close by one advantage we did not access was the airport bus which had a stop nearby we could have saved ourselves euro,1.0
we stayed here for nights for a city break my son and daughter were upgraded to a deluxe room which had brilliant air conditioning but was on the la rambla side of the hotel so got a little street noise we were on the quiet side but our air conditioning was not adjustable and so the room felt quite warm the breakfast offered a good choice of hot and cold food the rooms were basic but clean and the location of the hotel was excellent for seeing all the sights the metro station was a couple of minutes walk and we bought three day passes which made travelling very easy we went on a free walking tour which was really informative besides going to parc guell sagrada familia and the beach load of shops so lots of reatail therapy and so many restaurants with tapas and other great food,1.0
we wanted a great hotel right along the river liffey and we found it we arrived at from the airport and they graciously let us check into our room right away the room was very modern clean comfortable and you walk out the front door you are right on the street that runs along the river liffey you can walk to the temple bar district easily in a few blocks or hop on the belfast city hop tour bus just right down the street from here we walked to the bus stop boarded a bus to galway for under would definitely stay here again,1.0
this was a repeat visit for us i ca remember whether it was the fifth or sixth or seventh time that we stayed there and had a perfect visit the hotel has an excellent central location in the plaka minutes away from the acropolis and other touristic sites the staff goes above and beyond to help with recommendations and help when you need it rooms are some of the best we had at any hotel in athens and that includes the fabled grande bretagne i honestly ca think of anything negative to say the only problem now is that the hotel is so popular it becoming harder to get reservations so plan way ahead for one of the and i think best hotels in athens,1.0
just come back from a night stay at ink hotel amsterdam absolutely amazing interior from the minute you step in to the hotel and check in was quick and helpful our room was spacious and had views to a side street despite the central location we did not hear any noise from the roads which was good we loved the wallpaper on the feature wall which was a map of parts of amsterdam and the interior of the room which has a separate waterfall shower and toilet the room was clean and the king size bed was amazing not just two singles pushed together the room has air con or heating as well the hotel is in an amazing location and everything is walkable roughly min walk to dam square min walk to the red light district and about a min walk from the train station there are plenty of restaurants bars and cafes right near the hotel too during our stay the hotel became p ink for amsterdam gay pride week they were hosting a lot of pink events over the week which looked great overall we would undoubtably stay here again when visiting amsterdam thank you for making our stay so great,1.0
excellent service reception staff could have been more helpful beautiful hotel and very central walking distance to waterfront beach barri gotic opposie jaume underground station nice small rooftop bar and views very good choice of food for breakfast,1.0
our family slept there nights july and july our teenagers got rooms close to us and they got single bed as requested the beds was sooo good nice rooms and a shower that really washed the mothers thick hair other hotelrooms you can nearly see and feel the water the breakfast was boring and should have been included as in norwegian hotels easy parkingspace,1.0
stayed here for nights in august with my wife from when we arrived to when we left the service was excellent we had a superior room which while not spacious had one of the most comfortable beds i slept in a lovely bathroom and a large flatscreen tv albeit every chanel was spanish but we were in spain lol the tv did have youtube and an hdmi in so you could watch stuff for the web or plug something in if you wanted there was also a window which opened onto a small ledge the bar done fantastic cocktails and had a well thought out selection of spirits and beers the rooftop pool was fantastic to go and chill out on after a day of sightseeing we did have dinner at the hotel but did have breakfast one morning which was excellent also great selection of continental cooked pastries and even a selection of sandwiches and cakes we pinched a couple of raspberry muffins on the way out to have with coffee in the afternoon location wise the hotel is in a central part of town minutes walk from passé de gracie with its designer shops and gaudi exhibits and also where the tourist buses stop it about minutes in a cab from the hustle and busily of la ramble and minutes from the port and barceloneta outstanding hotel loved it,1.0
this hotel located in central barcelona just like its name from it to most travel spots are considered very convenient and just like minutes walking distance in the travel bus stop and also there is a supermarket next door extremely great location when we checked in we met a receptionist his name is marc i think he is the best receptionist i have ever met extremely nice and professional just by the way this hotel do check in i already starts to love this hotel the room designed very modern and they provide very high quality stuffs such as shampoo tea and so on each items are all better quality than other stars hotel we think this hotel train their staffs very good each staff from cleaning lady doorman receptionist restaurant waiters to room service everyone are just super nice and willing to help if i am going to barcelona again i will definitely stay here it just such a wonderful experience i had here,1.0
i choose this hotel due to close access to train station but was pleasantly surprised to find it was close to all city transportation close to supermarket pharmacy restaurants and shopping center great area for working and eating outdoors,1.0
we travelled to amsterdam on the of july and stayed in element hotel for a period of nights our check in at the hotel was handled efficiently and overall the front desk staff were extremely professional and handled all my queries and requests extremely well i had an issue with the ac which was also handled very well the location of the hotel is a bit away from the city center and that not a bad thing as it is located in a calm neighborhood the rooms are quite comfortable and my year old son loved the large tvs that were in there not much of a view from the rooms as this is a business district the only area of improvement i would recommend is in the breakfast it was very and boring more fruits cheeses vegetables and a different additional flavor could help overall i would say it was an excellent decision to stay at this hotel and i would strongly recommend it,1.0
am writing my review from the hotel right now the hotel is beautiful a bit older but nothing major the staff here do their best to help you in anyway the breakfast buffet also good hot bacon scrabble eggs and fresh juice the only fault i found with this hotel there are tiny ants everywhere in the bathroom and in the beds before i leave am definitely shaking out my suitcase also if your looking to sleep in it impossible due to the morning rush in the hallway yelling or talking the location of the hotel is spectacular everything is right around the corner from high end shopping down to mac donald lots of tapas to try also if you like u can buy your own wine or beer at the local supermarket with is a min walking distance i forgot to mention if your looking for a night cap check out the roof top patio for your complementary drinks and the sunset absolutely beautiful,1.0
hcc regente is in a great location within walking distance of many sights and a metro station there are also many restaurants cafes and bars close by staff at the hotel are very friendly rooms are nice without being exceptional and the buffet breakfast is excellent the rooftop bar is small but nice and the small pool is a great way to cool off after a day of,1.0
close to bus terminal block away so very convenient from airport and blocks away from street where there are many places to eat or good checkin and check out rooms very clean laundry machine a plus too only bad thing was room was a bit hot no air conditioning under repairs so a small fan was provided i would recommend this place and would come back myself,1.0
great hotel in a great location friendly helpful staff delicious breakfast good sized room with modern amenities single sink terrible beds they need to replace them asap other than that it good value for the money,1.0
pluses perfect location close to everything including a bus station from where you can get a bus or taxi to the airport nice walk to the city centre minutes away the hotel and rooms are finished with enough good materials breakfast rather good big and comfortable room disadvantages small and uncomfortable bathroom strange numeration of rooms for ex next to food could be better some elements destroyed for ex wallpapers,1.0
what really impressed me about this hotel was the wonderful staff from the moment walking in the door they were friendly attentive and helpful as we were on our first anniversary which they noted and we later we found chocolates flowers and a lovely happy anniversary card in our room they even found us a list of restaurants and then made us a reservation in a local steak house for our anniversary dinner look out for that review the staff do this hotel proud the hotel it self was up to standard the decor was a bit weird but that made no difference the rooms was lovely with a great shower and bath our safe broke leaving our passports and money trapped inside but the staff were straight on it and it was fixed with a new one installed within hours most areas of the hotel are accessed by your room and this includes the lifts so do do as my beloved did and forget yours or you may just get stuck in the lift as he did lol the location of the hotel is close to the main square but it is quite easy to get to with a short tram ride but do make sure that you get a travel pass for a few days the airport is super easy to get to literally a few stops on the train and then like two stops on the tram the whole journey took no more than about we had,1.0
this was a good hotel for my business needs i was here for business in june and needed to get to the rai center for a day conference the hotel was conveniently located within waling distance to rai the train station and stops from schiphol airport even access into the city center was easy just a quick bus ride into town minutes i did have dinner one night at the restaurant and it was a long wait the service staff did seem to have a sense of urgency granted the restaurant was probably busier than expected but the wait was incredibly long even to get our drink order taken there was a server in the morning that was fantastic though she really made up for the evening debacle she was friendly efficient and was able to multitask to ensure all guests were being taken care of overall the stay was fine no frills and convenient however when i return to amsterdam for leisure i might look elsewhere,1.0
stayed here last week before early flight the next day really enjoyed it as staff so pleasant and helpful from reception to bar staff and the bus driver who brings you to and from hotel to the airport had a lovely dinner in the bistro with a very relaxing atmosphere best hotel food we have ever had so compliments to the chef room was very comfortable with great bed and spotless bathroom tv has best reception ever and wifi is fast got a great deal for stay and parking for the week will be back next time we are flying and highly recommend this hotel,1.0
we had a good stay at the holiday inn the room was comfortable and breakfast was okay the hotel is in a very good position for access to all the tourist attractions and has plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby,1.0
all the advertising for this hotel mentions that it has its own bar does not turns out the bar was closed some months ago another misleading statement is free wifi wifi here is so weak it is unusable even for checking emails let alone anything more demanding we chose this hotel partly because it is close to the centre of dublin this is absolutely the only positive point i can make for it however it is not a nice area retrospect we should have stayed somewhere nicer and used the bus the prices seem cheap but you still get bad value for money as this place is little more than a room was tiny with broken furnishings burns all over the patched up carpet horrible bed uncomfortable the bathroom was shabby and cramped water in the shower constantly fluctuated in temperature making it hard work very noisy no double glazing and it would seem paper thin walls constant creaking of floorboards noise from tvs talking hotel feels they have a terrible system where they ask you to leave your key at reception whenever you leave the hotel but when you pick up a key checks who you are and the reception staff were different every day seems too easy for someone to just walk in and just get any key we took our valuables out with us at all times despite the dubious thing is that there is no drinkable water from the taps unsafe due to lead pipes we,0.0
the hotel was very nice and the staff were helpful and courteous the rooftop was amazing and spectacular views the hotel was a little far from the sightseeing places but we took taxi and were very cheap the only thing i did not like is that they do have wifi in the rooms only in designated areas of the hotel which was annoying,1.0
make sure you also dine on gb rooftop garden restaurant with awarded chef s en magnificent view all staff in hotel exceptionally good service and especially tzina at breakfast rooms comfortable and grand will definitely return when in athens,1.0
even in good hotels i usually find some little niggly detail that was quite right but i can honestly say this hotel was faultless we flew into dublin early and taxied to the hotel arriving expecting to bag check but we were able to check in immediately and access our room the hotel must be very new it was spotless and everything felt new and fresh the outlook was good the facilities were good we did have breakfast there so ca comment on that but there was a great café yards away it is a little bit further out of the city centre but we walked in about minutes or a cab would take no time the staff were helpful and friendly room spacious bathroom really gorgeous with big shower and a bath facilities and a fridge good storage space just all perfect,1.0
as someone who travels extensively i feel that i can compete hotel prices and ireland is by far one of the most expensive places to stay that said i looked on the internet read a lot of tripadvisor reviews and choose the ashling hotel in price ranges i would say it above middle it a great hotel it not centrally situated but from the city centre it a few stops on the tram it opposite the main train station personally i hopped on to the sightseeing bus as it was en route the hotel was clean modern with friendly staff and a great buzz as you enter the lobby check in with very easy and all of my questions answered by the staff my room was a single one which i was very happy with it was a great size modern tasteful decor with a large size bathroom with great toiletries and just the best irish tea and coffee available in the room this hotel would have had a five stars however the breakfast let it down as a vegan the options available were very and basic nobody wants to eat dry tasteless crackers any more as when there so much amazing vegan available i could eat any of the cooked breakfast options and they been cooked in animal fat and i found the chef to be most unhelpful and not even open to offer me any alternatives when i was checking out i did mention this and they did,1.0
hubby and i stayed for two nights last week at this fabulous newly renovated hotel and we loved every single minute of had called the hotel prior to our arrival as we were due to arrive early ahead of the official time i just wanted to check that there would be somewhere for hubby to change as he had a meeting scheduled for early that same dealt with a charming young lady who informed me that if there was an appropriate room available we would be able to check in otherwise provisions would be made available for my husband to hotel is located just a few minutes walk from amsterdam centraal station and very easy to find we were warmly greeted and hubby duly changed and went off to his meeting carlos just one of the extremely helpful reception staff stored our bags so that we could retrieve them when we checked in later in the afternoon leaving me free to go room was perfectly charming with a wonderful bathroom featuring a rainfall shower and our bed was so very comfortable and this was in a standard room my husband and i have been visiting amsterdam for more than years and have stayed at a variety of hotels and boats as well as with relatives but i can honestly say that this is one of the nicest hotels in the city that we have had the good fortune to stay in every single member of staff made it his or,1.0
i had a wonderful pleasant stay at radisson blu early in june arriving to the hotel by taxi arranged from the hotel since they do have any shuttle service i met a nice lobby area with discreet lighting leading to the front desk at the front desk the very polite and professional staff proceeded to the check in and i was in a clean spacious room in no time high speed internet connection let me work without any problems i also had the chance to experience the fast and polite service of the roof top restaurant staff not to mention the jaw dropping acropolis view at night an overall great radisson standard stay and a highly recommended hotel,1.0
stayed at citadines ramblas for nights with another couple it is a great location right in the middle of la ramblas the rooms are good size and very clean the hotel also has a roof deck in the floor overlooking the city complete with lounge chairs it was great to take up some pre dinner drinks and nibblies after being out all day and just relax the hotel also has car parking at a day the staff on reception were very helpful the brekky is basic but we went to a cafe just a few doors down the road each morning we would definitely come back and stay again great value,1.0
we arrived at the brazil suites after days of sailing and this beautifully presented one bed contemporary apartment haseverything you need supplied in the welcome desk were very quick to supply us with key and zap our passport then straight to the sitting room seems much larger than any photo had given it justice and our three children are more than comfortable on the sofa star,1.0
every time my family i visit athens we always make sure we include a mid holiday break at the hilton athens the pool by far is the best in town we luv the rooftop galaxy bar with spectacular views of the acropolis lycabetos hill the breakfast selection is outstanding as well staff were extremely helpful in all areas especially can not fault this hotel a definite must,1.0
we arrived well before regular check in as we had a very early flight from iceland to our surprise our rooms were ready and we were able to get settled in before wandering around dublin the hotel made a reservation at a recommended restaurant nearby we went to the hotel bar for a nightcap after dinner one of the bartenders was a wealth of knowledge regarding irish whiskey what a treat that was,1.0
we came to amsterdam to explore the city and enjoy an authentic experience and that we did the hotel was within walking distance to all the sites we wanted to see and the room was spacious with modern decor and a lovely large bathroom staff were always on hand to help with anything we needed and the cleaners were amazing ensuring it was spotless everyday,1.0
the hotel was excellent and surprisingly quiet with a big wedding going on room was as expected we did have to wait for the shuttle for minutes upon arrival but it was a busy time especially with a large group arriving along with us shuttle ride was about on shuttle so missed breakfast was told there would be a breakfast takeaway for us but i did see one nor was offered at given a voucher for free drinks at bar due to slight mixup with shuttles etc but the drinks appeared on our bill at checkout but were quickly hotel call for cab and they asked cash or credit i said credit but when cab showed up they had us as cash not sure whose mistake but left us scrambling a bit to find atm in the city for the return info euro cab ride to airport euro cab ride to dublin city i say this hotel is halfway between airport and city so i have to say if we had a later flight i probably would preferred staying in the city and taking the bus back and forth to airport not a slight to hotel just whether or not you want to walk home or cab home after a late night out,1.0
as always ibis is quite alright rooms are basic but suits everything you need after a long day of amsterdam clean rooms good airco free safe nice shower cabin and comfortable beds nice view from floor location is perfect bus stop in front of hotel line brings you in minutes to amsterdam central train station sloterdijk is a ten minute walk from there you can take train to amsterdam central station in minutes or you take a walk through the park in front of the hotel westerpark to the bus stop on the other side of the park luxury service of the hotel is the free use in weekends of the parking garage free parking space is quite unique in amsterdam,1.0
this is the second time we have stayed in the westin dublin while we do not travel extensively this is certainly the loveliest hotel we have stayed in anywhere the staff are so gracious no detail is too trivial we felt welcomed and taken care of the breakfast included in our room rate was hearty and delicious we were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine and platter of local cheeses on our arrival i traveled with a family of two children age and the junior suite was very spacious room and the hotel kindly gave us a rollaway and an air mattress yes it is a pricey stay but the location in the heart of dublin and the exceptional service by all of the staff make this worth the expense i ca think of a reason to stay anywhere else in dublin,1.0

i sorry albus i had agreed with your manager that i would not leave a review but since you prompted me i am now telling my true experience this is my experience and there are no allegations in this i had booked about a month or so ago through my travel agent aaa who went through travel bound when i arrived the part time front desk receptionist did not have rooms then she found me a super small room where i had to go to the thrid floor and then climb some steps to go to it it had views of pipes and roof tops i think the rooms with views that amy j refers to are reserved for people considered special when i asked to change to a room with a window that was being cleaned i was told no that that room was reserved for someone else after enduring one night in a super small room where the shower leaked all night leaving water and mosquitos i asked to change in the morning and only upon the importunate request of the plumber was i given a slightly larger room in a dark and dingy basement under a pavement grate that gave me night mares all night was absolutely no slice of heaven for me the pictures in the hallways were not to my taste and the neighborhood was full of weed smoke i came back hopelessly sick on the one hot day there was no air conditioning and,0.0
firstly i have to say that the hotel is very well appointed however we feel let down in many critical areas the room was euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had no windows it had a roof light and very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box the explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room so the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people do need a view we were disturbed after by housekeeping offering a down service we did take this up with mr zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time available if not we have to accept the windowless box again i guess i genuinely felt very uncomfortable about this lack of window it made me very anxious and i not the handicapped partner really upset and disappointed westin gold member and loyal to the brand no longer,0.0
we only got to stay one night but it was a wonderful experience the staff made our stay just perfect victor lined up our reservations for dinner our car return and a cab to the airport before we even arrived just made it so easy for us i really liked our room and view too just a good experience and wish we could have stayed longer,1.0
we stayed one week and what we liked best was the courtesy friendliness and unfailing helpfulness of all staff we encountered nice room with huge bed and an ample supply of all bathroom requirements décor was a little dull grey and brown it was especially pleasing to find that as well as very efficient air conditioning that could be turned off there was a window that opened ahappy week stay,1.0

my husband i stayed here for a week and had a beautiful stay it is close to the ramblas but not too close it a bit of a walk to the barri gotic but we love walking so did not mind the breakfasts were very filling and we often did eat anything again until dinner the rooftop bar and pool are a real pleasure with amazing views of the city very memorable stay,1.0

stayed here in june for a business meeting i am weary of hotel rooms in amsterdam they are usually space constrained but this this was huge compared to the other hotels i have stayed in amsterdam just avoid staying in rooms that are located on the high street gets noisy at buffet is the usual but well made i had a couple of meals in room not particularly impressed never been in amsterdam anyway albeit maybe my experience has been limited a very good hotel much better than double tree which other colleagues stayed at and even has better rating on tripadvisor,1.0
we stayed at this hotel one n night before boarding a river cruise we received a platinum upgrade the room was nice with a courtyard view this hotel also was great in communicating with me as i had luggage shipped there pre arrival through luggage forward i can not fault the only complaint is that it was hard to find a seat in the executive lounge and it was difficult to get food there must have been a lot of platinum members when we were there,1.0
we booked a two bedroom apartment absolutely brilliant we were near street right in the heart of the city we will definitely book staff were extremely helpful and pleasant the only problem was having to walk quite a way as the apart ent was not in the actual hotel,1.0
our initial thoughts were that this hotel was very far away from the central amsterdam city and tourist attractions but after a big day touring we were happy to come home to the peace and tranquility of this hotel situated at the rai metro rail station mins from centraal or rai tram station odd mins from centraal it was a peaceful minute walk to this hotel it is close to the world trade centre amsterdam stadium parnassus rai corporate exhibition onvention complex about mins walk away was a street full of different restaurants serving various cuisines and a supermarket albert heijn open till there is ice machines located on each level outside the lifts the mini bar has limited space to store drinks and all drinks supplied are electronically programmed to be charged to yr room if removed from the fridge,1.0
the hotel was very nice and convenient we had a room for three people and it was large and with two double beds in its nice bath coffee machine and its location was only one tram to the attractions of amsterdam,1.0
outstanding property the pool rooftop bar and rooftop restaurant are a must the hilton athens is among the best properties in the hilton network and the beautidul views of the akropolis certainly make it a must,1.0
hotel itself is very neat and clean with friendly staff just steps to the glories metro stop we never worried about transportation to all the things we wanted to do while in town the roof top offers great views of all the major landmarks of barcelona including the tower directly next door and overall our stay was perfect i would stay here again if i returned to barcelona just because i know what i getting at a reasonable to the wise do not eat any of the food at the rooftop bar we would go to the local grocery store and pick up cheap wine to drink on the roof each night just to soak up the evening but the one time we got food it was disgusting let me also point out that i easy to please but i thought i vomit after eating about half of the roast beef sandwich i bought,1.0
we were in athens for a few days and spend our stay at this hotel it was very clean and comfortable staff very helpful and friendly breakfast included and had a good choice help yourself buffet and plenty of food orange juice and coffee very disappointing both from machines and orange was not fresh juice more like squash coffee dreadful good buffet for evening meals euros good value but we ate out as there was so much choice took the tram five stops to glyfada and lots of lovely restaurants there five stops towards athens syntagma a lovely beach restaurant there are two there we went to the first one on left looking at the beach it was fab food delicious value very good lovely setting overall would really recommend the hotel the pool is very nice really good and the beach is across the road from the hotel the bus from the airport stops right outside the hotel although there is a very busy and dangerous road to cross when arriving we did it with three children and lots of luggage bus stops on the same side of the road when leaving and runs hours every mins mins journey for a few euros tram stops outside hotel easy to get to athens and the opposite way also,1.0
we chose the hotel v fizeaustraat because the price includes breakfast and wifi and we were satisfied the lobby area has a hip buzz about it and the reception staff are friendly and welcoming our room was comfortable with a good bathroom and good wifi the decor throughout the hotel is smart and stylish the hotel is outside the center of town but we did mind that its location means you avoid the noise and crowds of the center of amsterdam though the hotel is a walk to the metro which will quickly take you to the was unenthusiastic about the breakfast which is a la carte and where you get to pick two items out of a list i much prefer a buffet and find it stingy that you will be using up one of your two choices if you would like a croissant with butter and jam that said there is much to like about the hotel and i might stay there again depending largely on how its room rates compare with the competition at the time,1.0
please save yourself the heartache we endured avoid this hotel and hotel our sons birthday large amount of money our account before visiting amd did not return to us until a week after our help no apology simply did not care,0.0
it truly felt like coming home when we came through the doors of casa camper we were just a wee bit afraid that things might have changed since the marvelous susanna martin had left the helm but she had trained the staff well and our beloved georgina was there to welcome us and show us that casa camper was just as fantabulous as ever having been in the air forever with layovers all i wanted was food and protein and georgina led me right to their clever where i scarfed down a yummy sandwich wrap etc feeling revived we headed up to our lovely room and then out the door to get our first glimpse of las ramblas which is so close casa camper is beautifully located and the staff goes out of its way to give you info on wherever to want to go and whatever you want to see and the chef well words ca even begin to describe the breakfasts but if you go away hungry then there is something seriously wrong with you all i can say is that if there was a casa camper in every city where we travelled and georgina could clone herself then i would never have to research our hotel choices again this is a in my book,1.0
came back from a weekend stay in amsterdam in a standard double room the hotel is easy to get to from the airport via train and metro and easy to get into central amsterdam via metro system we purchased at the airport a day gvb card for euros each that allowed unlimited travel on the trains trams metro and buses the hotel is also only a few stops by metro from ajax stadium so would be perfect to stay in if in holland to watch a match the staff on check in were polite and a map was provided of the city which myself and hubby found very useful the bar area is lovely we did eat in the room was plenty big enough large comfy bed fridge tv hairdryer etc it was pretty quiet we were on level of the tower block we would definitely stay here again if we visit amsterdam,1.0
i called to see what complimentary spa treatments you would throw in for business travellers booking rooms for to nights the signal on your phones are so bad that you could not hear me i did not have such a problem with the hilton so why with you,0.0
we had a great stay at this hotel the staff where very friendly the breakfast where great could ask for more staff where very helpfulthe rooms where clean and a beautiful view we where more then happy and would visit again,1.0
we paid for a room with a view all we got was a view of a one big tree and a parking lot when you pay extra for a view you usually expect something that is worth the money room check that view please when i tried to change the room a woman from the reception told me that they do have another and said that i actually have a deacent view does that mean that the room without a view have not a window at all only because the hotel wants to get more money for the rooms does mean they have to lie about the rooms a tree and a parking lot in amsterdam is not a view at all the hotel is min from the center which is not so convenient if you park your car in the hotel parking they take your keys and every time you need to reach your car you have to wait the looong queue at the reception a staff member escorts you to the car because you are not allowed to reach your car alone and asks a silly questions what do you need to take from your car no privacy at all,0.0
this was our first trip to dublin so we wanted to make sure we were centrally located while the temple street area may be considered touristy and we usually prefer to stay off the beaten path we wanted to make the most of our short day stay in took the airlink shuttle bus from the airport which was about a minute ride and the fleet street stop was about a minute walk to the hotel really easy we arrived early in the morning and were offered complimentary coffee they did have a room ready but offered us a upgrade to check in early which we opted to do so we could freshen up after our flight and explore the room was clean and spacious we were a little concerned since we were given complimentary ear plugs but we never had an issue with noise even on friday and saturday night my only complaint is that the toiletries provided were shampoo and body wash this is a total nitpick since i usually pack my own but this time i did and i could have definitely used some conditioner especially with the misty and windy weather in ireland the hotel is really perfectly located it toward the end of fleet street so only a minute walk to bars and restaurants but it just far enough removed not to be super loud we really enjoyed how central it was and had a great visit overall,1.0
the only thing was to far from city center all the rest was great the people where very nice and friendly the canal in front was great and beautiful i recommend this place any time food was great bar also loved it,1.0
great value and llocation we enjoyed our stay because everything felt right the rooms were comfortable clean and very nice a little small but space by beds but we made it work bathrooms very nice and hotel smelled super every time you were in lobby staff terrific,1.0
to start with location is top notch on beautiful canal and within walk of most major sights the hotel is strikingly beautiful with a sleek contemporary feel to complement its classic brick and stone exterior rooms are bright thanks to huge windows and high ceilings and furniture linens and bath are service is excellent and friendly throughout and restaurant is among the best in amsterdam creative and brightly flavored true cuisine i hosted lunch for four where everyone was shocked by its quality hint some rooms have better views than others but all are bright and airy,1.0
nice clean hotel in a great location staffs were very friendly and accommodating hotel was walking distance to a lot of major spots of your travel in barcelona bus stop and metro was just a few minutes walk away a lot of nice restaurants and cafes close by would highly recommend,1.0
great hotel but needed unlimited tram pass because was out of the city center and there was nothing to do where it was located great free breakfast though great staff and rooms and hotel was very clean,1.0
the hotel is really nice room was lovely and very spacious the area the hotel is locate is the nicest but it is far to walk to the tourist areas everything we needed was there but food in the lounge was overpriced and not very interesting,1.0
i had an overnight at the metro hotel to catch an early morning flight i needed dinner and the service there in the restaurant and lounge is fantastic waiter mario and bartender taylor were professional efficient and friendly i had time to sit at the bar after dining and had some nice conversation it gave me a good impression of the hotel and that the management was hiring good employees if i ever need to overnight again near the dublin airport metro will definitely be my choice,1.0
the schoolhouse hotel is a first class option for enjoying all that dublin has to offer while still having a quiet little oasis to retire for the evening our room the formers chambers of the school headmaster was nicely appointed with a big comfortable bed the included breakfast in the morning is good rory doyle and his staff are consummate professionals rory was particularly kind and very patient answering typical tourist questions if the option presents we will be happy to return to this historic gem,1.0
we enjoyed our stay here clean room comfortable bed nice shampoo and very nice breakfast it well located in the heart of athens from acropolis and plaka district for shopping however being well located it on the main street so it noisy despite the double paned windows we ended up having to move rooms to the back of the hotel which was quieter but if there a house party in the back then it loud depends on your luck,1.0
greece was the first stop for my family vacation and this hotel was just what we expected it a little jewel in an area that reminded me of brooklyn ny in the we loved the staff and the rooms are completely as pictured i would stay here again,1.0
this hotel would be a star in australia but even then you would get some complimentary coffee or water in the room safe broken no mini bar no room service they have vending machines hotel bar never open receptionist bell boy managing entire hotel to their credit room was nice bathroom amenities are basic sachets of soap and shampoo no toothbrush body lotion etc was expecting so much more for the was its great location and housekeeping service,0.0
buswells hotel is a classic georgian style hotel that has excellent service while the hotel is close to a host of touristy attractions it is off the beaten path and a quiet place to stay the excellent breakfast is more than enough to fortify you for a full day of sight seeing would stay here again anytime we visit dublin,1.0
i stayed here on a family europe trip from july i found this hotel to be great and it exceeded my expectations we picked this hotel because we heard boutique hotels are great here and this one had really good reviews this hotel is very small and i love that it only has about rooms and only floors including the lobby this hotel is also within walking distance to just about all of amsterdam attractions there is also not to much foot or bike traffic where the hotel is since it is a little off of the beaten path it is good to come back here and have a break from all of that our room was clean and very nice the staff was also great this hotel also has a good on site restaurant i have no complaints on this hotel keep it up hotel v i would totally recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to or through the amsterdam area,1.0
checked in july checked out july hotel is nice and staff are very friendly and helpful tram is right outside to take to city centre very easy and fast bathroom shower was a bit annoying as water leaked everywhere on the floor with the set up they have so that was inconvenient bed was comfortable now we checked out july at noon and did not have a flight until late so we left our luggage there and picked it up later in he evening to head out for our flight upon arriving at our next destination we realized that my boyfriend had left his perfume in the hotel room on the bed please note the price of this was euros and the bottle was quite flashy i called the hotel right away to ask if they have recovered this lost item and the lady informed us to call in the next morning as it takes housekeeping hours to register it in the system i was confident they would inform us the next day that yes they had but when i called they said they had nothing i was a little stunned but thought maybe they still had not registered it i then proceeded to call them for the next few days and when i told them yes we did indeed forget it there and maybe housekeeping must have taken it because there is no where else it could be we looked through all our luggage and everything they insisted that,0.0
stayed here week beginning july very easy to find as the airlink bus stops right outside on cathal brugha st very welcoming reception staff and was processed very quickly lobby very smart and looks very nice which leads into the the only downside is when you exit the lifts they are decorating this area but signs do warn you of this people also for some reason left empty glasses and bottles in the lift area on the floor which i found very odd we had room which over looked the back of the hotel very quiet room even on the main road air conditioning nice and cold and could hear from other rooms either which was nice bathrooms very nice and clean with soap and shower dispensers and a hairdryer coffee facilities in the desk drawer only thing to be picky about was the quality of the picture on the tv was great but we did use it that much anyway overall a great hotel and would highly recommend,1.0
this world class hotel is an unexpected delight impeccably managed with discrete service and understated elegance the hotel is now undergoing a barely perceptible that is sure to put it in the same league as paris bristol and london connaught sumptuous indoor pool that rivals the pool at the ritz in paris quiet drawing rooms where tour groups mercifully would feel out of place for those accustomed to privilege who value tradition and luxury,1.0
we went for a birthday weekend away last weekend the hotel is fantastic decor size of rooms location and to top it all off the staff and service was exceptional they made sure we were well looked after we hired their bikes they booked restaurants for us they surprised us with birthday cake the breakfast was good they have on tap snacks and drinks all day long we had intended to go to the gym but did have enough time and there was too much equipment in the gym but it way more fun to cycle all round the city down to the can not say enough good things about this hotel highly recommend staying here,1.0
we checked in around after spending hours on the ferry the lovely lady at the counter welcomed us and gave us our room it was on the floor very quiet and nice and cool with the ac the room was spacious and very clean we were also stoked to have a queen bed hermes is a minute walk from the train station and the square the included breakfast was very yummy with plenty of options one of the staff members checked on us at breakfast and helped us with some sightseeing ideas very pleased we stayed we will certainly stay again if we come back to athens,1.0
wonderful hotel especially for cruise passengers as the terminal is right next door large nicely appointed rooms great buffet breakfast with lots of choices and very fresh food it was an easy walk to central station and downtown will stay here again,1.0

i recently stayed at the nh for two nights from the first experience at the front desk through to the lovely team who worked at breakfast all were excellent friendly and incredibly helpful all spoke very good english i had the most enormous bed room was clean and great bathroom coffee capsules tea etc in the room fresh water fruit and sweets at reception my only complaint minor i could have asked for one is that there is no ironing board already in the room easily remedied by asking reception the selection at breakfast was fantastic with an incredible choice of top quality food i did eat in the restaurant as it was closed for refurbishment but if the food is as good as the breakfast would certainly try because i was working i did do any of the options but understand that the ramblas was approx mins away with excellent transport links if you want high street shops the hotel is right by a decent sized mall with the normal range of brands available great hotel and not too expensive for what you get would certainly stay there again when next in barcelona,1.0
i love this place just as well i had not paid for breakfast as i was generally sleeping to late in the morning this was the comfiest quietist and darkest room i have ever had the pleasure to sleep in i loved the vintage feel and would argue that it should never be updated our suite was the perfect size and offered us a comfy environment for a week of relaxation i am already planning another week at the davenport,1.0
the hotel was very nice and posh with lavish buffet breakfast on the rooftop with amazing view of the acropois and the temple of zeus very well located minutes walk to many places like syntangma square plaka acropolis stadium staff was very helpful only drawback no electric kettle available which is the basic of any hotel,1.0
had to stay a week for business at the uni which is next perfect perfect staff is clean and despite the few unavoidable traces of wear here and had a one person room and as a result there was not much space one person bed no double bed great location with cafés up the street and metro stations minute walk from la your experience will greatly depend on where your room is the first days i was in right in the middle of the corridor and with the bed next to the door the light sleeper would have trouble finding sleep when i came back for one night i had and it was much quieter being at the very end of the corridor but the same could be said about any was good too even if i could do without the soft drinks they had for yeah no problem whatsoever recommended for sure,1.0
when we arrived on both occasions staff were friendly and helpful we appreciated being able to check in slightly early due to our room being catch tram at front of welled attired spacious and definitely stay there again,1.0
very good overall experience clise to teain ststion dhort wxlkvto tosn centre easy access to all of amsterddm wonderful sights would happily recommend tge movenpick to our friends and family difficult to find fault,1.0

thanks again to all the staff who took great care of us at the shelbourne hotel my wife and i had a wonderful stay chris at the front desk was extremely helpful in ensuring we were taken care of before our room was ready and this was much appreciated after a long flight also i like to recognize pawel in the saddle room for his phenomenal customer service and recommendations on within the city the room was clean and comfortable with many amenities i stayed at many hotels and a few star hotels through europe and the states and by far you all are number one in my book,1.0
this would have been good for a hotel but not for hilton top of the line we stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room the concierge service ranged from outstanding to i ca be bothered but the front desk was outstanding two out of three breakfasts were terrible the buffet items were outstanding but after seating and the initial coffee the wait staff had to be called they never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet i felt they may have been shunning staff at lemuel bar and lounge generally did a good job,0.0
my work booked me here during a recent visit to amsterdam on the basis it was a quality hotel close to centrale railway and it certainly is rooms have recently been refurbished and are very comfortable although my room was not spacious just enough room to walk around the king size bed and open wardrobe door bathroom was small and lacked hooks to hang anything on but shower was fabulous a nespresso machine bathrobe slippers and ironing equipment all provided room was quiet with good black out blinds staff were pleasant and very helpful when i needed them to follow up a problem breakfast was great and the staff there were delightful,1.0
our tour guide warned us to be alert for petty street crime but we had no problem it a nice walk going west along talbot street toward st it seemed a good location if you want to be on the north side of the liffey also feet away on talbot is the excellent restaurant le bon crubeen the hotel has a tiny reception but rooms were clean and of varying sizes as you would expect in an old hotel the pub was fun with music every night,1.0
the location of this hotel a few minutes walk from the station but also in between the shopping area and the red light district can not be beaten canals everywhere this is a very central hotel accomodation prices are high in amsterdam so this is not cheap but it is hard to find better value for money nice bar good breakfast buffet fine wifi is our favorite place to stay in amsterdam,1.0
the jaz amsterdam hotel was very nice and comfortable a little gym sauna and steam room on the top floor was a great about min walk to the metro station and about to the center of the city,1.0
stayed here recently with a group of friends from the moment we entered the staff were welcoming friendly the bar is comfortable and spacious with a nice outdoor area rooms are spacious and comfortable all staff were exceptionally friendly will definitely return,1.0
we booked this hotel through the stena line hotel and ferry and so were not sure what to expect the hotel was situated in a good location not far from many shops and attractions and proved a good ranging point for our trip the interior of the hotel was pleasant and seemed very relaxed the staff were polite and always room itself was good but basic but then for us this was not a problem our room was situated at the front of the hotel so did suffer from the noise of the traffic which did last a fair portion of the night we also had some guests i assume staying upstairs which at some points seemed to be trying hard to smash through the floor and into our paid in advance for a breakfast which was a very basic continental breakfast it was decent quality but very basic and i think by the end we were becoming a little altogether this was a decent hotel for the brief city break and did for what we wanted however i think if we had stayed longer it might not have been quite so good,1.0
the rooms did not correspond to the rooms at the pictures on the website the size of the room is very different form what is stated when booking it shows that triple rooms are but the actual size of the room was less then the hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived was not small dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room all the halls and corridors are very tiny if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel also no place for the luggage in the room we had to use an extra bed for it the hotel manager was rude to us screaming and shouting sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the website so upon the issue was solved if you book this hotel please do not expect to live in the rooms which are on the pictures and have the size that stated on the website they are tricking people,0.0
we found the rooms nice and large and the staff very friendly and was good with easy connections to the city centrethe setting of the hotel is in a beautiful old school building,1.0
this is an excellent luxury hotel service is wonderful beautiful accommodations great location however what makes it truly outstanding is its terrace which has the best view i seen in athens not to be missed,1.0
one of the best hi express i have stayed at it centrally located is almost brand new with big rooms walking distance to major sights in the city center could ask for any more would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in dublin,1.0
advertised as a star but it much more located min from la rambla but in a nice quiet street few mins from barcelona cathedral and also placa de catalunya short walk to the marina perfect location to be honest nicely furnished quiet rooms we were on the floor which had great views and our own wee terrace as well friendly helpful reception staff highly recommended and would definitely stay here again loved it a wee hidden treasure,1.0
we enjoyed a wonderful night stay at the merrion hotel the staff was some of the best that we encountered they were top notch we had two connecting rooms for our family of five not exactly an ideal hotel for little kids but our teens enjoyed the luxury of this hotel breakfast at the cellar was fantastic and the excellent service continued beds were very comfortable and rooms were light and airy bathrooms were beautifully appointed and well done in white and grey color scheme one comment that i want to share was that the shower stall was very small and my husband and i are tiny people my other comment was that there was no dresser or shelves to store our clothing which is never a deal breaker for me but just a minor annoyance as it makes unpacking very tricky for two people the courtyard areas are lovely and if the weather cooperates it is perfect to sit outside in the afternoon and have tea or an early cocktail my biggest complaint was that we encountered two different guests who were very rude to the staff at the merrion once upon check in and the other time at breakfast my teens were actually offended by the rudeness of the guests and they claimed that there were too many high maintenance guests at the hotel in both cases the staff handled the situations very well and it is a good reminder that it is never acceptable to be rude,1.0
very helpful staff security gentleman was informative and was willing to answer any queries i had could not fault hotel parking was easy and i felt my car was safe outside hotel room was clean and comfortable,1.0
i booked for two nights here to rest up before starting our tour of spain and portugal we were scheduled to arrive on sunday afternoon but unfortunately due to weather conditions our flight into chicago was delayed and we missed our connector flight to barcelona thus we ended up arriving monday morning i did email the hotel the night before to notify them of our situation and they promptly replied that they would hold the room for us once we arrived at the hotel one of the hotel staff walked up and greeted us by our name even before we introduced ourselves she told us that she had a surprise for us which ended up being an upgrade to a much room with a terrace overlooking plaza cantalunya having just experienced an unplanned sleepover in chicago without our luggage getting rerouted to new york before flying out to barcelona and then to top it off american airlines lost one of our bags we were very appreciative of this little surprise the room was exceptional and the view from the terrace was beautiful this hotel had everything excellent customer service perfect location to see downtown barcelona and great rooms with delicious breakfast i especially loved walking through the gothic quarters and las ramblas which was just steps away there was also a department store just around the corner where you could get just about everything including food in the lower level which they had the food court and only had time,1.0
we stayed three nights at this marriott property we arrived from an overnight flight from west coast our rooms were ready and we were checked in without delay checkout was equally easy and error property is very clean the rooms bathrooms both room and public public areas and restaurants were all clean and had no odor the staff was uniformly polite and pleasant we did find bar service to be often rather location is quite good it is an easy walk to the van goh museum and reijksmuseum it is a minute walk to old town which is too bad either one of the big shopping streets is also nearby as well in general the hotel is in a quite excellent ate breakfast here and some snacks the food was quite solid and no is a hotel i can easily recommend if you are looking for a a well located functional hotel it has no particular culture related atmosphere or charm just good solid functionality and did not price shop but my sense is that the room rates are reasonable and competitive for what you are getting,1.0
great hotel less so staff was wonderful food and pool area wonderful centrally located but a shady area we walked to dinner one night met some interesting types taxi back i would stay here again knowing the area know but is not appealing as graffiti and other dominate the area,1.0
a glance at the map will tell you that this hotel is in an excellent location right by the main transport hub of amsterdam the railway theme is different and interesting without being some kind of railway theme park the service is excellent and friendly my room was clean and comfortable the only thing that spoilt it a little was the window being very high up but this is an old amsterdam building so it was a surprise the breakfast was very good check in and out was quick and shall certainly stay again,1.0
it was our second time staying at the hotel parthenon and it may have been even better than the first the staff was extremely helpful from my planning months ago to when we arrived on site they helped us with drivers to and from the airport and piraeus port rooms were fresh and clean good wifi nice bathrooms abundant free breakfast every morning excellent location just steps from plaka would highly recommend,1.0
i wo advice you to live there in july i was able to find air condition it ok for one night but its a shame for it location work on service is much needed the room was ok make sure to print your confirmation going the extra for the customer was not their thing i was asked what do you expect from hotel my reply everything on the web but then again it a and for me a star should ask customers such a crazy question barcelona is a city with endless of hotels and hostels make sure to have a look around so book one night and find that which suits you you might even like the place,0.0
we spent one night at cotton house to fit in a quick visit to barcelona before boarding a mediterranean cruise what a jewel the property is in a converted house think rockefeller mansion that later became headquarters for a cotton trading company hence the name rooms are small as expected in europe but beautifully appointed we lacked for nothing my wife especially enjoyed the light fragrance that permeates the hotel it is made from cotton hotel staff was extremely gracious and helpful we were offered a drink upon arrival and checkin was efficient they offered us a quick tour of the hotel which was fascinating during the tour our bags were delivered to our room which was on the top breakfast buffet was outstanding the staff was very attentive and the food was delicious and do miss the marshmallows in the location is fantastic for visiting the city we will certainly be back to the cotton house,1.0
we are really glad we picked this hotel the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel was spotless and breakfast was a real hotel has thought of all the little extras chocolate hour each day you can sample some of movenpick chocolates we also had executive access which aloud us complimentary soft drinks all day biscuits chocolate too in the evening a mini buffet wine and beer is served too which was a lovely staff were very helpful when it came to local knowledge and the free shuttle to and from the central station was handy,1.0

we had a good stay here breakfast included is well worth it nice rooms very nice bathroom awesome roof top bar and pool perfect location to explore the city right beside shoppimg eating and subway,1.0
we stayed at the westbury at the end of our itinerary side note the train to galway is inexpensive easy and just a bit longer than driving after small rooms at other hotels the westbury was a nice and luxurious way to end the trip our room was spacious and nicely appointed the staff was helpful and responsive and the friendly bartenders at the bar make outstanding cocktails you can not beat this location a block from grafton but still quiet as a bonus for music nerds like me the hotel is near the statue of phil lynott we will return to the westbury,1.0
we arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight and were offered water juice or cava sparkling wine when we arrived we lounged at the pool until our rooms were ready the rooms were very nice and the hotel is very centrally located many taxi drivers did not know the hotel but we could direct them to placa catalunya and it was only a block away the staff were very accommodating and left us chocolates and wine in our room that first night,1.0

just finished a day stay here earlier this month the amsterdam marriott is situated in leidesplein a stones throw from the rijks and the van gogh it is right next to vondel park perfect urban rooms are well maintained but small according to american standards however they are comparable to most european hotel rooms in size after looking at a regular room i decided to stay in a suite on the floor the highest floor which was very roomy with a balcony this turned out to be a perfect choice as the room overlooked leidesplein and afforded a view of the canals as staff are extremely polite and pretty much handled everything with professionalism and courtesy the hotel has two restaurants midtown grill steakhouse and sorels we had dinner at the grill one of the days and found the food to be is an executive lounge for use by marriott members and we had breakfast there most days it was well stocked and the staff made sure that everything was replaced promptly they also have made to order eggs for breakfast we did not use the lounge for evening snacks but did notice that it got a little crowded in the peak hours of the evening snacks seemed to be quite sumptuous as service was excellent the concierge booked all the tickets we needed and made the requisite dinner bookings and also had some great touristy suggestions as well i highly recommend this hotel for a amsterdam city stay,1.0
the only two positive things i can say about this hotel trinity barbut that where it ends room is really no more than a box room and was extremely hot we had to have the window open but the noise outside although i expected was far worse than i expected there is a fan in the wardrobe but was twin beds and could cover both beds the lift still is working as already reported on herewould i go back to dublin again yes in a heartbeat but never dublin citi hotel,0.0
lovely hotel clean and nice rooms the staff was really helpful went the extra mile to check us in early also helped arrange airport pickup and drop off the street is a little run down and the rooms do have much of a view but that generally how downtown athens looks like these days it was safe and writhing walking distance to everything interesting that we wanted to see i recommend this place highly,1.0
stayed for one night lovely staff easy check in great location and comfy bed will definitely return and recommend this hotel perfect for a night or two in town and so handy for events in the rds,1.0
excellent food and service only issue was the bar service was slow not enough staff after a concert in the arena meant long queues rooms are large and very comfortable with excellent facilities overall all staff were very friendly and efficient food was of a high quality particularly breakfast location and facilities were great too luas stops right outside for easy access to city centre recommended,1.0
we booked this at the last minute but our normal preferred location is near the barcelonetta beach ramblas this hotel is out of the way of those but only about a mins taxi ride away it is near the magic fountain on the same road a min walk away which was lovely as we enjoyed the fountain show a shopping mall is nearby too again walking lobby is large clean and very relaxing with plenty of seating the rooms are designed really well and are well maintained the air con is effective the bathroom is very contemporary and overall the rooms are really comfortable the beds and the recliner chair are all comfortable for their purpose loved the usb charging points by the desk and the bed for phone ipad charging every hotel needs those free fast wifi too was great the breakfast was tasty and plentiful loved the omelette station very tasty fresh omelettes the only criticism is the spa the treatments are overpriced for what they are the therapists need more training to give more effective massage treatments and really disappointed that you had to pay euros to use the spa pool and gym having spent so much on the hotel rooms this needs to change no wonder it was empty total rip walls of the rooms were thin and you could hear everything next door the windows are pretty thin too and we were kept awake at night by an alarm from a nearby building car outside,1.0
we stayed last weekend i had notified by email that it was a special occasion on arrival we had the lovely surprise of being upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic with doors opening onto a terrace area a large bathroom and lounge area also then we had a treat delivered to our room with a note wishing us a happy anniversary was a brilliant start to our weekend and everything in the hotel was fabulous from room food staff luas just outside the door to the reservations team and all the hotel staff for making our stay extra special we will certainly return for another stay ken,1.0

the decor was somewhat tired and could do with here and there however this was more than compensated by the friendly and helpful staff the comfortable bed and the sumptuous breakfast which was really outanding with masses of choice convenient walking distant from the city centre and competitively priced roomsi stayed in a single room and the toilet was two floors below which was a minus i would check if the other rooms are en suite my room did have a view and overlooked a car park however it was was an office car park and quiet from to if you are fit or in some way infirmed i would suggest that you choose a room on one of the lower floors as kilronan does have a lift and there are a lot of stairs to the upper its drawbacks i would certainly recommend this hotel,1.0
we stayed in the central as it was one of the very few hotels in dublin available now we know why it was its tired and worn out small old fashioned rooms with no double glazing to block out the street noise which continues until after the general decor is old and worn the curtain in our room was splattered with what appeared to be liquid makeup and the standard of cleanliness in general was wouldnt recommend staying,0.0

this hotel has everything one needs its located just near christ church and dublin castle its an easy walk everywhere a pet peeve of mine is the breakfast extortion game many european hotels charge where it costs euros when all you want us a cup of coffee and a croissant this hotel allows you to order a la carte in the lobby lounge w wonderful respite about from the scavengers picking apart the room was clean modern and the bed was very comfortable the only thing is that housekeeping tended to make up our room late in the day between which meant after a long day out in the city we sometimes returned with a room unmade and being tired we had to call down to find out when they could clean it could have been the location of our room at the end of the hallway,1.0
catalonia born was our first experience in barcelona cab driver had a hard time finding the hotel upon entering we were greeted with big smiles that made us feel very welcomed the rooms were very nice and we loved our little balcony looking out were could see how the people live and we love that we had happy hour at hotel and they have free food all afternoon into the night the cava was great close to everything including great restaurants hop on off and pretty much everything you wanted to do in the city i recommend not just for the price but the location was thanks hope and rick from florida,1.0

we stayed in plaka hotel for three nights the staff was helpful and answered our questions efficiently the hotel itself and the rooms were small but is cozy and safe it did nit provide slippers shower caps toothbrush etc but we brought our own so that fine the free breakfast was delicious and we had our breakfast in the hotel every day the wifi is we stayed on the second floor there was a bit street noise and we could hear peoplr going in and out but we still managed to sleep well the bathroom was too small but everything is clean if you want a good hotel with affordable price in athens just for a few nights i would recommend plaka hotel,1.0
we stayed for a weekend and were very happy it is a bit pricey but you are right in the heart of the city so we expected to pay more the lobby is really pretty and different with all the purple décor and it was very comfortable to come back in the evening and have the couches in the lobby to relax and have a drink or quick bite the breakfast was pretty good and the staff was very friendly and helpful our room was big and had a separate sleeping area for our teens which was great we loved it and would definitely stay again,1.0
i stayed at the ashling for nights while in dublin the staff goes out of its way to accommodate it is very clean well run and well located it is more at the edge of all the action but that can be a good thing it is a quiet place to stay and only steps away from the tram which takes you to city center in minutes also you can walk to attractions if you to guinness in one direction and phoenix park and zoo in the other the on site restaurant is great offering a wonderful breakfast buffet with many many options the area is inviting and also has wonderful fare i would recommend the ashling as a place to stay in dublin,1.0
this hotel is just as the photos show lovely rooms we had room right on the corner with nice views down to the river liffey yes it was noisy at night if you had the window open but that why you stay in temple bar for the night life once you have a few refreshments you do hear the noise staff were lovely and friendly we arrived early so went for breakfast and were called when the room was ready which was an hour before listed check in time,1.0

very comfortable hotel and location nice and tiny swimming pool area the only inconvenient is if you want a sunbed you have to pay an extra otherwise you can comfortably accomodate on a sofa chair i have experienced a very good service the hotel is next to the seaside and only five minutes walking from the beach whatever you want you just ask and you will have it if you want to surprise your partner with a present to be found directly in the room you have many choices proposed by the hotel management is attentive and accurate good vibes,1.0
we loved everything about this hotel but have to give a special shout out to evelien who took so much time and care preparing a list of wonderful suggestions for us we were the couple heading to iceland i have never experienced better service in a hotel our room was perfect and the location of the hotel could not have been better little touches like the complementary bottled water were much appreciated,1.0

recently stayed for two nights in a floor junior suite we were very pleased with our choice in terms of hotel facilities location and location is a good walk to the main canals and mins to the old city centre several meseums are within a walk and there are several end shops nearby the lobby and atrium areas are great the pool and spa equally so and not overcrowded despite a nearly full hotel as we were told our flight was early in the morning and we arrived at around at the hotel where we were pleasently suprised that our early request had been acommodated and we were immediately note that we booked through the hotel room was excellent great sound proofing quite with a flawless bathroom our junior suite had high ceilings and an exposed wooden beam frame plenty of room around excellent seating choices writing desk and lovely was good but we were not as enthusiastic with the choices or tastes as in other similar properties around the was impeccable throughout in stark contrast to some earlier comments here the staff went out of their way to assist in any way the could doing so with a genuine desire to please not tip definitely by back and have already recommended the conservatorium to friends visiting this great city in the future,1.0
one of the greatest hotel in barcelona spain and europe i recommend it for your journey in barcelona leisure or business as long as you can afford it good services great people and great city do miss the arola restaurant ask anything at the front desk and they can almost provide anything requested neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci velit,1.0

we had such a lovely stay at the stanley hotel in athens from the moment we booked we were very impressed as the hotel sent us a lovely email with information about the hotel about athens and also a day suggested itinerary of places to visit during our stay we stayed in a superior room acropolis view and were super impressed to find it actually did have the most wonderful view of the acropolis and mount lycabettus these are lit at night and it was so wonderful having a drink on the balcony before bed and taking in the views be aware that there is a main road directly below you so it does get a little bit noisy but is easy enough to ignore once inside the room you do hear the road as there is really effective double glazing there is no furniture on the balcony but we brought the chairs and little table from inside out on an evening there was also a minibar with some complimentary drinks bottled water was replaced daily the room itself was very clean and comfortable with a tv safe tea and coffee making facilities plenty of wardrobe space and good air conditioning the bathroom was clean and toiletries are provided we were impressed with the friendly staff my husband had mentioned that we were there celebrating my birthday and someone came up to the room after we checked in with a bottle of complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries what a,1.0
had probably the best massage ever at the away spa today was welcomed by jessica who was very friendly she showed me where the locker room which was extremely clean was and a towel bathrobe and slippers were provided by the now the best csaba the who gave an excellent deep tissue massage i truly think the best i ever had only improvement i could think of is that they probably should not mention the price of the massage on the confirmation emails they have sent to my email address since my girlfriend bought this for me as a gift and i should not have known that this is a really expensive massage,1.0
we arrived in the evening and received a warm and friendly welcome which set the tone for our stay our room was modern clean and a good size breakfast was fantastic and everything that you can want to set you up for the day ahead all the staff we encountered were friendly and welcoming especially the guys at breakfast and on reception if we returned to barcelona i would hesitate to stay at the andante again,1.0
we only stayed here for a night the hotel is quite old but then so does the whole street of athens i think the room is pretty good in the sense that it is fairly spacious bed is comfortable the shower area is bigger than our previous hotels in ie x big tiles vs x square tiles location is the best imo it is less than minute walk from syntagma metro or the bus stop there are a lot of choices of restaurants around you can walk to nearly attractions easily we came in the summer so the weather is too hot for us to walk too far even though we are used to humid weather in singapore it might not be a good idea to return late to the hotel because athens can be dangerous with so many beggars thieves robberies breakfast is served from onwards it was fairly decent ie typical etc the lifts are really lifts are available it is very slow with a max of person capacity everytime you must the door to open this has to be the ever lift i seen in my lifetime thus far,1.0
we stayed there nights days a mint walk from the beach there a ling street right on the corner mint walk filled with bars and resturants even halal food is available there are also small spas nail and facial a couple of supermarkets location i cant say mint walk from metro station everything you need is there also you serrounded by bike shops used the taxi to city center because my grandma could walk you oau around one way mints away by are not comfy and if you book a triplet room they give you a roll on extra bed they dont have rooms with main beds and yes the rollon beds are even worse than thier main beds if you have a back problem or care much about your sleep i dont recommend it but there are many positives that makes me overlook the bed cleaning staff arent very dedicated tou have to tell them specifically to clean around the sink and to change tour bed covers even i saw the cleaning lady taking the bed civer from the room facing our and putting in our room instead of getting a new have little staff if you want something you need to go down get it youself most of the time even the bags we mived them by ourselves they do keep your bags after checkout for friendly staff i must say always smiling they do have a tourists office but they try to help as much as offered,1.0
this is a top class hotel minutes from dublin city centre it is beside the tram line which can bring you to st stephens green or to dundrum in the opposite direction the staff here were so helpful we met lisa the duty manager who could not do enough for us she was friendly warm and welcoming as were all the staff here if you are going to dublin city centre this is the hotel for you great value and great food with a modern bar,1.0
i stayed at the conrad dublin for my first visit to ireland the entire staff were so kind and welcoming and knowledgeable of dublin city and the country of ireland the food the service the rooms the concierge staff were all wonderful the location of the hotel is perfect as its not in all the tourist action but close enough to walk to if that what you looking for the hotel is directly across from the dublin national concert hall which offers concerts and entertainment throughout the month taxi are lined up outside of the hotel juts a whistle away from taking you anywhere the rooms are beautifully decorated with all modern amenities and hot water shower with dual showerheads the food at the conrad is mouth watering if you want to be spoiled and eat great meals stay at the conrad dublin please,1.0

when i booked this trip i was a little concerned that the hotel would be much different now that it is owned by a new company i was pleasantly surprised that the things i really loved about the gresham on three previous stats have not the staff are still friendly and helpful there is a safe feeling about the property and the service is stellar there are some changes being made to the structure itself but it was not inconvenient at all the housekeeping seems to be magic i would leave my room in the morning and immediately my room would be spotlessly cleaned even if i was only gone a short time i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a convenient locations and a feeling of respect for their guests lovely visit,1.0

first it located in rough neighborhood i had my jaw drop moment but it clean budget hotel with free working aircon and bonus of great view of acropolis from area at floor and friendly walk away from all athens high light but we do taxi mostly due to the neighborhood and are ok,1.0
we stayed recently for three nights the hotel is large and comfortable but it is a bit old fashioned the buffet breakfast is excellent and worth including the wifi is free if you join the intercontinental reward scheme the pool was nice but there were not enough sun beds there are two restaurants and a cafe but the prices are so high we could afford to try them the main drawback with the hotel is that it is too far away from the main sites of athens there is a free shuttle bus that runs to syntagma square every hour but it was a bit of a hassle to go out in the morning back to the hotel for a rest or to escape the heat in the middle of the day and then out again for dinner and back again at night ultimately i wish we had stayed in the centre where we could walk to everything,1.0
the toren was perfect for us the staff was fantastic i can not say enough about them in how helpful and kind they all were really went above and beyond the hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the room really had a fantastic time here,1.0

stayed for nights at the end of july just me and my yr old picked the hilton for its location to the beach and shopping in was a little slow but queuing is part of life staff were all friendly and helpful when needed the room was great with everything you might need on holiday it was also cleaned on a daily breakfast was excellent and as a brit abroad i enjoyed a full english every only went to the purobeach on one occasion as the beach is only mins away with great beach purobeach pool area has a great setting very chilled and relaxed however as mentioned in other posts it not what you call cheap loungers are charged at euro each with similar high prices for food and loungers nachos patas smoothies and cocktails came to around which is a problem but could get expensive over days in all i would definitely recommend this hotel yes it is cheap but remember your in an amazing spanish city and everything comes at a premium,1.0
we visited hotel amalia in june the welcome was very warm and even though we were way earlier than the regular check in time owing to our anniversary on that day the front desk lady julia was very kind to give us an early check in and a free upgrade of the room with a fantastic balcony and view she also included the breakfast for that day for us and recommended a very nice place for our anniversary dinner this made all the difference as such a warm welcome in the country started our vacation on a high note i will give stars to julia she is just super awesome and to their customer service as well as they responded to our needs in a timely manner however i will give star to the hotel for the appearance of the hotel from outside and inside the room we got was very nice with very clean and contemporary rest rooms however initially the ac was not working properly however they sent help immediately and the problem was fixed again stars totally for julia and the staff customer service,1.0
stayed here at the start of our honeymoon for from check in you can tell this hotel is a nice one very professional wish i got the name of the staff who helped as they were very room was excellent the map of amsterdam on the wall was brilliant great wee wish i could say the same for amsterdam itself was in long only stayed one night after getting the ferry over but it was not for me,1.0
just come back from my trip to amsterdam but first stay at the doubletree we used to stay at the crown plaza but after that shut were looking for somewhere similar in terms of standard and location our stay was excellent from start to finish all staff were friendly and helpful would stay anywhere else nice modern and clean rooms bathroom was huge but more than manageable brilliant location for the centraal station and the city itself no issues with noise whatsoever we were on the floor overlooking the train tracks could hear a thing from either the sky bar or the trains outside so no complaints from us we did have breakfast at the hotel but visited the starbucks underneath a couple of times which was just right for what we were looking for at breakfast time also paid a visit to the sky bar on the floor nice atmosphere and views of the city but the cocktails were very expensive but we wrote it off as part of the experience,1.0
the hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants it also quite close to the zoo a bit further than the nearest metro station there is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the aquarium nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty large room for the rest of town we had to use the metro which means x to walk the line close by is not really well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere the view well if you see the sea it ok the sunrise was quite orange some of the buldings nearby look however depressing,1.0
my wife and i stay at the dorian hotel in august this hotel has a pool and roof top restaurant late one evening we booked a reservation at the restaurant beautiful scenery over looking athens and the magnificent acropolis at night we and wine and a romantic dinner the restaurant provided excellent food and amusing service the price was very reasonable dinner for two the hotel is older but very comfy front desk is extremely they will answer all your questions the hotels offers tour daily to the important sited hotel is very close to the hop on hop off bus stop another plus is that you can pack you l suitcase and walked to the main square and take bus to airport,1.0
i organised a work conference here spanning days with international travellers the hotel could have gone out their way any more if they tried exceptional customer service in all areas of the hotel from the corporate side to the reception and maid service amazing catering and dining in the restaurants the hotel staff certainly gave us the that warm irish welcome they are famous for and they certainly went the extra mile the hotel is stunning and literally mins from dublin city centre and would highly recommend anyone considering in staying her to do so,1.0
lovely hotel it was rather hot when we stayed there but the air conditioning in the room was marvellous unusually it could be left on even when the keycard was taken out the room was spacious with very comfortable beds the bathroom was also of generous size if a little dated the shower was over the bath so anyone of reduced mobility would need to check accessibility we were on the third floor with a stunning view of pl espanya and the national museum complete with fountains and monuments the traffic noise was apparent and the road outside quite busy all nightthe room had a safe and minibar although the safe was being upgraded so any valuables were kept by reception breakfast was haphazard there was an extensive variety of fruit smoothies pastries cereals made to order omelettes and pancakes cooked breakfast etc however no matter what time we went for breakfast several options were not available the replenishment did not keep up with demand the staff were lovely the roof terrace bar and pool very good with a panoramic airport bus stops literally outside the door and there is a very convenient metro stop too the and were very slow overall a good place to staythe attached photo is the view from our room,1.0
the apartment was very roomy and comfortable all members of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful convenient location market restaurants and la sagrada familia all nearby a great place to stay in barcelona,1.0
after lots of research we finally settled on this hotel and were very happy we decided to go for the basic double room because we were planning on not being in the hotel much and it was a perfect choice the room had everything we needed for our stay a comfy bed toiletries such as shampoo conditioner shower gel soap toothbrush etc hairdryer and slippers and dressing gown there were also towels for the room and towels for around the pool you can even borrow an iron and ironing board which was good because my husband wanted to his hotel had everything we could need which was perfect for our city break there were quite a few bars restaurants and shops in walking distance from the hotel and there was a metro station within a short walking distance we would recommend and would stay again if we were ever to return to barcelona,1.0
our room on top floor was small but very clean good bathroom and shower good choice of food at breakfast staff were lovely explained how to get to places brought drinks when sitting in garden very near to tram bus and metro stairs extremely steep but they are in most buildings in amsterdam,1.0
if you value your privacy make sure you ask for a room with a bathroom door we asked for a quiet room when we checked in we were given an inside room which i m sure would have been quiet but much to our surprise it had no door on the bathroom it never occurred to me to ask for room that had a bathroom door i can t believe that anyone actually would want such a room staff was very nice and they agreed to move us to a room with a bathroom door but that room overlooked the street which was very noisy we were embarrassed to ask for another change in rooms i m sure the hotel is very nice and staff is certainly very nice but our experience with the bathroom door and noisy room clouded our whole experience,1.0
well appointed room and large bathroom with shower excellent location within walking distance of the major attractions breakfast buffet was included and outstanding staff were very accommodating and friendly room was very quiet at night,1.0
lovely hotel very cool and fun lots to do within the hotel which was lovely but on our last night we went to the restaurant called the pool well safe to say that its put me off ever coming back which is a shame we sat down in the restaurant and ordered drinks which they forgot and then had to wait minutes for them to make a mint tea wait it gets worse they then told us that the food that was advertised on the menus and boards was available when we finally ordered our food it came out minutes later to which my friend ordered the cheese with bread and she received a tiny camembert with very thinly sliced pieces of bread for she asked for more bread and the staff walked off and did bother getting wait sorry they did bring out some pita bread mins later when the cheese had hardened ridiculously overpriced for what you get rude staff and food was that great hugely disappointed but the reception team were incredible the girls are amazing and the rooms are insanely clean and so comfortable,0.0
have just spent nights at this hotel absolutely stunning the decor is sumptuous and elegant the staff are wonderful the beds are like sleeping on clouds beautiful huge bathroom it really does feel like you staying in a palace divine,1.0
arrived hours early for check in to be told no worries your rooms will be ready in hour cava for you and your husband water for your children you are more than welcome to go to the rooftop terrace and wait fantastic the rooftop terrace is amazing fabulous view over the marina small pool great seating good food served speak to the jamon man he wonderful room was spacious enormous size bed and singles lots of space air conditioning silent sound proofing excellent children slept in until staff fantastic very forgiving of terrible spanish close to las ramblas and the port parking day loved it back in october,1.0
my daughter and i stayed here for our first taste of ireland we arrived late and spent days exploring the city the staff were friendly accommodating and efficient we will continue to stay there whenever we come to dublin kudos to the management and staff our room was clean and had everything we needed the boutique atmosphere and the neighborhood made us feel truly welcome breakfast was delicious and served in a great room with a view of dublin daily life,1.0
i stayed here a few times and am never disappointed the rooms are immaculate beds are super comfortable bathrooms are high end the spa is beautiful location is a bit off the beaten path but cabs are right outside the door,1.0
booked nights in a superior room we were told at check in that the room was not big but had wonderful canal views not big was a gross understatement no bedside tables as there was no room on either side i could not see the tv from my side of the bed as it was tucked away on the only available wall space the bathroom was no better though apparently the bathrobes and slippers that we never use were part of the superior deal on the first day we went out early and came back at to find our room had not been made up we were due out at a restaurant at so it left no time for us to shower and get carefully and do believe the photos shown on the website,0.0
we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel while on a trip to dublin for a fewvisits to see hospital consultantswe stressed the need for a good nights sleep in a quiet room having had not good experiences in other city centre hotelsthis hotel could not be more central but our room was perfect quiet clean and well laid out for my husband who has mild mobility issuesthe staff were naturally friendly without being intrusivethe bar was an oasis of calm at night without loud muzaki will certainly use this hotel again,1.0
i passed nights in this hotel closed to the city centre and to the beaches this hotel is nice and well equipped the breakfast is continental and respond to my needs only remarks for the rooftop which could be privatised for a day and not accessible to the recommend,1.0
this was an easy hotel to get to from the airport although there is some construction going on it did not impact on our stay there is a parking building behind the hotel which is great if you have a rental car we had to book two rooms as they did not have rooms according to their website that would fit families of so i was a bit surprised to find that one of our rooms would have accommodated the whole family with a fold away bed their rooms however were clean and modern with air conditioning the breakfast was good as well friendly helpful staff and a guest laundry with a reasonable price per load was fantastic,1.0
we stayed here for two nights and it had several lovely staff was lovely and very helpful we had a couple of issues and they were pleasant the whole time room was nice enough and had air conditioning we had a room with both a tub and a sauna and i used both and they both were very relaxing also i accidentally left a bunch of undergarmets in the drawer of the room i emailed the day we left and they held them for me for a week so i could pick them up before i left location was also lovely just a short walk to town that made it so we could be away from the hubbub but still be able to access it breakfast was also lovely but this is the only place i stayed during my week in ireland that did have breakfast included in the room price cons couple of minor problems that added together lost it a star i used the jetted tub on the first night and it would drain the front desk said it would sometimes get jammed but they could fix it until the morning i also could figure out how to get the coffee maker to work also when i picked up my things i left they had added a bunch of stuff to the bag magazines a magnet etc that someone else had left behind i thought the magazines came with the room but apparently it just was cleaned well,1.0
pestana arena barcelona is in walking distance from the sans train station the staff is multilingual and very helpful the rooms are large and very well appointed the bathrooms are gorgeous i only spent one night here before a cruise but thoroughly enjoyed my stay,1.0
stayed here for night with friends ideal location for airport and also centre of town very clean excellent rooms just done up i think a short stay but could fault it and will definitely use again if visiting barcelona,1.0
the room is small and warm since we stayed here in july however the location is right in the middle of everything making it easy to walk to different sights and pubs the pub attached to the hotel offered great music at night even though the hotel is located in the middle of temple bar we did not have an issues with noise at,1.0
this is a very modern hotel with a lot of accommodation and services best features location walking distance from many major attractions acropole for instance and shopping service people over there just want to make your stay memorable they are proactively looking to help you in any manner finally the restaurant offers a breathtaking view of the acropole gorgious when illuminated during evening time with a glass of local fresh white wine nothing can beats that,1.0
i booked this hotel last minute after changing my travel plans and boy did i make the right decision first of all this property is minutes from the new beautiful acropolis museum south slope of the acropolis itself as well as the plaka the location seriously could get better next the staff was so friendly and helpful at all times their hospitality is some of the best i ever encountered traveling the room was comfortable and the breakfast spread was very nice to fuel up with in the morning before adventuring out highly recommend this property,1.0
we recently stayed at the wynn hotel and we were very pleased the staff was very helpful and friendly our room was clean and comfortable the free breakfast was delicious and there was lots to choose both hot and cold items were available,1.0
stayed here for long weekend as we were attending coldplay concert at croke park it was quite expensive i must say for nights the staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival with us being early they stored our cases and told us to come back in a couple of hours and they would get us a room which they did which was good as check in was till the reception and bar area was lovely bright and airy the bar prices were reasonable we did eat at the hotel but menu seemed lovely the room was as special as i thought it would be considering the price and it being a hilton could been doing with a lick of paint and the bathroom with a freshen up the bed was the comfiest either but that due to personal taste quite a walk from the centre of town depending the way you walk tram stop is right outside and frequent to take you into city over all was a nice stay would stay again if got a better rate for the rooms,1.0
the receptionist was nice and friendly my room was on the ground floor and facing the street so we can hear footsteps and pedestrians talking outside it did bother me much because i a heavy sleeper the area around the hotel is pretty convenient to find places to eat drink and smoke there also some convenience shop and a laundry right across the got the room for pax and the size of the room was huge i love the decor the bed was comfortable there was no bathtub though only shower there a mini fridge which i like although was not stocked with beverages only one mineral i enjoyed my stay the location is slightly out of the central part of the city but i kinda like that as the atmosphere is more it not too far away though and you can easily get around from here because the tram stops just in front of the hotel,1.0
family of rooms hotel is in a good location however the neighborhood is very run down upon arrival a very cheerful staff greets you there are several stairs to climb to get to the central elevator which is very small the staff happily gets your bags to your rooms so this is not an issue very clean breakfast area with a lovely woman making sure you are seated and comfortable rooms are very clean bathroom is a decent size air conditioning is is no hotel appointed parking they suggest a parking garage but it is several blocks away and not a well lit walk back to the hotel many shopping areas are an easy walk in you need a cab to town the hotel will call you one we loved our stay here,1.0
ok it expensive but it central quiet spotless great food and drink and staff very polite and well trained to look after visitors very close to good shopping and tapas bars would i visit and stay again without question,1.0
we spent night at the majestic in june and booked one of the majestic residences directly across passieg de gracia from the hotel two bedrooms two full baths a ktichen room balconies laundry we had it all it would be hard to find better service or amenities than this the hotel is centrally located and we walked to many attractions restaurants including la sagrada familia la pedrera and las ramblas the hotel has a very nice spa and a rooftop lounge with a great view the full breakfast at the hotel is delicious and has choices for everyone but it is on the expensive side we did not include this in our visit but chose to eat there once for the experience we would surely stay here again on a future trip to barcelona,1.0
my exact specification was a quiet safe room however i received the opposite twice and a promise of rectifying it by the manager garrett but when i later asked he completely forgot the conversation i recommend anywhere else,0.0
this hotel is well located beautifully and tastefully renovated with great big bathroom and storage space in the room comfortable bed and the beautiful floor although the hotel is located in a noisy area double glazed windows worked very well and the staff were always eager to help they even packed a breakfast for our early flight out of barcelona love to go back soon love from sydney australia,1.0
travelled as family of and the hotel met our needs one of the best family rooms we have stayed in large comfortable bed and not a sofa bed in sight great breakfast kids loved the pancake machine,1.0
if is what you are doing in athens then this is your place you can walk out and zip to the acropolis and the acropolis museum in about two seconds you are nicely set up to walk almost anywhere in athens our room had a nice view of the acropolis so pretty at night there a cute little restaurant on the top floor where you can grab a drink or have dinner with great views the staff at the front desk is so helpful and can advise you on anything an everything in the city love this place,1.0
a really disappointing hilton firstly the hotel shuttle did show up to the airport as per the schedule annoying in the height of summer but if the weather was bad or if it was the depths of winter i would be going was a chipped cup in the bedroom and there were marks on the splashback if the bathroom sink obviously not been cleaned properly after the last went out on saturday and when we got back late on saturday evening our room had been serviced which was really annoying especially as we supposed to be valued members of the hilton loyalty programme we had a late checkout booked as my partner is undergoing medical treatment and i knew he would be bright eyed and bushy tailed the next day yet despite having the do not disturb card on the door we still had housekeeping knocking on the door hours before we were due to check buffet breakfast was terrible lukewarm everything and dried out to within an inch of its work to be done here,0.0
my wife and i have recently returned from a day stay at the barcelona universal and have nothing but praise for the staff are so helpful and polite and ca do enough to make your stay more enjoyable during check in we were informed that we had been given a free room upgrade which was a very welcoming surprise the hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff work very hard to maintain it that way our room was on the floor and looked out on to road at the front of the hotel and although the road was busy the double glazed windows did an excellent job at blocking out the traffic noise bed linen and bathroom towels were changed daily and the air conditioning in the room was probably the best i have ever encountered in a hotel which was a godsend as the outdoor temperature was well in to the rooftop bar is excellent with a good selection of beers spirits and cocktails the bar really comes alive at night and offers some great views across the city the rooftop pool is small but ideal for cooling off in when the daytime heat gets too only criticism and which others have already mentioned would be the occasional smell from the drains the smell of sewage would sometimes be in the hotels corridors and also near the rooftop bar at times it could be quite strong but was only encountered a couple times during our stay so did impact,1.0
friendly welcoming staff at reception helpful in explaining different areas of amsterdam enjoyed every minute of our stay here easy to find from airport to train to ferry across the river to the hotel comfy rooms especially enjoyed the view across the river watching the people go about their daily business each lift up to the room had a different theme full size complimentary toiletries so you have no need to bring your own and a good powerful hairdryer also the cafe nelson mandela just by the river short walk from hotel nice to sit and enjoy the quiet whilst watching the boats only disappointment was that there was not enough umbrellas on the day it rained hard so go early if you need to borrow one,1.0
first the location ca beat it just seconds from red light district and a short stroll to damstraat and all the restaurants and shops second the hotel itself is a nice quirky assembly of various buildings straddling across a street with connection underground given the structural limitations there an unusual amount of twists and turns before i could reach my room but it does lend some character to the property third my room and the bathroom were surprisingly large for amsterdam though it faced just a back with no view to speak of but it was nicely appointed so no complaints fourth the breakfast was alright decent spread though not cheap certainly enough to set me off for the day of meetings and travels all in all good value for money with quick efficient service will book this place again on my next trip business or personal,1.0
we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel very friendly and customer oriented front office concierge staff lovely junior suite yet bathroom was somewhat small compared to the size of the room great location sumptuous breakfast roof top swimming pool it all really worked for us,1.0
had high tea at the shelbourne hotel our first day in dublin it was well worth the price everything was first class the service the pastries were scrumptious and the tea and coffee first rate even though it is a very classy hotel you do have to dress up to attend i had on a polo shirt and slacks and my wife was similarly dressed definitely recommended,1.0
good helpful staff and comfortable rooms clean and tidy and lovely bathrooms time we have stayed here and although this time we stayed in a normal room and not the deluxe it was absolutely fine,1.0
the location is perfect to visit the city without using the city transport the hotel is great with the pool the room was nice but there was some noice because of the reparation in the hotel the staff concierge was really nice and helpful but i think the people at the reception could be nicer they are the first impression of the hotel and it disappointing,1.0
tiny room comfortable bed helpful staff we had a problem with our reservation somehow there were rooms booked for us when we only needed one and the staff were as helpful as they could be about figuring out what happened problem with booking company and a path to resolution great location near lots of beautiful places to visit and nice to walk in the area behind the hotel barcelona cathedral lots of restaurants and shops etc although the area is very active and noisy the room was well insulated for noise and it was quiet for sleeping loved the balcony overlooking the street,1.0
amazing location right in the city centre beautiful view of the river small window in the room and a little noisy are my only complaints food is good considering it ireland so great chefs but not my favorite menu items felt very safe and i was traveling alone,1.0
very nice and super friendly staff we had a concert at the stadium so it was perfect walking distance the breakfast was a little crowded and they had run out of a few things but other than that it was great,1.0
just by luck we booked this hotel and right from the start we knew we had a winner great location just at the train station that takes you to the city and also the the hotel is a shopping precinct and a great variety of different eating places and the imax the service was great the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast was sufficient and a great variety only problem was there was insufficient room for everyone and there was a waiting period during the peak times and they did restock everything nearing finish time of serving which if you had to wait for a seat and then not have everything available was a bit disappointing still having said that this hotel was a winner and very happy to recommend,1.0
we stayed one night before our cruise train from airport to centraal station then ten minute walk with our rolling luggage super location for walk around sight seeing canal boats nearby many nice restaurants and coffee houses very extensive breakfast buffet plus cooked to order selections easy fifteen minutes walk to cruise terminal the hotel staff is accustomed to cruisers and are available to help get your cruise bag tags securely fastened to your bags very comfortable bedding and quiet rooms though right near everything,1.0
the only negative i have is that the room smelt slightly on arrival but opened window and was ok after an hour the staff were friendly and helpful on arrival and checking in and out was easy and left luggage there when checked out as we had late flight was nice size and bathroom was clean and big location is good tram was immediately outside we got off at overtoon and walked to the centre we found from the centre it was easier to train to sloterdikt then tram was just stop from there to hotel on way back we bought a day pass which allowed travel on all buses trams and trams for euro each everything was easy to reach from hotel we had no problems with any of the transport would go back to this hotel when i first was trying to book i wanted something more central but now i been there i not sure i would want to stay any nearer the mayhem lol,1.0
second visit to the arts in wonderful barcelona we were greeted in the club lounge and presented to a nice upgraded room along with the room for our children enjoyed very much these updated rooms in the upper floors with beautiful views of the mediterranean and barcelona there are six restaurants and bars to choose from serving everything from light informal breakfasts and lunches to exceptional catalan cuisine we specially enjoyed the cafe veranda for breakfast with so many delicious choices from local options to chinese fried rice to regular crepes pancakes it was a fun start everyday nearby there are many small restaurants not very good but there is also a the beach area to enjoy and drink a real sangria while watching the sunset ramble area is a good minute walk but the hotel has always lots of taxis and private ones for transportation the club lounge is worth it they have offerings a day and its nice to unwind late in the afternoon with a nice cava and a few local appetisers while discussing dinner plans the staff at the lounge is well trained and help you with reservations and options for dining and exploring the town recommend the rooms with lounge access,1.0
i highly recommend hotel omm with its prime location that you can basically walk to most places restaurants and shops with great services very clean and with the most friendliest staff we have ever met the front desk staff were very friendly and informative and the rest of the hotel staff from waiters to housekeeping were very very nice helpful snd welcoming bellmen worked hard to serve us to the extend that they will be running the streets to find the best taxi for us since we are a big family also the food was tasty and eclectic and each maincourse we ordered at roca bar was tasty and yummy especially the chicken tendoori with modern twist ca say enough good things we will be back again thank you,1.0
as a huge lover of cocktails i went to the sidecar bar ordered their special the sidecar signature cocktail and really enjoyed staff is very friendly and polite i know iva the waitress and that why i wanted her to make the cocktail a barman cathal helped her make it great and handsome guy i ended up having three glasses and a tray with nuts in front of stars for a reason,1.0
a lovely modern hotel situated in a quiet area surrounded by local shops and restaurants air conditioned rooms and a great breakfast buffet the staff are easy to talk to and helpful close enough to walk to park guel approx mins and even las rambla should you want to hrs with metro access to think about if you after a relaxed time with some sight seeing,1.0
the hotel itself is older but very clean and the service can not be beat in the heart of the action and a short walk to the acropolis you can easily and safely roam the streets of plaka great shops and restaurants are to be found the hotel pool and bar on the rooftop offer a great view of the acropolis it truly amazing at night we do regret our choice,1.0
this hotel was very good from start to finish my only comment would be that it is not the most convenient location unless you are on business still it is in walking distance lengthy from everywhere nice staff clean rooms good experience,1.0
what a lovely hotel so close to all the tapas bars restuarants metro bus and beach all the staff reception to dining room to cleaning staff were so helpful polite the hotel room was lovely we were on the floor at the back of the hotel but this meant it was quiet air con was a god send and the small fridge was brilliant even if we were late getting up and leaving the room the cleaning staff would work around us and our room was cleaned everyday and the breakfast was fantastic so fresh everything very clean and no one rushed you reception were very knowledgeable for the area trips you could take and best ways to get any place you wanted to will definitely be going back to barcelona and staying at this hotel would recommend for families as well as couples thank you hotel gotico,1.0
stay of nights there as hhonors diamond you should be treated fairly unfortunately not at all no welcome for breakfast the hotel do a segregation of hhonors member on the underground with a limited food and untasteful moreover the staff is far to be professional and spend more time to chat and joke than take care of customer this hotel is not at all as hilton level and should be removed from hilton group,0.0
very professional and delightful staff mark and francais were the best wonderful people wonderful very full breakfast with everything you could think of wonderful music show very professional great location to transportation of tours and airport coaches about minutes to the airport on airport coach rooms are carpeted and had to change rooms due to strong flowery smell but they accomodated us with another room great stay,1.0
from the moment we entered this hotel our stay was perfect room was beautiful and had everything we needed all of the staff were extremely friendly accommodating and were willing to go the extra mile a special thank you to hazel who found out we had just got engaged and gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco this made our stay extra special we did eat in the hotel so ca comment on the food but the bar area was lovely and the afternoon tea looked amazing although the room was incredibly hot we were provided with a fan without even having to ask this hotel is in a great location with lots of shops and restaurants on the same street number bus from the airport it takes about and it drops you right outside the hotel it is also a short bus trip to the city centre and buses are very frequent i will be recommending this hotel to all friends and family and wo hesitate to return when i dublin next,1.0
with good access to metro and easy walking distance to lots of sights and restaurants this was a perfect place to stay in the city good cool room to escape to when the heat of the day became too much,1.0
this is a nice hotel some may say small room but not for amsterdam the location is great for museums van gogh and rijks and is right beside vondel park the tram travels right in from of the hotel parking is available on the street for the city fee this is a very safe and upscale neighborhood,1.0
good location and room for the money if you expecting something super ritzy maybe reconsider it was clean the air conditioner worked well i did have any issues with noise level and i found the staff to be very helpful well located in proximity to omonoia station,1.0
great hotel great location very helpful staff that helped me with my train tickets when i had friendly and fluent in english and spanish breakfast was great i would certainly stay here again taxi stand right outside beautiful rooftop patio,1.0
i really enjoyed my stay here the staff were friendly and very helpful the breakfast excellent and the room whilst not large was well designed good wifi but a bit slow to connect on occasions the location is excellent to get around the city the rooftop pool was also very pleasant even if it could be a bit crowded at certain times free entrance to the egyptian museum was a bonusthe flaw was the bed which was seemingly comfortable on first feel but the springs either demonstrated that the bed was not in its first flush of youth or a better design should have been chosen,1.0
really nice night stay at praktik garden staff were friendly and check in was efficient nice decor and nice and clean most tourist attractions a walkable distance but super close to the metro for travelling a little further or if feeling too hot and lazy to walk the room was small but had all we needed the shower was good only thing was the door to the shower frosted glass with a small gap around the edges paired with the crome door frame i could see my partner sitting on the bed from the toilet and vice versa we found it funny but maybe not ideal for some,1.0
wife booked this as it cheap for the dublin city centre area you not know it are brilliant and ca do enough for you the room is up there with some of the best i stayed in massive comfortable bed our son looked dwarfed in the huge single slightly dated but well stocked and river view from our room over the was included and was very good,1.0
my son and i had a wonderful stay the attalos hotel had everything we wanted in a hotel without being overly expensive warm inviting and helpful staff the manager came right to our aid when we did know how to work the and they were great with suggestions and tour arrangements clean rooms housekeeping did a great job every day the room was small but that was perfectly ok with us we had more than enough space to relax indoors when we wanted and we had a small balcony with a partial view of the acropolis comfortable beds and pillows and quiet at night we slept well even when it was degrees outside the bathroom was modern and pretty the free wifi worked well the breakfast was delicious with a great variety of food convenient location very close to the shops in monastiraki and a short walk to the plaka not the fanciest part of athens very urban location lots of graffiti outside and some people on the streets nearby asking for money but we never felt unsafe and the rooftop bar is a very lovely place to hang out with a fantastic view of the acropolis nice seating and a friendly bartender we stopped by every evening around sunset i would definitely stay here again,1.0
ideally located in the paseo de gracia in the examplair district this property was within walking distance to la sagrada famiglia casa battlo and the liceu theater as well as la pedrera it was a short taxi ride from park guel shops and restaurants all around staff was attentive especially elena on the concierge level during our trip to barcelona she became our concierge and suggested places to go and visit in addition she was very attentive to our need during breakfast only complains would be that the mini fridge was not very cold and that the parking was extremely tight sergio the was helpful as well and directed my husband in and out of the tight parking lot overall a nice stay in a basic but well appointed hotel will definitly recommend it,1.0
the view of parthenon was nice though no one informs the guest that when the cafe at the ground floor is closed there is no way in or out of the hotel during the night i needed to go out of the hotel and i realized that i was locked honestly that was a nice experiences,0.0
this is a sweet small hotel just out of the chaos of the plaka and in a convenient location near syntagma square you can walk virtually anywhere you want to go as a visitor or take a quick taxi or metro ride the hotel is off the street through an open air restaurant and around a lovely courtyard it is elegantly designed and just the right size to feel homey without feeling stuffy the staff are very helpful leonidis helped me with many different arrangements and questions breakfast is quite good and you can order additional items off a small menu the rooms are well designed modern and spotless i stayed here twice and definitely preferred my room on an upper floor with a balcony to the larger room that was somewhat subterranean i stayed in the family room subterranean room first and might not have returned if i did already have a booking however after my second stay i would happily return what it might lack in big ticket amenities a pool for instance it makes up for with attention to detail charm and quality,1.0
i love this hotel it has everything that a person needs the design is interesting and the rooftopbar offers nice foods drinks great music and a lovely view i would defeinitely recommend it to my friends the hotel has a great location and it offers you an innovative room design the only bad thing is that the walls a little bit thinner than usually but i personally dont have a problem with a great hotel,1.0
we were in town for a concert at croke park and decided to book the spencer for our nights in dublin we were very happy with our choice we love to walk and could walk everywhere from here we also took advantage of the dublin bikes and the hotel had a bike almost right across the street everyone who worked there was very pleasant and like others have mentioned the coffee shop across the way is great the room were nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable would recommend and would stay again,1.0
we visited ireland on our honeymoon and stayed in two hotels while in dublin at the beginning and end of our trip i so glad we tried this hotel because it was absolutely gorgeous and such an amazing way to end our honeymoon the location was great and easily walkable to things the staff were friendly and the room was amazing honestly it was a perfect hotel,1.0
we arrived at this hotel after staying at a campsite for a music festival and thank goodness we did what a feeling it was to arrive at such a beautiful immaculate place we arrived earlier than check in at around and expected to just spend the day at the for some snacks waiting around for our room but the receptionist informed us our room was ready already which was fantastic news i had made my booking for two nights separately as i could find the two nights online anywhere and was anxious we would be able to stay in the same room for the two nights but the gent at reception tall blonde male accommodated us perfectly and had it all sorted out within minutes we had our friends with us who were due to travel back to scotland that evening on a later flight and when we asked if we could have them spend the day at the pool with us this was a problem totally accommodating with them even when they were guests at the hotel they did have to pay the extra each for this but the spa is definitely worth that the hotel also allowed them to get the free transfer to the airport as long as there was space after guests had gotten in it which is totally understandable and this just made their last day so much easier they were so grateful for all of the receptionists help my boyfriend and i had room,1.0
our third stay at this wonderful hotel we had a room on the floor with a big terrace facing the street it can be a bit noisy because of the traffic but it did not bother us roof top terrace and the small pool are great for relaxation and some sun bathing breakfast concept is both modern and traditional the new detox juices and other fruity dishes make an excellent alternative for the more traditional bacon and eggs but really there everything you need for a full breakfast the staff are really friendly service with a smile the location is very convenient near the city centre with undergound station just a minute away and good bus connections we want to come back,1.0
we arrived early our rooms were ready there were quite a lot of people hanging around in the lobby waiting we stood for quite a while when it got to the time that our rooms should been ready i asked one of the ladies on reception who called housekeeping to check still not ready stood waiting again a male member of staff who i think was called jorgis asked if he could help we explained what was happening immediately he sorted rooms for us one triple one double he upgraded our double room to business floor too great rooms fabulous interior of the hotel bar lovely shop selling ready to eat foods meals that you can pop into a microwave coffee etc can also be purchased there lovely bar restaurant area outside patio everywhere smelt fresh clean metro into city is just a minute walk away very easy nice quiet location too lovely stay,1.0
it was not too difficult to find with gps while the indoor parking is a test of the driver skill esp we had a big car there are plenty of outdoor parking around the hotel room is quite the bare minimum novotel is a usual in asia but this one would be our amenities are at just minimum towels were very thin the room was that comfortable overall to make me stay in longer lots of choices at breakfast with both hot and cold dishes staff looked very grumpy though hotel souvenir shop got some interesting stuff i like that the hotel installed a kinnect at the lobby this keeps the older kids entertained,1.0
really enjoyed our night stay at the hotel clean and comfortable and the rooftop bar and pool were amazing with incredible reviews great location too definitely recommended the only reason i did give it was the service no specific issues but it was special i definitely go back though,1.0
our standard room was located on floor it was quiet and large much appreciated when we were staying a week mini bar water juice chips free and replenished daily happy hour on cocktails dining room provided tasty food an great service location great can walk most places markets and supermarket close by tram at,1.0
comfortable boutique hotel we positioned for metro and bus just min away plenty of places to eat within to mins walk magic fountain just min walk hotel staff could have been more kind and helpful bed was comfortable room clean only thing missing was maybe some drawers to let us unpack from our cases,1.0
just stayed at clontarf for two nights during july it is truly a special hotel and place to stay the decor is just as the photographs show ornate and quirky great art work through out the hotel the location is a bit off the beaten path from the city centre but the bus nearby will take you into town or a taxi ride will get you there and back in minutes breakfast is really nice and perfectly adequate with hot food breads yogurts fruit and cold cuts would definitely stay here again,1.0
this hotel is fab spent the weekend here celebrating my husbands it was worth every penny the staff were super friendly fixed a leak in our room on the sat eve whilst we were out the manager met us when we checked out to make sure we were ok to apologise the restaurant was exquisite and the cocktails were fantastic both with great service would recommend this hotel if you looking for a treat,1.0
the best of this hotel is two thing is clean comfortable and at the train station if visiting the place on summer time r vacation is great you can easily rent a bike is much cheaper and nicer than others like clink nord which is well located but much worse rooms,1.0
lovely olde worlde hotel spotlessly clean very nice rooms the decor is amazing could believe how many people were at the nightclub under the hotel on a tuesday evening could of been a pint offers security on door on an evening to stop people from club wandering into hotel great cooked breakfast next morning good choice of continental as well only fault i could pick beware the windows open very very wide be careful if you have children,1.0
location is excellent as the luas stop is directly outside the door the hotel is just off st ideal for shopping sight seeing or business the hotel is in existence since and retains many of its old world qualities its an ideal central location for social or business meetings the double room was quiet and peaceful with a good shower and tea making facilities the bar food was very good and good value a most enjoyable stay,1.0
we stayed as a group in the hotel for days to attend a tournament at amsterdam zuid the metro was very close to the hall and to the city center very good ratio the rooms were very clean and the air conditioning can be turn off we had fresh air even we could open any windows the breakfast with is high but was delicious,1.0
we chose hotel fita because we wanted something close to the art museums we chose wisely upon our early arrival we were met by a lovely young woman who checked us in and acquainted us with amsterdam the map and her accompanying details about how to get around and what to visit made us feel immediately comfortable with the city when we returned that evening we found our room to be fantastic we had asked for a large double and it was large and clean and included everything we could possibly need even an ironing board that slid into its hiding place breakfast was great lots of yummy choices with delicious pancakes at the had a one block walk to the van gogh museum and a pleasant walk through the park to the rijksmuseum there were at least two other art museums within three blocks too the tram which we rode everywhere stopped within the block too one block in the opposite direction was a street filled with shops and cute places to eat getting dinner was more difficult than lunch because most of the closed by which i think might be because this is a museum district and the museums close by owners and staff are absolutely lovely you can tell this is more than a job for them they truly enjoy talking to each visitor and look for ways to make them feel at home i hope i have a chance to return to both amsterdam and hotel,1.0
stayed in hotel casa for night for business very nice hotel high quality at very competitive price excellent location few minutes walk from the metro station great staff service at and easy and quick queue free you drop your key in a box at reception if you already paid at rooms are spacious and quite wifi works well in all common areas and rooms very good breakfast served in their nice restaurant which is also open until am for drinks and snacks after terrace at the floor to highly recommended,1.0
overall our experience here with a family of in rooms was great rooms as small as you might expect in a european city but they are nicely decorated with plenty of outlets and lighting etc the staff was amazing particularly when the city experienced a sudden power outage one morning while we were at breakfast it seemed like every staff member ran around the floors of the hotel physically guiding people to stairs and generally offering any and all help that they was buffet style but you could also order additional items from the wait staff food was good and prompt and on our very early departure morning they offered to go bags so you could pack up some food from their buffet to take with has air conditioning which in an unexpectedly warm july was a great relief from our hotels in smaller towns in ireland hotel is a few blocks from a bus stop you can buy tickets at the front desk and walking distance to the temple bar give this if that was an option because i am to think of any complaints other than small rooms with no fridge but that last thing is such an american expectation,1.0
the hotel staff was rude when asked for information pertaining to the coffee machine in the bedroom they also ripped us off by billing us on the mini bar items which were not consumed as we never opened the mini bar as we were in a hurry to catch our train to brussels we did not confront them and paid the over all experience was bad for us,0.0
we spent our last night at the grande bretagne and despite the price it was more than worth it the hotel is on par with the best of the best the plaza in new york the ritz in paris and so on the public rooms are plush and luxurious the rooms while small meet every travelers need the staff is solicitous and polished they reached out to us several times before we even arrived to see if they could do anything for us but the absolute reason to choose this hotel is the rooftop restaurant with its mesmerizing views of the acropolis in the morning afternoon and most of all at night the hotel has a sumptuous breakfast on the grand scale of hotels of its caliber superb food terrific cocktails but oh please that view is the best ever if you can afford it hands down stay here,1.0
this lovely hotel is well worth it price they offered amazing breakfast in the morning and even packed us a breakfast box on our last morning as we were too early for the breakfast hours it is well located near syntagma square and about a minute walk from the acropolis it is located close to a train station about a uphill walk and has loads of restaurants and stores in the area,1.0
stayed for night in july with husband daughter check in was very fast and receptionist was so nice and helpful room was really big and spacious it is in a convenient place as the luas is right outside the door breakfast was very nice overall it was a great place and wld recommend and stay again,1.0
our stay here was underwhelming we booked a weekend break here days nights due to the reputation and found the hotel fell short on arrival the baggage handler was very friendly but the desk staff could process us quickly enough to get us out the way due to a queue of people waiting to check in they were not very welcoming the view from the room is exquisite but let down by the fact the bed is two individual beds separately made and pushed together with a blanket over the top to give the illusion it is one bed we requested an iron due to creased clothing as they have been in suitcases to be advised that there is not one available but you can pay for someone to come up and take the item away to be pressed not ideal the pool is far too small for a hotel of its size there are perhaps for a hotel with final day the roof garden was also unavailable due to a wedding ceremony with no alternative advertised and the downstairs bar does not have an adequate capacity we checked out at in the afternoon we had to go to a neighbouring hotel to await pick up from outside the royal olympic overall we were not all that impressed with our stay or the service we received from the staff,0.0
loved this hotel boutique feel with great service and beautiful decor they have a wonderful restaurant and bikes you can borrow to cruise around the rooms are well laid out with everything you need would definitely visit again,1.0
the hotel lobby is beautiful you have several areas to sit and relax there is a little area for coffee and doughnuts bagels etc the staff is very nice friendly and helpful the room size was not bad for europe there is a fitness center however it is only open from i was gone before and did not return until after so i was disappointed because i love to workout daily the rooftop restaurant was awesome the views are breathtaking you can see the acropolis and at night it lights up the sunset views are amazing also there is a buffet restaurant the food is good but a lot of the same foods daily within walking distance to shopping district of plaka,1.0
stayed there last week found the property very good and location excellent staff was very courteous and very helpful especially maria at the front desk who managed everything whether it was charger or restaurant booking breakfast was also much above average took a decision to book a junior suite as we were three adults and one infant which turned out to be very wise as the size of suite was very large special thanks to marion in reservation who also helped and guided while making direct reservation will definitely advise all my contacts to stay here,1.0
after a weeks cruising it was reassuring to arrive in this luxurious quirky and posh reception with a relaxed were well equiped clean and fresh and quiet this was a concern as location is excellent parallel to la rambla and can often be a trade off but we had excellent sleep and were well rested street view of cathedral over the road a nice boutique hotel thats private with good service and attention to detail,1.0
great hotel very up to date the thing we liked mosted was the fact we had a kitchenette in the hotel room which was very handy as we cooked our own meals during the evening after a lovely day out would recomend this hotel to stay in to future guests staff are very polite and attentive the only bad thing i can say is we dodnt get any toilet roll during iur stay as no one vsiited our room we did ask for some and git some straight away overall really enjoyed our stay thank you to all at the element,1.0
high ceilings spacious room excellent quality finishes fabulous staff hotel do is situated in the bustling placa reial where musicians performers and restaurants abound overlooking the action but without the noise from below our room was a tranquil oasis in this fabulous city very clean a little short on wardrobe space and contemporary we loved the wooden floors and furniture breakfast was superb and the roof top pool while small was adequate the wireless internet was excellent a shout out to albert for his friendly nature and obliging service highly recommended,1.0
this hotel is centrally located just a few blocks from la rambla placa de catalunya and several gaudi sites the rooms were comfortable and clean though small we had just barely enough room for a spare bed for a child we also thoroughly enjoyed the pool and the staff were really helpful it could use a bit of updating but overall we had a great experience here,1.0
booked the divani caravel for one night as a stopover on the way to somewhere else and have to say it was great hotel was clean and staff were very friendly helpful and efficient location was great try oroscopo restaurant round the corner and the kids loved the roof top pool hotel offers valet parking for euro,1.0
this was a very large room in an amazing location i would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone it was very clean and front desk was great i was here for days and they were extremely accommodating and nice,1.0
we booked nights at this hotel as my birthday treat we booked an executive room and i emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion i received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this on arrival the hotel was full this was the least of our problems the hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel taxi at euros on our return to the airport we were quoted euros by hotel staff which we booked decided to take the metro as we thought euros rather expensive the metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband passport were stolen from my handbag this resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the british embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement day ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within executive room was nothing like executive the bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath i reported this but the engineer could make no were replaced each day although the quality was not is unusual not to have facilities in a,1.0
i had an awesome experience at teleport hotel the staff is great funny serious rooms location everything good i will be back soon i promise is was a magnific experience thanks for all,1.0
my boyfriend and i enjoyed staying at this hilton location which was near almost every major attraction we went to see in dublin the view of the river is fantastic if you can get it the rooms are quirky and modern and the staff is terrific our only quibble was that the parking nearby is ideal as it is difficult to navigate a car into the narrow spots and maneuver in the tiny parking building but that may be an unavoidable fact of staying in downtown dublin and the car survived just fine in any event we would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in dublin,1.0
citizen has clearly worked hard on defining its offer which feels modern and differentiated great beds leave little space in the bedroom but the living rooms concept really delivered allowing for collaborative work or individual time in shared spaces smartpad controls in room felt a bit of a gimmick but functioned well so no gripes there catering offer whilst not extensive flexes well for people on different circadian rhythms or time zones helpful staff known as ambassadors which they were location is out of town but very well connected easty walk through beatrix park to ria conference centre mins on foot to museum quarter strolling distance from zuid station which connects with airport or number tram on doorstep,1.0
spent four nights at ink hotel in july this boutique hotel is really very good charming staff comfortable room good restaurant and bar also the location is first class would definitely stay there again on next amsterdam trip,1.0
stayed here had rooms as couples guy at desk very friendly and helpful and he doubles as our bar guy in the small room where we ended each day to wind down after very busy day exploring the interesting city rooms with all the basics very clean but shower recess very small and water goes over floor but nothing a towel did fix the breakfast was very something for every one the lift is very small but it made interesting talking point no complaints and would return if ever in athens again value for money,1.0
best location magnificent cathedral as background while you or just casual drinking on open rooftop easy to locate all is familiar with the place easy to walk to shopping place or local market for dinner classic design with advanced facilities interior is maintain its heritage look but combine with new design and technology wifi is always on and enough for daily use rooms are clean spacious and all stuffs you need is excellent service from staffs helpful and care for visitors breakfast is complete however the variation should be alternate family stay rooms for days july best vacation ever star from us,1.0
we were here for two nights and were very happy with the hotel room was small as was the washroom but both were extremely clean well prepared beautiful and provided everything we staff was especially lovely and accommodating from those working front desk to the staff in the bar and location was central and very full irish breakfast was fantastic and the staff worked continuously to ensure we were well looked quite convenient the dinner in the restaurant did quite measure up as well as the breakfast did we felt that nothing we ate was made from scratch however if it was then it was a very good choice of accommodations,1.0
the hotel was quiet and relaxing the cleanliness and rooms were amazing staff were welcoming and could do enough for you the food was stunning a beautiful stay in dublin and definitely advise a stay at herbert park hotel,1.0
stayed here for a total of two nights in one of the premier king rooms the room was modern spacious peaceful and most importantly spotless all the staff from check in to check out were extremely friendly and helpful we ate in the bar and sampled some of there tasty cocktails which were also faultless overall we had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back to this beautiful hotel,1.0
in a very central location not far from street you can walk to the gpo museum and the hop on hop off buses depart just opposite it the airbus from the airport also has a stop nearby easy to walk to the river and bars good size rooms décor just as you would expect from jurys what made this an exceptional stay was the breakfast an excellent choice on the buffet and the hot food was kept fresh it was as good a breakfast as i had in many more expensive hotels at the moment there are serious road works going on in dublin and there are some just outside the hotel there is only a small pull in drop off area outside i left the car in a nearby shopping centre until i found the hotel and checked in they will give you directions to a nearby car park and validate your ticket for a discount,1.0
good location close to several museums but far from the train station friendly staff big rooms but not used to the best a bit of moisture in the bathroom so the tiles were not spotless clean excellent breakfast good room service,1.0
hyatt is a new and great hotell free wifi good food great gym and good service the staff was fresh and need some time to be perfect the computer system in the reseption seemed to have some issues but a great hotell,1.0
where do i start we booked a room and got a room which included an ensuite felt like a jail cell me and my fiancé were dreading going back to the hotel at night staff did try to help us just told us the manager is away and to email him we did and never heard back rooms were dirty stained sheets blood stains on the walls no aircon there fore have to leave window open and the road noise was unbearable we had to sleep with earplugs in stair case is so narrow and treads are tiny very unsafe would not be leagal in aus,0.0
a grand location for a grand hotel the concierge and staff were very helpful with information and helping to book the busiest sites and always cheerful and pleasant we enjoyed the bar and restaurant on the hotel roof it was a beautiful place to sit eat and enjoy the view i miss it already,1.0
the hotel itself is wonderful top notch staff excellent rooms super executive lounge ocean views everything one would expect from a hilton but it is a minute taxi ride or metro ride from any major attraction which really takes a bite out of your day if going to montserrat the train station is on the other side of town about a minute journey by metro all in all if sightseeing is your main goal a hotel closer to city center should be considered it is a five minute walk to a lifeguarded beach if that is goal of your the hotel itself is wonderful the executive lounge concierge was particularly helpful to us and her recommendations were spot on,1.0
we really enjoyed the mercer the rooms are but the staff is what makes this hotel unique and superb the breakfast was delicious and quite beautifully prepared each morning we had a couple of with the broken but overall a great location to wander around the gothic quarter from,1.0
the staff was friendly and helpful the room was nice big and clean the pool was way smaller than the pictures show which disappointed us a bit but overall a good experience and we enjoyed our stay,1.0
we stayed at this hotel at the end of our ireland vacation this summer it was a great hotel very clean comfortable with impeccable were both really impressed with the lobby interior of the rooms the hotel is very only two things we encountered parking is at a garage behind the hotel it is validated however i would have felt safe walking over there alone after dark something to keep in mind if you are planning on moving your car or leaving during the hotel is dead prior to it was almost creepy we woke up at for breakfast but it was served until there was literally nobody around no guests or employees i found it strange for a full service hote,1.0
am only recently getting into the swing of trip advisor but felt i had to do a review most recent stay july have stayed here regularly over the last years or so over those years i also stayed in many other hotels in dublin depending on the event location or if cassidys was full just to sample what out there but all round cassidys outshines and outperforms them is unbeatable very central to all services and amenities yet undisturbed by any noise from busy street very convenient to most bus services taxi rank luas tram stops there is the newer executive wing but rooms in the rest of the hotel have continuously been completely refreshed and modernised i have never found fault re cleanliness and the hotel could operate as a training ground for other hotels as regards how to train staff in excellent customer service they really go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay as enjoyable as possible reasonably priced breakfast is very generous and ranged from the hearty full irish to a wide selection of healthy continental options have had evening meals here on a number of occasions and found the menu to be good value and contain a varied choice with something to suit everyone,1.0
the staff was awesome and was extremely helpful the housetop bar is great and the room was perfect with not a thing out of place the location can t be beaten with easy access to the shoreline and all the well known spots an easy stroll away when in barcelona stay here,1.0
i stayed in this hotel with my disabled daughter what can i say excellent from the receptionists to the cleaners to the pool man george and lefteris helpful nothing is too much trouble rooms are spacious with a small fridge and safe a tv is also in the room but maimly greek channels room cleaned everyday if needed towels supplied around the pool by the lifeguard who also supplied gallons of water if and when needed food was excellent and reasonably priced there no real downside to this hotel the beach is two minutes from the hotel with their own umbrellas plenty of transport to visit athens or down the coast to sounion hotel i will definitely visit again well done the palmyra beach hotel,1.0
this hotel has everything great spa great food great service so very comfortable which was great after days in warzburg we walked in and although our room was not ready we had a drink at the bar and were taken on a tour of the hotel tom was our go to guy he is phenomenal and can help with anything the room was beautiful and comfortable we never waited for anything loretta gives a fantastic facial in the spa the staff at this hotel makes everything easy i wish i could give this hotel stars,1.0
we stayed in this hotel for one night friday july we were able to get a room at very short notice within two hours of arriving in fact the hotel is large and busy the building is really beautiful we had a most comfortable room great bed good bathroom we also had dinner in the restaurant where we were served by magda magda is a real live asset for this hotel she was excellent in every way smiling polite erudite and helpful i hope she is appreciated by her employers she is a classic example of the old saying you do get many like her in a half dozen we most certainly use this hotel again and look forward to it,1.0
we booked a suite for nights and had an amazing time the staff is really polite and pool area is really cool and relaxing and the pool bar is an absolute room has everything you need to keep in shape when away for a few will return for sure,1.0

we just came back from barcelona where we stayed at el palace hotel i just want to say that it was one of the best hotels i ever stayed everything was amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous with a prime location our room was beautiful and always clean the housekeeping was doing a great job every day the stuff at the front desk and the guys at the door were just amazing always friendly and always helpful the guy who spoke russian was the one that we talked the most i regret so much that i forgot his name he was always caring and attentive and always went beyond his way to help us i would like to point out a special lady by name julie who made our stay unforgettable my husband was in touch with her before our arrival since it was our year anniversary we were given an upgrade to a better room and received a bottle of champaign with chocolates including a hand written note from her she took time to meet us in person later during our stay and it was a real pleasure there is absolutely nothing negative i can say about el palace if i am back to barcelona i would only stay there,1.0
perfect perfect location decor and hospitality we enjoyed a delicious lunch in the main restaurant great bread salad salmon and dessert and we were in a hurry and the staff helped to speed our lunch gold star service definitely enjoy drinks at the rooftop bar after dinner and have dinner at aleria about a minute cab ride some of the best food we have ever had,1.0
i wish i had booked something closer to amsterdam major attractions this hotel is in a nice neighborhood but out of the way it a hefty walk to the main tourist spots however you can rent bikes from the hotel and several tram lines stop nearby so getting around is i was not pleased with the sleep quality i felt our mattress was too soft and our pillows too service was good but we had a room snafu when we arrived i had booked two rooms for two adults and two children as we would be arriving late i called ahead to make sure we get two rooms together i was assured we would however we got there to find our rooms two floors apart they did switch us the next day no compensation was offered but the person on the desk quickly agreed when i suggested they give us all a free breakfast,1.0
we arrived in family to amsterdam after a long trip it was important a quicky and easy and also an excelent breakfast the next location to walk to downtown nemo and navy museum,1.0
my wife and i stayed at the shelbourne dublin in august unlike many of the reviews mentioned earlier this is specific to the hotel for staying guests and not its f b hotels generally frequented by wife and i are the raffles the ritz langham oberoi peninsula so this is relevant to customers who are accustomed to similar levels of quality and service which i also understand the peer group that the shelbourne projects would also confirm this as an original review being posted post our stay and not crowd good location without doubt and a grand history the irish constitution indeed drafted at the shelbourne and there is small one room museum to its history next to the reception area can not recommend enough the excellent afternoon tea though with hourly seating and in high demand staff on the ground floor are quite polite and helpful the demerits and there are a few room sizes are really small the queen rooms are tiny there is basically one to feet of space to move around the bed which barely could fit my frame at feet bathrooms are the size of an aircraft toilet with a cubicle attached window on floor looks into the adjoining s room window degree angle and while lying down our bed we could see the bed in the other room in effect ensuring there is no privacy for us or frankly for the other chaps in the other room we had made the booking through and,0.0
i stayed at stauntons on the green for a single overnight stop in dublin and the hotel was convenient for all of the things i to do before moving on the staff was very friendly and helpful and though the room was older it was clean and tidy breakfast was great only note is that there is no parking but there is a parking garage on the northwest side of the green that will give you a discounted rate for an stay with a stamp from the hotel on your parking ticket the location is convenient to a number of restaurants and pubs just east of stephen green and apart from stephen green itself it also possible to reach a number of sites of interest such as patrick cathedral from the hotel on foot overall good value for the room service and location right in downtown dublin,1.0
great modern hotel with central location the service here was impeccable for our whole day stay rooftop pool and bar were a great afternoon treat with views over barca large tidy rooms that ca be faulteddo forget to eat at catalana just around the corner,1.0

beautiful hotel modern rooms with air conditioning clean but cosy room with lovely canal view excellent position near the flower definitely stay there helpful and friendly staff,1.0
possibly one of the worst hotels i ever stayed at in my entire life i have been to motels in thirds world countries that are painted better than this there is about one advantage of staying at this place the hotel is within walking distance of shopping centers a few good restaurants and public transportation now let me tell you everything that was wrong with this hotel during my stay in roon the sink would not drain properly we brought our baby with us and it was incredibly tough to wash bottles in the sink when the water wo drain pictures attached the shower space has mold all over the place pictures attached no clock safe or iron available in the room is extremely small but rates are comparable to other better hotels the hotel staff are all nice but tend to either give you bad information or information that contradicts other staff members more on this later there are two phones in the room which makes no sense because the room is extremely small and does need some hotel staff may tend to argue with you about the quality of the hotel more on this later the ac is as powerful as you expect it to being a marriott gold member means absolutely nothing supposedly there are no upgrades for rooms at this hotel more to come on this later every time i asked for a better room i got one of there are no upgrades available right all,0.0
great location and service all staff were friendly and helpful with booking tickets for aquarium and football stadium the pool on the roof with the small bar was also very nice after a long day walking in barcelona,1.0

i stayed here with my girlfriend for nights in july it is a beautiful hotel with very friendly staff willing to help you with anything the tram to the main city stops right outside the hotel also the restaurant service is slow however we were told they were very busy even though they had tables the hotel does sell alcohol which was a problem for us but might be to other people i would strongly recommend this hotel for couples and people looking for a quiet break,1.0
chick was fast and chick in staff were lovely to deal with and it was a room with view of looing dublin city the food was the very good the breakfast was lovely and the chef and the hot food counter and the staff great to talk to the bar staff were love to deal with and hotel had high stander star serves located in huston train station and the tram red line and the city centre,1.0
a surprising find in the attractive area of plaka the room was plain and a bit disappointing on entry however everything else more than compensated super friendly greeting on arrival plenty of helpful information terrific breakfast and the very enjoyable four hour happy hour buy one get one free at reasonable prices easy walking distance to ancient attractions a handy super market at the end of the street there are plenty of places to eat in the plaka and we particularly enjoyed the gyros at the takeaway directly opposite our street this hotel could make itself even better by paying attention to a few easy to fix details in the room for example having two coffee mugs when two people are staying instructions on using the safe ensuring the tv is tuned and working and extra pillows in the room these were quickly fixed when raised but i feel i should not have had to ask,1.0
we stayed for night here in july and it was great the staff were super friendly and nice all of the staff spoke english it has air conditioning and a pool on the rooftop if you want to stay in central barcelona i recommend it,1.0
contrary to some of the reviews the desk had someone ready to assist hours a day the hotel is partially automated but anyone can get help if stuck the room was big with lots of toiletries i found the desk extremely friendly the breakfast was big but at euro not sure the hotel had parking which was a huge bonus the tram stops at the door taking you close to the centrum the only drawback you ca walk to the centrum it a bit far,1.0
very friendly and informative reception with clean and comfortable rooms happy to accommodate our request for two rooms close together ideally situated for tourist attractions and restaurants and shops,1.0
unfortunately we can not recommend a stay at the renaissance barcelona hotel our room had an incredible smell to it it seemed to get worse as the night went on since we were not staying but one night and had quite a bit of luggage in tow we chose to deal with it rather than requesting a change of room the trash from the previous guest was never emptied and what appeared to be the water pipes woke us multiple times throughout the night the overall appearance of the hotel is very beautiful and the front desk staff very kind however our overall room experience left us looking for a different hotel for our next stay in barcelona,0.0
overall a good experience location is great and the concierge was very helpful and recommended excellent restaurants the first drawback was they put us in room and it was very noisy it was as if the window was wide open even thought it were closed it was a very active party weekend in the city so there was no way to sleep with the noise we requested another room which they provided with no question i feel from their response that they know these are a noisy block of rooms and they anticipated the room change request also we had drinks in the bar a few evenings and the services was slow no refill requests from the waiter and we had to hunt him down to pay the bill but generally a good hotel and we wold stay there again,1.0
absolutely perfect ideal location short walk to lots of major attractions and beautiful beaches rooms are immaculate staff could be any more helpful friendly and welcoming and breakfast was delicious with a vast array of sweet and savoury food on offer rooms were as i mentioned beautiful and clean as well as very secure and noise proof would definitely stay again and recommend ca quite remember the names of the men at the desk but a massive thank you to you both for making the experience in your hotel amazing,1.0

wonderful hotel perfectly situated in the heart of the action walking distance to all that is great clean and light rooms delightful and attentive service particular kudos to monica who was of great assistance to us ca recommend this hotel enough,1.0
this hotel lives up to its brand name the service is always pleasant the breakfast is great and the rooftop bar has a fabulous view all this is to be expected from a star establishment however if you do get a refurbished room the decoration is passable the pool is too small the drinks are expensive in the bar a mojito nice little shop straight on and on corner right for cheap local food go to vassilis right and follow signs,1.0
i have nothing to compare with in spain however if i judge this hotel in comparison to star hotels in usa than it is very good hotel ladies at the reception desk were friendly to me and kindly provided any help i needed printing tickets that i ordered online or even helping order the tickets or some other stuff the rooms are clean and have most of the thing one need they supply toothbrush toothpaste shampoo bathgel soap disposable razor blades shaving cream comb shower cap and more the breakfast is quite reach the hotel have restaurant inside with bar however i never seen someone using it the parking place at the hotel is very small about parking places only the parking is very narrow quite hard to park it cost extra and you need to specify that you will need it however since the hotel located in the center there is a big parking place and more expensive available nearby a lot of restaurants close to the place supermarkets across the street inside a room small frig available so after i told you about my personal experience it is up to you to decide,1.0
we stayed here overnight the end of july on our way to mykonos was very pleased on arrival lovely lobby area i was disappointed with the pool area while it was clean there was a complete lack of sun beds it was disappointing after a long journey to have to lie on the ground on a towel particularly as there was lots of room to have more sunbeds dinner that night was delicious and we ate it in the rooftop restaurant over looking the staff were good and friendly however there was a particular waitress who was very rude at breakfast the morning which was disappointing after the experiences we had previously the rooms very clean they had mini bars but not a star room very dated overall this is a nice clean hotel in a good location but i would rate as a star not star,1.0
very high building noise starting on am during work days no air conditioner no advice about this until arriving at hotel good breakfast except fruit juices which taste very sour awful experience overall,0.0
this hotel is so central situated in dam square on arrival you are met by well dressed doorman then extremely well mannered reception staff check in was quick and easy small issue with being deducted from our credit card with no explanation when we questioned this reception apologised for not informing is it was for any incidentals rooms are located via numerous elevators our room was located on the floor via elevator lobby is dimly lit which possibly hides a multitude of issues one we noticed was carpet was quite worn and could cause someone an room itself has brown flooring and white cubed furniture massive bed which was really comfortable however the pillows were way too softbathroom was a glass cube style with everything you required during your stay toiletries were replenished every day we are both in our late but getting in and out of the shower was quite hazardous bath tub is really high no hand rails for getting in and out something the hotel should look at for elderly visitors we did eat in the hotel during our stay but had some drinks in the lobby bar it was well priced overall we had a brilliant stay here and would most definitely go back if visiting amsterdam again,1.0
this hotel is well deserved of its high regard by travelers we spent two days at the casa mimosa to celebrate a very special birthday and thoroughly enjoyed every the moment we registered to the moment we checked out the staff were super pleasant and we mean everyone from maintenance staff to reception bars and catering noah greeted us on arrival with a choice of complementary drinks and proved very helpful in explaining the layout of the city and the hop on hop off others have reported this hotel was super clean with lovely bedrooms and huge bathrooms with and hers sinks and showers the rooms are equipped with coffee maker hair dryer shampoos conditioner emergency shaving kits and large clean towels there was also complementary water and a couple of bottles of our stay the atmosphere of the hotel was very relaxed on a summers evening we would highly recommend relaxing on the roof terrace with a drink in hand watching the stars come out as the night falls if you do want to eat in there are many many restaurants serving all sorts of dishes within easy walking mentioned on checking in that it was a very special birthday visit for my wife which was why we were in barcelona late afternoon on the day the hotel delivered a complementary bottle of champagne small cake and card absolutely amazing thankyou to all the team at the casa service did stop there on our last day we were due,1.0
the location was good for what we needed on the nightfirst impression is good but the let down is when we got to the room room key was working bathroom was run down and shabby as was the bedroom definitely needs to be proof windows great for outside noise but noise in hotel due to krystle nightclub went on till about even though are provided not much well the scrambled eggs were just terrible hash brown over done as were the sausages croissants were also overcooked brown and dryon handing back the breakfast to the waitress she even commented on the eggs and reported the returned breakfast to the chef who sent her back into the kitchen with the plate last we heard or seen of the food no apologise or asked if we would like anything else the breakfast chef serving the hot food spent the majority of his time on his mobile phone,0.0
hilton athens is really the best hotel in town and also has the best rooftopbar as well the hotel itself is really big and so you have a wide range of possibilities to pamper yourself and outdoorpool fitnessroom unfortunately just one bicycle that should be fixable executive lounge with a amazing view and as well an amazing service and hospitality i had the king olive suite and have not regretted it at all the whole suite has a really good atmosphere a private i would say hilton budapest could learn right here how to arrange a suite you feel perfectly welcome also my question after one more lamp was fulfilled within one hour without any problem the guide who was recommended from the executive lounge guest service was euro a hour and it fitted perfect for three hours for the akropolis and the museum i would recommend to not meet in the hotel you should meet with the guide at the container where the group and guide tickets are sold so you will have more time with the guide also the breakfast is really hilton like there is everything you are expecting the whole crew is friendly and is very helpful the only disappointing thing was with the outdoorpool as you only get one big towel which you lay on the sunbed asking for one mor even a smaller one which is handed out for fitness was denied which is not star hotel class at all but i strongly recommend,1.0
we spent days in dublin and loved the harding hotel for the location and helpful staff walking distance to many of dublin tourist attractions room was clean and a good size but wish the lighting was better also we found we had to unplug the tv so that we could charge our phones and ipad we always bring an extension cord so that helped with putting our phones on the nightstands enjoyed the irish music food and entertainment at the darkey kelly pub located in the hotel oscars cafe bar christchurch is a good breakfast place around the corner on fishamble street overall we enjoyed our stay,1.0
a surprise night mid week stay for my husbands significant birthday so i booked this hotel based on its reviews position and general description and was hoping for a bit of decadent luxury in great location got it la rambla is bustling at any time of day or night but step through the doors of the hotel and you enter a large luxurious open lobby with sofas and decor reminiscent of old colonialism in a good way it reflects the building heritage as an old tobacco company staff were very welcoming professional and helpful both at check in and out and for advice on good places to eat and city transport our room on the floor was a classic room and therefore not huge but plenty big enough and decorated in a cool and relaxing style the bed was huuge and i have to say having not been sleeping well of late i had the best nights sleep in a long time i took advice of other reviews and asked for a quiet room which means it faces away from the noise of la rambla the only slight gripe i have is that we seemed to be directly under one of the roof top bar speakers and whilst the music was by no means loud and did at all affect our nights by the time we went to bed it was off the rather monotonous and repetitive music choice did intrude on my siesta yep us over like an afternoon,1.0
spent one night here before heading home friendly staff comfortable and spacious room great toiletries good shower gym could be better love the location close to plaza de cataluña which means easy airport transport i would definitely stay here again,1.0
we was here last year and it was amazing but this year we are shocked from the room services its really bad sheets not changed cups not changed or cleaned and we complained the first day but nothing happened the second days we found everything the same so we decided to move to another than this the hotel was good,0.0
great hotel brilliant location in the heart of the gothic quarter only a short walk to la ramblas and the port and all the lovely little side streets the staff are exceptionally helpful people and great to chat to the food is also great we had the breakfast buffet and they put on an afternoon tea spread free for guests at he bar i would recommend this place and will definitely return next time i in barcelona,1.0
the hotel was clean and comfortable the rooms nicely furnished the bathroom had a nice large shower the gym had great treadmills ellipticals and bikes also weights balls and water and towels the gym also has a nice view of the staff was not competent at the front desk and did not know the answers to the questions we had as we was delicious along with dinner the lighting system was terrible you have to use a key card and it makes going to the bathroom in the night a challenge we had a beautiful view this hotel is close but away from city centre,1.0
this hotel is truly located almost dead center in old amsterdam a minute walk to the anne frank museum minute walk to the rijksmuseum the breakfast buffet is one of the best i have dined in the omelettes superb the staff was the best it could be the concierges were very friendly and quite helpful the receptionists were also very friendly pleasant and smiles smiles from all the staff really help my thanks to the morning staff in the bridges restaurant for starting my day off right,1.0
we were on a girls day trip in amsterdam this hotel is very close to the main centraal station where you can get a train direct from the airport in minutes hugely convenient if you do have long in the city this is also one of the main tram stops so you can access the tram and metro network in mins walk from the hilton is a chain corporate so do expect boutique charm but do expect great buffet breakfast clean relatively spacious rooms modern bathroom good quality toiletries and efficient fast service in all areas plenty of staff on hand to help with concierge type queries buying tram day tickets at the hotel etc all in all a perfect place if you want to explore this city and have a comfortable efficient hotel to return to oh and yes one hidden gem it has one of the best roof top bars in the whole city on the floor excellent cocktails for a late night,1.0
a lot has been said about this hotel so i will keep it short the definite pros are location walking distance to acropolis and all museums roof terrace with spectacular views on the city and acropolis best for a sundown reasonably large rooms with very comfortable beds and a nice classic decoration now the not so good service is just okay especially the front desk the doorman was the most helpful the rooftop restaurant is overpriced and over busy with good but far from great the comfort is slightly outdated quite noisy air con high speed wifi is not free although the basic free wifi was actually enough for our needs overall i was expecting more from this legendary hotel,1.0
really nice place near the grand canal welcoming staff team and good dinner my room was nice and quiet but odd as it had beds nice breakfast also would recommend good for business or leisure did get chance to try the gym,1.0
we spent a in this hotel which is very convenient as many things are in walking welcome from the staff and a very good level for the rooms cleaned and nicely prepared the best thing is to enjoy a dinner at the rooftop enjoying the night view to the acropolis and its monuments food are excellent as sure you get a room with a view on the inner court you will have absolute silence the ac in our room was too efficient as it could not be regulated so i had to ask for extra blankets knowing it was outside,1.0
we have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the last few years this ranks with the best of them the positives clean property and room friendly and accommodating staff minute walk to tram to center city walking distance to restaurants about mile large rooms great water pressure in sink and shower good linens the best wifi you ever find in a hotel quick elevators great breakfast on floor with fantastic views of amsterdam on site restaurants on floor though we only ate at the bistro and not the pricey restaurant only negative room lighting is cave like which you wo discover until the sun goes down they really need to add some significant room light is no good at night bottom you have a great night sleep and avoid the masses in center center,1.0
this was our second year we stayed at the okura and we were not disappointed the hotel is impeccable the lobby is beautifully decorated in a subtle asian influence we stayed in the executive level and had the most amazing canal view room and had no problem drinking the good wines and japanese beers from the lounge after our long walks through the city and my crazy fun shopping escapades the hotel is located in a great location that has a lot of along with amazing bars and restaurants they have a really nice and modern gym along with very knowledgeable trainers we really enjoyed adinia this gal was beyond fit and great to chat with we can not wait to go back one to stay at the okura and of course to visit my dutch family the highlight of our return trip was meeting up with michael who works in guest service man is the absolute best he has the best restaurant recommendations and knowledge of the area we will miss him,1.0
this was a really great location it is only a block away from the airlink dropoff and pick up point and perfect for taking the public transportation we had the top floor quad room and were really surprised that we got free bottled waters sparkling and non and a whole bunch of flavored walker shortbread cookies i did not know that they even came in other flavors kitkats and some killer hot chocolate sean at the front desk was super nice and showed me where the sites are on the map and was patient with me when i realized i did need the breakfast on all of the days of our stay the breakfast was really good though i was able to sleep very well as we were far enough away from the madness of temple bar the bells of christchurch were really awesome too my only gripe is no ac so we opened the windows,1.0
stayed at the skylon for the coldplay concert last month my only gripe with the hotel was the price it obviously costed to the fact its within walking distance of croke park over for two nights and didnt include breakfast at this price we had a king room which was considerably smaller than it looked on the photo the room was clean very warm though fan provided and the usual facilities i will echo other comments in that the staff were extremely nice all dressed up in their coldplay tshirts and really welcoming if you are travelling from the airport i would get the bus from outside the airport and it drops you over the road from the hotel and same going back make sure you have the busfare in coins as the driver can not give change euros each way you can also get the same bus into dublin city takes around mins for the same priceyou do a great cocktail too recommend the bramble,1.0
we stayed at the hotel for nights two weeks ago the hotel is very nice the public areas are well maintained and the staff is very helpful breakfast was very good the room was nice and clean but the bathroom was not very clean and needs some improvements i have to say that we did complain i guess that if we did talk to someonethey would have done something about hotel is not really in the city center if you are a tourist to get to the main attractions you need a taxi or a train,1.0
i was here on a three nights sightseeing trip with my teenage son who had requested a comfy quiet room and good breakfast as mother and son we also wanted twin beds clontarf delivered on all points the room was not super large but large enough with a sitting nook comfy high twin beds that were cm wide lovely locally made toiletries and facility european and american power sockets were a nice touch the room was also very quiet breakfast was fresh much of it was and it was beautifully served in one of the castle characterful rooms travelling to and from the city did take some time around min walk to and around min transport time to connolly station leaving every minutes or so this was not a problem for us who did not mind walking and had bought leap transportation cards as one tour guide said there is no place in dublin that not noisy and clontarf was our quiet oasis after intense city strolls staff was lovely and very helpful but often busy this is a place where you carry your suitcase yourself i personally found the decoration of the hotel a bit kitsch but my teenager loved it,1.0
we stayed for a night break july in the gresham is centrally located comfortable peaceful in the middle of everything you out the door all kinds of services are on this is so easy good atmosphere staff at front desk are helpful courteous the ridiculous price of hotel accommodation in dublin this was not too expensive i would need a really good reason to visit dublin and need to stay overnight though to pay these prices,1.0
customer service is amazing and location is perfect this is the place i always stay in usiness or pleasure stays i recommend it to any and all going to amsterdam the check in experience is made so great because when i walk into the hotel they know my name thank you ruby,1.0
unique combination of a very convenient location and yet an oasis of calm on the passeig de gràcia a bit like the original mandarin hotel in hk the other great thing about the barça mo is the superb front staff porters receptionists concierges friendly courteous public spaces especially the restaurants are elegant and chic in an understated way otherwise the rooms tend to be on the small side with a décor more like a cute but not classy than a premier palazzo no nespresso machine or even a kettle with coffee or tea bags for that matter poor fruit selection slow and weak wifi guests used to mo in asia will be surprised at the absence of a hot teapot brought to your room upon or the underwhelming breakfast buffet probably or of the diverse food offerings in asia quality wise f b is good especially at the signature star moments see separate review beautiful pool which only opens at am tiny gym with modern equipment though in other words a offering at a pricing,1.0
the rooms were excellent the beds were comfortable and huge and there are black out curtains which is perfect if you want a deep sleep they also had a coffee machine in the room the only negative was that our coffee pods were replaced one day with all decaf the hotel is a little bit out of the city but with the metro right at the door it is perfect if you want to go into the city it takes around mins to walk into the city but it really is a beautiful walk and would definitely recommend it,1.0
all great clean and tidy and helpful staff breakfast goodtube not far away for park guell in particular can walk to sagrada familia in about mins and into la ramblas definitely recommend hotel area is great and quirky and out of major tourist traps,1.0
very nice hotel great location unbelievable view from the rooftop to the achropolis and zeus ruis pretty good quality the restaurant the rooftop is worth every second of the stay do not miss it,1.0
this hotel has an awesome view of the city it is clean and safe the location is only a minute walk to the city centre you should buy a i amsterdam city card for transportation and discounts take the tram to movenpick,1.0
the night stay was very enjoyable without exception the staff were friendly and accommodating special mention to maria and renata at the terrific coffee shop for going out of their way to obtain the perfect coffee for my elderly mother and making a big fuss of my daughter please can we have more of your gorgeous cakes on display to choose from next year rooms were of excellent standard and cleanliness would it be possible to include hot chocolate and biscuits with the beverages ca forget to mention the fabulous breakfast the choice and quality were probably up there with anywhere else on offer in the city the hotel is situated in a lovely area of dublin and was close to all the major travel routes shall be back soon x,1.0
we stayed at this fantastic hotel as part of our anniversary vacation and were extremely satisfied with the front desk staff greeted spoke excellent english and made check in an absolute pleasure they assisted with our questions about the hotel and my wife needed to see an emergency dentist which one of the reception staff even arranged for us i sorry i do recall his name but all the staff were had a balcony room that looked out over the side street below it was fun to do some people watching from the balcony and this even helped with our restaurant selection as we could see the popular places below and chose a few places to eat at just from this room itself was large for european hotels with a really comfortable bed and all the things i choose hotels for strong safe bar fridge kettle and in the room and a hairdryer for my wife the room was pristinely clean and the bathroom was kitted with quality and vanity kit we chose to have breakfast at small restaurants nearby the hotel every morning as there are many and all of them offered a variety of breakfasts that said i sure the hotel breakfasts are probably superior also had some drinks at the rooftop bar a few times and that was awesome to enjoy the views and relaxing hotel is by the busy las ramblas and placa de catalunya so very central and walking distance to all the interesting areas,1.0
we experienced an exceptional high standard of customer care the rooms were clean and have good quality furniture beds mattresses and on suit facilities although the four of us were only staying for a concert we were attending we felt that the hotel worked well for both short brakes and business functions,1.0
booked this hotel for a long weekend to dublin it was an easy stroll to grafton street and street it was the staff that made this hotel we arrived at and daniel on reception did a bit of shuffling and gave us a room straight away the same for the couple in front not many hotels do this this was a real bonus as we could get in immediately no hanging around and storing bags nice comfy lounge good self service breakfast with delicious yoghurts nice pub opposite called the ginger man just round corner from national gallery too,1.0
booked a one bedroom apartment but was upgraded to a very pleasant surprise the apartment was huge and we could believe we were in the middle of barcelona central location very clean and i did think the furniture was old at all the welcome were also a nice touch to help us feel welcomed the kitchen was spacious and easy to use and we cooked on a sunday when a lot of restaurants were closed glad we had laundry as we got drenched one afternoon in a sudden down pour we had breakfast one day at the hotel part one morning and enjoyed that as well,1.0
the hotel is about minutes out of amsterdam but it is located at a major transport hub so it is very easy to get both from the airport and to the city from if you arrive by air get a multi day transport ticket there appeared to a be limited number of restaurants nearby,1.0
very comfortable hotel with all amenities food in restaurant and breakfasts excellent reception staff polite and knowledgeable particularly about local transport pool very clean and quiet stops on metro into barcelona or a bus stops outside hotel big enough to accommodate groups without affecting couples and families,1.0
we have been around and this is the most distinctive and charming hotel till date it has so much character but that never overwhelms reception staff is super friendly breakfast setting is so cosy and homely rooms are tiny not annoyingly tiny but romantic and cute tiny bus stop is right downstairs royal palace is a minute delightful stroll fun size bathroom is the only bother but you knew that so if you are healthy enough for some stairs and got heart for some romance then must stay here,1.0
we enjoyed our stay at hotel continental barcelona the staff were all very friendly and helpful the hour and drinks were a plus the rooms were a little outdated and could use some upgrades the beds were very comfortable we had two rooms with balcony overlooking all of the activity of las ramblas but we were not bothered by any noise great location would definitely stay here again and highly recommend,1.0
stayed at casa fuster a couple of nights last week with my wife on the recommendation of our catalan friend the hotel is right in the centre of the city and has that real old world feel the staff were all excellent friendly and helpful room was plush with all the amenities lovely bathroom massive bed and luxe atmosphere the hotel is decorated in dark tones which is not my cup of tea as i prefer a brighter and more sunny vibe but that is just personal preference there was a water pressure issue for a few hours and no one could use their bathrooms but that was not the fault of the hotel apparently as it had something to do with the water utility service all in all a good hotel and a nice intro to the city of barcelona,1.0
this hotel was a great find the location was priceless walking distance to the metro station at which all trains stop coffee in the morning was perfect at the coffee place downstairs the room was comfortable and spacious enough for adults overall very clean and felt safe,1.0
we chose this hotel for its central location and the reasonable rates the staff welcomed us very friendly and helpful the room was sized ok and was clean enough it had a window to one of the smaller streets noise was an issue they offer parking for next door mall parking which is very everything was in walking distance from here,1.0
hotel estherea is a great hotel the location is perfect right on the singel canal and close to all the attractions markets the old fashion room keys with tassel classy the breakfast buffet was delicious we had it every morning the staff was so courteous and helpful with information about amsterdam i highly recommend hotel estherea for the perfect classic hotel,1.0
lovely rooms supplied with fresh toiletries every day close to many restaurants and bars clean and nice breakfasts wifi was good enough for me to use my laptop whilst here on business rooms are a bit hot and can be noisy when windows open but overall excellent,1.0

came across this hotel as we were on the way to temple bar we never got to temple bar fantastic night of live music it was a rock band the night we visited and it was so much fun great atmosphere and everyone singing and dancing mixed ages but more our age than full of youngsters food was available but we did eat drinks were cheaper than temple bar which means a lot on a night out in dublin it was about euros for a pint of guinness and a vodka and coke which was cheap after the band there was a dj with more dancing we left around and felt like we had had a fantastic night out great find would return,1.0
having visited amsterdam many times and visiting this area previously we opted to stay here and were not hotel was clean our queen superior room spacious and the bathroom modern and well appointed we encountered no disturbance from our neighbours or nearby venues we stayed monday to friday the view of the river was stunning and were were able to watch the river traffic going to and fro it was very were excellent with a wide variety of hot and cold choices eggs bacon etc meats cheeses and breads cereals and fresh fruits daily fresh pastries the coffee was also very the staff we encountered were courteous and hotel is relatively small and has a good we are spring chickens we took advantage of the nearby venues such as pllek noorderlicht and loetje and enjoyed them all we felt that we had a true amsterdam experience in that we were away from the main tourist areas the ndsm wharf is being regenerated and the hotel is right next to the old slipway the nearby ndsm boat works is now home to many local businesses there even a hotel in one of the old dockyard to the hotel is a problem the free ferries run every half hour every minutes at peak times and the journey takes ten minutes this gives you an opportunity to watch the yachts and boats sailing up and down the ij and see the landmarks as you pass by the hotel will give you a would,1.0
the hotel is beautiful we had a two room connecting family suite and it was perfect for the four of us the bakery is amazing and always so nice to walk into breakfast was included and it was wonderful the location was away from the touristy areas but easy to walk everywhere,1.0
we had a very nice night stay earlier this month and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel the staff were helpful the subway stop was metres away and there were restaurants nearby if you did feel like making a track to somewhere new there was a minor error with the time that we wanted our room cleaned by but they made it up to us with a very nice note and a bottle of champagne very attentive and very concerned about their image of course the hotel was clean modern and the pool area was a great place to go after a long hot day trekking around barcelona my only complaint is one that is common in european hotels there just needs to be more places to plug equipment in today people travel with so many pieces of equipment that need to be recharged at the end of the day and with only one or two available receptacles and given the inconvenient european electrical receptacle design it just hard to get everything recharged for the next day for any traveler i suggest that you take a american plug to plug into your european receptacle converter this is not really a criticism of the hotel as this place was great,1.0
arts no longer wows like it did when it opened it remains a very good hotel you can see the ritz carlton management prompt response to requests upgrades amenities rooms are spacious and functional very nice views,1.0
we stayed with family for nights back in oct hotel location is quite convenient only min by foot from main attractions in the quiet area if you are lucky to stay on top floors as we did you will have picturesque views of athens including even acropolis being leaders club members we were upgraded to suite on top floor with big living room nice separate bedroom and huge terrace overlooking athens we did have a king bed which however was not extremely comfortable other than this all the amenities you would expect form star hotel were in place wifi was free and of good quality breakfast was sumptuous while just ordinary good breakfast nothing exceptional we also did use the rooftop swimming which was nice with very interesting feature if you go outside and down floor you can see people swimming through several big window in the pool very nice touch views from rooftop pool are unbeatable you have panorama of whole athens service was at all times friendly and staff was always trying to be helpful all in all we did have very nice experience,1.0
excellent and modern hotel in the centre of barcelona and has the the amenities required and more the superior rooms are spacious and worth the extra cost shower is amazing my main complaints are that the air conditioning is set wayyyy too cold and the housekeeping stayed there for days and housekeeping were not on top of changing towels or the bed sheets or vacuuming had to request towels to be delivered regularly was a very poor experience in this regard compared to other hotels we have stayed in across europe house keeping needs to lift its performance,1.0
a comfortable hotel with good facilities clean and accommodating the area surrounding the hotel was alive with restaurants cafes shops transport and attractions the double bed was actually single beds put together and was a little hard the restaurant area had great views of the acropolis breakfast was ok,1.0
room was reasonable but not worth the and per night shoddy repair work throughout broken mirror covered up with piece of new mirror shower head moving in and out of the window could not be opened very much so the room was very could be best described as disorganised with large amount of tables left unclean after the previous park on arrival day there was plenty of space having returned day i was forced to park on street as the car park was full of match patrons as pay parking commences at i had to relocate my car the following morning at to the hotel car park which when checking out i discovered that they attempted to charge me for x car park stays at a cost of not a good example of a dublin hotel therefore i will chose a different hotel next time,0.0
arrived after midnight with my family and they welcomed us with a big hotel rooms are clean and tidy with a lot of breakfast with a huge variety and tasteful dinner on the floor with great acropolis view the personnel were very helpful professional and congrats to the managers are coming back next year,1.0
as americans who travel a lot there is not enough praise that i can render to communicate just how outstanding this hotel was from the initial curbside service to the quality rooms to the depth and knowledge of the concierge this was was the best we have experienced we took another couple with us who actually live in northern germany and they agreed that the service and food were the finest they had had i can not recommend this hotel enough for the discriminating traveler,1.0
i was looking for a cheap weekend break to see the sights of dublin this hotel is two minutes walk from street where you can catch the hop on hop off bus to tour the city i believe the airport bus is right outside the hotel mark and his colleagues are extremely helpful the breakfast was lovely and vegetarians can request mushrooms and tomatoes also eggs are available to be cooked to your liking we booked the irish night and a three course meal and this was all superb the entrance of the hotel and toilets are lovely however the bedrooms are a little dated and damaged but i do believe it is all down for refurbishment only used as a base and suited us perfect,1.0
we stayed in the hoxton amsterdam from july thru july the hotel is clean modern and comfortable the one caveat being that the cozy rooms are very small indeed we had requested a quiet room and early check in and got both the staff were extremely friendly and helpful a special thank you to william who was at the front desk early on a sunday morning when my wife became very ill and we needed advice on medical care he told us our options then at our request called a cab told the cabby where to take us and we were whisked off to a wonderful modern hospital where my wife received excellent care at a reasonable price later that evening hours later to be precise william was still on duty and noticed us dining in the hotel dining room he sent over complimentary drinks since as the waiter put it we had had a rough day then he came over to chat and asked us how we were doing service with a warm human touch thank you william the hotel restaurant and bar are great by the way with the bar known locally for its innovative cocktails the one thing to be aware of is that the cozy rooms are a tight fit for two people still this is central amsterdam right on one of the main canals within easy walking distance of dam square so you have to expect some all in all a wonderful hotel with outstanding,1.0

the hotel does not have its own parking garage but one can park safely in parking of the shopping mall the hotel is part of more cost effective is to park for free in the evenings in the streets surrounding the hotel not sure if there are many safety issues with that the gordal restaurant downstairs is rather upmarket spanish but there are also other dining opportunities in the neighbourhood breakfast is in a separate restaurant upstairs nice details are multi system power plugs and nespresso coffee maker,1.0

good quality accommodation in a very busy and noisy street ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you do want to be kept awake by boozy youngsters and very loud music in the hotel staff were very helpful even going to a lot of trouble to print our boarding passes for our flybe flight the day we checked out we did not eat breakfast in the hotel during our three night stay as it would have added to the cost of our short break there are plenty of places on temple bar to get a full breakfast for half the price or coffee and a croissant for just a few euros try centra a convenience a couple of hundred yards from the hotel where they sell excellent croissants for and a good cup of coffee for less than take away or eat got the bus from the airport to dame street a couple of minutes walk away from temple bar a briliant service which runs every or minutes and cost us each return,1.0

a wonderful hotel in barcelona located on the water being on the water it a minute cab ride to the ramblas but i personally prefer being on the water then on the ramblas it also next to night life the hotel is beautiful and service is excellent the concierge is great and will help with whatever you need rooms are classy refined with either city views ocean views or some corner rooms which have views of both i must single out bellhop david alster who was really great breakfast is excellent with a great selection only disappointments were pool though nice is small for a hotel of this size even though the hotel is on the beach it does not have its own private beach and a personal pet peeve was charged for one serving of ice cream with three scoops though i expect high prices at a hotel and they did adjust it at check out that was exorbitant i definitely recommend this hotel for anybody going to barcelona one last thing we checked out the w hotel while there as we were curious as we debated staying there and we definitely recommend hotel arts over the w hotel the w hotel though nice is more of a party hotel and you can go there to party when you want no need to stay there just for that the hotel arts just deliveres on everything,1.0
at the athens gate hotel from the moment you enter the building you are greeted and helped right away staff is extremely nice there is wifi within the building and can be sketchy at times but if you in the lobby it works perfectly fine the lobby is pretty huge as there are multiple sofas also has a tv fireplace computers a bar which is a very comfortable setting free breakfast in the morning there is no pool in this specific hotel however they do have a sister hotel nearby about minutes away walking and you will have access to that pool the views are second to none as you can see the temple of zeus across the street and the acropolis from the top floor amazing hotel,1.0
ok for one night as a stop over or for an early flight as it nearby airport but would recommend as a base for visiting dublin they have shut the restaurant so no food available no bar either there was a chinese over the road that was good there was a bar next door but looked a bit rough to me like the whole of the ballymun area i would walk round here after in dublin are expensive in summer so if you end up here it better than no room at all but if you are on holiday and are visiting dublin this would be the last hotel you would want to book ballymun although supposedly being regenerated it still the same old dump it was would recommend this hotel for families or couples the hotel itself is ok but the area lets it down and it no where near dublin,0.0
we stayed for nights in late july and i was very happy with our choice rooms are a decent size for what you pay and our bathroom was big by european standards very clean and the location of the hotel is in a great area a little bit away from the dense tourist spots though not too far away tons of great restaurants on adjacent streets as well also there a very small terrace on the roof that we did discover until the last night which was my fault because it was mentioned in the hotel welcome book in our room i recommend this hotel to family and friends,1.0

we stayed one night here mainly for proximity to syntagma square and the metro to the airport the location is indeed excellent we were pleasantly surprised by the room quality everything is very good but was let down a little by noise from buskers and even passers by on the busy and even more disconcertingly from neighbouring rooms if they could deal with that this place would get a particularly for value for money,1.0

just back from a stay at the wittmore overall a positive experience but just one or two issues that stop it being fabulous this hotel is really stylish and exudes exclusivity starting with the discreet entrance the staff are very attentive and extremely pleasant you do feel they would do anything for you small touches like bottles of water etc are appreciated our arrival was marred however by the receptionist insisting we had booked a tiny room despite my confirmation clearly stating we had booked a large double room she was happy to give us a large room but at a cost stating that the double room stated on our confirmation actually meant large double bed anyway the manager pilar arrived and dealt with it immediately and professionally ensuring we had the room we booked this exchange lasted only a short time but the wittmore must know first impressions are crucial and having to debate about what you have booked is ideal the rooms are smaller than other hotels i have stayed at but that is well documented on the website so should be a surprise they are also extremely well appointed and the toiletries are fabulous however there is no full length mirror or if there is i could find it which brings me to the other downside this hotel is dark really dark and while i get it is all about the ambience it becomes rather annoying we had trouble unlocking our door it was so dark lets,1.0

we were in amsterdam for a few nights and ended up staying at the hotel casa location it is about a minute walk from the amstelstation which is a decent hub or the metro lines stop hear and it is only about stops to central station and stops for other city center locations the sprinter and intercity trains also stop at this station in addition there are casa signs almost the whole way from the station to the hotel so you know which way to the hotel is clean with a big lobby the lobby also has tables set up where you can sit with your laptop and work and many people were doing so this hotel has a young vibe about it with what seemed to be a younger type crowd staying there it also has a great coffee bar in the lobby as well as a breakfast buffet wine bar and floor rooftop terrace however these all close at around pm and there is nothing really close by so if you want a late night plan on being out in the city at check in the staff was very the view in our room was not great we were overlooking the other side of the hotel so we basically looked at a building for days also if you on the side you can see into the rooms across the way so keep that in mind had i known this i would have asked for a different view or,1.0

i seldom post an unfavourable review preferring to deal directly with the restaurant or hotel reference saturday we had occasion to overnight in dublin checked my favourite websites and for last minute price and location hotel seemed to fit the bill central and at very cheap indeed for dublin in july arrival our reservation made and paid for a few hours earlier was confirmed but we were asked for euros cash as a deposit for any room damage well travelled at years of age we were astonished at this request indicating that we were reluctant to stay at an establishment where the guests obviously trashed or ransacked the were advised that it was unusual for the charge to be levied but it was the managers idea and the reception staff could not get the policy were however advised that had we used an alternative website to book there would have been no charge which mystified us were given vouchers for a free drink at the bar at at check inwhen we looked at them later they expired at the room was adequate but when i dropped an earring on the bathroom floor i gave up the search early on as the discovery of a less than clean floor left me feeling a little illthe final insult came at checkout when we were advised that there was a chargeof two euros per bag if we wishedtoleave our small overnight bag with them for a few hours we felt sorry for all,0.0
the location is perfect very close to rijksmuseum and van gogh museum tram stop is nearby the room was rather small but quite adequate and clean tea coffee making facilities in the room comfortable beds you can have a good copious breakfast though with several days stay you find the food range a bit narrow this was our third stay at the hotel and if we visit amsterdam again we will definitely choose this place once more,1.0
very good hotel with friendly and professional stuff always ready to help rooms are very clean and peaceful with excellent view at the park the restaurant and pubs offer are great in the neighbourhood,1.0
everything about this hotel is just lovely great staff great location food and the room defiantly worth upgrading to a canal view it really sets the amsterdam mood love the breakfast bags in the mornings and the bar makes the best cocktails especially their old fashion it our second stay and definitely not our last,1.0
after getting married abroad in december my husband and i held a party to celebrate at the trinity city can not recommend it enough this hotel is a gem it beautifully decorated with a fantastic garden at the centre that was perfect for a warm evening the staff are wonderful in particular mihaela for her amazingly calm organising and stephen for his attentiveness on the night the food was stunning and catered for all tastes and dietary requirements without both from dublin so the central location was perfect and allowed our guests to go out or get home easily after the party ended my husband and i stayed at the hotel that night assuming we would sleep after such an exciting night but the room was so peaceful and comfortable that we just passed out until our breakfast arrived the next living close to the trinity city hotel i will definitely find a reason to come back and stay,1.0
great location rooms at back clean cleaning staff seemed to take a genuine pride perhaps motivated by wall mural of cleaning staff air conditioning worked well shower was excellent breakfast was really good layout was great and variety of foods available serving staff were great attentive when needed but not in your face,1.0
located just outside downtown dublin these two converted town houses are a kind of b b with around rooms it is adjacent to a commercial street that has several good restaurants shopping and conveniences the service was excellent and the sitting room near the entrance and desk quite pleasant,1.0
fantastic friendly and helpful staff breakfast improved further since last time rooms very nice and good value area superb a few things to improve would be easier to use air condition another lift as waiting times can be high at times cooler bed linen for the summer as the bed feels a bit too hot in the hot season in my opinion,1.0
i initially just booked a day room here but ended up extending my stay over night just because i was so happy here there were some great deals for room service see the special staff were kind and very helpful tv in the room supports apple airplay and steaming from windows laptops which i found very useful will come again,1.0
very tired looking hotel which desperately needs some love first room offered was in the basement and was really noisy moved to the top and was still really noisey due to the seedy all night clubs over the road room walls were heavily stained and the room had an unpleasant musty odour like most hotels in dublin it is overpriced but if you going to pay over the odds you may as well pay a tenner more and go somewhere nice,0.0

lovely hotel great rooms and facilities breakfast was fantastic massive choice and good quality the staff are very very helpful recommending good restaurants and bars very nice roof terrace and plunge pool definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
great location friendly staff and very nice rooms stayed nights and enjoyed a great trip due to the central location and great access to the transit system nearby only complaints the first being that the room was far too hot when we first arrived and although the ac works it takes a day or two to really get the temperature down and keep it down second being the gym is a bit small and the available weights are anything challenging for a regular gym goer,1.0
i would like to complain about the terrible experience i experienced during my vacation at the athens i got to the hotel i went down to the swimming pool of the hotel the service was shocking and no waiter came to me and took me half an hour until i arrived for a drink and glasses of water outside the temperaturethe outside temperature was degreesthe drinking glasses that came after minutes from the time i ordered were hot and the waitress did not bring the water and said she was coming back to get it just gone and did not come back i felt i was going to faint and that did not come water i went up to the room with a strong headache and it ruined my night and night i had to take pills all to the hotel but no one did with you nothing just the next day i spoke with the manager did a favor thatin addition we did not clean the room for two days the room was filthy we stayed in the shower without towels and leftover food from the night before we had to get out of the shower and call the receptionist to bring us towelsthis is something that certainly can not be for a star hotel and at the hilton chain i am a member of the club at the highest level i have never had such a service such a terrible experience of cleanliness and carelei will never go,0.0
great spot if you are coming and going by train from amsterdam central staff are super friendly and room very clean not a big room or bathroom bud adequate if you are not going to spend a lot of time in the room,1.0
i stayed here for four nights over the period the hotel was very accessible from the airport via train on my arrival the staff were very friendly and just what i needed after my hour flight the room is small however i did spend much time in there anyway great shower pressure and temperature and the wifi was excellent there are not a lot of eateries in the immediate area however they are just a train tram or bus away would stay here again,1.0
this hotel is a stand out hotel there is always the question mark when making a reservation at a foreign hotel will it really be as good as expected based on the reviews well this property far exceeded our expectations just a beautiful property i could sit in the library for hours yes with that nice cognac one can get from the bar just super breakfasts and lunches and the staff so very helpful and kind and friendly but not with that forced fake pleasantries that one can experience at other properties we had a canal view room which was important to us so thank you for that british airlines had lost our luggage prior to us going on an ocean cruise and they failed to get it to us for a three day period we were in amsterdam before we started our cruise ambassade hotel which was where we were staying upon our return was so gracious in accepting the luggage from the airline even before we were scheduled to arrive nice touch it was already in our room when we arrived,1.0
i was in amsterdam for just one night for business the central peaceful location overlooking a canal was excellent and i was glad to be welcomed warmly and recognized as hilton gold member and the rooftop executive club was truly star and the rooms were certainly good enough nothing particularly stood out though i recommend this property for a business stay,1.0
after a not so great experience with go with oh we decided to book in here for a treat and spend the last night as a family group service was impressive from the get go and loved the interior of the hotel that was a luxurious escape from the city hustle loads of options to spend time lounging in and outdoors with two pools a small gym spa and sauna restaurant cafe and bars if you can manage to book a day bed on the roof the view with a cocktail in hand is a worthy one it simply magical to see the sun go down and the city light up the rooms were a little on the small side but the plush beds made up for it great to get a good night sleep the amenities in the room were also great and really appreciated the jug and tea selection in the room as well as bathrobes for lounging one confusion was that the staff opened our door to come in on more than one occasion without knocking which was a little intrusive it happened almost times during our night stay and not sure if this is the norm aside from that i would highly recommend this hotel especially if you want to give yourself a treat and spend it with loved ones barcelona might be beautiful but it also very busy and this was the perfect calm before and after the storm,1.0
this is a lovely hotel it is right on the beautiful herrengracht canal and is very convenient for the main sites in amsterdam our room was spacious very clean with a view of the canal the staff was very helpful getting us tickets to van gogh museum so we did not have to stand in line could not have been happier,1.0
safe to say this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in simple ok lobby but a rickety tiny elevator dirty in nooks and crannies tiny tv noisy and creepy hallways the worst part was a hole in the roof of one room looking directly up into some kind of dark and dusty storage area above this creeped us out so the entire family decided to sleep in one room good location though,0.0
i choose this hotel due to close access to train station but was pleasantly surprised to find it was close to all city transportation close to supermarket pharmacy restaurants and shopping center great area for working and eating outdoors,1.0
we stayed here for one night the hotel is nice and room was nice and clean including bathroom they offer rooms for ppl which was perfect for us it very central within walking distance are many restaurants the acropolis and direct bus service to airport that runs every and through the night price is also good with tasty breakfast included after it possible to leave luggage in a large locker downstairs for for as long as you like there air conditioning even though it on a busy street our room was quiet when we kept the window closed we were on floor go to the floor to admire a view to the acropolis would definitely go again next time,1.0
i stayed at this hotel everytime i traveled to greece it feels like home from the friendly staff that welcome you upon arrival to the cleaning staff that always say good morning and take time to ask how your day was you ca ask for anything more the rooms are very clean beautiful roof garden with a pool witch you can enjoy a nice meal a drink or a great always chose this hotel year after year because makes it feel like home thanks to this great staff for making our stay once again pleasant,1.0
i decided to spend my last week in athens in luxury and style probably the most affordable to someone like me of what i consider the holy trinity of luxury hotels in syntagma square i was so excited on my arrival i tipped the bellboy when he brought my luggage to my room what a room location location location and view view view wow a deluxe room on the floor i could see the changing of the guards in front of the greek parliament and the parthenon from my balcony big spacious and clean room with air conditioning that was a blessing every time i returned from the scorching athens heat comfortable bed crisp clean and fresh linen big bathroom with quality toiletries nice touch my room did not come with breakfast but i had the option to take breakfast for but i opted to walk across the road and for had a freshly squeezed orange juice and a spanakopita instead perfect yes this place expensive but as a treat to myself was well worth it it easily accessible with the metro and airport bus on walk i loved my stay,1.0
this hotel has great location just a walk from the famous temple bar rooms are cozy equipped with vintage furniture it also clean and there is complementary tea and coffee we suggest this hotel for a short stay in dublin,1.0
very presentable hotel with nice would suggest that the word in the name is misleading as the hotel is a minute tram ride in all a nice clean hotel we booked a couple of breakfasts when we first arrived but after the first we decided we be better off just grabbing a coffee from the in the reception area to be fair it was the first week of the school holidays which made breakfasting a tad manic,1.0
the hotel was clean excellent for americans in july this is a huge bonus beautiful pool great view from our room looking out on the magic fountain show at night location ca be beat metro right downstairs decor could be updated the room smelled a little like smoke and there were no outlets on the nightstands otherwise this is a great hotel,1.0
nice hotel in a good location rooms are basic but that all you need for a weekend away the breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice dublin itself is sooo expensive a round of drinks for was around,1.0
just left the burlington and felt i had to post this beautiful hotel and ca really fault it for comfort and appearance however we just spent the night in room and never slept a wink a domestic argument in room until the wee small hours put paid to that my partner was going to phone police it was that bad paper thin walls did help and we heard everything there was wall punching door slamming roaring shouting swearing what appeared to be slapping and lots of crying it was nothing short of a disgrace the management had already said the hotel was fully booked so no point i asking to change rooms it was before we got any sleep and only then because the female left i accept that this is no fault of the hotels but i paid for a bed to sleep and could it was cheap either i reported to the girl on check out who seemed wholly disinterested always liked the hotel but doubt i stay again going home completely wrecked after what was to be a comfortable hotel stay,0.0
loved this hotel for our first three nights in greece had a lovely room on the eighth floor of this classic hotel enjoyed the rooftop bar and restaurant several times and especially liked having breakfast there each morning with the amazing view of the acropolis also enjoyed the pool several times as a way to escape the heat of the afternoons would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
others recent reviews pretty much say it all i add that it not only next to the cruise terminal but adjacent to where the river cruise boats dock the room had lots of convenient electric outlets for cpap machines chargers etc the concierge spent quite a lot of friendly time with us pointing out sites on the central business district map and giving us tram advice,1.0
just returned from a three night stay hotel is situated in a area which makes it quite nice as it out of the busy tourist area still offers a lot around with great restaurants supermarkets and a market within min walk the metro in min walk and only stops from the main station the hotel itself is small but adequate staff are a real asset to the business on i discovered that my safe was not working and the receptionist on duty tried to fix it was unable to so called out the maintenance man who arrived an hour later to resolve the issue daily housekeeping was good cleaned the room thoroughly room had an air con which was definitely needed only let down was breakfast service was great and breakfast was neatly presented however the quality of ingredients was not that great which is a shame maybe we were spoiled by eating at one of the nearby bakeries two of the days but i think that this is one area that can be improved upon i would rather pay more charged at pp and have freshly squeezed juice better quality yoghurt etc having said all this it would not stop me staying again overall a great little hotel in a great area,1.0
fantastic hotel with very nice and artistic decor rooms are maintained very well neat and clean staff is friendly and helpful only problem is not having enough option in dinner for vegetarians still very much recommended for overall comfortable stay,1.0

this spanking new hotel was perfect for our one night stay in athens located in a central spot it in very close proximity to the plaka acropolis and tons of museums our classic room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom as went up to the rooftop our first night to lay by the loungers and were really impressed with the gorgeous view of the acropolis all lit up when we returned the next morning for breakfast it was an equally stunning seemed a bit understaffed but that was a problem since it is a buffet for the most part the selection is quite lovely with yogurt fruits meats eggs waffles pancakes and so much more we only needed a server for coffee and someone eventually came i was satisfied with our stay and would definitely recommend it as a base in athens,1.0
njv athens combines luxury with history in addition to great location in the middle of down town with walking distance to shopping and dining places rooms are clean and comfortable staff are helpful and friendly breakfast was yummy with variety to satisfy all tastes all in all it was a nice stay,1.0

hotels decor is modern and stylish the staff are friendly and prices are reasonable did realise the hotel had a nightclub on the ground floor so weekends are rather crazy i called it a night at but the party continues way past and your in the middle of it apart from the noise which can be blocked out by copious amounts of alcohol the hotel is awesome,1.0
a pretty good hotel with kind prices are pretty reasonable and the room is beautiful and well breakfast is various and highly recommended weather the trip was for leisure or only disadvantage is that the hotel is about half an hour from the center,1.0
for a city hotel you ca fault this location the tiny roof top pool is small and really welcome with a bar snacks and loungers no umbrellas maybe a hazard if it windy but ample shade good car parking but very expensive at per day the reception area and staff are very welcoming breakfast good and they even had gluten free bread negativeswe were in room very noisy from you could hear running children and even the lifts opening and closing we would return here when improvements are finished as sleeping areas need modernising,1.0
brooks for the quality of hotel is good value we were checked in speedily and the room was a good size and we were asked whether we wanted a quiet room this we did certainly get the room was very classical and well furnished the breakfast was excellent served by attentive and experienced staff in fact many of the staff were with long time service and knew their subject the concierge was full of good ideas and routes the restaurant staff at breakfast were always smiling the front desk were helpful but a little remote and spoke to you as children all other staff were excellent we used the residents lounge for our drinks and it was like a week designed library in a private club and very roomy and comfortable there is a cinema but we never found it except for the picture in the lift when we wanted a taxi the hotel always called friendly and knowledgable drivers we hired a car for our stay in ireland but quickly realised that taxis are better and cheaper the car park across the road was well situated and there is a waive of fee for the hotel but we could never find anyone on duty in the car park the car park is not run by the hotel we would certainly stay at brooks again all the attractions are very close by,1.0
my wife and i were booked for five days at this hotel because it was the conference venue for an event at which i was speaking we were also sponsors of this event well our visit was a farce from start to finish largely due to this incredibly inept we booked months in advance and were relegated to a tiny room on the outside of the sixth floor as we were on the outside perimeter of the building the walls were slanted just under the roof as such it was very difficult for two people to move around in this small room and we had to do this for five nights even worse the bed was simply too small for two people i measured it to under cm my wife and i were constantly pushing each other over the side during the night we asked to be moved but the hotel apparently had no other rooms curiously a colleague booked a room at a remarkably better rate about a month before the conference and had a spacious room on the third floor with a big bed and two chairs she arrived a day later than we did i had to send some documents to the united states and needed a fedex envelope the reception said there was no business center but i should talk to the concierge the concierge referred me to the business center one flight down the business center said the fedex envelopes could be obtained from the,0.0
we are just back from an amazing stay in the castle we had a brilliant time the hotel staff were excellent with us and the food was of the highest quality on the first night we ate in the knights bar and we well looked after and for our anniversary meal we booked the fahrenheit grill and it was outstanding this is one trip we will never forget highly recommended this castle,1.0
me and my partner stayed here in march for nights this hotel was a perfect location for exploring the city also being right next door to the train station it was very easy to find we payed a little extra for a river view room this was well worth it as the view from the room was beautiful the room was small and compact but the perfect for a base to sleep and explore the amazing city had an problem with the booking but the staff were very helpful and prompt to email back to resolve the issue location was the biggest plus for this hotel and therefore would definitely recommend would stay here if we return to amsterdam,1.0

for years i have stayed at the grand bretagne but now i am wondering why as rich in history as the grand bretagne is the hilton is just a much more comfortable place to stay from the clean modern guest rooms to the wonderful breakfast buffet to the rooftop with unparalleled sunset views it is hard to fault this hotel my only complaint comes with the pool which was absolutely packed we could not find a chair for ages but once we had a chair it was a lovely place to hang out will definitely go back,1.0
just returned from a two night stay at the rho hotel the location is excellent just off dam square and easy to get to from the central station you can walk to all the attractions from here and it close to the many restaurants amsterdam has to offer the staff were very helpful and breakfast was good too room was clean and quiet would definitely go back,1.0
impressed with the size of the room and the bed was very comfortable i and my partner both managed to get two consecutive good nights sleep however there were exposed plaster and curious large dark marks on one wall the window did not close properly because one handle was broken and just spun had to put the kettle on the floor to boil water because there were no power sockets located near enough to the beverage shower did not work properly and made a horrendous noise when we tried to switch it on we did manage to get water coming out of the side of the shower head and trickling out of the base but we gave up because the inside of the bath beneath the shower was peeling from the effects of being painted with vinyl paint and had a large rusty stain where one of the taps was constantly dripping see photos we decided that it was safer to resort to standing up washes over the badly neglected vanity wash basin see photos again in the bathroom the window was completely devoid of a handle and what is so surprising is that the lack of a fixing was so obvious to customers the bathroom door handle was broken and hanging off on both sides and the door itself well see more photos we were only in dublin for three days so we laughed all this off and decided that the most important thing was a good nights sleep,0.0
staff were very welcoming rooms were clean and larger than expected even though we were just on the edge of the city the room was quiet breakfast was excellent a great place to stay for a visit to dublin,1.0
perfectly placed for the city our room was spacious and clean and even though we were at the front of the hotel there was no noise at all so our sleep was never disturbed the bed was wonderful a very good size and probably the most comfortable bed we ever slept in when away from home staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome would recommend this hotel without any hesitation,1.0

having lived in ireland previously i wanted to stay at this iconic hotel when i visited with my son we stayed in the renovated front part of the hotel and the rooms were lovely it is the little things that make it luxurious like the bottled sparkling and still water the very soft slippers and the incredibly soft bath robes and fine linens the rooms was very spacious and well appointed my only gripe is that accommodation services could pay a little more attention to things like wiping off fingerprints on the ceiling in the bathroom into the maintenance access and ensuring the toiletries are actually inside the cardboard packets mine were not easy to miss but still it is the small things that can taint a reputation we had dinner in the restaurant which was nice and the service was great breakfast was ok but to be fair i expected a little more class it was your average breakfast foods and the bacon was tough but the service was good and the chefs friendly the view from our twin room was particularly ugly and disappointing a great hotel and i would definitely recommend it,1.0
stayed here for two nights the location is perfect for sightseeing at the main attractions in athens the room is average and also during the evenings you can hear some noise from outside when trying to sleep overall good stay and decent price for the location,1.0

after having enjoyed many pleasant and comfortable stays at the hotel inglaterra the previous name of this establishment my wife and i looked forward to seeing the changes that occurred in creating its new incarnation as the midmost we were not liked the tasteful remodeling of the rooms a softer and more traditional look and the renovated bathroom was all spiffy and modern there seemed to be even more closet space due to some rearrangement of the closets interiors and we much appreciated the addition of the spacious safe as always the room was quiet and comfortably cool barcelona was quite summery while we were there and as before the housekeeping staff was cheerful and did a good job and even when we needed to use the room after breakfast until fairly late in the morning was very considerate in fact the staff as a whole was quite pleasant and welcoming the buffet breakfast was tasty with good ingredients including eggs and meats and cold alternatives and everything was refilled promptly the new coffee brewer now with café americano worked fast and another nice improvement as always the location is unexcelled perfectly situated where the gothic quarter meets eixample and three areas of barcelona that have along with great restaurants and shopping the attractions of greatest interest to visitors and the hotel is only steps away maybe meters from the universitat stop of the inexpensive and fast airport bus obviously my wife and i are fans of the midmost we,1.0

perfectly located and an excellent introduction to the relaxed amsterdam way the hotel appearance is captivating from the moment you arrive and then we were lucky enough to be greeted by the lovely smiley lisa on reception our room was beautiful we were even fortunate enough to get an upgrade as we were on our honeymoon i have seen people comment about bathrooms with little privacy it is right to say that in certain lights you might get an eyeful so sharing with a work colleague for example might be a tad awkward but did bother us not sure all rooms are like this tho the are even more stunning than the photos show staff were a joy generally helpful chatty and welcoming we even got to have a look at the chapel food was super and the cocktails were really rather good too if you fancy staying in a laid back neighbourhood a stones throw away from central amsterdam but with its own trendy cafes and vibe oosterpark is ideal only pernickety grumble it really no worse than this was a screechy bathroom door just ill fitting so caused a noise when my husband or i used the loo in the night do go,1.0
we stayed one night at the ariel house which is located in a quiet area near the aviva stadium the place is very quaint and has a nice vintage vibe and style my only issue with ariel is the creaky floorboards which may disturb guests we had someone upstairs that moved around at night disturbing our sleep breakfast was great with a small buffet and cooked breakfast parking is available as well,1.0
very good rooms with good size bed and great shower very professional and welcoming staff we he a dinner in the restaurant and food was excellent with very good choices on the menu rooms are very quiet so you can get good night of sleep did not try breakfast as we left very early but definitely will stay again,1.0
as a lifetime platinum member my fiancé i search out marriott hotels unfortunately he made the reservation so my platinum lifetime status was not honored he is a gold member and we did get a room upgrade so everybody was very accommodating in that respect why we loved this hotel glasses of champagne and a little chocolates i downed two glasses before we went upstairs no one rolled their eyes when i came down on a regular basis to take more in the room know us soap bath gel bath salts and lotion in the down service and complimentary waters every day we had a lovely view overlooking the outside terrace and bar below us took advantage of the pool on the sixth floor very small but water temperature was perfect and the lounge chairs were great and the towels fluffy large service by the staff are only request it was not honored was that we needed a lint brush for my fiancé pants and the concierge was unable to find one a recommendation have one available service at the outside bar where we enjoyed a bottle of cava and a bottle of delicious spanish white complimentary potato chips which we devoured as well complained on trip advisor about their breakfast was just mean the food choices quality and quantity were everything we wanted was available plus desserts desserts for breakfast we thought the location was outstanding and the hotel is spectacular we would stay here again,1.0
beautiful hotel which has retained all its prestigious elegance excellent staff and very clean in all areas outstanding location would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who seeks perfection,1.0
i had a great stay at this recently rennovated hotel next to the exhibition friendly stuff great restaurant outstanding rooftop poolbar which is a highlight are spacious and i even had nespresso coffee maker in my room guess it was a club room or so plaza de espana metro station is away aerobus from the airport is going all minutes as well good for return taxi is about ramblas are away by great experience and i would choose this again but i guess a busy place if there is a exhibition,1.0
this is a lovely hotel definitely the nicest one we stayed at during our tour de ireland the rooms are nice and updated and the bathrooms were very spacious i would say quality would be on par with a courtyard which is pretty good for a european hotel our room was on floor which is actually the second floor but it was very quiet even the night after a big match at croke one thing i did love was the location trade off it was a solid minute walk from downtown we timed it one night took to minutes to walk from christ church there not much around the hotel bleecker st cafe is a minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every min or so a can from temple bar costs to euros not a bad trade off for a quiet hotel,1.0
not too imposing from the outside but do be put off friendly staff clean rooms and a lift the only thing we missed was a cooked breakfast although that may have been our misunderstanding the complimentary breakfast appeared to consist of fresh juice cereals toast scone marmalade and jam with tea or coffee,1.0
let me begin by saying the drive from valencia to madrid along parts of toll route produced some views including of the mediterranean that were spectacular my only wish was that there were viewing points along the roadway so that you could take photos the total tolls i paid were finding ibis barcelona meridiana was not entirely difficult even with my bicycle oriented gps map of spain although the hotel is located outside the center of barcelona i found the location to be ideal especially with the amount of that i encountered in the city it is located specifically in heron city and part to a mall that includes a supermarket and next to a cortés inglés is a department store the mall includes a few decent places to eat and has a mcdonalds if you are so inclined there is also a nice park directly across the street that contains a large public swimming pool and of course there is also an adjacent residential area to explore listen to the linguistic cadence of the people and find typical tapas ibis barcelona meridiana is located outside of the center the metro station i puig on line is located a minute leisurely walk from the hotel out the front door to the right through the park the cost of a ticket or sencillez is i would recommend taking line from favra i puig to the catalunya stop a minute ride this will put you in the center of much of the,1.0
we stayed for nights at arts hotel with my husband the first room we were given was not nice at all overlooking a crowded roundabout with a lot of traffic and noise and the corridors were kind of dirty the front desk proposed a new room by the end of the afternoon and it was defining worth the wait nothing compared to the first one with a nice view over part of the beach and sea service was really good even though there are a lot of trainees who sometimes are clumsy with customers the cons of the hotel the location around km from anything the swimming pool ridiculously small with lots of families and children i do not understand parents going to these kinds of hotels with children who can not clearly and fully have fun and enjoy as facilities are clearly not adapted to them breakfast you can order eggs waffles or pancakes from the kitchen but nobody tells you that which is not a one except for the price of course we tried the last year and will stop at the or mandarin next time so we have a clear picture of the luxury hotels in barcelona,1.0
if you like to stay in a nice and quiet residential area and you do mind to use the metro or bus for commuting to the center this is the place to stay spacious and well equipped rooms rich breakfasts and friendly staff we stayed there for eight nights and loved the place in addition the hotel has a nice that serves good dinners and is very popular among locals it is located minutes walk from amstel station from where you can go everywhere if you come with car you can park it the garage for additional cost we travelled outside amsterdam as well and found it very comfortable to,1.0
i have just got home from a a hen weekend in dublin we stayed at the arlington hotel the hotel is beautiful and full of irish charm it looks a little worn in places but i personally felt this added to the charm the staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating when i first arrived the hair dryer in my room was not working however they sent someone up immediately to fix the problem the arlington hosts a celtic night each night which consists of a course meal a live band and irish dancers the evening costs around we attended this on the first evening and it was absolutely fantastic the music was beautiful the dancers were stunning and the food was delicious and they do not scrimp on the portions the leader of the band was funny and entertaining and i felt this was the perfect introduction to irish culture as i had not been there before the hotel breakfast was great and they had something for everyone after a couple of boozey nights the fry up was just what i needed to keep going the only criticism i have is that the pillows were a bit hard but that really is nit picking i thoroughly enjoyed my trip and my stay at the arlington and would certainly return,1.0
fantastic location across from the parliament building with an awesome terrace with a view of acropolis and the entire city of athens hotel amalia is one of the nicest and customer friendly hotels i ever stayed at it is luxury but everything you need it there front desk is souper friendly and helpful restaurant is actually very good we were avoiding dining there because we did expect good and reasonably priced food the last day waiting for a taxi to bring us to the airport we dined there and were very happy also we ordered a bottle of amalia house wine tasty and cheap definitely recommended,1.0
i arrived here yesterday after canceling three other hotels in the center of athens while this cozy beautiful boutique hotel is centrally located but it quiet and away from crowd front desk ladies were most friendly and helpful in suggesting several tours breakfast is great the hotel is located in a residential posh area surrounded with high end stores but just minutes walk away from metro parliament national garden and many other activities i am enjoying my stay and will most definitely recommend and will return in future it feels like home thank you,1.0
stayed here during gay pride weekend and although other places in town were partying pretty hard the location was just perfect in a quiet side street location is a huge plus with the red light district tram access restaurants less than minutes walk canals are right there with even a star michelin restaurant bridges just behind the hotel maybe a five minute or so walk the pastorie bar has great ambiance and the de palmboom restaurant was not bad at all heck even the rusland coffeeshop which i think is the first coffeeshop to become legal in the netherlands is smack right across the street i had an upper floor room with a view of the street in the main building now i saw the reviews of the inner rooms with atrium views in the main building and i guess it a preference at the end of the day i mean in the winter time the sun does shine much so it is what it is the staff was very kind and helpful aiding us to the best vantage points to watch the canal parade thanks for that i spent a special day in the hotel and i thank the management for acknowledging that thanks marjo for making so pleasant will definitely be back,1.0

i stayed at the hotel earlier this month as it was in a great location for visiting athens it is very close to the train station at syntagma square i realised on train back to the airport that i had left my ring somewhere in the room i rang the hotel and the receptionist christina said she would have house keeping check she called me back within minutes to say they had found it under the bed they obviously had to have a good look since i was sure where in the room it could have been the hotel arranged to have the ring shipped to me providing me with a couple of options on how i wanted it sent i chose tracked postal option the ring arrived safely in dublin yesterday thank you electra hotel,1.0

i stayed in the qbic for four nights with my partner and other couples upon arrival the staff were really friendly and accommodating and this continued throughout our stay our room was spotless with interesting trendy decor a comfortable spacious bed and extras like a wardrobe and a safe which came in handy the staff also gave us suggestions for local restaurants and bars things to do and places to visit and arranged a trip to the van gogh museum for us every morning there was a variety of pastries available for all guests free of charge also with unlimited hot drinks which was perfect the staff also put out platters of local food including cheese and pickles some days the location was a five minute walk from amsterdam zuid train station tram and bus station and a local bike hire was less than a five minute walk away too it then took at least minutes to get into the central which was perfect overall this hotel is perfect for couples students and anyone with a low budget looking for good quality and a comfortable stay brilliant value for money,1.0
yurrban hotel was the perfect hotel in barcelona for a couple nights the best parts about the hotel are the location and the added perks that make your stay on the edge of the gothic quarter so there are endless great restaurants in walking distance and it s only ten minutes away from la boqueria i recommend taking different routes through the quaint alleys and popping in boutiques along the way also café lolea the famous spanish sangria is just behind the hotel i recommend stopping in for a drink and some there is a wine hour from pm which is a great way to decompress there is free laundry and laundry soap on site that you can use if needed lastly there is a very small pool on the roof with an amazing rooftop area that has spectacular views of the room is on the small side but the location and rooftop make it very worth it,1.0

this a modern hotel down a side street near parallel and near the port end of the city the area is quiet and safe even late at night and only minutes from las ramblas and minutes to the area has many decent little restaurants nearby when i stayed there was a local festival and i saw the real essence of the area friendly passionate people the local roads were closed and within metres of the hotel a stage was set up given lively entertainment in to the early room was basic bed wardrobe television on the wall with english channels safe cost a night very good air conditioning and bathroom with shower the floor had marble type tiles which made the room cool when the temperature outside was about degrees was two problems with the room one was the view from the window looking on to a brick wall in a central courtyard and the shower did not drain very tried the breakfast on the last day which was fine for euros a basic continental breakfast in a small area by staff were absolutely fantastic spoke basic english but were helpful and you are looking for a no thrills hotel this is the one to go for,1.0
stopped in for two nights recently well located in the gothic quarter between metro stations a short min walk to both exceptionally lively area in easy walking were able to leave our bags until our room was ready staff were friendly and spoke english had a balcony room on the first floor so were slightly concerned about potential noise from the square but as they are refurbished rooms they installed the french doors very well which blocked out all did seem to have as much power as it should have very pleasant bathroom one large shower free wifi was reliable and in room amenities another reviewer mentioned the bed was two singles pushed together so not ideal for a couple but the only minor flaw in our whole definitely stay here again when visiting barcelona,1.0
i choose this hotel because it was slightly removed from the bustle of downtown barcelona it was a great choice offering access to surrounding neighbourhoods an easy pleasant minute walk to the beach and convenient access to the a four points sheraton that delivers exactly what you expect i took rooms for my family and was very pleased with the rooms and the though was the service by everyone i met in particular i mention angelica of the front desk team to whom i ended up turning for any assistance including one persistently insoluble issue which she solved such great service and the location will see me select this property over more luxurious venues on a return visit,1.0
my wife and i have just returned home from a two night stay july and on the whole enjoyed our stay although we had a few problems with the room it was small as was the bed in the bathroom the shower always seemed on the point of overflowing as the outlet seemed blocked and the temperature valve could be turned so the shower was lukewarm at best these were minor irritations which we reported on checkout and we were assured we would be allocated a better room next time on the plus side the breakfast was absolutely fantastic as was the one evening meal we had in the lounge and the hotel is in a good location and any staff we came in contact with were very helpful we would stay again not in room,1.0
this hotel was really beautiful and the staff was helpful for us to get around its a little far from the center of the city but a short cab ride to all the attractions museum and bars and restaurants,1.0
great location i arrived with the train at heuston station and took the red line tram directly to the hotel the next day i only had to walk a few hundred metres to the airport bus great the staff was extremely nice i had requested a bath and the woman at reception had made sure i got one breakfast was really nice and the waiters charming and funny i will definitely stay here the downside wifi never worked and there was quite a lot of noise from the street,1.0
the staff is super friendly helpful and warm they work really hard to make this place great the room was very clean bed very comfortable with very spacious bathroom once we got into the hotel we felt like we are leaving the chaos of the big city to enter a really peaceful really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend it to everyone,1.0
every time we travel to greece through athens international airport we are spending at least one day at oscar hotel why we are coming back the personnel is very polite and knowledgeable about the surroundings of the hotel and the cheapest way to move around the hotel it a few meters from larrisa subway station you can travel with euro to the acropolis which is the station in direction elini super close to omonia station from where you can catch for the same price the train to pireus port or as they say in greek peierias the hotel has a lovely swimming pool that over looks the hill close to the temple of athena the breakfast is excellent and the room are big enough to accommodate people and from the roof you have the most amazing panoramic view over the athens,1.0
only issue of euro deposit required at after being told when we checked out that the deposit was not charged to our credit we were very happy with your facility in regards to the quality of the room food and service we especially appreciated the proximity to the city and public transportation,1.0
we stayed at the hera twice at the beginning and end of our stay in greece in june initially we were so tired from the long flight it was a wise choice to have allowed an extra day rooms are small but well furnished comfortable clean beds and a nice view on the upper floors facing the street front the breakfast buffet included foods we have at home with local sausages bread and fresh yogurt and staff is friendly and helpful even after we blew a breaker with a power strip plugged into an adapter they also arranged a taxi to the airport both times we had to leave and made sure our second stay was at an upper floor with a balcony street roof garden restaurant was also amazing see the separate review,1.0
the location is very good close to the subway clot always a taxi ariuns if you want to move around quicky good restaurants in the neighbourhood for breakfast you can go to glow bar small but delicious breakfast,1.0
ok this was our first hotel we stayed at once touching down in a very hot athens was a little hard to locate but that was the fault of google maps so buy a gps with athens maps and you will find it without an issue the staff are great with there customer service and extremely helpful we had a room viewing the bay and it was along with the big balcony and comfy outdoor setting beds were very comfy as i find it hard to fall asleep in certain beds i we all fell asleep come night very quickly and woke up refreshed breakfast was part of our stay and boy oh boy it was tasty hot and fit for a king and you can help yourself as many times as you please coffee was real as to was juices and if you have a sweet tooth then you will love there greek cakes also they cater for the kids as well and plenty of fresh fruit cereals all you can imagine the pool was tops its built around of an accent setting along with modern and comfy sun lounges and sofas also very shady areas if you do want to tan oh and before i forget every room has a split system air con which will keep you nice and cool during this heat wave that sweeping greece only downside is the restaurant chef really go back and learn the basics of a good old fashioned greek meal,1.0
rooms are good but in the one we had the bed took up far too much space so if you stopping on a long trip and have several pieces of luggage it is not that easy to move around bathroom is large by the breakfast is excellent and well served and the food is abundant and good quality staff are very kind and helpful excellent location to city center and especially good if like us you were there to attend an event at the aviva since it is within walking distance we also chose this for the parking which is available however you have to leave the keys with the reception as the cars are left in a driveway and you have to block other guests this was well managed and we had no problems but one can get a bit anxious given that we had a rental car this is central dublin afterall so you can not expect wide parking areas for free,1.0
overall my stay was very good due to the hotel being extremely busy we were upgraded to an executive room which had a bath and overlooked the canal wifi was great streamed video from bed the room was satisfactory in terms of décor bed was not a true double but two twin pushed together with a hole in the middle location was very good i would avoid the hotel food as there are many places to eat nearby for cheaper and better quality the manager was not very kind on one evening when we went to reception with a noise complaint but thankfully we resolved the issue,1.0
i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in barcelona whether it for business or leisure as it has everything you need when we arrived we were told we had a free rom upgrade which was nice and they had no trouble helping us sort out things in our room the receptionist lynn could have been more helpful she printed a booking out for us for an event that we forgotten to print the tickets for as well as help us find the best ways to get to places we wished to visit all in all very helpful and she made our stay easy the breakfast was nice and there was a choice of cooked breakfast fresh fruit breads cheeses meats etc the only downside was the it seemed quite expensive at each when i do normally eat a lot for breakfast seemed a lot for toast and a cup of tea but it was still very convenient and a nice roof top terrace is very nice and got very busy no loungers left only tables and chairs but i was bothered overall the hotel is very smart and sophisticated the rooms replicate this also big beds lovely plush bathrooms and furniture too we were even given a complimentary bottle of cava on our last night which was nice the location of the hotel is good it about a minute walk to the main shopping street if that your thing and about minutes from the universitat which makes,1.0
back at home and we miss this place a july european trip with two of our daughters left us wanting to stay at the pulitzer indefinitely making you feel at ease the minute you walk in the door they offer everything a discriminating traveler could want wrapped up in the most unique and charming package the good beautiful comfortable cozy rooms many with a canal view excellent entertainment options ca fall asleep without a tv so i pay attention here and delicious food breakfast each morning was a delight and the staff could be nicer the hotel is made up of several different buildings surrounding a sunny courtyard complete with swings dining tables flowering plants and ringing church bells a delight to the senses the location is also amazing yet the area is so quiet you forget you are in the middle of such a large european city the hotel pulitzer marks the first time i have stayed in a bustling metropolis but felt as serene and relaxed as if i were on a remote beach we loved loved loved it and will definitely be back,1.0
well comunicate hotel clean rooms good breakfast friendly staff i would recomended this hotel to other people the staff speaks spanish this is difficult in athems wonderful roof sights romantic place to have a dinner,1.0
we were on holiday with my mom and we both really liked this hotel the stuff was friendly breakfast was really good and the atmosphere was really pleasant the pool area was amazing the room was nicely decorated even though it was a bit surprising that the bathroom was basically a separate shower and toilet behind a glass walls however we did mind it because it was just the two of us,1.0
very nice hotel the best breakfast we had on us trip the service is outstanding if you want to discover dublin then is this the right spot for doing it the bus stops in front of the hotel you have at the back a free parking the standard room is small but nice,1.0
i can not write enough good things about our stay at king george hotel it was flawless the location is unbeatable the front desk and concierge were extremely helpful and courteous our rooms were available for early check in as requested the rooms were quiet impeccably clean and the beds very comfortable highly recommended,1.0
this hotel is stunning architecturally inside and out and the service was great as we walked into the atrium upon arrival i was in amazed by the modern atmosphere while checking in we were all offered a glass of either water or apple juice and to have our luggage taken up to our building apparently used to be a music school so there are some nice heritage elements of the hotel such as the dimmer lit hallways with concrete pillars and mosaic floors and a violin chandelier just past the main to the lobby area the hotel room was very bright and modern we were four people in a suite which had two levels a lower level and a mezzanine i heard many rooms have steps so it be a good idea to ask the hotel for a room with no stairs if you have trouble climbing them the lower level had a bathroom television closet kitchen table bench mini bar and nespresso machine and couch which converts to a bed since we were four people we asked for an additional cot the mezzanine had a couch chair television king bed closet and a the aesthetically pleasing decor the advanced technology caused much frustration among all of us including millennials the day and night curtains are operated by a switch on the wall which did make sense to me when you can open the curtains manually twice as fast and decide how far open you want them the lights were,1.0
great location around the corner from acropolis acropolis metro and plaka area everything was on the doorstep tour buses souvenir shops museum cafes bars and tons of restaurants to choose from service was excellent staff friendly and helpful fabulous rooftop bar and restaurant with view of parthenon spa and open air jacuzzis on great for chilling after a long hot day sight seeing rooms were air conditioned clean and functional with coffee facilities and a safe breakfast was a self service buffet with a generous selection to choose from and staff happy to accommodate any additional needs there was also a lovely bar and lounge area with atrium on ground floor but we did use it as we went to the roof top bar instead as the evenings were so lovely would recommend,1.0
the hotel grande bretagne went all out in making us feel incredibly welcome to the property as the room needed an extra half hour to get ready my wife and i were entertained in the beautiful members lounge on the sixth floor our fifth floor suite eventually proved to be a veritable slice of heaven it was large and luxurious and represented the epitome of class and comfort the swimming pool on the rooftop was just as divine as last year while the health club and indoor pool on the floor also sparkled all the staff who served us and helped us were so generous helpful and refined that we simply must return someday,1.0
we stayed there nights days a mint walk from the beach there a ling street right on the corner mint walk filled with bars and resturants even halal food is available there are also small spas nail and facial a couple of supermarkets location i cant say mint walk from metro station everything you need is there also you serrounded by bike shops used the taxi to city center because my grandma could walk you oau around one way mints away by are not comfy and if you book a triplet room they give you a roll on extra bed they dont have rooms with main beds and yes the rollon beds are even worse than thier main beds if you have a back problem or care much about your sleep i dont recommend it but there are many positives that makes me overlook the bed cleaning staff arent very dedicated tou have to tell them specifically to clean around the sink and to change tour bed covers even i saw the cleaning lady taking the bed civer from the room facing our and putting in our room instead of getting a new have little staff if you want something you need to go down get it youself most of the time even the bags we mived them by ourselves they do keep your bags after checkout for friendly staff i must say always smiling they do have a tourists office but they try to help as much as offered,1.0
exceeded our expectation by a lot food close by easy access to metro highway and amazing customer service suite was sweet plenty of room and super clean hector went above and beyond to help us get around the city this place is a must stay,1.0
it a below average dingy hotel with better alternatives for the same rates at nearby locations it very outdated hotel with outdated furniture that have stood the test time but their time has come reception staff were just fine but nothing to write home about location was good but i had stayed in a nearby hotel slightly better location for the same price but that was very modern and fully refurbished i think it was called definitely would stay here nor recommend i would highly advise a full refurbishment to the furniture and dirty carpets,0.0
last night in a month long trip to spain and portugal so we stayed at ohla eixample after sampling ohla barcelona earlier in our visit the eixample ohla was truly outstanding the room was great the staff were friendly and professional and the xerta resaurant was sensational this is an excellent hotel,1.0
my friend and i were put up by airbnb at the last minute in the orange suite due to trouble with our original host and we literally could not have been happier to be here i spare you the details and suffice to say that from the moment the hotel staff member opened the door to our room we could not keep our cool the hotel is within a five minute walk to dam square and a short twenty minute walk to the rijksmuseum the breakfast was well worth it with fresh squeezed orange juice and prosciutto staff was friendly and always willing to help us out it also right on the canal and very tastefully decorated our only complaint was that the suite was located on the ground floor and the foot traffic can be a little loud but we were so exhausted we barely noticed,1.0
i stayed at the hotel piet hein for a week in june the hotel is right next to vondelpark where you can take a walk or go for a run grab a bite to eat and enjoy at your leisure you will be at a comfortable walking distance from the museumplein and from the shopping area on leidestraat and the hoofstraat the tram lines are nearby and the front desk will help you with getting rooms as mentioned in other reviews are very small but and comfortable most are but some are not which does matter in the summer months the staff is friendly and very helpful directing me to several excellent restaurants they also warned me against using the hotel laundry and gave me several options to get some jeans washed before i moved on there is an excellent breakfast with all the standards including eggs beer and mixed drinks are available at the bar there is also a quiet shady outdoor seating area for would definitely recommend the hotel piet hein as a home base while visiting amsterdam,1.0
we only stayed one night on our way home the hotel is very nice with all the right facilities the bar and pool on the floor have a fabulous view of the acropolis we were rather disappointed with the breakfast service we arrived at probably the busiest time but the staff did seem to be able to cope and the food was not replenished quickly enough many of the dishes were empty we had to ask for water milk and to have our table cleared to make room it let our stay at the hotel down however if time allows do have a spa treatment i had an ancient greek massage and it was one of the best massages i had in a long time well worth finding the time for and it redeemed the hotel,1.0
on a trip with my mom and sisters and we stayed here for nights because of the location and good reviews staff were friendly breakfast was good rooms were clean though a bit small price was good and the location really was fantastic walking distance to temple bar and other touristy areas and bus stops right outside the hotel my room had views of christchurch which was just lovely though a bit noisy at night from cars and people in the streets with a very clean room updated bathroom and a nice breeze through our window we were very comfortable the others in our group were in a triple but they felt very squished and thought their room was a bit stuffy overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
my wife and i booked three nights at the love boutique hotels but hotel estherea was perfect it starts with the service and attitude of all the staff always welcoming pleasant and at a high level of room was beautiful and decorated and the bed was very coffee and cookies area in the lobby is really pleasant and the breakfast is very you want to enjoy amsterdam and not just the city then this is the hotel for you,1.0
renovation completed in this mid size boutique hotel has stylish rooms with a semi industrial chic excellent smart tv system features helpful maps information for the local surrounding area pleasant rooftop pool very sunny not overshadowed by other buildings as some city rooftop pools can be great buffet breakfasts but the mercat del nino is meters down the road and that is the place for breakfast fresh orange juice and tortilla espanola with an espresso superb the corner hotel is in a convenient location in eixample district easy walk to metro friendly two downsides the free seemed to attract dozens of students who are permanently camped in the lobby order one coffee each all day and never move from their laptops the lobby bar is comfortable so you ca blame them but it is annoying for paying guests the other downside is the large garbage bins situated just adjacent to the hotel entrance positioned so you alight from your taxi right next to recommended for large business groups unless maybe you are a business student needing as the hotel does not have extensive meeting facilities however for a weekend break holiday or any sort of romantic getaway this is an excellent comfortable hotel,1.0
for my first visit to athens i was very pleased having selected king george it was an easy minutes metro ride via the blue line to syntagma square and when you emerge from the train station the hotel is right before your doorman were extremely friendly offering me suggestions on where to wander my first day and recognizing me back when i gone to an island for a few days and at the king hotel is pricey but the location was fantastic near the plaka right by the national gardens beautiful for my walks or to sit and read and a fantastic view of the acropolis from the breakfast room and some of the guest rooms the room i booked included breakfast not sure if all rooms do and it was ample with lots of great general and greek choices plus the young woman who seemed to be the head hostess i ca remember her name but she is lovely could have been encouraging me to try some of the local options and bringing me a delicious glass of watermelon juice everything was so fresh and delicious i slept well and comfortably i would definitely stay here again,1.0

have stayed here for week and loved it great location close to everything but with a little separation so it feels tranquil decor and rooms are wonderful because we had a teenager with us we had a junior suite lovely lovely room nespresso machine and electric kettle came in is gracious and extremely helpful rooftop pool also nice treat view is amazing and food quite good i only say quite good because i not a fan of spanish food likely the food is delicious would absolutely stay here again if i return it is a gem,1.0
this hotel is perfect for dublin horse show and any other event in ballsbridge the staff are some of the best anywhere it is spacious and comfortably contemporary rather than austere the rooms are well appointed but the beds could be softer we enjoyed our stay as always,1.0
the location is virtually at bang in the city centre and accessible to the plaka area and parliament building i loved the decor of the entire building a mixture of art deco with grecian style the rooms were comfy and had everything you expect of a hotel the staff were great very accommodating and the business rooms catered to all of our needs i would hands down recommend this to any prospective traveller coming to athens very affordable for a central hotel the breakfast and lunch were amazing as was the service i stayed in the hilton before in athens and you ca even compare the two this is better in every aspect a major plus as well are the panoramic views of athens and the acropolis loved it,1.0
great overnight stay in a classic hotel good amenities and rooms very well furnished to a good standard within walking distance of the main city centre and not far from the very pleasant and helpful breakfast very good choice and tasty,1.0
i wo advice you to live there in july i was able to find air condition it ok for one night but its a shame for it location work on service is much needed the room was ok make sure to print your confirmation going the extra for the customer was not their thing i was asked what do you expect from hotel my reply everything on the web but then again it a and for me a star should ask customers such a crazy question barcelona is a city with endless of hotels and hostels make sure to have a look around so book one night and find that which suits you you might even like the place,0.0
room was not to a star standard but okay for a weekend away the river is beautiful and you can sit out there during the day and it is in close proximity to a train station there is a woods nearby which is lovely to walk through overall nice stay and would probably go again,1.0
great location close to the major sights and on the edge of the plaka district with its vibrant studio balcony room was very pleasing as regards the interior design high quality standard of fixtures and fittings super rainshower and a very comfortable bed being in the heart of athens you can expect some street noise as we experienced with garbage trucks at night however it was short rooftop bar is pleasant for a drink or two whilst viewing the skyline and breakfast has a good variety of choices as regards constructive feedback i would ask that reception are trained to be more welcoming and friendly the nicest and most helpful staff members seemed to be those at the door and the junior staff working at the rooftop otherwise the overwhelming impression was rather standoffish and arrogant not what one expects or should accept as a guest,1.0
got to the hotel a few hours before check in time and was allowed to leave our luggage we were also told we could book in a few hours earlier than the agreed time as our room would be ready we were given room room is directly over the reception area has windows that do open and are directly over the foyer making it really dark there is also hardly any storage space and nowhere to store your empty case the air conditioning unit is really noisy as well so could be left on i went straight down to the reception to complain as there was no way i could stay in that room the very helpful receptionist found us another room straight away room which was so much better it is the ritz but it had a window that opened and more storage space and a comfy hotel is in a great location it is literally minutes walk from the central station is probably the same to dam square has loads of bars and restaurants near by and just seems to have everything close to hand it is on the very edge of the red light district but i think you need to go to amsterdam with an open complimentary toiletries are really nice which is always a bonus and there is a decent hairdryer and tea and coffee making would recommend this hotel as long as you get the right room i would stay here again as well,1.0
this hotel is amazing the staff are friendly the rooms are beautiful and the breakfast is delicious it was our favorite part of the time we spent in barcelona highly recommend for anyone wanting a luxury hotel in the city,1.0
everything about our student hotel experience was excellent wish there was more of them around the world would highly recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam to stay here easy to just jump on team or metro to get into centre in minutes,1.0
stayed here for nights for work and whilst the location is superb the room are looking very tried there really needs to be a makeover here as when you enter the hotel the downstairs lobby and bar area look very nice and inviting if a makeover is not performed soon then i can see this hotel losing out on even more business having said that the buffet breakfast was ok the items were crammed down to the one end of the restaurant where there was not enough room to be able to cook your toast etc whist other people wanted to grab some butter jam and other breakfast items the cooked breakfast i had on my last day was oright but i have had a lot better they seemed to want to present it in a fancy way rather than actually giving you a decent hearty breakfast myself and colleagues were not the only ones commenting on this i would stay here again purely due to location and would hope the hotel manager takes onboard some of the guests helpful comments i did find the lobby staff very welcoming and friendly,1.0
very comfy well appointed rooms that are spacious and clean and comfy wonderful buffet breakfast and very staff if you ca do stairs this is for you i had close to elevator but still had some stairs to negotiate quiet and some rooms on canal side very happy just the stairs lose a star and would only really be half off as you need to understand how old the buildings are just something to remember i would go back,1.0
this is a very nice hotel with large public spaces and outstanding service staff are exceptionally gracious and go far beyond what is asked for to accommodate guests my room was comfortable but the bathroom needed updating although the heated towel rack was much appreciated in dublin s damp weather there was a tub with rain shower but no separate shower stall so entering and exiting the shower required climbing over a high tub my room had plenty of lighting a large desk and comfortable easy chairs wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly turn down service breakfast was above average with a buffet of fruit yogurt and breads and a variety of egg dishes that were very well prepared however the dining room was unpleasantly crowded at breakfast most of the week because of a large pharmaceutical company floor bedroom had a large window that looked out over rooftops soundproofing from the hallway was good but rooms on lower floors have windows that face directly into other buildings in the back or onto grafton street in the front which is very noisy the hotel is in the city center surrounded by bars and shops this makes for a noisy environment particularly in the front of the hotel which faces down grafton street with its rows of bars and hundreds of patrons standing in the street and drinking throughout the evening you would hear some of this noise if your room faces that street but my room faced the,1.0
the two of us plus our alarmingly tall year old checked into hotel actual last week and shared a room during our night stay in barcelona it kinda dinky and the welcome at reception is pretty cool but the beds were comfortable the room was clean and everything worked we not undecided about the modern trend to zip single beds into a double somehow we always on the seam which feels a bit precarious but as somewhere to sleep in between touristing it works,1.0
family of thoroughly enjoyed a stay here booked rooms using points i was hilton diamond at time of booking but only gold as of arrival date arrived at hotel approx am rooms were not ready as they were connecting rooms and one of the rooms had a very late checkout for the previous kept us posted as we snoozed the time away in the lobby room was ready at room still was ready as of but staff had offered us the use of a different floor room until was ready this was necessary so we did take the hotel up on the offer the signature doubletree chocolate chip with walnuts cookie tasted a bit different was it a double chocolate dough instead of the usual in the us cookie dough good cookie just not quite the same as i had in the states the staff at front desk were excellent giving us good advice on sites and hop was high quality honeycomb was a great surprise baked goods were very good we received buffet and also ordered from the menu at no location meters off the river liffey and near lots of the action minute walk to halfpenny bridge rooms very well done this is branded as a boutique hotel under the hilton umbrella and that exactly what it felt like in a good way smaller property not a high volume tour bus type were very comfortable as one would expect of a property in this a great stay one,1.0

great location hotel room very small but clean with nice white towels supplied daily very quirky decor which made us smile hotel recommendations for eating were excellent including the seafood bar and the uptown meat club both on van baerlestraa which was about mins walk from the hotel,1.0
i would give this hotel if possible but decided to swing to to help boost overall figure we booked a basic room just a few days before we stayed and found the price of per night a good deal at such short notice if you book a basic room and are surprised by the fact it is small and does have a great view then you need to loosen the purse strings a bit the basic room was cosy very clean had a fridge big bathroom with rainforest shower cleaning service every day if you want it and all the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming the rooftop pool was small but very clean and there were enough loungers it seemed to stem the flow of people coming up at various points during the day the view was good pool temperature perfect for summer weather and clean toilets up there including a shower and hairdryer for people who check out early but hang about the pool until their you flying into el prat then the aerobus stops at universitat which is minutes walk from the hotel the hotel is surrounded by well priced bars and restaurants and is minutes walk to ra lambla but eixample itself is great for up and coming gastro places thank you sunotel we will stay here again when we return,1.0
stayed over night when visited dublin for a zz top gig when you first enter the ground floor looks suspicious as there nothing there bar a lift and entrance to tgi fridays when you arrive at reception on floor you start to see the quirky and charming nature of this hotel it a bit of a maze on the upper floors rooms are small but comfortable bathroom was clean and spacious the bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept in staff were pleasant and ready to help we left our luggage in storeroom to go exploring the city breakfast buffet offered reasonable options for a small boutique hotel everything was nice and fresh overall highly recommend,1.0
wonderful welcoming hotel in a beautiful and vibrant city the hotel staff was amazing the location of the hotel was perfect for us the neighborhood was fairly quiet at night which we love and everything in the city was easy to walk to and if we could walk the metro and taxis were a half block to get anywhere in the city,1.0

close to syntagma station and right by lots of shops and restaurants got a prepaid sim card with local minutes and of data from the cosmote store just next door for on a summer on floor was modern and clean quite a bit of water would leak from shower onto bathroom floor through the shower door minor issue no other pool area on the rooftop but not a lot of seating view of acropolis is obstructed from pool area but view is excellent throughout most of the restaurant,1.0
the rooms were clean but small location is great for airport train in and short walk to hotel lots of attractions in close walking breakfast was good included with room many restaurants close by for eating out,1.0
i would stay here if you are cabbing it in from the airport and you want to be in a lively nightlife are if you want to drive in park and rest i probably pick somewhere else my room was very nice and all of the staff i dealt with were friendly and informative,1.0
we arrived in the evening and was tired from a long flight upon checking in we had to bring our own luggages upstairs no bellhop service and you have to squeeze yourself into these tiny elevators that can barely fit people me and my family had to take turns going up being a platinum spg member they upgraded us or so they say but the upgrade is the same type of room and just floors higher i needed some ice at one point and called the front desk if there are any ice dispensers which is typical of four point hotels but was told i need to go down to the to get it myself or they will charge a service fee if i want it brought up to the room the shower is so narrow that you need to be careful that you do not hit your was a situation where the people handling the breakfast table in the morning was getting fed up with the tour group from china who could not speak or understand english remarking that english is important wait a minute their bellhop can barely speak english when i asked for a taxi i understand that the hotel is a basic hotel but it should not be this bad,0.0
my recent stay at swissotel amsterdam was made extra special by the duty manager albert hammerseth who went above and beyond to assist in making my stay both enjoyable and easy albert went out of his way and very kindly provided a room upgrade on arrival and also greatly assisted to ensure my laundry was arranged in a short timeframe the hotel is also in a great location adjacent to adam square,1.0
we stayed at the for four nights and it was one of the best hotel it is right across from central station and the main tram interchange minutes walk hotel is in an old bank building and the contrast between the classic facade of the building and the modern interior makes for an amazing effect there is something special about this hotel with the interior filled with wonderful pieces of modern art and sculpture a word of warning the rooms are purposely dark so the lighting is a key part of each room in itself having an expression we loved it the room was very comfortable and there was ample robe space for the two of us bathroom was also charming with the use of mirrors and light to create a feeling of staff were unbelievably helpful and attentive we received a complementary bottle of wine on two occasions when we dined in the hotel restaurant this was a first for us the food in restaurant at both breakfast and dinner was very tasty indeed the dinner menu is a mix of small medium and large plates to be shared we had the zucchini fries and duck as a medium entree and shared the sirloin on one night and the lamb on the second night both were was one of the best hotels we have stayed in and have no hesitation to recommend it highly for design location value and service,1.0
we stayed at the clarence on the tail end of a trip to ireland and were very excited to stay here big mistake it was a total dump we had two rooms and both were filthy the bathrooms floors were sticky and spotted the shower curtain liners were black with mildew one room had a horrible and persistent smell one sink did not drain at all the vents were covered in dust there were random smears of gd knows what on the shower walls one room windows did not open at all and there was no ac or ventilation gross and loud as our rooms overlooked a beer garden next door the lobby was likewise nasty with a sticky counter and floors i am not sure how other guests gave good reviews this hotel was totally especially for the price,0.0
stayed two nights using the hotel as home base very accommodating at by eu standards descent size rooms very good amenities with rain shower heads and illy coffee flat panel service wifi rooms facing west on floor get hot so avoid in summer needed to change our room otherwise friendly service with professional attitudes nice am buffet at eu,1.0
we had an executive balcony and it was amazing the views of the city from the floor were astonishing we had sunset views every night that were breathtaking all the boats in front going back and forth were a real treat the location was great and the executive lounge was a bonus we really enjoyed the hotel the sky lounge is a must a short walk from the train station,1.0
everything was great service freindly staff great spot the only fault was our bathroom wasa little small it was clean and had tea coffee and cold water for you to have in reception area when ever you wanted,1.0
i would say half of this hotel is star and the other half is star our first experience was with the star portion also known as the older part of the hotel you need to be specific when you make your booking that you want to stay in the newer air conditioned portion of the hotel the rooms were still nice in the older portion but as others are mentioning it gets hot over there without ac you face a train station and there are elevators to the floors my wife had a polite conversation with the front desk no screaming or demanding it not their fault we did research the hotel long enough to understand the layout and we stayed in the newer portion of the hotel for the remainder of our trip the front office manager was extremely polite and super helpful ask for ela and she put us in a super nice room in the newer portion of the hotel from then on i would give the hotel a star rating this was by far the nicest room we stayed in throughout all of ireland,1.0
the hotel was really clean but never left enough towels the turndown service was a hit or miss the hotel staff was very friendly except the hotel bartender that would never visit our table to see if we wanted more drinks the breakfast buffet was very tasty but for some reason we kept getting invited to the preferred lounge it was a very small buffet compared to the main buffet the hotel is very centrally located excellent spot we would stay at this hotel on our next visit,1.0
modern comfortable great room great breakfast located within walking distance to all dublin attractions and great restaurants close to airport service outstanding will stay here again on our next visit to ireland,1.0
really great hotel everything that you expect from a quality place to be honest everything was clean cool and comfortable and the view from the top is just outstanding relaxing in the evening with a drink and that view is something i wont only negative is really about the hotel but more of a warning about the city itself parking is extremely tight in athens and therefore if you have a large car you might get a bit stuck and need some help small cars should be a problem though,1.0
we stayed at this property one night before our may cruise belated thanks to miguel at the front desk who was welcoming kind and courteous he recommended and reserved for us an outstanding nearby seafood restaurant we dined at on the same street avenida del parallel as the hotel where we enjoyed the best meal of our trip at a very reasonable price,1.0
hotel is a very good value of quality to money with very good location near to nice staff and good restaurant rooms are very clean and quiet with beautifull view i would recommend for visiting amsterdam,1.0
stayed there for a couple of nights in august during high tourist season and must say that the friendly staff the bright and spaceous rooms made our stay worthwhile also the very convenient location is super however it can get a bit noisy at recommendable,1.0
great hotel easily access all tourist areas as it well connected with public transport especially handy for parc guëll and tipidabo which are within walking distance if you keen nice staff too clean comfy rooms and good to see another neighbourhood by travelling on public transport you more than double your bang for hotel buck it by cab from placa catalunya after midnight,1.0
this is a large modern hotel with good facilities you can walk to trinity college in a leisurely minutes so it is outside the city centre but within striking distance the theatre opposite means the hotel does a theatre dinner and the bar can be busy before the show starts the reception staff were very nice and got us our room before check in time the breakfast has a healthy option and there is a lot of choices it was busy and i have to say after some donegal home cooking the food was not so great nothing wrong with the quality just it felt like a canteen rather than a restaurant with the food being a bit tired there is an pub close by but like so many in dublin they do not do food after lunch time the room was an executive one which meant something significant i suppose but it was spacious and the bath was big enough for a good soak just watch out for the hot water it was really hot when cranked up to warp was not any water in the room which was a little disappointing overall a nice place with predictable business type accommodation,1.0
lovely room excellent location very friendly and efficient staff breakfast superb enjoyed having thepark land beside the hotel where we had a stroll after dinner one minor improvement might be to have digital tv in the room to give wider choice of tv channels,1.0
such a good place with very good location very near to station and suprisingly this hotel have an open kitchen that we can cook by ourself and there is a refrigerator to put our food but beware i put my breakfast of chicken and box of friedrice and the next day my chicken is dissapear and hey have coin laundry too,1.0
location the view on the acropolis the view on the ancient ruins the staff is very nice and welcoming breakfast is nice the decoration of the rooms is nice rooms are small for the price even though the equipment is nice i think it a bit overpriced compared to the price in the surroundings nice hotel well located but a bit pricey for the room size,1.0

our room was at the back of the hotel so we could see the arch or the acropolis but you could from the front of the hotel this is an old hotel tastefully renovated with a single room that includes a small dining table and chairs and a mini kitchen with a small cook top if needed no need to eat in your hotel as the plaka ha so many places to choose from to eat late into the night just be careful of the gypsy as they will take every opportunity to steal your items the staff where friendly and very helpful especially the young lady who took our bags up and does most of the running around and always with a smile,1.0
we stayed for nights had rooms booked staff are friendly and helpful our person was very very good knowledgable efficient friendly room sizes were of the rooms one had a very small short shower if over you would have a problem other room air conditioning not working well had an odor and thus we had to open up the windows thankfully it was cool during our stay location is close to amsterdam but away enough to be quiet and more residential close by bakery was great for breakfast simon something albert heijn market close by as well for snacks found a wonderful laundrymat nearby powders laundrette they have self service machines and will also do your laundry for a very reasonable price first time i have ever had my laundry done by someone else while traveling and it was marvelous and well worth it,1.0

we only had the pleasure of staying at temple bar hotel for one night but we were very pleased with our short stay temple bar is the touristy area but we wanted to be in the heart of the action with restaurants and pubs everywhere you turn we were disappointed was easy and the free and delicious ice cream was a nice touch our room was modern and spacious but had no air conditioning typically this would be a problem in dublin but we visited when the weather was quite warm i discovered on tripadvisor that some rooms had ac so we asked at the front desk we were able to switch rooms for euro best money spent that trip our new room was just as nice as the first only cooler the ear plugs on the nightstand with a note saying the area could be noisy it is temple bar after all made us a little nervous but our room was quiet and we did hear a sound that rate included breakfast which was delicious with lots of items on the would definitely stay here again,1.0

needed a hotel for a weekend in amsterdam the services had to include at least a wifi network good enough to work from this was a good booking was made via the website which is a little flashy but extremely efficient if you want to make a booking it also helps if you are a member of the loyalty the hotel in walking distance of central station was easy and was efficient our wish for a particular type of room was also granted as we were very early to check wifi was good enough to do one last over as well and that got work out of the and bed were excellent marriott quality as did not try breakfast but had ours a the koepelcafe and at lpqnl both just around the corner the koepelcafe is part of the hotel so you can even charge it to the room on this rainy weekend the hotel lounge with firepace also came in handy the concierge desk was able to arrange a for us on sunday it rained but those boats are covered checkout was easy and we could leave the luggage in store until our departure in all a good hotel for a weekend in amsterdam,1.0
we have just spent two nights in possibly the gloomiest and certainly the noisiest hotel room i have ever booked a king junior suite for the weekend we were then acknowledged at as platinum ihg club members and unfortunately as we were late arriving our son and his girlfriend were already waiting in the restaurant there was no time to take in any details of the room as we dropped our cases turned the ac to maximum cooling and went straight a very nice meal in wyers restaurant we returned late that night to be hit by the dreadful noise from trams and other traffic just yards from the windows the room was still warm as the single small ac outlet was totally inadequate and there was almost no light available the bathroom was tiny with no bath and only a shelf behind the toilet to balance soap bags etc our weekend schedule left us with no time to request and then move to a different room and i accept that the hotel may have done this if asked that said i can not believe that they are unaware of the problems with room visit amsterdam regularly but nothing would tempt us back to the kimpton de witt,0.0
we enjoyed our stay at this property excellent service great location comfortable rooms and great views the executive lounge had great options with friendly and helpful staff all staff spoke english and made sure they offered their help,1.0
great location within walking distance to shops restaurants trinity college tourist sites temple bar comfortable rooms though the view of the parking garage is great service is very good lounge on ground floor is a great place to relax in house is restaurant and bar is more than adequate for a quick bite or drink,1.0
the best part of our night stay at brooks was the staff rory who helped us with our bags helped us with booking a dinner reservation and was just about the most positive person we met during our week stay in ireland the ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and accommodated our requests the folks who cleaned our room and provided us with extra pillows were so very kind the breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and the location of brooks is perfect for sight seeing,1.0
room was clean and quiet the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel is located across the street from a hop on hop off bus that allowed us to get around to most of the major sites very easily the hotel is also located within walking distance of several good restaurants and eating options,1.0
worst hotel i have stayed in there no ac holes in the door holes in bathtub dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till am someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous it probably has really good bones and could be redone as a boutique hotel the staff on the other hand was very kind when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air would recommend this to anyone,0.0
you would think it hard to write a review for a place that has received so much praise and love already but let me tell you it is quite possible my husband and i had the pleasure of staying at the mercer barcelona during the length of our honeymoon this past may though it been close to months since we returned from our trip we find ourselves talking about the mercer on a daily basis we miss it all it not hard to fall in love with a city like barcelona for us it become a clear favorite but rarely if ever do you feel that the hotel you stayed in almost supersedes the location it in we are avid travelers yet every day we found it nearly impossible to find the motivation to leave the hotel so we could go out and explore the city plenty has been said about the mercer understated elegance and history all well deserved the location in barri gòtic speaks for itself the true beauty of this hotel though lies wholly in its staff the attention to detail that goes behind every thoughtful note we found in our room each day the cava left for us as a surprise the perfect room service delivery at this is what makes a hotel memorable though it was never mentioned the staffed figured out i would be celebrating my birthday during our stay and surprised me with cake during breakfast my husband has been able to eat,1.0
clean and quiet when i was there though it was a week night welcoming staff allowed an early and were helpful recommending restaurants room spacious and comfortable would happily stay again,1.0
convenient location to city centre clean hotel with good quality fixtures and fittings nice friendly staff and room maintained well by the maid service all in all a great stay here and thoroughly recommend,1.0
when arriving to the hotel we were greeted with a free glass of champagne hotel staff very friendly and helpful at night we never seen the restaurant open but outside there is plenty of room to eat which most people did and ordered food at the bar hotel was close to the nou camp and the magic fountains but was a walk to the beach and other site seeing areas but barcelona is a huge city so this did bother us as we got taxis which were reasonably cheap but being not so close to the beach at night it was quite so you could get a decent sleep rooms very clean and had a fridge which next door is a supermarket which is so cheap so we stocked up i would really recommend this hotel again and i will be staying in more of the hotels,1.0
our visit to this hotel such a good location and very comfortable hotel friendly staff and good breakfast catering for our vegan diet as well would visit again if we return to bcn keep it going,1.0
it is a lovely hotel with a stunning elevator witch is my favorite company the service is so nice and my room was on the floor the top floor my room number was the food on the floor is nicethank you and this was my review,1.0
stay at this hotel if you need a clean room in a good location but it does offer much else great location next to christ church dublinia museum and temple bar area near hop bus stops hotel had a very limited area aside from bar and restaurant breakfast was good but food quality in restaurant for dinner was poor no fitness center staff was not very friendly and most seemed like they did like their job rooms were standard and clean overall we just did find the hotel very inviting and comfortable as a family we just did want to hang out there,0.0
i was recently on a motorcycle touring trip to ireland and i tended to spend a night in dublin but was worried about secure parking after doing some digging i saw that cassidys had a secure car park at the back in which you could so opted for there the parking was about per night which i would have happily paid but on arrival the receptionist said i could use a tucked away area without charge which was even better the car is protected with an electrically operated gate controlled by the hotel it was only a short walk into all the main areas i did venture as far as temple bar as i been there before so had a few beers in the immediate area after one very dodgy pub i found some nice ones including the confession box which was fantastic and very welcoming it should be noted that drinks are massively cheaper in the area the hotel is in rather than a temple ate at a korean restaurant approx from the hotel and it was first class the following day i had the full breakfast in the hotel which was excellent and amongst the many things on offer was iced water with mint which my body needed after a night in dublin great place great location,1.0
we were given a room here after we were unable to stay at another hotel we previously booked at there were only of us but we were given a family room for the price of a double room with breakfast included for less than what we would have paid at the other hotel location is good only minutes walk to the metro at monastiraki the building is rather old but in reasonable condition the highlight is the old timey elevator room was quite good only downside was that it was not very sound proof wifi was very slow sometimes unusable one of the guys at the front desk whose name i ca remember was very friendly and offered suggestions for things to do around athens and greece the other staff were friendly too but did say not perfect but pretty good for the price,1.0
our stay at the hotel balmoral was excellent from the start we were greeted with a smile and much helpful information about where we were staying and how they could be of help to us during our stay taxis tickets the breakfast was wonderful serving both american and barcelona foods the location had easy access to the metro and bus lines along with easy walking routes the staff was friendly and helpful we enjoyed our stay very much and would return,1.0

we have just returned from a night midweek break at the renaissance hotel in barcelona the reception and surrounding inside areas of the hotel are stylishly decorated there is a roof top bar area which gives you amazing views of the city we had an executive suite on the first floor which came with a coffee machine which only had one type of coffee and complimentary mini bar however the mini bar only had water beers and coke drinks inside we have stayed at other star hotels and the mini bars have been full with a selection of food and drinks inside so we were a little disappointed with this one the room was a good size however would not call it an executive suite it was just a slightly bigger room than a standard room the bathroom was really nice however there was only one dressing gown and one pair of complimentary slippers when they knew of us were staying there the room was cleaned and towels changed everyday the breakfast was adequate but nothing special which we had included with our room booking it was expensive if you had to pay extra it has a gym area and spa which we did use and there was supposed to be a pool however all we found was a small water feature on the floor the reception staff were very helpful and friendly especially andrea who made us feel welcome i would recommend this hotel however we would prefer a,1.0
stayed here last monday with my girlfriend and baby and we could have been location is great minute drive to city centre and only a short drive from phoenix staff were all so friendly and helpful and the room was just right and at euro for the night including parking an absolute bargain for in the infamous white moose was absolutely excellent we were pleasantly surprised with how good it actually will definitely stay here again,1.0
stayed here just one night hotel room is basic but was all everything i needed for the night easy to get to convenient location staff were very friendly and bed was comfy only walked around during the day time but area seemed safe enough,1.0
excellent everything was very good excellent location smooth check in comfy and neat room as a hotel city it is very difficult to have a nice view unless you pay extra so our window room had another building right next to but it didn t bother us since we were going to stay one night and we would be out the whole day the view from the roof top is beautiful you can see the parthenon we had super while admiring the view and it was a very nice gourmet experience food was delicious we ordered the greek salad tuna tartar and the chocolate desert which was a symphony of flavors,1.0
this hotel is in a great location an easy walk to syntagma square the plaka the subway and the acropolis it was a wonderful surprise the first night when i went out on the little balcony and i could see the acropolis lite up on the hill we were there during a terrible heat wave one day when we returned our air conditioning was not working panic the person at the front desk got us help immediately and we had a comfortable room with an hour the breakfast was quite good as well,1.0
this is beautiful hotel near the tram and within walking distance of the museum park the first thing we noticed was how friendly and welcoming the staff was we were given information and touring advice from who ever we asked including the gift store clerk who gave us some great ideas about what canal houses to room was comfortable and the executive lounge was great for breakfast and dinner,1.0
the hotel is beautiful clean and in an excellent location the rooms were comfortable and a great place to stay after a long international flight the rooftop restaurant and view of the acropolis were fantastic as well,1.0
even after a stay in a city of words like dublin my vocabulary stretches to meet the challenge of describing our stay at ariel house we stayed for a total of six days bookending our travels to the west and northwest for family sightseeing the place is attractive and but the uniqueness of ariel house lies in the staff welcoming knowledgeable efficient thoughtful and gracious here management leads by example and the rest of staff is led to provide a hotel guest experience recommendations reservations and luggage handling were all handled with charm and efficiency the provided breakfast is excellent with attentive service in a very pleasant is a quick ride on dart transit to the stops in the center of the city and there are some good eating places in easy walking distance our room was clean and we utilized the drawing room and enjoyed the chance to meet other guests our one suggestion for improvement would be to strengthen the so that it reaches the further rooms we have been many places but ariel house is one of a kind,1.0
stayed nights location was good easy access to the centre by tram hotel lobby very inviting despite the mouse running around did complain but staff not that bothered room though clean was tired and dated shabby curtains no tea and coffee facilities pillow was lumpy and small and hotel would provide extra ones bed uncomfortable and soft would stay again even for one night,0.0
this is an average of two stays once in december and one recently in july in december everything was perfect we were truly impressed for a great christmas stay when the hotel was fairly empty the design location perks and happy hour comfort and service were exploring the garden is a must the above were true this month except for service as this visit had a few issues we requested early based on an early flight but it ended up being late day the other things were anything to do with room service took extraordinarily long and housekeeping could have done a better job of cleaning under the bed from a previous guest all of these might be explained by the hotel being fully booked and especially busy and the front desk was appropriately apologetic when notified upon checkout we would stay again but would hope it is more consistent for a five star hotel,1.0
the europark hotel is the best option to stay at in barcelona the room was amazing breakfast was delicious it very well situated and the people were extremely nice specially the manager amazing,1.0
this place is in a perfect location not right in temple bar but across the bridge from it so you far enough away from the crazy but not too far the hotel is old but clean beds were comfortable staff was very friendly helpful breakfast was just ok it located on a very busy street so if you leave your windows open at night prepare for lots of shouting drunk people lots of traffic but i think that part of the charm of dublin i think it was a good value for the price,1.0
my husband and i chose to take an express shuttle from the airport to the hotel because we arrived at about am we found the express shuttle paid for the tickets at a kiosk stepped right onto the shuttle amazing luck stood for the minute ride and got off across the street from the hotel the longest part was not wanting to jay walk as our first act in another country so we walked up across and down to the hotel entrance when we arrived our rooms were ready amazing luck we showered and took a nap for an hour or two then hit the town running while we were there we saw a historical recreation ship moored very close to the hotel and the river walk had a festival the hotel had flowers in the lobby so you could take on and brighten your room and free wifi they also had a fake sheep reading a newspaper full of his one review said it not in the city center we had a great time and it a few blocks from the green line bus tour we had dinner at a restaurant that we could see from our hotel room i would stay there again,1.0
booked this place for our trip to athens got it as a steal the best cheapest way to reach from airport will be to take the express bus right side of departure gate and get down at syntagma square last stop this is almost an hour drive and take a taxi kms to the hotel not many know this hotel by name due to its location you need to specify that its on aristogitonos lane alternatively you can take the airport to monastiraki by metro mins ride and min walk to hotel careful if you have lots of luggage as this station is filled with few people who bombard tourists pros of acs colourful budget rooms with basic amenities top floor ones offer a good greek breakfast loaded with bread cheese served from early you can book your hop in hop off bus tickets at self service tea biscuits at the great location to access and enjoy local food street joints hard rock cafecons of acs very poor response to they are under staffed probably offseason may be location does get lonely at night as its in between a market,1.0

a small one of a kind boutique hotel whats remarkable about it is the super helpful and friendly staff i have to greatly mention oana tonya and eva they never failed to help answer an of my questions concerning where to go what best is to do where to dine and even where to shop i send my great appreciation for location of the hotel is great walking distance from any place one needs to visit where you can walk to your destination and enjoy experiencing all the greek life tavernas souvenir shops markets and all the hotel is quite clean and tidy it lacks some essentials like cotton buds and the free water bottle but that was last of my worries for it offered what was more important i highly recommend this hotel and i have to mind you that i was a solo traveler,1.0
we had a great experience here the location is near las ramblas but not right in the middle of the city chaos the city is very walkable and this was a great place to stay the first night we arrived there were food trucks that lined the promenade and we found the most delicious food there the hotel has a great bar and the breakfast had everything you could want the rooftop deck was nice but the pool is kinda small the rooms were comfortable and clean just what we wanted,1.0
this was my first stay at a kimpton hotel and it wo be the last i shared a twin room with my teenage daughter and it was a very comfortable exceptionally clean room very comfortable beds with excellent pillows nespresso coffee maker complimentary water still and sparkling and lovely warm bath front desk staff were incredibly helpful and as we had arrived after we were presented with vouchers for complimentary glasses of wine as we had missed wine hour until room service was prompt and not extortionate the breakfasts are excellent and next time we visit we will try definitely try dinner in the hotel is only a minute walk from the station and most major attractions are easily reached on foot too there are tram stops nearby if you wish to use public recommended,1.0

i had nights here in the views are mesmerising no matter how many times you experience them the breakfast was good but poorly displayed my room was an adequate size for one person but a couple might find it challenging suitcase space was inadequate the pool was great in may but by the end of june it felt like warm soup and was full of children bless as well as which it is small access times for the pool is limited due to its proximity to the dining not a boutique hotel but good none the less i would definitely return,1.0
we stayed on the top floor but one and had beautiful panoramic views of the city roof tops persuaded to upgrade by the charismatic and friendly welcome i glad of having done so the breakfasts are excellent a good range of hot and cold food that constantly updated by the kitchen the bar is good and carries a wide selection of hotel location is out of the centre but only a minute walk from the central station and therefore within minutes of all the attractions of the city the trams stop just around the corner from the hotel and are cheap enough should you not wish to walk located by the iamsterdam sign and the rijksmuseum there are good restaurants and bars in the vicinity of the hotel and we found some lovely ones thanks to the amazingly helpful hotel staff and the map the hotel gave room we had was lovely clean modern and spacious and the bed was comfortable given the hotel location it meant that there was a lot of noise outside at night,1.0
had high hopes for this hotel but it was at best described as adequate loud vicinity appreciate that the hotel can only do so much to address this but more could be done in terms of the decor worn out carpets on the stairwells and very low budget shower curtains that stick to you you know the ones polite enough staff but they have an air that they are just going through the motions did find them very genuine it a shame as this place could be so much more,0.0
great rooms with a kitchenette staff very friendly and helpful keta and fatima did a great job providing us with coffee at breakfast and were very friendly we left as friends hotel is part of a large shopping centre with a big supermarket does take visa or mastercard has a laundry,1.0
situated in the middle of nowhere it kind of like the place airlines put you when your flight is delayed if you are looking for a cute coffee shop or shop then best stay somewhere else if you happy to get straight on the tram and commute to amsterdam city first thing in the morning then fine no disrespect to the staff but i was a bit disappointed because the hotel had a lot of stars and i did understand why,0.0

just returned from this fantastic hotel i could not praise it enough we were welcomed at reception by a lovely lady ms martinez and given a welcome glass of sparkling wine our room was ready so we were able to go in early which was nice i was pleasantly surprised how big our room was we had a corner room which was spotless bright and airy with a great view i can often feel claustrophobic but no fear of that with three huge windows there were robes complimentary water and toiletries the roof terrace was a bonus the staff very friendly and helpful and prices reasonable the views of the city were fantastic and we watched the sunsetting from here over a bottle of delicious rose on friday night there was a band on which was an added bonus only four sunbeds but as it was never that busy we always managed to get one i love barcelona and in future will come back to this hotel every time excellent position too in between the gothic quarter and el born can hear the metro slightly but it stops between midnight and and never bothered us thank you for a lovely stay,1.0

i spent nights at yurbban trafalgar i had what called a standard room which turned out to be super small reminded me of ibis initially i had a room on the floor next to the elevator the same floor as access to the rooftop bar unbeknownst to me the rooftop bar is open to the public sometimes until am when they are hosting an event it was sooooooo loud my first night luckily i was able to switch rooms for my next nights what i liked great location good comfortable bed good shower friendly and helpful staff loved the rooftop deck improvements tea kettle in the room for almost usd a night there ought to be one the wine and cheese social is a great concept however the setup does work well since people are sitting next to the cheese and wine it felt very intrusive when taking a bit of cheese or wine perhaps place the cheese and wine on the table used for the breakfast buffet loud room on the floor due to access to the rooftop bar i probably would not stay at this hotel again i did think it was worth the price i had paid per night,1.0

me and my girlfriend stayed here for a week at the end of june to the beginning of july we were extremely excited and it safe to say we were staff were absolutely amazing from the moment we pulled up outside in our taxi extremely helpful from carrying all of our bags to the concierge giving amazing recommendations and advice about all things barcelona peggy and dennis were especially rooms were extremely comfortable and had everything you need from usb ports to remote controlled blinds to amazing bathroom facilities the architecture of this hotel was incredible and the huge light well in the centre of the hotel just makes this hotel stand out even rooftop pool does have many sun loungers or beds but even if you do get a bed you can easily still sit there and enjoy the all day beaming sun and if you do get a bed it delightful and very peaceful the food and breakfast is expensive compared to other places but you certainly get what you pay for all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone i speak to family friends or strangers i also stay here again if i ever visiting barcelona again thank you for an amazing stay the one,1.0

stayed here on the of july and was very unimpressed with the customer service we received at reception when checking in i had booked the hotel through with a voucher i had received i had all the confirmation letters printed out and in order but when we went to check in the receptionist straight out refused to accept the confirmation booking and stated that they did accept the voucher even though i had the paperwork she stated that i did book through the voucher website and that they could accept it as part of the payment she then implied that the fault was on my part and that i had to sort it out with as she had other customers to deal with which i found quite rude to check into the room we had to give the full amount deposit on my visa card which took days before i could access that money again the whole ordeal took over minutes i rang hotelsireland and they were so helpful i gave them my reference number and they checked it out saying everything was in order and that the booking was sent to the hampton the day after i had booked the lady then rang the hampton herself and sorted the whole thing out in a matter of minutes on checking out i paid the remaining balance which i was expecting to do in the first place but was still out of pocket for days because of the deposit payment i,0.0

four nights at the manor in amsterdam during peak summer season this hotel is well appointed very clean and a good sized room with excellent bathroom staff were very welcoming and friendly booked through a well known consolidator and was a little disappointed that it was not made clear during online reservation that breakfast was extra so had to find another for two people on hotel is right next to two tram lines one of which goes to the centre and the other to the museum district and there are plentiful shops and cafes within metres however with hindsight we would have paid extra to stay nearer the centre and would happily use another of the many hotels within the hampshire group in tram journey is minutes each way and even with tickets the cost adds up in the summer heat it is not practical to walk back each time to the hotel and for those of us who are of age the bicycle hire was not a welcoming summary this is a great hotel but visitors need to balance the savings available by being away from the centre against the time and inconvenience of not being able to back for a regularly visit european cities and rank amsterdam as one of the safest and we never felt intimidated or unwelcome and loved being able to meander the compact centre however it is not a particularly cheap city and the budget does not stretch as far as it does in,1.0
the welcome was very pleasent and wines were very good the room was quiet and clean and cool with the airconditioning nice bed location nearby city centre overall we were very satisfied with the room,1.0
we stayed for three nights in this lovely hotel the staff were exceptional from check in to check out and they showed a high level of customer service the rooms and facilities are modern clean and very comfortable the cocktails in the city bar are a must thanks for having us grand hotel central we look forward to returning one day,1.0
booked in here for three nights and have to say the room was clean and comfortable a bit warm but that something i have come to expect from hotel rooms breakfast is a self service affair with many different treats and offerings blending the traditional irish hot breakfast with the continental style really enjoyable and sets you up for the day staff extremely friendly lunch in the coffee dock was very tasty one small criticism for a small glass bottle of coke a bit expensive again staff very helpful and nice,1.0
chose this hotel principally because of its location it is literally just across the road from the central station in amsterdam from the minute we checked in the staff could have been more helpful friendly and accommodating our room was on the floor and was very large with an enormous bed beautiful bathroom elemis toiletries safe minibar air conditioning and everything else you could possibly need you would never know you were in the thick of amsterdam at night because the windows blocked out everything and black out curtains added to the feeling of peace the breakfast in the hotel is superb with a very wide choice of food and drink we would hesitate to recommend this wonderful comfortable and friendly hotel left luggage service meant we did have to drag our cases around on our last day and midday check out meant we were rushing either ca really say anything bad about the place highly recommended in every way,1.0
used parking space for airport shuttle bus to dublin airport driver of mini bus excellent he is always so helpful with bags and children always so friendly and recognises us from previous trips he is a credit to the hotel and he is the reason we return time after time,1.0

absolutely loved this location they had a bus to the city every day through out the day the room needed a little updating besides that everything was perfect staff was super friendly great breakfast nice area it was located in we walked to a restaurant called koytoyki and had the best dinner ever and for people it was only great experience we wish we stayed here after our cruise also the lady who did my husbands hair gave him the best haircut he has ever gotten she is so talented very good customer service also we loved her please recognize her also management was great also when i thought i left my passport they searched the room and was there for me great customer service on the managers part also thank you all for a great stay ca wait to see the updates and to come back in the future with our family,1.0
i stayed here for the first time on a recent overnight business trip the hotel decor is art deco plain but true and consistent the public areas are so one is inclined to lounge and the hotel lacks a buzz the room was very nice and comfortable but it was a rare hot evening in dublin and although they supplied a mobile loud aircon unit and a fan it was very difficult to get the room temperature right made worse by a bar courtyard adjoining premises below playing loud music that said this would not be a problem of the time given the climate the tv did work very well and there was a limited range of channels not a huge issue for me breakfast in cleaver east was nice and the dinner menu looked interesting service throughout my stay was excellent the hotel is in a prime tourist location i think it better suited to tourists than business travellers but it was close to the four courts so that suited my purposes by dublin standards the price was good and as such it represented very good value,1.0
i have to admit that i tried like crazy to cancel our reservation here at the last minute we had a devastating health diagnosis and the hotel which was refused to give us a refund that said we decided to go on our trip after all i have never been more impressed with a hotel or it s staff like i was with this location was perfect and i will never forget the kindness the staff showed me when i became ill i had an infected spider staff arranged for a to come to the hotel they sent me a tray with fresh fruit tea and a get well soon card they even had housekeeping change my bed all within a minute span of calling the front desk i was so ill that the lady from house keeping was changing my pillows as i was crawling back into my bed i remember her lifting my head and fluffing them until they were perfect they sent us dinner via room service at no charge never have i felt so pampered and taken care of i am ever so thankful for the kindness they showed me this is a perfect place to stay in the heart of amsterdam stars all the way,1.0
efficient pick up and check in front desk staff were helpful in directions and also made the effort to arrange a food box when i need to go on an early train trip before their breakfast starts the room is really clean well and newly designed and compact hotel breakfast was fantastic enables a few choices of different savoury and sweet staff at hotel breakfast always so friendly early in the morning near to museums as well as tram stops which were really convenient when i go for my conference or walk around the city would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time i visit amsterdam,1.0
lets begin where our journey started we looked up the prices through and a dutch travel agent called tui the travelagent offered a superior twin room which was also a roomtype on the website it was combined with a flight the price was about the same so we booked trough tui when we arrived at the hotel it was very clear that the room that was booked for us was not a superior room but a standard room we tried to change this because we booked a superior room but according to the manager he offered this room as a superior instead of the real roomtype because of the company were we have booked the room this was unbelievable for us he just laughed at us and did nothing to help us with this problem he did not listen to our story but was only looking at the line with people who wanted to check out behind us because everything was full we had no other option to stay in the room is interior in a building it looks like a closet and does not have enough space for two persons who stay nights there is a semi double bed but this wasnt even close to the worst things every night we heard noises from the room next to us there are a lot of young people in the hotel that like to go out every night that fine and fun but when they came home at they kept talking,0.0
just returned from a week stay in ireland with my family of looked at many hotels and for the nights in dublin decided on the drury because of the reviews and location location was great easy walking to everything sights and shopping the front dest was exceptional friendly helpful and so nice to talk to i think staying in a small property was the best choice we made we needed a triple and double room both were huge clean and comfortable it was a deluxe property but beds were so comfy with nice sheets and pillows we had the best sleep,1.0

the hotel is easy to find food in the bar was lovely the room itself was clean but would really benefit from a bit of tlc new windows we were on the second floor so the unit was loud there were building works at the back of the hotel which were quite loud with the single glaze windows and paint to cover bad patches on the walls the highlight of our stay was definitely the staff they could have been more helpful in every way from printing maps for us to the bar staff declan was a real tonic and seemed to be popular with all the guests,1.0
wonderful staff and convenient hotel on the northern side of la rented the top loft for less than loft has a jetted jacuzzi the room has an entire patio although to hot to seat and relax the worked well as it was needed with touches need to be updated like all around the bathroom and the two people elevator is very slow but overall a very cool and convenient place for a day or two in athens,1.0
there was so much we loved about this hotel we found the rooms pleasantly quirky and were not bothered by the lack of windows we were there just to sleep after all although the ground floor rooms line the main foyer they seemed at least as quiet if not better than other rooms we have stayed in the décor throughout the reception area and foyer is really funky and we enjoyed just sitting there and having a reception was very helpful at and they have nice cool water on offer all day which we helped ourselves to regularly with one exception detailed below the service standards were the location is a tram trip from the main tourist spots it is a picturesque tram route and they run regularly the added bonus of the location is the adjacent food hall which we ate at on both the last night of our stay we spotted a used coke can lying under the bed we could have just disposed of it but felt the reception would want to know their cleaners had missed it they told us they would come down and remove it straight away but nobody showed up we had to contact reception again minutes later at which stage a different person said he knew nothing about it he did come down and remove the can but by then it had turned into a larger issue for us then it should ever have we were happy with hotel de hallen and,1.0
hotel is dated but well maintained in the center of tourism just across from greek parliament good nightly rates this said clerk talks of breakfast at checkin as though it included likely it not so ask prior to taking your breakfast otherwise you might get a surprise at the end a good star hotel with character and close to it all,1.0

me and my friend came to dublin for a few days away and we were not disappointed the clayton hotel is in good walking distance to the centre with lots of bars to visit whilst on the way we were dropped off by the airlink which was just across the bridge so it took us mins to get to the hotel with no messing on our last day we sat in the hotel bar and was greeted by derek who was polite and welcoming he told us we could stay and relax until it was time to leave for our flight i would highly recommend this hotel as all the staff were helpful and friendly,1.0

i had the pleasure of spending a night at athens zafolia hotel for a quick business trip and i experienced a long lasting memory of which i urge to hotel is conveniently located for business purposes and has a relaxing pool on the roof top with extremely friendly staff reasonable breakfast and nice rooms and the reception personnel are very caring and helpful but why such an outstanding memory well i for personal reasons chose to change my room and mistakenly forgot about my belongings in the safe box half an hour later i was relaxing watching this beautiful traditional greek band playing bouzouki that someone knocks on my door telling me to go to my recent room immediately where i found my gold chain passport credit card and few thousands of cash euro left behind now i know they were suppose to do that but still this is not something to forget so i deeply appreciate such honesty by the zafolia staff from the manager whom chose and trained these personnel and also this lovely russian guy whom was so honest and friendly athens zafolia you represented the very rich greek culture again by such tremendous act thank you zafolia and thank you beautiful athens,1.0

the hotel has free wifi and is located in one of barcelonas most busy streets a short walk gets you to great restaurants as stores and that about it the room was really small having a suitcase got to be a problem we had to place some of our luggage in the bathroom the bathroom contained some hair from other guests and god knows what else the elevator did work the tv had three spanish channels and the breakfast cost extra perfect since the room did offer a simple do not disturb sign it was easy for the housekeeper to wake you up at to tidy your room next time no thanks hotellet er plassert sentralt i barcelonas mest travle gate gåavstand til butikker og gode restauranter gratis wifi der stopper det positive kun spanske kanaler på små rom uten plass til koffert eller sekk sekken måtte for øvrig plasseres på badet badet inkluderte hår fra tidligere gjester heisen var i ustand og alt dette til tross for en vanvittig høy pris for rommet i tillegg manglet enkle ting som et ikke forstyrr til døra pga dette kunne man raskt bli vekket kl noen skulle vaske rommet neste gang nei takk,0.0

breakfast ok however too many guests which meant that we had to eat it in a conference room on plastic foldable chairs since no tables were available pool and rooftop is nice allthough small and over crowded restaurant overpriced the staff in the restaurant and by the pool were the most rude i have ever encountered apart from a man called dimitrios that was very service minded not interested to take orders when instead walking to the bar to order i was told to sit down and wait for a colleague that never came the last day we were asked to pay to use the pool since we were not allowed to be in the hotel after our check out even though we arrived late and planned to leave late the hotel in general needs an update and the room was old and smelled like mold,0.0

one of the best things about is it location it is stops from schipol airport on the train and stop before amsterdam central it is a minute walk from sloterdijk train station so it perfect for both getting from the airport and into town it also has a tram stop at the station number that goes past anne frank house and up to the hotel itself is fairly new and it looks sleek and stylish the rooms are light and comfortable with a couple of chairs and a decent sized wardrobe the fittings are nice and there is a senseo coffee machine in each room that beats the standard sachets of instant coffee housekeeping was regular changing towels if required and squaring the room up the room could have been a little cleaner it just seemed a little hotel has a sauna and a gym that we did use and a nice roof terrace that we did we sat out till closing time which is but the staff were ok with us staying out a little longer to finish our drinks before they locked up staff were very accommodating of requests and very helpful in general for the price this hotel was very good value,1.0

the hotel is close to two underground tube stations marina or bogatel which then get you into the centre of barcelona quickly although the underground is efficient it is very hot but cool on the trains the hotel is about a fifteen minute walk to the beach through the streets the marina is about ten minutes walk the same way restaurants available for evening meal there and a room was clean and plain but comfortable large tv no english channels apart from the news toiletries provided no breakfast unless you pay extra there are small eating places close by to grab a croissant and coffee had dinner there one night when returned too late to go out again very good food there is a pool on the top floor but it is quite small there is a fair few sun beds and chairs there but they get taken very quickly and you are sitting on top of one another but it is good for a couple of hours rest after a hard day exploring the reception staff were really helpful we needed directions to a few things we had booked and they made sure we knew what tubes to catch and the exact directions the area surrounding the hotel is more local and residential but we felt really safe walking about late at night and stopping off at some of the more local bars where you are not ripped off for a drink or meal as you are in the,1.0

staff in the hotel did an excellent job however service in the restaurant was quite disappointing it seems like the wait staff are attentive to your first drink order and food order but after that their rarely check on you and it can be quite an effort to have your finished plates cleared order dessert or get and pay your bill,1.0
the hotel is ideally located near the quarters of the city making it a perfectly central location to most key tourist locations min walk from the metro min walk to la rambla and min bus ride to the beach myself and friends arrived for our first girls holiday to barcelona and were welcomed with a friendly reception as we entered the quirky hotel with little idea of how far we were from the tourist attractions we planned to visit the receptionist whipped out a map and gave a swift and detailed summary of our closest metro stations most accessible bus services and even the advised us on some of the attractions we planned to visit the rooms we booked two doubles were clean spacious and extremely comfortable we seen on the website that only a mesh curtain separated the bathroom from the bedroom and as we were sharing between friends we figured this would have been a bit intimate however there was also a white curtain which could be drawn for privacy the loo had its own private room as well thankfully i have to say the beds were absolutely incredible so comfortable which was a dream to come back to after our long out we spend a few afternoons and evenings on the spacious and modern rooftop area enjoying the fantastic cocktails and soaking up the sunshine when we were a bit too tired to head down to the beach overall i highly recommmend the hotel we received a,1.0
location locaion location very close to downtown and everywhere is within pretty much walking distance minute walk to the spire minute walk to george dock luas station if you want to get to the west side of the downtown with ease airlink bus at the door step it took only minutes to the airport the staff is above and beyond the standard they are exceptional hotel appears very new clean and well kept hilton gets free breakfast in olys restaurant on the ground floor which has very good selection of irish breakfast and omelet bar waffle machine it has guest laundry facility within the property eur for washing and drying complimentary laundry detergent there so you do have to wander around the city and sit for hours for laundry i will recommend this hotel to friends or family who will visit dublin in the near future high recommended,1.0
we stayed in the dean for a one night trip we were attending a concert across the road from the hotel so the location was perfect the room was a room that we paid for without breakfast the room was stunning very unique lots of quirky touches like the orange smeg mini fridge we ate in the restaurant slightly pricey but we just had pizza and that was reasonable we drank in the bar very friendly staff expensive drinks we had been warned about the noise and as we were out until ourselves we did sleep through it with the help of the pricey drinks i mentioned earlier they leave ear plugs beside the bed they were very useful rooms were very warm and when i opened the window the noise obviously increased so we just left the ceiling fan on all night i would recommend this hotel for young couples groups of friends maybe not families or older folks we really enjoyed the experience even if we are quite tired now,1.0
hotel is well situated ideal for using the going downtown personnel is kind and efficientbut rooms are totally unacceptable with bathroom including wc directly open on the bedroom with no door to close you better not be sick or comer for the first time with your new girlfriend a real romantic night killer another inconvenience the bed is close to the wall so impossible for one of the sleepers to get out other than by jumping over the other one hotel maybe ok if you are alone but forget it if you a disappointing run away,0.0
the hotel is located close to the acropolis and other attractions of ancient and modern greece it is close too to public transport the metro trams and bus to allow for ease of movement around the city the hotel is charming tastefully designed without being the top the rooms are comfortable though slightly small and are cleaned daily our room away from the street was very quiet breakfast was included in our tariff and well worth it with an excellent range of freshly prepared fruits vegetable dishes and local cuisine such as cheese pies the rooftop restaurant and bar though pricey is well worth at least one visit the views of the acropolis are spectacular i save my last comment for the wonderful staff who were extremely helpful and thoughtful with our leaving early on our final day they arranged for a breakfast plate to be brought to our room it is the little extra touches that make this lovely hotel truly special,1.0
we stayed here for a wedding we can not recommend the hotel enough clean and modern with helpful we were worried the hotel was too far from the centre but we could not be more wrong the number goes from across the road and you are at dam square within minutes figuring out the tram routes was easy and actually we opted to walk a lot of the time as things are closer than they seem on the roof top bar is amazing with stunning you for a wonderful weekend,1.0
just an outstanding experience although we were only there for one night a very special place to stay only one caveat although still worth five stars the location while fabulous in other ways is inaccessible by car or taxi taxis can approach a nearby street larger vehicles car service autos etc can only approach further away get your driver to call the hotel as you approach and they will send a porter and luggage cart rooms are small although very smart deliberated about how many stars to give location in the end gave five would have given less if i was mobile if i had a mountain of luggage or if it was pouring with rain,1.0
have just checked out and will be back staff very obliging and helpful manager josé mingles with guests each morning and always has time to talk and offer help special mention for irene in mornings very pleasant and helpful in fact all staff lovely room basic but fine location beside la ramble poblenue so loads of restaurants metro min walk and barcelona centre min away only small negative booked rooms and not ready for hours after arrival wifi great and given complimentary on held bags in safe location on our departure while we spent last afternoon shopping no price basic but great,1.0
the hotel is an oasis in busy athens with it beautiful courtyard the front desk are so helpful and truly try to accommodate your stay that what i call good service the rooms are simple yet spacious and the beds are very comfortable breakfast was quaint and delicious the hotel is in a perfect location to explore by foot syntagma square plaka monastiraki and the acropolis the only thing i found strange yet modern was the translucent dark brown doors for the bathroom and shower,1.0
a bit tricky if you arrive to the hotel by car the street outside is a busy road and there are only a very small space to park while you check in the location is excellent with views overlooking the park and the parlament and with walking distance to a lot of the sights in central rooms are elegant and normal in size the bathrooms are quite big and very nicely designed breakfast offers a large variation so no matter your diet find something on the buffét the only disappointment was the lobby bar food was not that good and expensive and when i ordered champagne i was told it cold so please put the champagne in the fridge and come back joke aside i would absolutely come back to this hotel again,1.0
myself and my husband stayed in the westbury for one night over a busy bank holiday week end the receptionist jenny met us on arrival and was very friendly and personable she was very attentative to our needs our concierge was also lovely and did all he could for us we ate in balfes after check in and enjoyed a lovely lunch we had a lovely time overall and soaked up the atmosphere in town we had a very pleasant stay the staff were great the location is a bonus,1.0

banks mansion is a small and friendly hotel well located clean and very comfortable room was quiet roomy and comfortable great breakfasts close to the flower market a tram runs outside the front door however it is an easy walk to most of the main attractions the staff were always helpful happy to answer any questions every afternoon guests were invited to gather in the lounge over drinks and cheese this engendered a sense of coming home at the end of a busy day provided opportunity to meet others i highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to amsterdam,1.0

within walking distance of the liffey river and temple bar area in the south and to croke park in the north the holiday inn express was a brilliant place to located near the spire it has both a coffee shop and a traditional irish pub with great food right next bank is across the road and shopping strips are nearby on parnell and staff are polite and friendly while small the rooms are clean and quiet and the facilities are modern and is a really great breakfast provided every morning to get your day in dublin moved here from an alternative hotel which did work out and were so glad that we did,1.0

stayed for nights in june with my partner and hotel granvia did not disappoint we got a free room upgrade and bottle of champagne as this trip was for my so this was a lovely surprise upon is simply amazing very central and right next to a metro station which we used to get to the was not huge however there was a built walk in wardrobe which was ideal for placing clothes and suitcase in order to avoid clutter in the was simple yet very classy and elegant again bathroom was not huge i have experienced bigger bathroom in barcelona but it was not an issue shower was provided in large bottles which is ideal if travelling for a short trip and only have small hand luggage allowance on plane we did not have breakfast included as was cheaper for us to go to a nearby cafe an amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around if i remember rightly and it was delicious sandwiches cakes etc and all homemade additionally there is a lovely terrace outside at the back of the property where you can sit and relax and make use of the bar menu the nachos and potatoes were not the best would definitely recommend and stay again,1.0
room were clean and the hotel is easily accessible from the international airport a ride would be around check in staff are helpful and polite rooms were comfortable and meet basic needs,1.0
stayed nights on business attending a conference at the hotel the location is not really central which in this instance was not a problem the hotel has some nice design elements although can not be deemed a design hotel strictly speaking the rooms are rather standard clean with recent furnishing you will note that the website advertise the rooms as then mentions a surface of sq m so i guess it all depends on your own definition front desk was helpful both at and when ordering a taxi overall the hotel is good value and could be considered for leisure as well notwithstanding its location,1.0
we stayed at banks mansion between the and july the location was absolutely perfect for everything on arrival we were given room which despite being quite big was very dark i am partially sighted with a view out onto the street there was no noise as the room must have been sound proofed but it was the darkness i did like went straight to reception and the room was changed for which despite being smaller than the first was light and airy with a canal view perfect and thank goodness it was changed the bed was amazingly comfortable and so were the pillows normally when i go abroad i tend not to sleep too well but i did at banks mansion i also kept referring to it as home which is a great accolade as normally hotels are like that the breakfast was great and a perfect way to start the day fresh eggs etc cooked to order pancakes fruit yoghurt meat cheeses bread etc and copious amounts of and fresh orange juice i loved the cheese and saucisson at a lovely little pick me up before heading out for the evening the hotel is central to everything and we were amazed that a minute walk got us to rembrandt square and pretty much everything else we loved getting in after a hard days sightseeing and being able to have a hot chocolate enjoyed with a waffle that had been left in our room the shower was wonderful and fresh,1.0
just staid for one night and did not use the restaurant for dinner only breakfast rooms are ok but with little attention to detail breakfast buffet is nice with good variety incl some healthy options location is very convenient and relatively close to the centre the lobby and restaurant look nice but the hallways and rooms clearly are one level below room was also a bit noisy towards the hall not the street,1.0
set only minutes from the heart of dublin city and only for one night this is great value for moneythe rooms were clean and well presented and there is a very powerful shower to wake you up in the morningthe location is very secure as you must leave your key with reception upon entry and there is a hour security for when you come back late in the nighti will be back,1.0
the hotel is located right in the middle of temple bar all the visits can be made walking and you get a plethora of choices in the evening if you want to listen to music in a nice pub the hotel has a very nice design with large cosy and comfortable rooms and good bathrooms wifi is free and quick the breakfast has a good choice and is of good quality warning however if you come during the week end the bar becomes some kind of trendy night club and the whole hotel becomes extremely noisy,1.0
booked this hotel for a visit overnight to see coldplay in concert euro reserved on card met with a rather abrupt receptionist who handed us our key and left us to it up a narrow staircase we found our room brown musty loose fitting carpet flowed from the downstairs right up into our room the beds were at an l shape never seen before a door mat was set in front of one bed obviously to wipe your feet when getting out of bed sitting on the creaky bed i looked up to see that upstairs had leaked a lot of water that had run down the walls and dried in black spot everywhere the window rattled all night and when we woke up the next morning the sun shone through the moth holes in the curtains euro and not even a breakfast really disgraceful how do these people get away with calling that place a hotel a dog hotel would be more apt shameful and quite insulting that the owner would assume people would gladly stay and pay for the exceptionally poor excuse of accommodation,0.0
if you looking for the large lobby elevators cookie cutter chain hotel this is not for you but if you like to stay in a quirky place with a lot of local charm this place is awesome we had a large room with sufficient space for our family of clean lovely decorated small but functional bathroom very friendly staff check in was a breeze we were given a small package with maps discounts and happenings in the area breakfast had a good selection of cold meats cheese and pastries location was great just one block from the reijks museum bus and tram and even a boat tour company to get a sense of the architecture of amsterdam would definitely come back next time we are in amsterdam just be aware that although there is a tiny elevator there are steep steps everywhere so it might not be suitable for persons with restricted mobility,1.0
room the room itself was basic the bed was very comfortable and clean and the shower worked as it should was also very effective the safe could be rented with a deposit of euros which was returned wifi was particularly fast but it was alright and connected easily enough we were happy with almost all apart from one were really helpful and friendly you had to give in the key when leaving and collect when returning the staff were casual and friendly unlike many hotels i visited over the years breakfast very basic bread which you could toast cured meat ham cheese shrink wrapped croissants and cakes yogurt limited fruit oranges and bananas orange juice and tea and coffee sometimes there was less of a selection as the guy who was looking after breakfast most mornings did exactly rush to fill things up we did get a bit bored of this but it was ok for a bit of something to start the great location about minutes walk to las ramblas and the sagrada familia minutes to the beach metro station was too far away for those journeys where we did want to walk as much for us it was ideal not in the touristy bit and in an area where you saw real citizens of the it was a basic hotel with helpful staff and in a good location we did really hear noise from other guests either we would stay there in a sort of apartment building so,1.0
we stayed at hotel curious for nights the staff were welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble our room was very small but your in barcelona so we were hardly in it it was furnished well and clean the breakfast had enough choice for us and we even had the choice of an early breakfast on the day of our hotel is in a great location being just off les rambles i would recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to barcelona,1.0

hotel very clean and comfortable we had a river view room and there was not much noise from the road breakfast was very good with a good choice hotel location was only a short walk away from the city centre so a great location the only annoying thing about the hotel is the music that they play in reception it did get really annoying after sitting there for a while staff were very friendly and helpful,1.0

i was visiting amsterdam for a days during the open gardens weekend booked this hotel using some of my accor hotels points the ink hotel is connected to sofitel who are part of that loyalty program with the discount that brings i reserved a junior suite it was really lovely quietly tucked away at the back of the hotel overlooking an inner courtyard the ink hotel is in a historical old building which used to be the home of a dutch newspaper so enjoys a nice stylish quirky design with typewriters and interesting typeface on the walls etc the suite was a really good size large luxurious shower bathroom corner sofa and lots of storage and a nice big comfy bed i did get much chance to hang out in the room but when i was there it was a joy to be staff were super helpful and friendly the buffet breakfast was around euro extra a day i think but well worth it really good choice of fresh fruit cheeses meat cereals bread and bakery goods as well as lots of hot food the lady who seated and helped me there deserved a special mention did catch her name but she was really friendly and smiley too the hotel is in a good location around minutes from dam square amsterdam is a really beautiful walkable city and all the canals where i was visiting gardens was around a minute definitely stay here again if i ever back in amsterdam,1.0
the davenport hotel is located near the center of dublin ireland just a block north of merrion square it is also located about a block east of trinity college and several blocks south of the river liffey it is also located next to the house were oscar wilde grew up it is now some type of small college the hotel is located about miles from dublin international airport or approximately minutes by taxi longer if you are in rush hour stayed here for nights in late may with my wife and youngest daughter and thought the hotel was nice and also thought it was in a great location near many major tourist attractions we paid a night for a triple room one king size bed and a twin bed which i thought was pretty reasonable breakfast was not included and was euros per day per person i thought the lobby and bar area were nice looking and i also liked my hotel room the carpet and furniture were updated in addition the room was above average in size the front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given only complaint was the poor breakfast service the main breakfast room was full so we had to go to the bar area where the guy working there was lazy and would not help us i thought he was a dishwasher or cleaning person we had to walk back into the other area and ask,1.0
i have visited the hotel end may for about days at the executive level on the floor while the room was very accommodating and had a balcony i would not advise the executive floor at least not on the front side for the simple reason that the floor is the conference level and i was suffering the whole night from hearing furniture and chairs being dragged on the floor for the rest it has been a perfect stay great remodeling super location and fantastic friendly staff actually i am returning there pretty soon mind you this is the first hotel that i visited in athens that provides sockets on both sides of the bed and at the desk at reach level so one can charge the phone and the batteries and without having to crawl underneath the furniture to find one the restaurant at ground level is just perfect but the view on the floor restaurant is breathtaking and unbeatable,1.0
we chose this hotel because of location and price we were completely pleased gorgeous hotel beautiful fountain out front great staff and close to everything would definitely stay again,1.0
recommended by a friend we spent four nights at the hoxton the staff is superb everyone is friendly and helpful and full of great recommendations for restaurants and things to do around town the location is in the canal section of town and second to none in terms of centrality and the ability to walk wherever you had breakfast at the hotel restaurant our first morning and like most other meals in amsterdam it was perfectly cooked plated and presented by a great wait staff the room we had faces the canal and though small has everything you need as well as an incredibly comfortable bed i having a hard time thinking of a negative aspect to this hotel but if there is i say the ac in the room could be more consistent some nights it was great other nights not so good aside from that this is a terrific place to stay when in amsterdam and we would definitely stay here again if we return,1.0
while we have stayed on several occasions at this hotel it was the last visit gave me the push to give a staff are very professional and welcoming but particularly at the receptionthe rooms are perfect and well equippedthe location is terrific being in and very accessible to dublin by foot or public transport this is most relevant to us as regular visitors to the city to see our children family and friendsconvenient parking is chargeable nightly but we did not need to exit till pm that eveningbreakfast is well worth the extra a nice practical pleasant place to stay and compares very favourably with other hotels in the suffers the common problem in the tourist season of higher prices than the rest of the year,1.0

we needed to stay in amsterdam for night on the way from belgium back home in hong kong we chose swissotel because of good experience with them in other countries and because of the location we would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
it was great to see such a stunning hotel after a long bit of travel to get there the lobby is gorgeous the staff is extremely welcoming and the rooms are perfectly appointed my one tiny issue would be with the layout of the shower which has a half glass partition and makes it slightly difficult to run the shower without getting soaked aside from that this room was modest in size but so beautifully furnished that it did feel cramped one bit the location was central and easy to walk around many of the sites i would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting dublin,1.0
we had a great experience at hotel balmoral lovely spacious modern clean rooms no issues with anything great location in the city for us close to diagonal metro station hardly heard anything from other guests perhaps the roof terrace could benefit from allowing food drinks out there but honestly in a city with as much to do as barcelona it was no hardship would definitely stay here again,1.0
good location within walking distance of most tourist stops with tram stop a half block away our room on the ground floor street side was small and you could hear some street noise only one chair so the other person had to sit on the bed or at the desk shower with steam no tub prior to arrival we emailed the concierge for help making a restaurant reservation and got a reply but the reservation was not made once there staff were friendly and helpful breakfast buffet was good with eggs cooked to order fresh squeezed oj nice variety which changed slightly daily for those who take advantage of the free alcohol wine and cheese this hotel is probably worth the price lobby was comfortable although not enough seating during in the evening we prepaid the entire stay but were surprised with a rather hefty city tax to be paid upon departure,1.0

following a day trip through ireland we spent our last three nights at the schoolhouse hotel in dublin the structure of the hotel is an old private parochial schoolhouse the setting is quaint and the hotel staff is very friendly the rooms are very clean and modern my only issue was that the wireless internet in the room was weak or i went down to the lobby and was told that the hotel had been experiencing internet problems throughout which also affected their computer operations i used my wifi hotspot and all was well the pub was excellent the breakfast in the restaurant was also very good and open at would stay at the schoolhouse again and recommend it to others,1.0
the hotel is very old like a bit of a haunted house the staff is very friendly helpful the rooms are very nice but big problem we saw a baby rat in our room the vibe of the hotel is amazing old type hotel i wouldnt stay there again,0.0
we have just returned from a night stay in this hotel firstly i would like to say that whoever gave this place a star rating needs to go back and check again on arrival the first thing that struck us was the overwhelming smell of stale cooking the triple room we paid over for was the size of a postage stamp with not enough room to move around in one of the beds was so near the entrance door that we had to keep pushing it back so that we could close double bed was pushed right up against the wardrobe with very little space between that bed and the single one to give an indication of how small this room was the tea and coffee facilities were in the wardrobe because there was no space for them anywhere else the bathroom had no space to move around in and had a damp mouldy smell we were told that toiletries would be supplied so bought none with us but all that was provided was a hand wash by the sink and an empty shower gel dispenser in the shower we queried this and were told we could have some toiletries that other guests had left behind our room was next to the fire exit door but when we looked there were stacks of chairs a folded up table broken mirrors with shards of glass all over the floor and a henry hoover blocking the stair case not the easiest or,0.0
really nice hotel with good facilities the staff are however extremely slow particularly on reception for some reason there can be a que of guests and just two people on reception there is also not a separate hhonurs reception for members which is very unusual,0.0
the staff at the hotel were excellent and went out of there way to help well worth going to the roof top bar great views of the dock area nice walk into the centre of dublin along the river providing it is not raining,1.0
i spent the weekend here with friends and we share a room for we thought it would be a tiny room but were surprised with a very nice room with queen size beds made of individual beds each and a very clean bathroom which is always key for hotel itself is very nice as an art hotel it has a lot of paintings and artsy designs in display that you can take a look at it is very well located not too far away from the city about min by bus and the bus stop is around m from the is included and it has great variety and taste great and the backyard has a wonderful value for the price for sure,1.0
i knew the was told the hotel is so hip and the concept is young and fresh and it is so much so however it not that kind of a place that leave you feeling old like some trendy young type of hotels lobby is amazing the layout is so cool it calm yet hip if you can have both they managed to find the balance we had a fabulous guy serving us a great drinks here he is ellissio from italy in the hotel bar and he was friendly and knew how to care for guests ride to center station is a minute free ride with a fast ferry loved it will come back,1.0
liked everything about this place bed was so very comfortable rooms were well insulated from noise funky bathroom great selection for breakfast decent location would certainly stay here again only minus point was when we checked in late at night the member of staff was terribly helpful as we struggled with the self thanks for the cookies for my husband birthday too they made a great midnight snack,1.0

we have just returned from a whirlwind stay in barcelona thoroughly enjoyed ourselves we stayed for nights and though we did spend much time in the hotel we were more than satisfied the hotel is modern with a small but pleasant reception area the young man who booked us in was very cheerful helpful our room was modern relatively spacious with a walk in shower in the bathroom open double wardrobe in the main bedroom area the hotel is about mins walk from laccuna metro station about a min walk to the beach if you turn right out of the hotel and walk for mins until you get to a cross roads there is a tree lined avenue full of bars cafes restaurants with lots of people milling around lovely to see lots of choice if you want to stay near the beach but still within easy striking distance of the centre than hotel is a good shout,1.0
stayed here for days july in barcelona we alighted at metro station arc de triomph and walked towards the direction of hotel and initially found the location to be bit weird in between narrow lanes was bit skeptical whether chose the right one but all our concerns were cleared once we entered the hotel and checked into our room really cosy room and neat clean bathroom very comfortable bed and good air conditioning later during the day we realized that our stay was indeed very close to the gothic area of the city which was amazing with its architecture and narrow alleys apart from that the most famous area las rambla was also walkable from our location breakfast spread was really good manager at the reception was more than happy to serve the breakfast half an earlier when we requested that we have to go for an early sight seeing trip late nights you might feel the place to be slightly deserted but we never felt any safety issues overall a very good place to stay in barcelona room rates are slightly on the higher side though but not complaints,1.0

this hotel is located in a very desirable beautiful charming location in the city it is very convenient to the major tourist sites mostly by walking although we did take the metro at times the taxi were also a good value el prat and the port were only to minutes away you are surrounded by excellent restaurants in a quaint area of the city away from the hustle and bustle of other areas the hotel is very nice rooms beds cleanliness breakfast pool but what really influenced my rating was the customer service the entire staff was helpful and able to communicate very well in english and other languages they went above and beyond to help in anyway they could mario gave us a free bottle of cava to celebrate our wedding anniversary which was very much appreciated i ca say enough wonderful things about the hotel location and staff i would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this to anyone traveling to barcelona,1.0

we stayed here for one night in june the location is great on a very quaint street across from a small park it removed enough to be quiet with some nice pubs around the corner but a close enough walk to the center of town as to not feel isolated definitely has a boutique feel the entire staff was great breakfast was excellent the bar area is really charming as is the dining area the whole premises have a great rooms at least ours felt like it could have used a bit updating we had it did seem to match the quality of the rest of the property or some of the pictures of nicer looking rooms we saw online but we were only staying the one night and i sure they have nicer rooms on the premises this would be the one mark against it the room we had did seem to match the rest of the experience especially for the price all in all though seems a nice hotel and a solid choice when in dublin,1.0
i was very excited when a i booked this hotel and understood it would be small rooms considering it was in an plus old house right on the canal the hotel had great reviews and great photos on arrived late at approx am and given our rooms unfortunately our twin year boys where given a double bed to share when we had requested two singles however we were so tied and hoped this would be rectified in the morning it also did not assist the check in process failed as there was a computer issue and the night staff came to our room at am to say the system is now working and could i pay for the room i would have thought this could have occurred in the morning the morning a spoke to the duty manager and stated i was disappointed about our twin year old boys sharing a small double bed when we requested singles i also stated the rooms were not big enough as the door to the room and bathroom could not even fully open and you had to step over your bags in the room to get in and out of bed basically it is the smallest room i stayed in and i stayed in plenty of small rooms in europe before the photos supplied by the hotel of a small room is misleading if a knew it was so small i would not have booked this hotel the staff member basically stated i,0.0
i can not recommend this hotel enough it is the perfect place to stay in barcelona a quiet oasis in this beautiful city it is a euro minute taxi ride from the airport all the major attractions were a euro taxi ride area feels very safe it is very close to la pedrera minute walk and casa batllo minute walk there are plenty of good restaurants close by there is a fantastic bakery around the corner in hotel praktik which does amazing and very reasonably priced pastries for breakfast and delicious baguettes for a packed lunch if you going out for the day pastries filled baguettes a fruit pot and a cake came to only euros there is a small shop a few streets away a few doors up from the tiasanta restaurant that sells chocolate churros which are to die for there is a hour supermarket next door where you can buy water drinks extra milk for snacks etc the hotel is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean the pools and sun loungers are lovely the courtyard is peaceful with shady areas to sit if the sun is too hot the roof terrace has amazing views including la pedrera the room was an excellent size with a lovely big bathroom with double shower the toiletries were great too the bed was huge and so comfortable the air conditioning worked really well my husband took his own nespresso pods from home so he enjoyed his morning coffees using the nespresso machine,1.0
this is a pleasant clean hotel with a great location we always choose our hotels for location and this delivered although just a star hotel we could not have asked for a better location it was perfect clean had a swimming pool and served a reasonable breakfast included in our rate all staff were friendly and extremely helpful we emailed ahead with some and they came back immediately helping in every way possible our room was great we had the top floor with a large balcony comprising sun loungers tables and chairs all with a roof top view could not have asked for more the room and bathroom was modern with a huge bed and exceptionally clean we would advise anyone to read the blurb on the hotel as tea and coffe was not supplied in the room however this was not a problem for my coffee addict husband we took a travel kettle with us water was not supplied in the room however a supermarket close by sold bottles reasonably priced there is no concierge however the reception staff are on hand to answer any questions about this city we purchased the open top bus tour through the hotel saving us a couple of euros there is no entertainment here just a bar with little atmosphere buy hey you are in the heart of barcelona go out into this beautiful city and embrace it it right on your door step we enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate,1.0

the herbert park hotel is a beautiful and relaxing hotel just outside the heart of dublin cityit has very professional staff both front of house and behind the scenes the only grievance i would have is the cleaning staff came in to our room at while myself and partner were asleep this took us by shock as we were away for a couples night,1.0

stay here for days on the june and had the best time ever the hotel is in the centre but i liked that seeing the quite side of amsterdam got to the hotel by bus took less than half an hour and literally from the bus stop about minute walk to the we travelled into the city using the tram and bought a hour tram bus and metro card for we bought this from the hotel the rooms were cleaned every day of our visit the only thing that i thought needed improving was the ice machine on level every day of our visit did have cups or ice had to go down levels for the mini bar in the room was none existent just an old mini bar fridge that had been but apart from that loved our stay here and would defiantly visit again has a lidl about minute walk away with a takeaway and other shops near buy for snacks etc so we never bought from hotel,1.0
what a find this hotel was the main reason for booking as it was the closest one available to my office in amsterdam but upon arrival i could instantly tell this was a family run hotel who are proud of what they beautiful lady greeted me and checked me in even took me down to my room and gave a little tour and explanation of the facilities a nice touch the room was spacious as was the bathroom with a shower large enough to fit a family not one for continental breakfasts but at hotel fita they also provide eggs and bacon and also freshly made to order pancakes again a nice can not fault the staff at all always smiling and always helpful location wise its great because its away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough to walk to or even hop onto a tram you have a number of museums on your door step and also one street away from your high end stores such as versace if that you thing guys if you brining your wife maybe this is the place to stay there were a couple of things that would have made my stay a bit more comfortable which is why i only gave do not have air con now whilst im sure of the year this would be an issue the day i arrived was quite warm and air con would have been a god send also the room i was given,1.0
my sister and i arrived late on saturday evening and were welcomed by senne i might not have remembered her name but the lovely dutch receptionist and directed to our newly decorated room on the floor the room was lovely and had the most fantastic view it has everything you need good shower nice towels changed daily lots of hanging space and really comfy day on the floor there are snacks and drinks overseen by the charming adriana nespresso coffee apples sweets and ham rolls we did eat much but it was a nice touch and great for a cold drink after an afternoon by the rooftop rooftop pool is gorgeous big comfortable beds and chairs for the daytime and a cocktail vibe in the evenings a fantastic addition to the staff at this bar were friendly and efficient in fact i would say that the staff are among the friendliest and most efficient i have encountered the pluses of this hotel if i were to choose great staff clean and beautifully laid out rooftop pool and bar amazing views lots of nice little luxury touches in the rooms and even the hallway and finally good value for money it euros in a cab to the ramblas cab stand outside and there is plenty to do and see around the hotel ca think of a single moan i already planning my return trip,1.0
if you need a good and relaxing place after a long trip do go to the catalonia park putxet in has no access for people with disabilities i supposed that was a must for hotels but i guess i was wrong it had a fake electric chair to get down the steps to go check in but it was not working it was there for show only hoping i believe nobody would need staff was very rude unaccommodating and in no uncertain terms told me to go somewhere else because they did need to accommodate me well i did after i demanded it they sent me to another hotel for the same price and paid for my had never seen or met anybody as rude in the hotel business or anywhere else for that matter anywhere in the world,0.0
this hotel is located right on la rambla it has great restaurants nearby and you can catch the metro nearby too the hotel offers a breakfast so you can eat until you are stuffed with lots of choices to satisfy anyone taste buds it is a very clean hotel but make sure you do get a back room as the apartment next door can be loud the market is just across the street and down a block where you will find the most wonderful experience in culinary delights it is a must visit if you are lucky enough to be there for barcelona biggest festival in september you will have parades going by every few hours on friday saturday and sunday,1.0
my family and i stayed here for nightsthe staff were extremely friendly and welcoming the rooms neat and location within walking distance to beaches restaurants and public transport overall an amazing experience and would strongly recommend to all,1.0
price considered this was one of the most disappointing and poor value for money stays in a hotel i have experienced every staff member we spoke to during our stay lacked any sort of cheer and nobody seemingly wanted to be there for example it took us three attempts of asking to have additional pillows for the room the room itself was clean on arrival but by the end we were even getting new coffee and rooms themselves are very basic and seemed to be furnished with a will do attitude for example the curtains do reach the bottom of the window so light will always get in a quarter of our room was taken up by a desk which had no chair the shower had terrible drainage and almost no lip meaning every shower the room would flood there is no air conditioning unit in the room instead we got a rickety old fan which seemed the type from a bargain bin at a hardware store there is a thermostat thing it did do anything the hotel did offer extra services like breakfast and bike hire but all at a ridiculous surcharge breakfast was per person and bike hire was plus a deposit per bike we were surprised the wifi was free you could buy separate items for breakfast but they seemed to have gotten the price list from a budget a side note avoid the east restaurant at all cost there is a review on my profile the,0.0
my husband and i stated here for two nights in this beautiful stayed in a junior suite the room was very a very quiet relaxed atmosphere where a var menu was available with fantastic there was some construction works being carried out at the entrance but it did bother us,1.0
the rooms were decent size compared to city centre hotels we have seen in other cosmopolitan cities upon entry there was some smell of damp locked in but it was readily auctioned upon as a cleaner was sent there was a strong smell from bathroom drain which we also told the staff about the location is very central for acropolis and most of the sites lots of places to eat nearby room service is very reasonable priced all the receptionists and porters were very very friendly a ramp would have been really helpful as we had to lift the buggy over the steps only though every time can book again if available at sensible price whenever we go again,1.0
we decided to go to barcelona at the last moment so it was almost imposible to find a room the hostal paris solved the problem although they only had a room with a shared bathroom everyday the bathroom was clean we never had a problem with a busy bathroom the checkin was good and the employees were very helpful and attentive the hostal is close to everything and public transportation is very accesible near food shops pharmacy bus stop metro station important site seeing everything is close,1.0
a lovely hotel find in the northern area of athens very near kifisia we were very impressed with the service and helpfulness of all the staff the room we had was lovely with a very large sitting area outside and lots of space to relax the spaces in this hotel are amazing from the main dining space and sitting area to the lovely deck outside the hotel exudes an air of calm and its easy to relax and just watch the world go by we did venture out to kifisia which is a lovely little area to explore with great eateries and went into town by the metro which was very easy the food here is good but i would also recommend eating locally to make the most of your time here thanks very much we will be back,1.0
after much research we chose the waldorf for our night stay in amsterdam what a perfect choice the location was within easy walking distance to all the major museums and attractions the service was impeccable from to room and bath was beautiful free and each night we returned to a little treat in our room with a thoughtful staff takes care of your every need without being overbearing had breakfast in the restaurant each morning lunch one afternoon and drinks in the vault bar one is what all luxury hotels should aspire to if we return to amsterdam we will definitely stay here again,1.0

i stayed at the w amsterdam perhaps times or so since it opened a couple of years ago in truth i had very mixed experiences there ranging from great to terrible most of the past negatives were the result of inadequate experience or training of hotel associates however during my last few stays i have expressed some of my service concerns to the staff at the w and i am pleased to report that i have noticed great improvements in service levels there are still kinks to be worked out but i happy to say that service levels are improving with time particularly around consistency of service level between different associates kudos to the team at the w and i will certainly be staying again i stayed thousands of nights in hotels and there are some very unique pro about this property try the rooftop pool long enough for short laps and incredible views an amazing spa in the bank building is actually quite nice but underutilized you be the only ones great centrum location if you runner you can run down and around vondelpark just to the south of the hotel a solid run if you into shopping or eating you be right in the middle of the spg platinum breakfast at the duchess is elegant and thanks to some memorable hotel associates charlie orlando yannick and andre look forward to seeing you all again soon,1.0

we were in amsterdam from july we stayed at this hotel based on reviews from tripadvisor the hotel is in a former office building but let that dissuade you it is fantastic inside it is funky chic modern and very clean the people working the desk the bar and the restaurant are extremely helpful the breakfast every morning is fantastic made to order and we heard that the dinner is great we had dinner at the bar one night and it was excellent the hotel had bicycles to rent and we took advantage of them if you ride you are about minutes from just about anywhere in the city that you might want to hotel is right by the amstel station which is serviced by the metro and by trains and by various tram and bus lines this makes it very easy to get to centraal station the airport or the museum area however there is not very much within a five or ten minute walk in terms of restaurants or bars or shops if you know this it makes it much easier to plan your is a great place to stay the beds are nice the bathroom is very big shower only and the area around the hotel is very residential,1.0
we stayed here to use the metro to the airport the metro is two blocks away and goes to the airport with no changes the hotel was good well appointed room with a nice bathroom great water pressure and hot water lots of cafes and coffee shops very close by included is a buffet breakfast nothing unusual there most of the fruit is canned but there are other choices eggs yogurt breads sweets cereals cheese olives coffee and juice perfect location for us and a decent price,1.0

from the initial booking checking that the height of our vehicle would fit in the car park amendment to booking through to our two night stay for people we could not have been treated better the staff at this hotel are all so attentive nothing was too much trouble the hotel was spotless and its unusual layout added to the character and experience breakfast is without doubt value for money and sets you up for a day sightseeing early evening drinks on the terrace followed by excellent food in the vaults is also not to be missed if your lucky enough to be served by hazel and brendan you are in for a real treat especially great if you have children thank you for making our short break such a good one,1.0

stayed with husband and son for a long weekend location is fab very close to beach and fab restaurants cafes and bars a stones throw from the hotel due to recent surgery i have mobility issues so this was just perfect we walked to beach and picked up tour bus which allowed us to see barcelona without much walking pool is small but sufficient for our needs no pool bar but plenty of supermarkets round about to buy your own drinks etc that you can have at pool no towels either so most people used towels from their room did have breakfast in the hotel as plenty of places round about to try rooms are a good size and very clean air conditioning very effective perfect location for us and we will definitely return,1.0
just had my first stay at the clarence i loved it the staff was magnificently friendly and helpful the design of the building and the rooms are elegant and very stylish my room was generously sized for a european hotel and mine was a standard room i did have any meals except a simple breakfast only issue with this place is the noise of the burger joint in the place next door but i knew this neighborhood would be lively at night and my jet lag was so intense that i had no trouble sleeping through the noise in my very comfortable bed,1.0
i made a reservation for my birthday for my daughter and my self with beds the room was ready so i went to the pool deck i asked the pool attendant for sunscreen she gave me her own because the hotel did provide her with any i asked to call down to see if my room was available she said there was no phone that she had to use her own cell phone she told me she was an intern she was very sweet but very inexperienced it turned out that the staff were temporarily interns when i got my room it was the size of a postage stamp there was only one bed i had a cold and when i complained they told me there was no other room available they said that they never guarantee how many beds the room was so tiny we cold not fit a roll away in it the staff was sweet but were not honest in meeting our needs on top of that my daughters watch went missing never to be found do stay at this hotel,0.0

rooms are clean and simple with hardwood floors the location is perfect for walking around athens and seeing the sites the free breakfast on the rooftop can not be beat we stayed before and after our cruise and stayed in two different rooms the first nights we stayed overlooking the temple of zeus floor the view was great however there is a lot of traffic noise all day and night it was fun to watch the crazy motorcycles from the balcony after our cruise we had a no view room out our window was a deserted office building wrapped in large black tarps this room was definitely not as welcoming with the black tarps right outside the window the cost of the hotel seems high based on the rooms and amenities however the room was very clean the staff was nice doormen were always helpful breakfast was fresh and delicious internet was available but very slow and difficult to load any pages,1.0
if you book this place because you trying to stay at a name brand and avoid the uncertainties that come with obscure boutique hotels you may be quite were sent to someone else room apparently housekeeping had not updated who had left and who had the room key was highly problematic throughout the room phone is tricky to use housekeeping is very very poor there is a mention about green choice and not changing your sheets or towels but there no way to opt out so if you prefer clean bedsheets you wo get them there was no change of linen for nights bathroom amenities are not replenished so if you staying days you need to make do with the amenities you received the first day repeated calls to front desk for toiletries went unanswered laundry was undelivered after days room incorrectly mentions complimentary tea service on the top floor when what they mean is there tea bags in your room that you can use housekeeping does not vacuum or clean the bathroom to test placed the shower gel cap in the middle of the bathroom floor found it right there upon return overall this place feels like a motel definitely not at par with other a beautiful rooftop restaurant though with great views of amsterdam and breakfast buffet has a wide spread with waffles breads cereals salads yoghurts hot foods and location is also a plus point because it away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but very,0.0

my husband and i stayed at waterloo house for three nights at the end of may and could not have been more pleased the location is ideal for visiting dublin the airport aircoach stop is a couple blocks from the house and public buses into city center pick up just a few doors down the street only used them once however as it is an easy and enjoyable walk from waterloo house into downtown dublin the neighborhood is quiet and feels safe with numerous shops and restaurants in short walking distance the georgian house is charming and our room at the back of the house was sizable and very clean with a spacious bath and comfortable bed lovely view out on the garden and the rooftops beyond there was some barking from the resident dogs at the start of each night but they soon quieted down so it was not a problem fabulous breakfasts with a variety of cooked options in addition to an extensive buffet the staff were attentive and accommodating especially irene who was most helpful and and welcoming although the steps up to the front door are rather steep the house does have an elevator which i believe can also be accessed from a ground floor entrance if stairs are a problem all in all a delightful and memorable stay for our first visit to dublin,1.0

we stayed at this lovely hotel for nights in july the location is perfect in that it is within the picturesque streets area there are lots of cafes and restaurants small independents rather than chains and it is great to watch the boats on the canals the hotel has a lovely garden terrace where you can enjoy food and drink or just chill the pulitzer bar and restaurant janz are both top class and i would highly recommend them canal houses have been converted into a hotel so rooms are unusual and stairs can be steep although there are lifts the concierges are extremely helpful and taking their advice can really make your stay hotel has a daily boat tour in a special vintage boat that is well worth the charge,1.0

this is an older hotel but beautifully renovated the rooms are very nice about average size the staff is very friendly and helpful our luggage did not arrive on time and they were very helpful the rooftop terrace is the key attraction here wonderful breakfast with a great view of the acropolis you can use many of the amenities of the sister property next door i recommend the cigar lounge for a good relaxing time will definitely stay here again,1.0
a beautiful calm oasis in a relatively untouristy area of the city but still just a short taxi ride to the city center rooms are quiet and have an elegant simplicity staff is very helpful and most speak excellent english as we had an early am flight could not take advantage of the michelin starred restaurant but the continental breakfast served en suite was delicious the exercise room spa and swimming pool were also pleasant surprises will definitely return when next in barcelona,1.0
a great little boutique hotel with lovely views of the canal everyone was so helpful and friendly and the owners were kind enough to provide a bottle of cava in the room for my birthday thank you all for a great stay,1.0
i have tried many intercontinental hotel and the hotel keeps its promises the rooms are great clean good spacious and great breakfast service is generally efficient we took a suite and a family room and stayed nights overall concierge services are disappointing though we asked for a restaurant and were proposed one with a nice view but food was really not good an nowhere like a greek restaurant but more like a tourist trap we also asked for a pharmacy on sunday and were advised a pharmacy which was closed luckily the taxi had an app with all open pharmacies on sunday and brought us there he also advised us a great greek restaurant walking distance from the hotel we also did get our luggage from airport and asked the concierge to help but we did get any news luckily the airport sent the luggage hours later concierge services need some action plan,1.0
nice hotel had all the amenities close walking distance to all the tourist sites many restaurants and cafes close by nice rooftop restaurant good variety of choicesfor breakfast dinner is also nice at the recommend this hotel for those planning a trip to athens,1.0
the holiday inn express dublin city is a new well designed hotel with decent size modern rooms that have a safe full length mirror good tv and comfy bed fairly small bathroom but it has good counter space and a nice walk in shower very good breakfast and excellent service by the staff great location within an easy walk to temple bar and other areas of the city and with bus stops right outside the hotel for the dublin bus tour buses airport bus etc,1.0
my only request would be that to get to your room you have the option of using the stairwell lifts were very busy at times for some reason stairwell could only be used in a emergency we had a lovely stay here rooms very clean staff very helpful and friendly close to city centre we would use this hotel again,1.0
even though under construction the hotel is lovely it is located literally in the cent from everything so you can just walk somewhere if you want to the staff were really friendly and the rooms were getting clean often and quickly the staff deal with your queries immediately i loved my stay there,1.0
when we first arrived there was a bit of a mix up with our room that the staff fixed as fast as they could our room was rather spacious the food was good but make sure you get down early out much of it will be gone,1.0
loud music until am every night no accommodations made to help filter the noise light curtain on window no air conditioner no sound insulation whatsoever at one point in the night i wanted to stuff the single bed mattress covers and pillows against the window to block out the noise all they gave was ear plugs our adult children were traveling with us and enjoyed the club the first night however they had an early flight out the second night and did get any sleep even though their room was around the corner from the was a real issue as we were aware of the fact that we had to park several blocks away with a discounted staff is courteous and very friendly rooms are dated but adequate,0.0
i have been in quite a lot of hotels but this one is certainly above average the rooms are clean and spacious enough with very high ceilings the rooftop bar and pool are really nice after a day of traveling or walking in the city and the personnel are very kind and helpful last but not least the breakfast is great,1.0
from the moment i entered i was already impressed this hotel oozes luxury i had so many beautiful photos but due to a dodgy phone i have been unable to retrieve them for this review the staff go above and beyond to make your stay so lovely we received in a room i would personally live in it was so elegantly decorated and absolutely spotless we stayed days and it was cleaned daily on our first evening going for drinks in the bar the receptionist noticed us trying to take photos and offered to take them for us it is so difficult to get a good photo on a couple holiday she was so kind she would have stood there all evening to help us out it was so sweet i being a major rugby fan loved the fact that our room over looked the aviva best was yet to come when we went to breakfast the following morning wow i have never seen such a selection in a hotel every fried food you could possibly think of different varieties of eggs even tough it was buffet it did not taste at all like b b it was batch cooked nothing was soggy or kind of getting cold it was all superb a firm favourite of mine the cold meats and cheeses had an entire section to themselves along with every bread type known to was a banquet not a breakfast the location of the hotel was ideal arena walking,1.0
we were two families of four with some of us staying nights and other nights overall we were very happy with the divani caravel the rooms were very good sized although we had expected that the triple rooms would have had a true bed for the person not a sleeper breakfast as mentioned is overpriced for what you get if you pay out of pocket but was actually very reasonable when you booked the room with it pool was very nice although we were a bit surprised at the cooler temperature of the pool especially given how hot it had been in athens the two weeks before we arrived service was excellent and they were very helpful in the one area where we ended up having some because the people in our party had been in europe from weeks already we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry ultimately this is more of an expedia issue than a divani one but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service not the laundry facility we were expecting however the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant overall i would say it was good nothing special but it certainly hit the spot and let us get to bed earlier than if we went somewhere for food options there are several,1.0
the shore is only a few minutes away there is a great deal of food options down the road the staff was really great we really liked the bar the bartender was very nice i will stay here the next time i am in town,1.0

it was our first visit to amsterdam and we picked hotel library i spoke with the hotel before booking and they were very nice we let them know that it was our wedding anniversary and our first visit to amsterdam when we arrived at airport it was so easy to get the train and we arrived in central station and we walked to our hotel took us ten mins to walk there on arrival the hotel looked lovely outside and inside was very welcoming we were on the top floor which was very steep at the top i ended up crawling up the stairs as the steps where so tiny but it did put us off the room was lovely clean and the bathroom was amazing there were chocolates and wine out for us because they new it was our wedding anniversary which was a lovely touch we stayed for three nights and liked that there was free coffee and fresh fruit downstairs it was only few minutes away from all the sites and we walked everywhere there were plenty of trams as well we are looking forward to going again in a few months as we enjoyed it so much,1.0
everything excellent about this hotel first and foremost they provided me an early checkin at in the nice reception area big and clean to tram train and metro station amstel station didnt see any supermarket closeby we did had meals included but their restaurants very mostly busy implying that the food and service was also good in suggestion is to provide multiple key cards,1.0
the hotel is in need in refurb the bathrooms especially but the staff at the hotel are very good people dec from behind the bar is a great asset to the hotel very friendly and welcoming and always going above and was a good selection of food at breakfast and a bar menu at dinner served a good selection of food i would visit the hotel again as the price is a good the rooms are ok and the staff are great,1.0
centrally located clean hospitable and helpful staff and safe this was a perfect landing pad for a family unfamiliar with the area after walking the city and viewing many must see sites we realized what a value and what a great hotel we had found,1.0
the entrance is very nice but the rooms are so dirty i even took some pictures i was shocked there was hair all over the bath and the curtain in the bedroom was ripped and disgusting it a shame because the hotel looks nice and the bed was comfortable but i was uneasy about sleeping in such dirty conditions i wo be staying here again or recommend it i come to barcelona often and i disappointed by my experience,0.0
the hotel is tucked off of a windy road at the base of lycabettus hill it provided wonderful views of athens and the acropolis we had a wonderful dinner at their rooftop restaurant and dessert oh my dessert was heavenly the included breakfast had a pretty varied selection to choose from sour cherry juice is amazing and refreshing a room for two is smaller by american hotel room standards but i expected it so i was bothered by it i did appreciate the bathroom having two doors separating it from the main room this is important when you sharing a room with someone it helped with privacy the room was nicely done and view was amazing as you walk into the room and open the curtain to the balcony you are hit with an awesome view of the acropolis i loved waking up and going to sleep to this view the hotel staff was beyond excellent everyone from concierge the spa and restaurant were very friendly and welcoming as a said they made the start of our trip wonderful thanks st george,1.0
one night after our cruise three rooms they gave us of the rooms at the morning when we arrived from the cruise ship no extra charge great service lovely lovely breakfast expensive but worth every rooms very modern but nice clean look hotel seems a bit dark inside maybe that is the look they hop on hop off bus stops directly outside the hotel by discounted tickets from reception friendly staff,1.0
we booked pillows for the location it is near museums rijksmuseum van gogh a tram stop restaurants churches and the vondelpark it has been remodeled so nearly everything is new clean and efficient no front desk check is vía a hand held device a hour kitchen can cook up a meal in no time breakfast can be ordered or enjoy their continental breakfast a small but cozy lounge wifi internet concierge service why not a higher rating our room for two had a king size bed that took up most of the room not enough space for luggage to out or generally move around very tight quarters for one person let alone two people staff tries hard to please their visitors and they do an excellent job we will stay here again but in a larger room,1.0

i arrived in the ballsbridge hotel with very high expectations due to hearing very good things about it from various people however with the hotel being supposedly and so well renowned it was highly disappointing and is at best average in this day and age having wifi at a pace is an absolute disgrace and having to go down to the lobby in the middle of the night to check your messages is a joke despite having full bars of wifi on your device the wifi still will not work i had to go through the hassle of calling reception on multiple occasions to resolve this issue but the staff at reception always turned the sitatuion around to make it seem like i was the one slowing down the wifi the wifi was and not per room so the mere suggestion of the cause of the problem being me and my devices was from this overwhelming techonolgical difficulty the room was clean spacious and there was a tv and a nice ambience in the hotel as a whole however where the room fell short was the lack of although it is available upon request the room service was extremely overpriced for a portion of fish and chips and there was no air conditioning or any sort of temperature control there was also a bit of stinginess with the lgithing as there was no main lgithing fixure in the room only door was also very creaky so much so that my,0.0
although they are remodeling the hotel they managed to give us an excellent service my youngest daughter is on a wheelchair and they made things easier for her and the family appreciate all the help and care by everyone at the hotel the location is close to las ramblas and other important points of the city but the surroundings are not the best at night,1.0
we stayed here for one night in november for my birthday a surprise from my partner it was perfect amazing location right in the heart of las ramblas the rooftop pool and bar is gorgeous giving great views of parts of the room was nice with a big bed and a lovely bathroom not the biggest room i ever seen but more than big enough the staff were friendly and helpful offering us tips and advice for restaurants and places to return in the future,1.0
we stayed at this hotel two years ago when visiting athens and recently spent a night there again this hotel is great value for a hotel in athens it just two train stops away from syntagma square and the bus from the airport basically stops a half block away from the hotel the lobby and rooms are spotless and they provide a very good complimentary breakfast and are also open for lunch and dinner there are restaurants and pubs within walking distance i would definitely stay here again and highly recommend for an affordable hotel in good location,1.0
dublin is not a cheap place to visit but every now and then a bargain surfaces amongst the greed of a constant roundabout of those that want a bargain and are not worried about a luxurious stay then i can highly recommend trinity college campus accommodation for a stay in may until september when the students are not on site the accommodation can be rented out and for a fraction off the cost of a normal hotel accommodation is basic and by that i mean a bed table wardrobe and for me a shared bathroom and toilet but you get what you paid for and at for a nights accommodation in the heart of dublin it worked to my pockets advantage,1.0
very nice hotel in the central parts of amsterdam it a hotel with personality and good atmosphere you are welcomed by an armor in the reception and there are some collections of other nice things to look at in the lounge we had one of the rooms on top floor so there was a few steps to climb i the steep and narrow stairs but that is okay when you know it and are in kondition to do it no lifts available the breakfast room is bathing in sunshine if it not cloudy of course and there is a just what you need breakfast to choose from as we say in sweden lagom we are very happy to have found this hotel and if we return to amsterdam we will stay at this hotel again,1.0

this hotel is amazingly cheap for what you get the rooms are not fancy at all but they are clean enough and there is air conditioning even if it turns off when you leave room however the location right in the plaka district and close to the acropolis were phenomenal the rooftop of this place was so amazing that we did not even feel the need to go out at night we simply drank wine and beer on the roof and watched as the acropolis lit up at night,1.0

being someone who travels extensively for work i can say i experience my fair share of dump hotels this place however tops them by a good way it pure nasty so where do i begin i start with minor grievance of only towel in a bed room i had towels in a no star hotel in lobito the front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless could not offer alternative room when i complained at the rooms allocated small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it a little on the snug side our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get was the sympathetic front desk reply the all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day the photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of guinness would i be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online to top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of in what way was that even remotely possible the only way i can get my head around that if if the catagory was the,0.0

i was so amazed with this place after a last minute booking and at a great price i was sure what to expect i came here with my best friend and with two large suitcases and a lot of stairs facing us we panicked but the staff were amazing and as soon as they saw us attempt to go up they rushed over and helped us even took the suitcases down for our departure the rooms are small but cozy and you do really notice we requested a room with a canal view and we got it it was so worth asking for it so beautiful to wake up and go to sleep seeing the view the breakfast was above average plenty of options and lots of stroop waffles and if we ever brought food back they let us take cups and cutlery up to our room when we rented a bike from the hotel but i soon learnt i in fact could no longer ride a bike they let us be refunded i am currently in amsterdam at the moment and am heart broken that this place was booked out although i understand why if you looking for location staff value book here,1.0

we have just returned from a fantastic three night stay in dublin could fault this hotel clean modern and with a great bar and restaurant if you need them room was lovely and staff were all really friendly not right in the centre but only a pleasant minute walk to grafton street or you have a tram stop literally right outside we used to walk in during the day and catch the tram home from grafton street at night for minutes later we were back at the hotel perfect and means it just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre loved dublin as a city do expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful welcoming people eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from transport options from the airport were superb we chose the airlink and it dropped us off about a minute walk away the guinness factory is obviously on most people list but the jameson experience is also well worth a visit even if you do do the tour the bar is superb and has a great atmosphere the zoo is also a brilliant visit and great value at,1.0

we visited the hotel days ago when we arrived we were asked to authorise euros this was fine as this was a pretty standard request and allowed us to settle our bill as we left the hotel when we left the hotel charged my card again instead of using the authorised amount my bank explained it will take a long time for the funds to show in my account as available due to being in europe my bank recommended emailing the hotel and asking them to cancel the authorised payment which i did and received no response i am still waiting for this money to be available in my account secondly when we arrived i requested my friends room was near us the manager immediately interrupted and said in a tone you book with a multi million pound company and expect a personalised service take a huge amount of my profit if you wanted a personalised service you should have booked with the hotel direct we had just finished travelling and were feeling a little bit flustered as it was and this was not the welcome we were expecting for the remainder of the trip i felt uncomfortable being in the common areas if the manager was there the hotel is advertised as a art hotel but most of the art covering the hotel is pretty ghastly and gives the building a very confused feel the swimming pools advertised to not belong to the hotel these are public swimming bathes,0.0

am having to right this out of frustration deep annoyance if the way my friends i have been treated by sunotel central we booked rooms back in march around through a booking agency we realised we had made a mistake within hours of the booking so through the agency who called the hotel direct at to try and cancel the rooms they refused to do so stating they had a non cancellation policy it was explained that as the holiday was not until september surely they could take a small cancellation fee but no they stuck to their policy rigidly my friends i worked something out so we could still use out of rooms i called the hotel again requesting they cancel just rooms however again they refused to budge repeating like parrots their no cancellation policy i think a bit of consideration understanding would go along way i only want to cancel rooms which i sure they would be able to re sell before september very unhappy customer who will not be recommending this hotel the rest of it chain ok thanks for letting me vent unfortunately it does get my money back,0.0

it was the last day of our holiday in ireland and i wanted to splurge on a castle hotel i am glad i had chosen clontarf castle because it had all the elements i had wanted in a castle hotel grand and full of history and yet with the modern amenities incorporated we walked past knights armours on the way to the reception area which was uniquely decorated with all shapes and sizes of ancient keys for a moment i thought we were going to be issued one of those to enter our room the room itself blew me away it was spacious and luxurious and comfortable and distinctly star our only regret was that we were only booked for night stay as we had to depart ireland the next day we certainly ended our ireland stay on a high note,1.0

do let the entrance to the hotel worry you from the outside set pretty much in a bustling market the hotel seems like it star but once you get to your room you realise you truly made a great choice by staying here we first got a room on the floor and had to ask to change rooms as the window was literally looking out directly onto another building just a stone throws away it was so claustrophobic we asked to change rooms and we were given the top floor room wow what a difference we were literally looking at the acropolis the bed is comfortable works well loved the laundry service where they do a whole bag of your laundry for a very small fee within hours the breakfast was excellent too varied on different days with extremely friendly staff the location is perfect so close to everything sensational local eateries right around the corner wine bars local shops coffee shops no tourists in sight i would definitely come back if i could be guaranteed a higher floor room the bar on the rooftop has wonderful views just feels like it can do with some more decorating,1.0
the hotel is top nodge big rooms excellent location near the beach their computers run slow though i made a reservation online and it took mode than minutes for my order to be processed stuff is nice you can keep your luggage for free if you want to go places before your plane flies u back as a downside it would be the view from some rooms you see some unused ruined old constructions but who has time to look over the window when in barcelona also the room has one of the nicest bathrooms from any hotel that i visited,1.0

the hotel is well placed close to the old part of the city and a short ish walk to the harbour there is a metro station directly over the road from the hotel the reception area is fairly traditional but the rest of the hotel has been well generally were welcoming and helpful facilities were as you would expect breakfast was a generous buffet with warm croissants and fress orange juice delivered to your table as well as the buffet there is a roof top bar with excellent views which is a good place to sit after a day being a star hotel there were some issues with housekeeping there were insufficient staff to clean the rooms during the day and so on three occasions we returned between and to find the room had not been serviced on talking to the hotel staff this was a regular occurrence there also seemed to be an issue with rooms not being ready at although that did not affect us there were free refreshments on a glass of cava and sound insulation on lower floor rooms was very poor our room was on the second floor above a side street but the noise from outside continued until starting again at about in addition and there is nothing the hotel can do about this one of the metro lines runs directly underneath the hotel and so there was a good deal of vibration every time a train passed,1.0
a very special thank you to the staff at the westbury for a fab afternoon tea food was gorgeous and we were treated like royalty all the staff were extremely attentive especially tin who made us feel very welcome i would highly recommend afternoon tea at the westbury for anyone who wants to spend a special afternoon in the city,1.0
we stayed at this hotel on the advise of a friend who lives in dublin we found it clean quiet and upscale the rooms were large and the housekeeping services were excellent we had one in the bar and the service was extremely slow but perhaps it was just an off night front desk staff was helpful this hotel is a bit of a ride from some of the dublin action but if you are looking for cleanliness and space this is a great option there are fun restaurants and bars nearby and a wonderful park,1.0

staff are top notch and i are the best hotel staff of any hotel i stayed in ireland from the night porter michael whom greeted us at with a cheery smile and friendly manner to the receptionist and the staff at the buffet breakfast each location is on a quiet street very close to saint stephen green and the city center our room was comfortable and very little street noise could be heard the bed was comfortable and the shower was good and the bathroom was very clean buffet breakfast was served with french press coffee that was tasty and was fresh made the bar in the lower floor has a good selection of imported beer and beers from galway brewing company and excellent onion rings i thought parking at euros a night was not overpriced for this central only complaint was that we in early am and slept for a few hours and found it hard to sleep due to other guests slamming their doors,1.0
very helpful staff who had the room organised exactly as required and were very helpful in any requests that we had special thanks to joao silva for the great work would highly recommend to any organisations looking to host an event,1.0
we picked this hotel over another athens hotel because it had dedicated parking and a pool we arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there i was not happy however the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage he was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our got up to our rooms needed to book because of our big family to find twins bed pushed together in each room not the best but it worked the furniture is dated the tvs are ancient smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain it is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere to top it off they charge euro a day for internet access in the room and that is only for devices probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area they have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar however it is a very small pool area it is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground so you can hardly walk around the pool we arrived at the first day at knowing it closes at with kids in tow the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have mins to swim so we should come back tomorrow well my kids were,0.0

after an overnight fight we arrived before noon and were allowed to check in early this was greatly appreciated as we needed to get some sleep unfortunately the room we were given was across the hall from the linen supply room and there was a constant banging as the door closed not being very happy about this i went to the front desk and asked for another room the manager on duty was very kind and upgraded our room both in type and location which was greatly included breakfast was extraordinary lots of options great tasting foods and even fresh strawberries i had trouble with the in the hotel after the first day i went back to the front desk to request help oh your problem is that you are in airplane mode i explained that airplane mode did not affect and that it has worked elsewhere for years she turned off my airplane mode even though i said not to do so and said it was it worked but on cellular and when i got home i got a bill for the five minutes it was not in airplane mode that really annoyed location is close to the centraal station and not too far from where many of the river cruise ships dock which was convenient but to get to most of the other parts of downtown amsterdam it generally means going back past centraal station and then to the interesting parts of the city we stayed at another,1.0

i went to barcelona in a business trip and stayed at the hotel due to the great location i was very pleased with the room and friendliness of the personnel in particular i have to mention javier and ricardo at the reception for their help and suggestions and bianca at the swimming pool she is a treasure i managed to get a full operating office under the sun overlooking the city from the pool at the top of the what a treat after that i reserved the same table every afternoon until my departure i got my ideal office there,1.0
after reading reviews on here i rather cheekily asked for a room with a balcony when i booked a large deluxe double room at this point i did realise there was only room in the hotel with a balcony room what can i say what a room what a view there are far cheaper hotels in amsterdam but this view was worth every penny of the price we did eat breakfast so i ca comment on that but the hotel was clean and we were more than happy with it central location my only tip would be not to forget the mosquitoes we slept with the balcony doors open every night and were covered in bites by the time we went home but this was definitely down to mosquitoes rather than anything else will definitely be staying here again,1.0
the highlight of the melia is the rooftop swimming pool restaurant we ate dinner there overlooking the acropolis and went swimming the next morning as room was very well appointed and comfortable the air conditioning unit made some very loud noises in the middle of the night but we were given a fan to keep cool,1.0

this historic hotel was getting a when we were there the hotel rooms are large and the bathrooms are nothing short of magnificent you can stretch full out in the tubs and the showers have many options hand held rain shower head etc the decor in the rooms is a little dated but not awful the common spaces are gorgeous especially the restaurants which sit right on the amstel river the hotel is also central to the city center but not not in the midst of the chaos so it quiet and convenient,1.0

this hotel looks like a converted grand house in a posh part of town there are many period features with some very like in decor at first it looked inviting but then not very coordinated the room was very dated it had a period fireplace but a shabby wardrobe the lovely white sheets covered a poorly spring mattress not very comfortable for sleeping the period like bathroom features looked lost next to plastic door showers with shower heads that did not function well and shaving sockets that felt loose and did not workit is probably unusual to complain of barmy summer heat in dublin but you have to when the room is stuffy and lacks any air conditioning there was no extractor fan in the bathroom the open window was the only cool air to my surprise ear plugs were available in the bathroom their use only become apparent in the evening as the night club bar noise reached decibels as recorded on my mobile app this persisted until hours and was punctuated with sirens followed by shouts and incoherent ramblings of drunk party goers this also explained a bouncer on the hotel door when i arrived he asked if i was staying in the hotel does the hotel entrance also lead to the bar in dublin according to the bouncer i booked through a third party i asked the desk about the noise element in the morning there was no answer at and they did tell me that the,0.0
we came to the hotel at when check in is at was told that there are any issues with our room so we went for lunch and came back at room was ready on time was asked to come back at we are busy was the explanation we got nothing alse we thought that it should be reasonable to have been compensated for that but did ask for nothing i think that when paying this much for a star hotel they have to do more to make your customers happy when you messed up i sure that if i did check out on time i would be charged for it and so if my room was ready on time the same rules should apply,1.0
excellent location got early tried to sell me on a suite for additional euro for nights got the cheapest room although paid for vip room took minutes to change to the right room i do understand why i did got my room to begin with,1.0
the location of the hotel is probably the best one in athens as from the rooms you have a great overview over the entire citiy to the akropolis and behind to the harbour and the sea if weather is clear you can reach all museums and sights be feet have good restaurants in the near and an open air cinema with good films in the evening directly in front of the hotel in the morning you can swimm in the pool on the roof or walk up the hill to the very top to have a marvelous view,1.0

we bought a leap card at the tourist info desk in airport and this allowed us to use the bus train and luas for got a bus into the city centre and then the luas to kylemore and hotel is a minute walk so great hotel is a little dated but spotless clean we arrived at and were given a room which was were in room small with a sloping ceiling but clean and well stocked with toiletries and tea and coffee large tv with lots of were above the lively bar but music stopped at on sat night and on sunday night so did bother deal included breakfast which was buffet style cereal juices toast pastries fruit and cold meats and cheese the cooked breakfast was to order and the full irish was great there is a cafe and a hour mcdonalds as well as garages across the road for anything else you would use this hotel again to save paying over the odds for a city centre one,1.0
i stayed on the july and the hotel is as described it is no secret that the hotel is attached to a club or that its likely be noisey it is dublin and anywhere near the town is bound to be i had a double room which was bigger than i expected and yes it def not a star hotel but for the price and location it reasonable the room was clean along with the bathroom and clean towels in the room had a station a hairdryer and ironing facilities and a book to advise of local attractions and the hotel only critism i would have is that the shower head looked like it could be cleaned better and the bath had seen better days was clean but old and there were markings in some of the walls where fixtures had been moved and the wifi password in their handbook did not work but the receptionist did offer this when we checked in i would say if your looking a quiet hotel it not for you but if u need somewhere to crash close to town then it were pleasant both during check in and check out times so i would personally stay here again,1.0

room was very nice comfortable bed nice amenities like most european hotels the and power are only on if your key card is in the dock so the rooms would get extremely hot while out during the day on business and took longer than my usual liking to get back to a comfortable level for practiced business travelers no the put the business card in the dock trick does not work bar and bar staff were excellent food was very good including the breakfast buffet every morning hallways a bit dark but otherwise very nice décor in the hotel beautiful views from the top floor restaurant,1.0
this hotel is lovely it very modern we arrived early due to our flight coming in at but they were helpful and let us fill out all our details to make check in easier when we returned at and also let us store our bags in a locker room which was controlled securely we stayed in a triple room which was quite small and basic but suited our needs as we were out all day in the centre of amsterdam it very easy to get the train from sloterdijk station into the central station it takes minutes and a return ticket for the day costs we also used it as our transportation back to the airport a taxi costs about and the train only cost each therefore this hotel is in a perfect location with many transport options around you we chose not to get the breakfast from the hotel but instead go to the spar store which is right next to the station and does fresh pastries fruit freshly squeezed orange juice and fruit smoothies and was all a lot cheaper than paying for breakfast at the hotel we also found the staff very helpful in regards to buying attraction tickets you can buy many different tickets for popular attractions at the desk which was better for us as we got ourselves organised on our first night overall although this hotel is basic it definitely provided for our needs was clean and modern and would be worth staying in,1.0

i booked a deluxe room for my mothers as we entered the hotel the staff set the tone which was one of warmth and sincerity the room was upgraded and checkin was swift the room was large albeit proportionally the bathroom could have been bigger the view was facing the front of the hotel and certainly no noise floor was served with he same flair and certainly you wo leave hungry and the setting in wilde is bright and it is expensive but as long as the hotel hits your expectations and in this case exceeds then it is worth it,0.0

we had realised till we arrived just how central this hotel was in barcelona it on the upper floors of a building right in the corner of the busy plaza de catalunya at street level it like entering a private apartment building feels exclusive our triple room was fairly spacious and overlooked the busy square this was not a problem as the double glazed soundproofing was excellent and we were not at all bothered by street noise the room had a good air con unit which was also fairly quiet when the fan was turned down for the night the reception staff were charming and always helpful when we needed advice and the housekeeping staff were stealthy and efficient we thought the breakfast was not good value for us so we ate at a nearby cafe instead a great base for our week in the city,1.0

been to barcelona before we stayed at a hotel nearby so we already knew what to expect with the location the area may not be the however we preferred to be in the residential part instead of next to bland buildings lots of street art mismatched houses love it if that is not your thing then use google view prior to booking stop complaining about location we had our baby with us felt safe in the area when we walked a few minutes walk to metro shopping centre waterfront such a handy location you away from the bustle of city centre so it quieter but easy enough to get to the staff were really friendly helpful we honestly would have left them all a tip if we had any money left hotel room was fab very clean spacious even with our baby crib in it only issue we had was the people next to us were noisy for a couple of nights so it must be thin walls of course i can not fault the hotel regarding how our behave but i suggest maybe allocating families together if possible the swimming pool is quite small but did the job for us plus the views from the of the building are amazing degree view of barcelona and you can see the la sagrada família hear it ringing in the distance fabulous we felt very welcomed was sad to leave,1.0
only stayed in this hotel for one evening after an enjoyable week driving all over the lower half of ireland but it was a welcome ending to a wonderful trip the ambiance of this hotel is excellent considering the busy dublin area and it is only a short drive to the airport recommend just walking around the hotel and grounds to take in some of its history it is a quiet oasis within a busy city everything about this hotel was excellent and highly recommended,1.0

sir albert was definitely by far one if not the finest hotels i have ever stayed in the hotel decor itself in the reception corridors bedroom are very modern and chic with a touch of class we were offered complementary prosecco on arrival the staff were more than helpful when we were checking in another day we asked for directions to the van gogh museum and the man at reception went out of his way to help and assist us with directions and offered umbrellas to each of us as it was a rather dreary day the room itself was very edgy and modernly decorated and felt very personal and welcoming with complimentary messages on the mirror and my name on the tv to welcome me it took maybe walk to get to dam square but there are lots of lovely bars restaurants shops and markets on the way which was nice to experience there was also a tram about a walk away that can take you to dam square i would recommend this hotel to every type of passenger and hope to return to it once again in the near future,1.0

i booked to stay at hotel piet hein for two nights for my boyfriends birthday whilst the hotel lobby area was beautiful every other aspect of our stay was a let ordered for a bottle of prosecco to arrive in our room at a surprise for my partner which they discussed when we checked in at surprise ruined the staff were also careless failed to deliver on information on tourist activities as they emailed me saying they would declined to help when our room stank of sewage for some unknown reason and were horrendously rude upon check not pedantic travellers we did care that our room was small dated that we did have any kind of view nor did we care that the hotel is sound proof at all or that the cleaner came into our room at whilst we were getting dressed we just felt we could have picked a much better hotel for the price we a positive the location is perfect although as other reviews state you there are lots of hotels in the area so they would be my first choice next time,0.0
when i got to the hotel i was amazed by the beautiful modern and clean smell of the lobby that image was destroyed when i got into the room the carpet was filthy full of stains and the humidity smell was awful the ac did work which made the humidity worst i was changed twice to different rooms but the problems were the same at midnight one of the front desk guys came and advised me they did have any ac i finally quit and tried to enjoy the stay peter from the front desk was very helpful and nice to even gave us good recommendations to enjoy the city which we loved despite the hotel rooms breakfast is varied and good restaurant food is delicious expensive though,0.0

for the second time we stayed in expo hotel still think is a great hotel for the value and its location is common spaces are looking good but maybe the rooms need improvements some things in our room seemed old or somewhat new decoration would be breakfast is great and perhaps better than the last staff is very polite and friendly and always ready to our months baby with us made us need some boiling water and hot soup and that was never a problem for the staff,1.0
we stayed at kilronan house for a total of days split up in the middle by two days in northern ireland this quaint and charming hotel was a delight i was traveling with my son and daughter and we were in a comfortable room with twin beds the staff are the friendliest people that you will ever encounter our arrival flight put us into dublin very early and we were able to securely drop off our bags at am with no problem the other highlight was the outstanding breakfast options there were selections available to accommodate every need and it was consistently delicious the price was a great value and very fair the location was great and within easy walking distance to everything i recommend kilronan house to anyone wanting a classic friendly value hotel,1.0
we spend nights in a triple room for single hotel is design comfortable and very well personal are the best a great thanks to lanny our receptionist who was able to give us and early check in at pool is very good they have sunbathing seats in the pool do not hesitate to contact them before your arrival in order to do an early check in i will definitely come back in this booked on agoda the best for promotion price,1.0
having looked at this hotel as a potential wedding venue some years back it was a nice surprise to see it pop up when searching for a hotel for our trip this year albeit now with two kids in tow the location is fantastic and the buzz of paseig de gracia and neighbouring streets made it an easy selection for to a last minute flight change we added an additional night at the start of the booking for which we had to book a suite this was located on the floor underneath the restaurant the room i have to say was dated no bigger than a normal room in most cities and aside from the terrace area was just on the fact that the next nights would be in a standard room i was worried what we would find in fact the standard room had been renovated and was more comfortable clean and welcoming than the suite it did have a smaller bathroom and obviously no terrace but the room itself was far more to our liking than the suite our only moan about the room was that the fridge is actually a vending machine with a touch screen meaning a our young daughter kept ordering items that on check out they did refund even though they were still in the fridge and more importantly we were not able to store any milk fruits etc in the fridge for the kids not at all practical for anyone let alone families,1.0

we found the central to be a very pleasant located walking distance to the plaka and monistriaka areas minutes walk from syntagma square where the airport bus operates from and lots of restaurants clean and modern stylings in the room was compact but comfortable bathroom is well big feature that we loved was the rooftop terrace the view to the acropolis is fantastic and a great place to relax at night food prices are good for their limited menu but after each long day tourist tramping we loved it staff are exceptionally and genuinely give it a rating except for one lodged a minor maintenance request at reception on day one and it still was not attended to when we left three days later anyway we would definitely stay there again if we return to athens,1.0
we recently stayed at hotel phidias and specifically chose this hotel as it was very close to the port of piraeus we need to catch a ferry to milos upon arrival katherina at the from desk greeted us with extreme friendliness she struck up conversations with my and year olds immediately she is was certainly a breath of fresh air after hours of travel our room was very comfortable but a little small for a family of the bathroom was also small but extremely clean the hotel offers a free shuttle service around the piraeus area they took us to the port its a short walk to the main town from the hotel where you will find supermarkets restaurants clothing stores etc,1.0
though it a four star but there was no sign of welcome rather no doorman to open the door or porter to help u with the luggage and the outside stairs are too broad to pick ur luggage n take it till the standard room category is considered to b the lowest n they treat u as if u they r obligating u to let u rooms r very small and bathroom small in nh collection milan and straight from there came to this nhcity centre hotel which was a terrible feeling after seeing the rooms n the do have any the room was neat n clean the bedsheets ver super white n so were the towels in the honestly i m waiting to go to my next destination a little claustrophobic,0.0
excellent location with a homey and elegant feel the room we had overlooked the courtyard and gaudi buildings it was so gorgeous the room was beautifully decorated with a ton of detail the first hotel room i seen that had fresh flowers in the bathroom and living area as well as a few bottles of delicious sangria for us the pool top was very small just enough for a quick dip to cool off but not for lounging all day pool drinks were pricey but there was a convenience store beside the hotel with reasonable drinks,1.0
we stayed here for nights at the beginning of the month this hotel is a great place to start your iris vacation easy to get from the airport take the airport bus euros ow and get off at cathal brugha street the hotel is across the street on upper rooms are modern and well laid out think ikea the rooms also have very rare in ireland nice sized bathroom with a shower there are making facilities in the room we asked for a quiet room one that did not face street there was a big sports bar under our window when they got late and loud i just closed the window turned on the air conditioning the windows appear to be double glazed and keep out exterior noise well there are also decent black out curtains if you want to sleep late do not sleep too late or you will miss out on the included breakfast buffet other reviewers have noted a lot of the front desk staff are esl they try to be helpful but do not always have a very good knowledge of dublin i asked at the front desk where we could pick up the no bus to the botanic gardens the young lady had no idea turned out to be across on the other side of street easy minute walk to the trinity college or temple bar area lots of city busses stop right in front of the hotel the luas tram is just a few,1.0
i stayed here for nights and found the location was really good the roof top is spectacular and adds the the overall experience with super service in the day by such a lovely warm and welcoming bar lady the view is amazing and you feel so grateful and lucky to still have the opportunity to watch over barcelona after a long day of travelling around the city the pool is a little smaller than expected but there are plenty of seats around to enjoy the view the room i stayed in was very clean and the size was just right the bathroom was lovely and modern with a spacious shower even wash and cream if you have forgotten and complete with a hair dryer breakfast is available but i not one to eat a lot in the morning so a short walk and you have a selection of cafes with croissants and a coffee all in for,1.0

our family of stayed in four rooms for a couple days before a sailing trip through the greek islands the hotel is ideally located with breath taking views of the acropolis and an easy stroll to old town i have been there before on business but had to return with my family because dinner on their roof with the views of the acropolis ca be overstated their food and their greek salad were among the best we experienced during our days in greece the staff is unusually attentive as an example my youngest son arrived separately from the airport as he entered the hotel one of the staff casually asked how much he paid for his taxi the staff member said he was overcharged and ran out to the driver and made the driver refund my son the overage where else have you ever heard of a hotel staff being so proactive there are lots of other examples of how helpful the staff was as well i would stay there again without question or hesitation,1.0

this hotel has everything from three restaurants with together michelin stars to excellent service we had booked two rooms at the executive level with access to the lounge and everything was nearly perfect so why not dots the two rooms were very different one had a big bright bathroom overlooking the city and the other a dark small one the two rooms had everything you need including the latest technology but to be picky the curtains did shut out the light and i wish for a more soundproof room would i stay here again yes on business or with kids but not as a couple next time in amsterdam as a couple i will be closer to the old town in a old charming hotel,1.0

the critical feedback follows the carpet in our room was dirty it took them a few days to clean it and even then it was quite stained management should either deep clean it or replace it before they rent out this room again i meant to talk to the manager about the rug but by the time i got around to it he was out and would be back till after we left he struck me as someone who would have been very responsive to our complaint the beds though comfortable did even approximate a double as in most hotels in europe it was singles pushed together but what was unusual was there was no pad over both to in any way connect them and they were separately made up with individual single sheets and tucked in etc the hotel staff and policy did seem concerned about recycling or the environment i had to ask if they recycled paper etc and bring it down separetly and i ended up hiding towels we had used just a few times so that the housekeepers would take them to be laundered and bring fresh ones i suggest that there be a sign in the room about recycling and a place for recycling and a note that if you want fresh towels to put any you want replaced on the bathroom floor as there is in most hotels conscious about the spite of these issues which need improvement there was plenty to like about,1.0
we stayed in the student hotel at wibaustraat the location is very convenient with metro station literally just outside the hotel so you have access to the whole city so no worries location wise the hotel is very clean and the staff is just awesome the overall vibe is superb there is pool and ping pong table at the ground floor so played that quite a bit there is a vending machine in the lobby as well although overpriced but quite convenient late night when nothing is open in the neighbourhood the room was quite comfortable for people shower could have been better overall a superb stay and would recommend this to anyone visiting amsterdam cheers,1.0
the people at the front desk were very helpful as we had questions and needed to call tour locations the rooms were nice well maintained and quiet at least in the back of the hotel where we stayed we had a single room on the ground floor and a family room for on the top floor we really enjoyed that the hotel was walking distance about minutes from many of the places we wanted to visit but not right in the noise of the city the breakfast was good though additional not all rooms have air conditioning so ask if that is important to you,1.0
this excellent hotel has a great location and a very helpful staff the swimming pool has an amazing view i wrote down my when i made the booking and the very friendly man who checked me in made a successful effort to make me happy someone else whose service stood out was the doorman alonso who gave me some good suggestions for exploring the area by foot on the night all the taxis in barcelona striked one suggestion for improvement i was not impressed by the quality of the food and coffee at the breakfast buffet,1.0

i travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels that carry stars unfortunately in my opinion herbert park is at most when i moved into my there was silicone falling off in pieces above the mirror in the bathroom the wooden panel that covered the bottom of the tub was splitting and paint was chipping the pillows smelled in one of the hallways the wall phone was hanging by the wires etc i was moved immediately to a different which was little better but still faced the same issues i do have to give some credit to the staff everyone was friendly and the cleaning staff was superb all rooms need a face lift or a star needs to go,0.0

we wanted a cheap hotel that offered free parking that was between town and marlay park so this hotel was perfect as other reviews have stated decor could do with updating especially the bathroom in the room but for the price paid and the fact that there was free parking which is rare we could complain bus to town right outside the door too,1.0
being across the street from an arena it normal to expect a lot of loud noise causing lack of sleep although there was a huge tournament in town the room was surprisingly quiet clean good water pressure great breakfast and very friendly staff the only problem i had was my room was ready upon arrival but other than that i would recommend this hotel to families business travelers or anyone just passing through it in a central location and walking distance to shopping and dining,1.0

i stayed here for a few days with some friends the building is huge and in a great location the staff are helpful friendly and welcoming all staff i met were so polite and kind and happy to stop what the were doing to talk with you the service from the hard working staff really was star the public areas are well maintained and luxurious the views from the hotel are incredible the view of barcelona really is breathtaking to wake up to i felt let down by a few things the pool was far too small for a hotel of this size it was also very shallow i stayed here with the plan of spending a few hours each day by the pool but i only spent two days by the pool as it was not what i expected at all i pre paid for the breakfast but i feel that the choice was very limited and sometimes the scrambled eggs were cold there was a good choice of pastries and bread but limited on hot food and cereals i did not feel like a star breakfast and was not worth what i paid was also a few issues with the room some of the sockets did not work and there was a smell from the they were minor issues but they were resolved and it was what i expected from a star hotel at this price the room itself felt a little dated and in need of a,1.0
if you are courageous enough to use the metro then this is a good location as it is only a minute walk from the nearest station the breakfast is quite good depending on who the grill chef is that day one guy is very friendly and very competent while the woman seems grouchy and is not quite as good kamil is a friendly server that always smiled while she worked and always made me feel welcome the rooms are good with a small balcony i did use the balcony except at night when the air was cooler the only challenge is that if you want to try a nice restaurant with some atmosphere you may need to jump on the metro and hit the city center back alley ways or the ramblier drive there is not a lot of great options near the hotel although the food at the hotel is quite tasty,1.0

the hotel was very nice and the staff were helpful and courteous the rooftop was amazing and spectacular views the hotel was a little far from the sightseeing places but we took taxi and were very cheap the only thing i did not like is that they do have wifi in the rooms only in designated areas of the hotel which was annoying,1.0
our standard double room was small but very comfortable the best thing about this hotel is its stunning architecture and decoration the entire place was renovated in a way that perfectly mixes old and new by respecting the original architectural features of the building nicely done staff is also very friendly and helpful the complimentary croissants and coffee every morning is good but a more complete breakfast option hurt the terrasse and the reading room are superb,1.0

we stayed here nights the hotel is very minimalist we were on the floor there is a lift the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom was fab with a large shower the air con kept us cool on very hot nights the hotel has free wifi which works best in the lounge area on the floor it was not so reliable there was a buffet breakfast for euros there were lots of restaurants nearby,1.0
nice quirky little hotel which was clean and comfortable we arrived late afternoon very tired only to discover we need to lug our four cases up and down several flights of stairs not a great start to our stay the rooms although very clean were very small and the bathroom and shower even smaller and no storage facilities in the bathroom and very compact in the bedroom ideal with a lot of luggage the room looked out onto the back of the property not nice view the window opening was small and the room was very stufy and warm free wifi was very poor,1.0

let me start with a positive the hotel is in a great location in the temple bar area it ends there upon arriving at the hotel i was underwhelmed at the cleanliness and effort to update the hotel for per night it was rundown the bellman took me to my room and it appeared that the carpet had been cleaned in years the room was dingy and in need of a good updating after returning to my room for dinner and drinks there was a raging party going on down the hall no big deal i thought it will die down eventually at am it was still going i informed the front desk and they told me there was nothing that they could do apparently a group had reserved that part of the hotel for a party i asked to change rooms and was told that since i already been checked into this room for hours it was possible i was offered a tiny discount on the room instead i do want a discount i want a quiet night of sleep to be clear the issue was not the street noise which is a modest hum given the hotel proximity to the bars in the area that would have been tolerable the next morning when i checked out i made mention of the issues they gave me the managers card and told me to email him so i did and after four days i received a snarky response from the,0.0
very lucky with location not too far from pubs and shops unfortunately the windows are single pane so the noise from below is quite audible i suggest ear plugs if you need it quiet whilst you sleep hey we very helpful provided us with a fan as it was fairly warm at were even given drink vouchers each to have at the vat bar which is next door guinness larger or baileys two of us had a larger shandy for no extra cost is not included though for an irish breakfast but there are coffee shops and a tesco extra across the main road,1.0

after reading hundreds of barcelona hotel reviews my wife and i decided to stay at the port vell in july prior to our cruise we arrived a few hours before time but the front desk staff got us and were extremely helpful and friendly we stayed in room on second floor with a view of the harbour the room was clean and comfortable with a nice view the furnishings are more modern not the traditional hotel style furniture at night we could hear the traffic but that did not bother us or keep us awake at night hotel location is great close to shopping and restaurants all with walking distance with a bus stop just across the street when i booked the hotel i told them that they were the start of our wedding anniversary vacation and hoped we could have a room with a nice view we not only got that but on the first night the hotel delivered to us a complementary bottle of wine with chocolate covered strawberries and a slice of chocolate cake totally unexpected and a really nice touch of class by this wife and i are very selective about the quality of hotels we stay at only star or higher the port vell has a star rating and is definitely that or slightly higher the only con we had was the price of the buffet breakfast euro each with limited selection we ate there the first morning but i would recommend walking to one,1.0
we arrived at the hotel well before since we landed in dublin at about am while a room was available as expected given the time the front desk person gave us access to the health club facility which has a shower and pool so we could freshen up we took advantage of that and then went to breakfast at their were advised breakfast would be euro each which felt a bit high but since there were many other dining options nearby and we were tired we went for it the breakfast was a very nice buffet when we went to pay and the manager asked for our room number he actually gave us the breakfast since we were able to check in yet this was a nice gesture that we really appreciated the room itself was much larger than expected and had a nice view of the river liffey we had a king bed that was very firm and comfortable we were a little concerned that the room was directly across from the elevators and adjacent to a vending machine but it was quiet both nights despite the hotel being full we were there on a thursday and friday night the only thing that did hit the same standard was the hotel bar there is a comfortable sitting area but the two times we visited we found the service to be inconsistent slow and unfocused we had a sharing platter of various asian fusion items but it was fairly mediocre,1.0
my second visit to this hotel despite being a little further from the centre than say the westbury it remains a favourite rooms are of a generous size and service is faultless the cellar bar makes a mean cocktail,1.0

with my son and a friend we were in barcelona to attend a football match at camp nou we spent one night at el jardi this little hotel is ideally located in barri gotic area its charming facade is overlooking typical plaça sant josep a drink at the tiny bar del pi we came into the historic building we were kindly welcomed and proposed a cozy functional simple bedroom view from the balcony on the famous catalan gothic church santa maria del pi was really a short but quiet night we came down to eat something and have coffee as the breakfast room was a bit gloomy we went outside and took our café and buñuelos at a nearby terrace looking at the city coming to life around the pine planted in the middle of plaça del pi all in all we had a pleasant stay at el jardi,1.0

i stayed in the citizen m hotel at the airport in amsterdam too thats why i choose this one in the centre for a proper visit to amsterdam location wise it is about by tram to the centre tram stops almost in front of the hotel which is perfect amsterdam south is quite posh which is nice the rooms are very modern everything lights tv heating aircon controlled by the ipad so maybe if you are a bit older and do know how to work an ipad that might be a problem to share a room you must be comfortable with eachother as the door to the toilet is a little see through the bed is one big one and massive by all acounts which i loved rooms are small but perfect with clever storage under the deffinately visits again love this concept of hotel,1.0

stayed in this hotel for one night as a party of all family catching a cruise ship around the greek islands the following day several of us being forgetful and tired as did arrive till around forgot some of our items the next morning at check out despite phone calls and emails to the hotel to ask about our left items we were informed nothing had been found i find it hard to believe a full ladies outfit a man shirt one shoe and a phone charger all magically disappeared maybe the management need to vet their staff alittle more closely to avoid a cross dressing one legged member of staff hopping around the streets of athens swinging a samsung phone charger around their heads not a good advert for the hotel avoid,0.0
sheer luxus we have to experience this hotel once more and more and more best of all was the serviceminded attitude and friendliness of the staff the room were clean and bed comfortable nearly as the one at home and the bathroom shiny and clean breakfast among the best we have experienced at any hotel last but not least has the finest roof terrace and restaurant i attended so far,1.0
then this is the place for you get ready to wait in the lobby sitting on your luggage while rude condescending staff lie to you about how long it will take for your room to be ready and you waste your day in barcelona enjoy watching other frustrated tourists be offered no water or refreshments while the lobby plants get watered and you wait for hours with misinformation and are held hostage because you must wait with your luggage and no porter is offered so you can enjoy the city i been treated with more grace and respect trying to get my friend out of jail there are at least other guests in the same situation in the lobby so thought i give everyone the that this hotel is managed with less courtesy and honesty than i have ever experienced as a guest stay away not matter how good the points deal is save yourselves dear reader,0.0

this is a nice hotel a little off the beaten path it in an affluent area of the city dublin and the building was originally a masonic girls school in the if you looking for a chain hotel this should be your choice but if you like some character and charm check out the clayton hotel ballsbridge and the staff is very friendly which made the stay even more pleasant,1.0
when we first checked into the gallery hotel i was skeptical of its location because of the route we took to get there i could not have been more wrong one of the best things about this hotel is the location one block to the left is passeig de garcia where one of the famed goude houses is located it is also a major shopping avenue to the right one block is another great shopping street there are also many restaurants and cafes nearby the location is definitely great for walking if you want to take a tour the stops for both hop hop off tours is also about a block away as hotel itself is very nice the lobby and dining areas are comfortable and accommodating the dining room offers a morning european breakfast there is also a rooftop pool and bar it is a great place to relax after a day of shopping the pool is not very big and isn t really for kids but for adults to take a quick dip it would be room i stayed in was of ample size with a queen bed and nightstands a desk and lounging chair the bathroom was very nice and again a very good size the staff was also very lovely sara at the front desk and axel the bellman were especially would recommend this hotel if you are going to barcelona it is more american than european but if you don t mind you are good,1.0

we stayed at stauntons on a saturday night before heading to the airport the service was great the porter met us at the taxi and brought all of our bags in we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the day we were early when we returned our bags had been brought up to our room hooray we were on the second floor and as folks have noted there is no lift our room was beautiful we were in a triple with our young daughter the bathroom was beautiful and we appreciated the deep tub and plush towels at about the music started there was an outdoor concert in the park next door and it was loud our room faced the back garden the concert was nathan carter and it was great instead of being miffed we were happy to have a front row seat to this wonderful concert breakfast was not included in our rate but we went anyway because breakfast is tough to find early on a sunday service was very good always tough to pay full price for a full breakfast for a five year old but that was fine check out was easy and a taxi was called and promptly came to take us to the only beef and this is for irish hotels in general it was warm and without a top sheet only a duvet it was tough to get comfortable,1.0
wonderful most european rooms are small i was on my own and got a single it had a sauna and a whirlpool tub when i was there it was very hot the room did not have ac and there were concerts going on so there was a lot of traffic with cars and people walking around partying i had to leave the window open so did not sleep for almost nights i stayed i asked to be moved but no availability on night begged for a fan or something or i was going to find other accommodation i feel i should not have had to ask for one but offered so i could close the window for some quiet otherwise it very conveniently located and the tub was great after long days of walking and hiking,1.0

we stayed here in july in the room no the whole quarter is quiet and noble full of beautiful villas and gardens amsterdam itself is like a botanical garden in summer and also the backyard of the hotel we hade a view to the garden with a huge magnolia trea which was amazing the reception people were very nice and helpful you can rent a bike here for euro or so breakfast definitely worth ordering great choice of fresh sliced fruits lovely croissants crispy bread and many many more it is very nice that you can rest in the cozy reception after you return tired from the centre charge yourself with a cup of tea or coffee free of charge and than move off to explore more of the city the only think i would change there is no hair shampoo in the bathroom and i definitly do not wish to wash my hair with the liquid soap and also the hairdryer dries your hair out it noting dramatic but if you have any hair issues take your own stuff the location is great near the galleries and just besides the vondelpark we loved our stay and definitely will come back,1.0
lovely hotel off the main street yet only a minute walk to the temple bar area there is everything you need in your room a kettle with mugs and a good supply of tea and coffee hairdryer and even an iron and ironing board the rooms are very spacious with nice comfy beds we did have the breakfast as for someone who only has a slice of toast i thought euros was a bit much there are plenty of places to get a good breakfast within walking distance from euros was very impressed with the security as you had to swipe your room card to get in and out of the lift and corridors all in all an excellent location to explore dublin,1.0
we were walked to the spencer by another hotel that overbooked it was a pleasant surprise the rooms were very different from the hotel that we previously booked very irish artsy the room was small but very comfortable bathroom amenities were almost full sized and of great quality this is important to me since i have very long thick curly hair i hate when i get a bottle of shampoo and conditioner in one the staff was attentive and the lobby and bar more than adequate would recommend if you want to stay city center,1.0

hotel looks much better in the pictures than it actually is we stayed at a different hotel one night in barcelona at the beginning of our vacation and two nights at the cubic at the end of our vacation the first hotel was half the price and much nicer our room had no outside windows making us feel like we had booked the cheapest room on a cruise ship the staff greeted you with a smile but was unhelpful and cold when you engaged them the location is central but it is on an unattractive busy noisy street i really hoped that we would like our first experience with an hotel but we wo be staying in any more of their hotels,0.0

the harding hotel provided us a wonderful accommodations experience in dublin we were originally scheduled to stay in iceland and then fly to ireland after our initial flight was cancelled to iceland the hotel was nice enough to extend our stay more days last minute so that we could fly in early to dublin the location is perfect being off the busy and noisy temple bar district but also being only a walk to temple bar and the river it allows for walking distance to all the main sights in dublin and there is a bus stop right outside our hotel room overlooked the courtyard of the christ church cathedral the room was always cleaned well and we did not have any disturbances from outside noise our adjoining rooms the front desk was tremendously accommodating to all our needs and quick to provide any suggestions for restaurants or live music that we were interested in we certainly recommend the harding house hotel for any stay that you may have in dublin,1.0

beautiful hotel in a great area in the centre of amsterdam ideal location and very quiet lovely room and very clean staff extremely helpful and polite only downside was that we asked for twin beds for myself and my daughter which we got but the beds were very small only each when you are used to a or foot bed being classed as a twin does give you much room air conditioning was great and very quiet,1.0
if you are looking for somewhere clean modern and in the center of all the action this is the place to go it is a very nice walk to a lot of restaurants and a lot of the nightlife in barcelona as well as there are a few subway stations very close the rooms are very clean a decent size we had a beautiful view of the courtyard employees are very nice and want to help you with anything,1.0

the hotel was clean and modern and the price was reasonable location was great as there is amstel station less than minute walk which takes you stop into centraal station the tram stop is also outside station which takes you to the museum square the bar is ridiculously overpriced so i would bother there is a bar nearby with drinks and breakfast at a fraction of the price the bed was awful had some ridiculous mattress topper thing that slipped off the bed so then so did i the staff where professional but unhelpful and somewhat cold all in all it made for an average stay at a rather dull hotel,1.0
this was a totally positive experience from early no problem store your bags to the sublime view across the city from floor to the facilities in the room especially bathroom get those dimmerlights for navigating in the dark but my admiration is especially warm for the breakfast team professional yet totally convincingly concerned for our every need everyone looked genuinely happy to help and contribution apparently i was first to request a strawberry jam styled pancake i loved it so why not try it and the chilled apples in a bowl on every landing thoughtfulthe park will always be in my top for local tips message the flying engishman budget air,1.0
beautiful property on diagonal mar next to diagonal mar mall large lobby with helpful front office staff rooms are very spacious and lot of them are sea facing elaborate breakfast with sitting even outside which is a welcome break although the hotel initially mixed up rooms for us and gave wrong beds however the same was quickly rectified by their side overall if you are in barcelona this is good property to stay and venture out in the city,1.0
we just came back from a family vacation in glyfada it was a great vacation and the hotel was on top of the success factors for the vacation the hotel location is quiet convenient as it is very close to a bus and tram stations and also a min walk to the beach and glyfada is a very clean and pleasant hotel the staff are very helpful they offer beautiful breakfast with a variety of fresh international and national dishes our room was spacious beds and pillows very comfortable and with an extraordinary view of the beach as our room was on the floor we were offered a fruit basket upon arrival and complementary coffee and tea service our housekeepers were our friends that were spending the vacation with us has booked a family room but not with sea view they did not receive the same hospitality they were not offered any welcome fruit basket not service in their rooms their housekeeping was also sloppy as their bathroom was not cleaned regularly nor their waste baskets emptied i would go back to this hotel anytime i am in glyfada,1.0

i booked this hotel for one night it was booked for adults and children but when we got there they only had a double room so we stayed in the room with one double bed the staff was very unwelcoming and rude the rooms was small and very warm u could open the small window because of the noise outside the fridge did work it did cool the food my son was sick and the staff was so unhelpful they told me to clean it myself and if the room ca be booked out again until they can bring in cleaners because the housekeeping only hoover the floor i will be charged a extra night or,0.0
naturally ink hotel amsterdam appealed to me as a retired journalist and the venue delivered in many ways largely focused around the theme of communication but in the sense of paper ink linotype typewriters and words ink is centrally located just a walk from the big train station its public spaces feel unique and intimate from the sloping entryway that brings you down a tad below street level where it is cool and quiet to a very casual desk employees stand behind a wooden table to work it feels like they could have been printsetters in another time the bar and restaurant with their attentive help are inviting and casual so much so you might not want to leave even though the city beckons rooms upstairs carry on the word and story themes in each an artist has sketched a map of the city on the bedroom wall and written favorite spots to visit it actually a big help rooms are small tight even but nicely appointed and the bed comfy and after all the point in amsterdam is to get out and explore staff were extremely helpful in suggesting trips especially an excellent canal boat ride i loved for the evening hour and the champagne served i think the company is called friendship a good name,1.0
we arrived after nine and there was a queue at reception which seemed to take a while to go down there were comfortable chairs available to wait in the entrance to the hotel is beautiful outside there are fountains and inside the floors are marble throughout when we opened our room we were very pleased at what we saw for a standard room we had been offered an up grade for a night which we turned down the room was just as the photos on the website marble floors ceiling fan air con safe the bathroom was spacious with vanity unit with full length mirror toilet and bedit with a phone next to it the rest of the room consisted of built in wardrobes with iron and ironing board into the main room which was a standard twin room were two queen size electric beds which were made up with crisp white sheets duvets were in the wardrobe if required either side of the beds were bedside tables with wall lamps and spot lights there was a wall mounted tv the mini fridge was supplied with mini bottles of water each not to worry as there are several supermarkets within five minute walk there was an easy chair and table by the window to be honest look at the hotel photos they accurate in the lobby there are two massage chairs very good in the basement there is a spa which if you book through certain companies gives you hours,1.0
friendly staff and a very warm welcome this hotel was gorgeous had a room on the fifth floor and they had also allocated our friends a room on the same floor which was thoughtful loved the little touches in the room from the crap drawer to the fantastic hairdryer the bar upstairs was a perfect spot to unwind after a busy day and the spicy chicken wings were amazing super comfy beds with massive pillows and all this in a wonderful location which is close to everything thank you x,1.0
our experience with the roger de lluria was generally consistent with the positive reviews on tripadvisor as my wife our two adult daughters and i were going to be in barcelona for only one night i wanted a convenient location in the heart of barcelona i was already familiar with the area having previously stayed multiple times in a nearby hotel this time i wanted a somewhat more elegant place and the roger de lluria seemed to fit the bill i booked two double rooms for a sunday night and requested twin beds high floor and facing the street on the friday before our scheduled arrival we decided to arrive a day early my daughter called the hotel and asked if there was availability the next day the answer was no but a few minutes later the desk clerk hakim called back to say they could provide two rooms for the first night although he warned they would be smaller and not as well located as the rooms we would have the second night unfortunately the price would be the same as for the better and bigger rooms euros per room per night but hakim said he would include breakfast for the first morning therefore even before our arrival we had a sample of the friendly and helpful service provided by the hotel staff and after our arrival there were other examples i had parked my car a couple of streets away see why below and asked if it was,1.0
last week i stayed in the croke park hotel from arrival to departure everything was done without fuss small issue with noisy was immediately addressed by a room change special thanks to sandeep and krischna and the front desk sophia for their help during my stay the executive lounge was fantastic and has all you need for a continental breakfast i basically nested there for the day as i had returned from a long haul flight the coffee machine is a little tempermental and may need a service as it was giving trouble stayed in the sam maguire suite for one night as it was a special occasion again krischna and the front desk were very helpful here the bed was extremely comfortable and the toiletries white company were excellent quality it was nice to have the space and also the stadium view which is impressive from this close proximity to the croke park stadium one can only imagine the view immediately outside the colosseum in rome when the roman empire was at its height see gladiator for nearest modern interpretation also on saturday morning we culd hear the soundchecks from coldplay which was for dinner in the sideline bar and service was a little slow as was room service so these are small things to correct i walked into the gym and it looked adequate and smelled fresh so it is being kept only thing missing to make this a must stay as a family hotel is a swimming,1.0

my boyfriend and i stayed for four nights from the to the of july walking up to the hotel i was amazed at how beautiful it was the mix of old and new is stunning walking through into the hotel lobby the place was full of were originally worried about what type of room we would get as we had accidentally booked a twin room instead of double but we emailed the hotel a week before our stay to ask if there was any chance of changing this and we were delighted that they were able to accommodate us with a double room at no extra charge the room was very interesting as it had the bathroom and seating area when you come in and a small stairs up to the double bed above you which i found very quirky although i did find the stairs quite steep and it made me nervous to walk down especially at night and also the bathroom walls were see through glass which was not really to my liking but i still loved everything the hotel was a five minute walk to a tram that would take you to the centre of amsterdam in no time or you could walk and it would take roughly to minutes to walk which was no issue to us as the surrounding area is beautiful and peaceful do be mindful of bikes though altogether it was a wonderful hotel and a fantastic trip will definitely be back,1.0
i have stayed in the hotel melia at regents park london and was so impressed with that i felt a spanish version would be even better i was not wrong this spanish version is the absolute most modern concept of hotel i have stayed in the rooms were superbly designed with no loss of detail in the total concept extreme modernity with extreme comfort the dinning area was superbly spacious with an unbelievable lighting design that i have never seen before the roof terrace and swimming pool were large with large open sunbathing and dinning areas and the bar there accommodated itself to all one desires a super bonus point was the underground parking all the staff we encountered were very helpful this hotel is certainly worth another visit,1.0
the clayton hotel was a lovely base for our mid week break in was a minute walk into the city centre with bus stops situated outside the hotel there is car parking available at the hotel for a discounted rate of per day if you are a breakfast was nice with a good choice of cereals fruit and breads the cooked buffet was good considering how many they are catering for although for how much they charge for breakfast better quality sausages would go the exception of one receptionist the staff were friendly and helpful the concierge if you managed to find him was very helpful and knowledgable about the booking the room i phoned to book as i needed to request a cot in the room and could not do this online i was not given the best deal over the phone i could have saved more choosing my deal online but took the hit as i needed the cot which was provided free of charge upon checking in though this addition was not added to my room and we had to wait to check there was a cot available which luckily there was also the receptionist who checked me in did not give me any information regarding the restaurant times breakfast times check out times etc not a major problem but it is a basic requirement when checking in and certainly one i would expect from a star enjoyed our stay it was a very comfortable clean room,1.0

our party of six adults stayed here only night before leaving on a cruise we all want to go back and stay longer everything in this hotel was top notch the bellhop met our party of six down the street to take us to the hotel there is no grand entrance on a street with a sign you actually walk down an alley way to the entrance the front staff was more than professional they were extremely friendly and will help you in any way possible we arrived in barcelona without luggage and they tried to help us track it down the day we were scheduled to check out it was raining as we were stepping out to go to breakfast the front desk offered for us to borrow umbrellas while we walked around we did even have to ask stayed in a tiny category room which was more than adequate for a night or two the bed was extremely comfortable the shower was absolutely amazing and the toiletries provided were loved hanging out on the rooftop at the bar bartenders and staff were amazing and take such pride in what they all highly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed,1.0
accessible on foot from the airport bus and a little longer but possible from sants railway station close to hop on and off bus stop check in staff when we arrived was very friendly and helpful we had a courtyard room not that we really used it as we were out and about a lot large room very comfortable beds breakfast excellent restaurants across the road on the top floor of the arena for tapas or absolutely delicious tapas restaurant called bodega monumental a min walk away would stay here again because it was a little out of the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas in a quiet street the pool although small is a bonus,1.0

stayed just one night at this excellent and very attractive hotel found everything to be of a high standard from check in to bedroom with the most comfortable superking size bed i am fussy about beds but have to say this was the best sleep in a hotel bed for a very long time as the mattress was top quality my room like the hotel in general was very clean and well presented the extras you could wish for were present in the room including and it was nice that there was not just coffee making facilities but iron and ironing board decided to opt for buffet breakfast in the morning having had the cost added to my bill at check in to get a slight discount on the price and again i was delighted at the diversity of food beautifully presented in the breakfast room it was an excellent meal we stayed on a sunday evening and it was so wonderfully quiet room at rear of hotel and no noisy guests to wake us up last but not least it is a beautiful and characterful hotel just like the photos show and not boring and like so many other hotels it is one hotel that stands out for quality in all areas that matter and i plan to return again soon as great location not too far away from dublin centre and howth with its amazing seafood cafes and required though to get to city centre or howth good,1.0

hotels in amsterdam were crazy expensive in late july and we found this hilton which at was steep but reasonable compared to other properties the hotel feels like a cruise ship but there is more than meets the eye the backyard has views of a lovely canal the rooms were fresh and turndown service was offered the breakfast buffet was ample and tasty as was the selection and view of the executive lounge for visitors the hotel is a quick bike ride or walk to the museum quarter and other tourist attractions and the trendy foodhallen is nearby also the hotel also has a nice modern gym and you can run in the nearby streets nearby there a joe and the juice which is nice as well as wilhems and carter which are nice neighborhood places popular with locals,1.0

new hotel according to hampton standards created in a former institute building limited parking in the building plus overflow parking garage on the other side of the street which has to be manually opened by hotel staff cost of euros for parking is a bit quite comfortable and low noise breakfast included and rather good with coffee from real beans the young staff is friendly and can just about cope in the busy mornings,1.0
i was so pleased with my interactions with guest services prior to my arrival they assisted me with reservation of a driver to meet at the airport and transport to the hotel the driver could not have been better to us assisting with finding a wheelchair for my husband comfort they quickly found us a for transfer to the nearby passenger cruise terminal the following morning the service level was so evident throughout our short one night stay at this hotel i will return,1.0
stayed here for a first stop on our honeymoon perfect location for foodies landmark lovers popular shopping and nightlife our taxi from airport had no trouble getting us here the front desk is very friendly helpful like margaretta sp who helped us find concert tickets for an event the same day as our stay as far as the room goes the bed is comfy the terrace is relaxing the bathroom is nothing special and the ac works wonderfully all and all it was a beautiful stay and we would love to come back again,1.0
my mom and i stayed here while exploring dublin for a few days from the dublin airport we took the aircoach bus route to street it was just a short walk rolling our bags to the hotel it costs euros each round trip the location of the hotel is great and everything we saw was within walking distance dublin castle temple bar cathedral christ church cathedral the brazen head and tons of to see the guinness storehouse you may want to take a cab for around euros maybe and the hotel can call one for you the book of kells is also close by at trinity college the room itself was clean and comfortable we asked for a quiet room so ours faced a little courtyard the room was quiet except for a rattle in the hvac but it did keep us up at night the room has a thermostat so it comfortable to your liking the beds were nice the shower worked i had no drain or hot water issues the staff was very friendly and helpful we did eat breakfast there so i ca comment on that,1.0
we stayed nights at praktik garden and we absolutely loved it the hotel itself was very uniquely decorated and chic and the reception staff were very helpful and approachable there was free coffee in the morning and even though there did seem to be a breakfast option we did ask there were plenty of little coffee shops in the area at very affordable prices so we had breakfast somewhere new every day the location was brilliant as there are at least metro stations at a walking distance from the hotel and we could get everywhere very easily the room was lovely and decorated in the same unique style as the rest of the hotel with a massive ensuite bathroom which also had a window which was perfect as it was very hot in june i do know if all rooms are the same but ours was quite small however as we were out and about all day anyway it did really matter we loved our stay and would definitely recommend,1.0
first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,0.0
exceptional boutique hotel located in the heart of barcelona close proximity to numerous dining and sightseeing options the courtyard pool and patio lounge were a nice option for relaxing after a day of sightseeing and before going to dinner that evening what made this particular property shine was the staff the level of service and attention to detail at this hotel is unusual at this price point however it was comparable to that of most star hotels i have stayed in,1.0
my instinct was to rate this hotel at a but i give it a because of the excellent front desk and restaurant service the room was extremely small which i expected because i viewed the rooms on their website it was an odd bright color there was absolutely zero privacy in the bathroom if you are traveling with someone and are modest or you need a private bathroom moment this can get uncomfortable the lighting was not suitable for doing your makeup the bathroom vanity was tiny and there was not enough room for both of us to have our things on the counter top the view was of other balconies across the city street it felt more like nyc than athens all of that being said the included breakfast was very good the employees here went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable the hotel is in a pretty convenient location and we were able to walk to most places i give the property itself a but the staff a so i rounding it to a,1.0

we stayed nights at gallery hotel spending vacation the hotel is located one block from passeig the gracia which is the main avenue of bcn all the stores and of main gaudí museums are if you have good mobility you can explore everything walking we could get to la sagrada família casa battló parque güell this is kinda far and casa milá great restaurants and stores are just by as well a place to stay in bcn,1.0
we stepped of a plane after hours travelling from new zealand a warm welcome greeted us whilst a clean quiet room with plnty of hot water awaited us we slept like doormice before quickly wandering into the streets of amsterdam it is a good location for sightseeing a good selection of food was available in the breakfast room which set us up for another day travelling,1.0
stayed at the merrion for two nights in july this was our second time to the hotel and we were not disappointed the staff maintains a level of excellence that is found in very few hotels always warmly welcomed and professionally looked after our room was lovely and well appointed fabulous bed and linens everything you could think of is provided for you i ca imagine staying anywhere else in dublin,1.0
i agree with most of the previous reviews here in that this is an extravagant stay by any sense but if you are looking for a clean and comfortable home base while you explore the city it great bang for your buck we found staff pleasant and the breakfast with a great view of the acropolis was a real treat in the morning the location also cant be beat if you want to be near the only suggestions for improvement given what it is is we agree the air conditioning was spotty and there were times we were way too hot some more protein options at breakfast would be nice also,1.0
whilst this was a perfectly nice hotel with great staff i did not like the area long walk to the beach so for the first time ever i used the metro once you get the hang of the ticket system it is no different to the london underground the staff were wonderful and after having been ripped off by the taxi driver they could have been nicer warning if the fare seems to high tell the driver to wait and go inside the hotel pool area is tiny and fills up very quickly breakfast ok,1.0
so it seems that there is a lot of variability in the rooms we were perhaps lucky but our room was incredible we were told we were staying in a one star room and then got brought to the biggest hotel room i been in amazing art decor style and most comfy beds we stayed in room so if you looking for a cheap but incredible place to stay request this there is a shared bathroom which is just across the hall which was beautiful clean and i never saw anyone else using it location wise the hotel is right beside the tram line and it took about minutes to get to the train station trams were every taxi from centre of amsterdam was only had lunch here but top marks great fresh food cooked perfectly and average were very enthusiastic and everything went recommend this hotel enough,1.0
i have stayed at this hotel on trips to amsterdam and i love it it is within an easy walk from centraal also is in a quiet location yet is easily accessible to a lot of the major tourist sights either by walking or tram the concierge room was excellent also the hotel was very accommodating to get me into my room as fast as possible after my flight i highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here on my next trip to amsterdam,1.0
want to spend some time seeing the sites in athens check this place out we like to stay at the higher end hotels this really fits the bill we stayed here before checked out a few other spots this time and decided this was the best hotel for us it a min walk to the metro which takes you to the key sites in min the gym is a serious gym for those that exercise get breakfast included it wonderful good selection the room and washroom are getting a little tired but generally very highly recommend this hotel,1.0
sure there may be newer hotelrooms in athens but i may not use a calory to find it out best location in the city excellent service spacious comfortable rooms very good breakfast buffet and helpful staff i come back here each time in athens,1.0
please please please ignore the miserable reviews below me i cant believe how some people can be so damn rude and lack so much common sense this is a lovely hotel yes its main purpose is being a business hotel but familys are still welcome ive stayed in a few business hotels now and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them just some peoples expectations are not realistic we stayed here for a week while exploring relaxing in barcelona and i wouldnt have picked anywhere else to stay stylish hotel throughout friendly staff regardless of previous comments and lovely breakfast we specifically didnt eat dinner here because of previous reviews and to be honest was glad as the downstairs restaurant is under renovation at the moment so they obviously can not offer the full service they would like too although i would like to point out that absolutely nothing could fault the breakfast service huge array of choice cooked cold cereal fruit how anyone could nit pick and find fault with that i have no had the first flight out of heathrow so arrived at the hotel around even though check in isnt supposed to open until our room was already ready for us to get comfortable and yeah okay the beds arent the softest in the world but if they were soft im pretty sure someone would complain that they werent hard after a couple of nights sleep you get used to it like a human plus actually exploring,1.0
very euro chic hotel still has a boutique like feel even though it a starwood property marc general manager and his staff were wonderful amazing rooftop infinity pool that looks over barcelona and the y queso sandwhich with truffle was amazing at the pool bar would come back over and over again,1.0
we spent one night at this hotel prior to a cruise and from the moment we arrived all the staff were great helpful and could do enough for us we were offered an upgrade and when that room would open due to an issue with the lock we were given an even better room with great views of passeig de gracia and a terrace the rooftop bar is amazing although smoking is allowed up there so stay upwind of any smokers the breakfast is good with everything you need and again super friendly efficient was quick and they ordered us a taxi for transportation to the cruise would definitely stay here again on our next visit to barcelona,1.0
i stayed at the camden court for nights on my way to kerry it is fairly centrally located within easy walking distance of central dublin ca mins with the luas overground train and buses on the doorstep i love this hotel as it offers parking which i often need when coming back to ireland and it has a leisure center with a lovely swimming pool and jacuzzi plus sauna and steam room and all the gym equipment you could want i prefer to just use the pool and the jacuzzi to unwind from being on the road for almost a day breakfast was a pleasant surprise this time around the last time i had breakfast there years ago it was nothing to shout home about this time though it was great high quality and all hot food well prepared there was a huge amount of choice for every taste and staff were helpful and friendly can definitely recommend it i also appreciated the wonderful porters who helped me with my luggage everyone in fact was helpful friendly and a joy to interact with thank you for making my first two days back in ireland memorable and enjoyable,1.0

hotel was terrible the staff very rude and not attentive at all shoes were stolen out of our hotel room and the hotel did not do anything furthermore hotel staff entered our room and opened all our luggages and inspected them for some reasons when complaining about these not acceptable incidents they seemed not to care and we did not get a clear answer to what happened or anything besides all that they also gave us a hotel room where puke was in front of our bed and the smell in the room was horrible not recommendable property,0.0
we stayed in one of the houses which are owned by desmond the owned of the roxford lodge we booked the house thru airbnb the house was clean modern and well appointed with everything that we needed for our is excellent several local bars and restaurants within metres and a minute walk to trinity college temple bar was an convivial and gracious host and even provided us with some basic foodstuffs on will not be disappointed with this property,1.0
the hotel is in a very good location for walking or metro the staff is friendly and there english is very good the hotel is very clean as is the room and the bath the cost of the stay is a great value for the money i give this hotel an excellent rating,1.0
very modern hotel at an extremely fair price the location is defiantly in a much more local then touristy area though which can make you trip a lot more fun depending on what you are looking for the beach is a quick jog away and fantastic cafes are on almost every corner for your more laid back travelers this is a perfect stay,1.0
i really liked this hotel i was only here one night but the entire staff was very helpful and accommodating the street looks a little rough with graffiti and a homeless man sleeping in the street but i can attest that it is really a easy location to everything a lot of athens can seem a little rough but this hotel is a nice little spot for a great stay,1.0
we arrived in athens on the way to naxos booked this hotel last minute based on trip advisors rating i must say wow this place is worth all its stars they are experienced in the hospitality industry the front desk danae katerina and manager dominik and the rest of the staff are wonder and paid a lot of attention to rooms grounds and pool stars we then tried their restaurant which was also fantastic its minutes from downtown athens by cab in a very upscale neighborhood as i travel to my next island naxos i have already booked my next stay here as i consider myself a very hard to please and demanding guest but they came thru in such a grand i highly recommend this hotel to all,1.0
this hotel is quite pricey but everything in amsterdam is so it was not that far out of range we stayed in a suite and had so much room very spacious living room with a couch that works as a bed and then a separate bedroom also beds are quite comfortable and the bathroom was quite roomy with both a shower and a tub it was all very clean and the view was amazing we just sat and watched out the window quite a bit we could see much of amsterdam from our window and took advantage of the white nights to stay up and watch the world go by we also took were able to use the executive level privileges breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks very helpful at saving money and also very good food and service the hotel is very centrally located easy to get to from central station which is right next door it is also close to hop off boat and bus routes so that is easy is you use that option while sightseeing good restaurants are nearby and everything is very convenient it is a cruise stop hotel so it can get quite busy at times but we did not mind as it did not really affect us much they also have bikes to rent so that a fun way to get around and they have waters in the lobby to grab on your way out for the day and those cookies and there,1.0
very clean hotel convenient location near la rambla and other nice and plentiful breakfast but it could be rooftop pool was very appreciated after a long hot go back,1.0
the hotel is well linked with metro the service level is comply with the stars while the menu of the sky loung restaurant could be improved the panorama on the acropoli is amazing even if the area is not so attractive i will come back for sure,1.0
chose this hotel because of its location price and previous reviews i was disappointed we walked all over the downtown area the canals were amazing lots of shopping sights and restaurants nearby the hotel was clean and really decorated nicely breakfast was great and plentiful the staff were all helpful they gave us directions to sights restaurants and even offered us breakfast when we checked in early they were a huge help carrying our luggage up the stairs whenever we needed yes the stairs are steep but the staff was always there to help i would definitely stay there again,1.0
the location of the hotel could not have been more perfect it just a short drive from the airport and the hotel is centrally located in athens city center great design and a short walk to all the chicest restaurants and shops,1.0
krystel found us a great room helped us arrange a shuttle directions to airport really appreciate that she understands family she was patient kind and helpful i have already recommended to friends flying into and out of you for a great stay we will definitely be back,1.0
sorry but this hotel was not good stayed in room which faces over the internal courtyard where park to access the hotel no air con so window needed to be left open to keep room reasonable temperature woken at by delivery lorry which was noisily loaded this is street noise this was directly outside the hotel and appeared to be stuff from the hotel reception told me this was a quiet room when i checked in sorry but they were having a laugh,0.0
this hotel is centrally located although very expensive checking in was a bit long and laborious further frustration was endured when collecting the keys when the room was ready because we were registered incorrectly reception staff could be more welcoming that being said they did have a great deal of people to attend to and we did receive an apology from the very gracious manager for the inconvenience caused the room was modern with good facilities large bath walk in shower and separate loo beds were unbelievably luxurious with crisp white linen our room slept three and was spacious we had a drink in the bar area which was quiet on the inside and busier outside again bar staff could have been more welcoming and attentive the champagne breakfast was exceptional all the staff in the restaurant were brilliant friendly welcoming and attentive which is what one would expect from this high class hotel the food was phenomenal and the choice was over whelming in a good way there were several areas of food including smoothie bar cereals fruit bread cakes hot food and omelettes freshly cooked to order see pictures to perfection it was such a pleasure to have this experience whilst staying in amsterdam,1.0
it was always a great experience staff are effective and efficient well kept and maintained rooms we always wants to come back whenever we are in barcelona it perfect location close to anything you need,1.0
we enjoyed our stay at the marker we arrived from boston at and the room was ready for us to drop off our stuff and take a shower the hotel is in a great location it took us minutes walk to get to temple bar for drinks and dinner the breakfast was awesome,1.0
i stayed in the marker on a recent overnight business trip everything was fantastic and i was delighted to get a complimentary room upgrade my only issue was i arrived late had to leave early so i did get to spend more time there,1.0
clean secure and central in dublin expensive for what it was a tiny room with single bed and shared bathroom worked out at on hostelworld for a midweek night should be cheaper as comparable prices around dublin can get you lots more for an extra or,0.0
we stayed at this hotel on our last night in amsterdam and it was the perfect ending to the trip hotel de hallen is truly unique a transformed space with creative decor and design so fun for young couples and families i have stayed at a number of hotels but this one is truly unforgettable i loved every piece of detail the vibrant colors trendy atmosphere and convenient amenities i wish we could have stayed longer the staff is very helpful and friendly the hotel is minute walking distance to central amsterdam and the hotel rooms are perfectly designed modern amenities clean comfortable and upscale the pricing is perfectly affordable i actually could believe how wonderful the hotel was for how much we paid i will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting amsterdam and i can not wait to return one day a wonderful stay,1.0
you would never know from the outside what awaits you inside gorgeous amenities and spotless spaces and rooms beautiful attention to detail the gardens and the restaurants and bars all add the final touches get away from all the hustle and bustle in this incredible hotel,1.0
hotel well situated in the heart of dublin and close to the nightlife of temple bar i found the hotel itself to be a little tired with signs of wear tear in some of the public areas having said that the bedroom was more then adequate with a good selection of both hot cold food for breakfast and hotel itself was very clean large tight car park to the rear which if staying at the hotel you get a discount on the cost,1.0
the hotel is amazing the owner is very helpful as well the power went out in northern holland for the first time in years and we had our flight that morning the trains were not running so we risked missing our flight torren kept calling different taxi until he was able to get a hold of one and we were able to make our flight on time thanks torren,1.0
this hotel is very old the rooms are not pretty at all the wifi is charged expensive the hotel receives a lot of tours and school trips etc so it is very busy it has a pool on the top floor which is nice but the personnel is unfriendly as can be if you have children that can swim well you have to be inside the pool too to take care of them the pool can be visited from am to pm very short time the breakfast buffet is a bit expensive for what it offers so you are better having breakfast in any of the coffee shops there are just crossing the street to get to the center you have to take a taxi that will charge you around euros i would not choose this hotel again,0.0
the staff are lovely really helpful kind and friendly however the hotel is falling apart it grubby at best filthy in parts the breakfast is horrible any price is too much i stayed here loads of times in the past and always thought it was acceptable for the price and the fabulous location not anymore it needs to be closed down and renovated it could be lovely the location is great,0.0
excellent location with tram stops right outside the staff were very friendly the rooms a good size clean the breakfasts plentiful and good quality and a great bar on site what more do you need,1.0
we were visiting amsterdam to celebrate some special birthdays and chose a this hotel to treat ourselves we were disappointed the rooms were very comfortable with everything you could need to enhance your stay what made it for us though was the attitude of the staff all were friendly efficient and very helpful we would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
nested in the angle of a canal in the heart of the old town the hotel de is pure class you really feel that this hotel is special not part of a chain or franchise privately owned by the heineken family and indeed originally used as the special venue to accommodate the founder guests the service is exceptionally charming the concierges really knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile the food is superb and the waterside venue stunning the rooms are individual and stylish after years in different places in the city i have now unquestionably found my in amsterdam i would want to stay anywhere else,1.0

just had a long weekend stay and would certainly return easy walk to local restaurants bars etc and to vondel park and museums room well appointed and staff could have been more helpful excellent minor criticism is that web site directions on how to find from tram be much clearer yes i got lost in heavy rain,1.0
great little hotel near all the action impeccable service champagne on arrival and thorough explanation of everything in the hotel you get a free mobile device with a ton of local info for walking around down too,1.0
this was my trip to barcelona and this is my personal experience i have been in hospitality management for over years i am always willing to bend break the policy when it comes to legitimate human life issues of my i prefer to cultivate a relationship based on trust and return business with my clients on july we had a family emergency but even after explaining the situation were denied a refund for the nights stay on the that we could not use as we had to fly back home to on this personal experience when i return to barcelona in i will book elsewhere,0.0
we stayed nights in barcelona we had two connecting rooms in the hotel hotel location ambiance food service beds decor everything was star highly recommend this hotel w hotel which i though was very dated and off location reception door man waitress all went above and beyond for service only thing negative was the pool was very tiny and breakfast had limited choices and very expensive there are tons of cafe and restaurants behind the hotel we found a pizza pattza which was pretty decent food in barcelona was expensive compare to in barcelona was amazing at this time of the year although i think it peak of the tourism streets were packed with people everywhere,1.0
really helpful staff only too ready to book excursions tours and give advice position of the hotel was within easy walking distance of all the city attractions and shopping centres at breakfast there was a very good choice with good coffee was good in the room bathrooms needed updating,1.0
perfect location so close to the bars and restaurants and a short walk over the bridge to the shops the staff were very friendly and helpful which made for a nice warm welcome the rooms were fairly old with only available power point but overall very quiant clean and comfortable our room was facing the busy street at the front of the hotel so it was rather noisy through the night with traffic and passerbys but other than that we enjoyed our stay,1.0
the house offers first class accomodation in a very convenient location excellent breakfast coffee facilities in the room would be a bonus but is available in the lounge hours staff really helpful and secure parking off road,1.0
worst hotel i have stayed in there no ac holes in the door holes in bathtub dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till am someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous it probably has really good bones and could be redone as a boutique hotel the staff on the other hand was very kind when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air would recommend this to anyone,0.0
we stayed here for two nights we got an upgraded room that was words of staff but do know if it was real or just our room the room was very big bathroom too the room was very well soundproofed the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was just normal instead of others comments i do think it is super basic plates orange juice greek yogourt croissant breads cake few jams peach eggs and bacon coffee and tea that all i think so the price is a bit expensive but it is vacation after all anyway the hotel is at a good location by feet from victoria station green line and by feet from larissa station red line or regular trains,1.0
rooms are great even cooled before arrival on warm in the restaurant is fast correct and friendly special thanks to mayramenu is ok but for regular visitors a bit more variation would be welcome,1.0
stayed here for a hen party last week from the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out everyone was just so helpful and lovely hotel is spotless and so modern door staff were so helpful from booking taxis to giving you umbrellas would certainly stay here again,1.0
we stayed here for two nights after some time in killarney overall we were happy with our stay we asked for a quiet room and got one at the back which was perfect the bathroom was a great size and the room came with a kettle iron tv with lots of channels and a hair dryer the staff were really lovely especially those at breakfast which by the way was superb the bar food for lunch and supper was only ok though there are plenty of eateries about that looked better to be a city centre hotel space is limited and expensive so it important that you have realistic expectations on what size room you will have and the price the location more than makes up though,1.0
location is good rooms are clean although on the small size however the beds are not too comfortable and the noise from the pub downstairs is unbearable in other countries this place would just not get a licence as a hotel we would recommend travellers to keep off this noisy place,0.0
spent nights in this lovely boutique hotel the room had a much needed king size bed night tables with close by plugs for all your electronics bathrooms were large and modern with everything you could possibly need slippers bathrobes etc staff was amazing location ca be beat did not indulge in the breakfast but went to the bakery around the corner for chocolate croissants would definitely return,1.0
just like the title the hotel is horrible nothing of hotel would be much more a pension dirty sheets and torn floor full of hair employee who does not speak english inserted in street also very dirty,0.0
my wife and i stayed for a night in the hotel and found its location to be super convenient to visit the various sightseeing locations around dublin its proximity to locations such as trinity college about mins walk christ church cathedral walk and dublin castle about min walk makes it easy to visit especially if you have a short time further its not too close to the main part of temple bar hence the noise was bad,1.0
from the moment of our arrival which was a bit late around to be exact my daughter and i felt welcomed by the staff at hotel jl the entry is quite bright and charming the desk representative was quite lovely and gave me all the information i could possibly need for my stay the room was beyond my expectations with a full jet stream tub and steam shower and tv the bed was plush and comfy and the robes were quite the plus the daily breakfast was delicious and plentiful the staff was amazing i honestly have not stayed at a better hotel their service and accommodations exceeded my expectations and i am a travel blogger i travel quite often please do yourself a favor and stay here,1.0
the positives the location of this venue is absolutely perfect minute walk to the diagonal mar shopping centre and minute walk to the beach minutes walk front desk staff were awesome and always to assist checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no at staff in the restaurant in the evening were very and the food quality was very buffet was fine good choice of and the options for which type of breakfast were junior suite has a large bathroom and the bed was negatives sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to junior suites are on all floors the first suite and not ideally placed next to the housekeeping room so there is a lot of noise from the housekeeping door being and the room attendants and their associated room attendants failed badly on the night first night we opted just for change of towels but nights the room was not cleaned properly not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a job not once but twice after we complained to front desk things were fine but the staff on housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple second problem is that whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time if you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling,1.0
granted this place is clean and in a good location however this is where the positives walls are paper thin so we can at this moment hear the couple on one side of us having a conversation and the cleaner vigorously cleaning the room and possibly rearranging the furniture on the other every time our neighbours take a morning shower at or this morning at it sounds like a waterfall is running down the wall beside our bed we can hear lights being switched on plugs being put in and out conversations tvs hangers being battered in the cupboards and people walking on the laminated flooring the hotel has a pool which attracted us in the first place but do let that entice you since it only gets sun in the morning and the loungers and swiftly taken by people who do leave them all day so no chance of using it until the sun goes down avoid at all costs if you want a good nights sleep in preparation for your busy trek around the city,0.0
good hotel would recommend this to anyone as has got good links via metro into main centre of city but is much quieter we got free upgrade to a room with view of sagrada famillia by lovely receptionist for our honeymoon great views,1.0
the rooms were very nice the staff were really kind and professional good cleaningservice and nice pool only improvement would be the gym we would preferably some free weights there will definately return,1.0
adorable hotel clean and brand new minutes away from the city missing some extra facilities like pool and spa helping staff and good buffet great room service food only thing i would suggest is for them to warn people from pocket pickers phone got stolen in a coffee shop in monastiraki ps greeks are lovely people very welcoming,1.0
stayed there for days night the room was very clean and staff were very friendly location was great as if you want to do some sightseeing there is a bus stop right across the street from the hotel for the open top bus tour the tour takes you to most of the major sightseeing places in barcelona although this is not a big hotel but the rooms are still spacious we got a coupon for free drinks upon check in we visited the bar on our last night the bar could over see the most famous architecture of gaudi the la sagrada familia the view is very nice from the rooftop bar i recommend this hotel for couples friends and families to stay and remember to go to their rooftop bar for the night view of barcelona you will be amazed,1.0
stayed here with my partner for days in july i would say the location was perfect for us just a short walk from the ramblas which we preferred as it was so exposed and crowded the hotel is very modern and up together our room was spacious and very clean we also had a lovely little balcony the only thing i would say is i like to have tea and coffee facilities in our room and they do provide that very happy with the place and i would definitely recommend,1.0
great value comfortable room great location with easy access to transportation city centre and airport park nearby good breakfast especially for the morning leaving to airport coming amsterdam,1.0
located just outside the centre this hotel is around walk away it has shuttle service to trains station every mins booking at the concierge desk room is spacious and well maintained however the front check in counters staffs should smile more no point working on the front counter with sulking faces the concierge staffs however are beyond great overall hotel need to constantly monitoring smoking weeds in the room some time the corridor is stunk with the odour hope management with take note,1.0
i recently stayed here for a couple of nights on a business trip i enjoyed the quietness and the view from the room it was a relaxing stay with a well presented breakfast selection the staff were very helpful and friendly and most spoke enough english for me to get by the hotel had free wifi but i was unable to get this to work but as i was only there for a short while it was a problem for me,1.0
my wife and stayed for six nights and enjoyed every minute the hotel is modern beautiful and best of all the staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful being right at a luas tram stop makes the location very convenient to desired locations we would definitely stay here again next time in dublin,1.0
this was a very nice hotel for our group of people our process was efficient and friendly the room and bed were both comfortable the room provides a counter with television and desk area and a small closet there was a refrigerator with four bottles of water no charge the bathroom has a basin on a small counter with a variety of provided amenities toothbrush comb the has a glass door that covers only half of the opening so it was hard to keep water from running onto the floor during a shower the shower drained very slowly but the water pressure was strong and the temperature stayed consistent the free wifi service in the room and the lobby was strong and reliable we found only one electrical outlet in the room and one in the bathroom for charging electronics but we carry our own plug strip so it was no problem we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would be glad to return in the future,1.0
holiday trip with kids i ordered rooms for nights reading all the reviews i was certain i had a great place to night aircondition did not work the staff are well trained to apologize coz all they said was we could get you a fan for tonight is that why i am paying full price we moved rooms the next it the fifth night and yet again the airconditioner is not a nightmare this hotel is and as nice as the staff is it is completely not what is your time holiday and money is dear to you do not approach this hotel,0.0
this hotel is in an amazing location it away from all the tourist shops and is real amsterdam i only have one negative and it a bit of a pet peeve rooms listed as two beds do really have two beds it two singles pushed so close together you basically sharing a double everything else was fantastic staff is superb,1.0
the hotel arts is not only charming but it has exceptional service food clientele the hotel arts staff truly makes you feel like you have their undecided attention and they help you create a barcelona experience you will never forget i also highly suggest the club level as it make eating snacking so convenient apart from breath taking views the staff on the club level took care of our every whim and desire all in all it was the perfect hotel and i ca wait to stay there again,1.0
we stayed in a tasteful clean functional room overlooking the harbor in a port view room fyi you can usually only get this type of room when you order online directly through the hotel website for our family visit of people it was a very functional we had a king size bed for the of us and a single bed for our teenage daughter there was another single daybed that we used to put our luggage the bathroom worked well for us we had a single shower in one area then there was a second having separate shower areas was great for getting ready more quickly in between both showering areas there was a fairly large area with a sink big mirror magnifying mirror and all of the various toiletry items as well as a blow dryer we had wonderful robes and thick towels they had champagne and chocolates waiting for us in the room they had many different pillow sizes and a card that allowed you could choose the fragrance of you room the room was quiet and the worked great we had troubles with the safe and had to call them separate times to get it resolved which they finally did by changing it out for a new one the room had a table desk coffee maker and mini refrigerator which was stocked with drinks and food though we did not buy any of their products instead we walked to a grocery store that was only a short,1.0

this is a beautiful hotel within view of the acropolis it has a roof garden restaurant with magnificent views of the parthenon i would have given it five stars except that its two tiny elevators are not quite sufficient to get guests up to the floor roof deck for breakfast while getting other guests and their luggage out for and the stairs mostly lack hand rails,1.0
located by diagonal mar barcelona mins walk from the beach close to diagonal mar shopping centre mins walk mins walk to metro station where you can get a metro into barcelona central plenty of restaurants located at diagonal art deco throughout staff helpful reception cleaning rooms modern and clean large shower cubicle roof terrace with bar and pool did use this but looked very good free safe mini tv limited on english speaking channels no problems highly recommended,1.0

the hotel was clean and close to the airport but those are the only two good things about it the airport shuttle rarely runs only between and not dependable the hotel is also in the middle of nowhere and the in the hotel was closed during our stay as well as this there were only two power outlets in a room that was housing people,0.0

the hotel place is a good point and you can go to anywere by bus or metro you can walk in about one hour to reach gothic area of the city or beach but our rooms was good enogh and the service was below average our room was in first floor with a small window if you opened it you could just see emergency exit with ugly view there was any blanket in the room and when we asked for that we recieved a dirty one without cover we had some problem with the safe box too and waited two days until someone came up and fixed it if you want a cheep hotel near bus or metro its a good choice but next time i choose a different hotel for sure,0.0

myself and my fiancé were warmly welcomed yesterday to a fantastic afternoon tea experience with a twist to celebrate our recent engagement we both chose the crafted g t cocktail which was served in a teapot accompanied by garnishes of apple cucumber and a delicious ginger sugar syrup to start the presentation was just what you expect from a hotel it was much more than that with twists on all the classics adding character and giving the elegant afternoon tea a shake up and a refreshing relevance the classic ham cheese was served on tomato bread and topped with goats cheese cucumber the pork belly was phenomenal there was a caesar taco which both looked and tasted fantastic but the showstopper came in the form of a foie gras white chocolate lollipop which was a taste a must try before you die kinda thing sweet treats were equally as impressive with a selection of strawberry eclairs salted caramel macaroons and ginger meringue cones but the gin infused panna cotta was the talking piece served with tonic foam and cucumber caviar it took real will power not to lick the bowl as an overall experience ca recommend it enough the manager nicky who took the time to congratulate us in person and offer us complimentary prosecco and his team are doing a fantastic job our server gabor could not do enough for us he made us feel so special and really topped off what was an amazing experience overall,1.0
i really enjoyed my stay at this beautifully designed hotel my room was gorgeous and one of the most unique i have stayed in spent some time at the rooftop bar and pool where staff were just perfect great place to cool off have a drink and get ready for the evening the best thing was their portier mobile phone it acts as a hot spot for your mobile and i popped it in my bag and took it with me everywhere so i did need to worry about wifi or mobile roaming it also had suggestions for restaurants shops and itineraries such a good idea hope to see more hotels provide this of the staff front desk porters cleaning etc were really friendly and helpful so many choices in this wonderful city and i am glad i chose the claris,1.0

it gives me great pleasure to review the stunning divani caravel hotel athens last week my family and i had the pleasure to call the property home whilst visiting the beautiful capital city of greece upon our arrival we were professionally and promptly greeted by concierge and reception staff our suite was that of above and beyond expectation and quality that was comfortable and spacious we could unwind within the suite with ease it contained flat screen televisions a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom the property is beautifully maintained spotless and reception is it a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us whilst we stayed with you everybody from check in through to house keeping food and beverage services were brilliant and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service you all made us feel right at home our experience was indeed sublime the roof top pool is very memorable for our and the food cocktails and stunning uninterrupted view of athens and the parthenon unforgettable breath taking breakfast was delicious and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay perfectly located in athens lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the but do yourself favor and savor the divani caravel club sandwich,1.0
we stayed at the condado for nights overall the we stayed in was spacious and clean with plenty of wardrobe room was back of the hotel which meant it was nice and quiet however the windows looked out into an external shaft so had no view and little lighting in the room itself was a little dim but i guess it could be classed as subdued and there is no fridge iron or kettle in the rooms there is a safe hair dryer and tv and good wifi on each floor there is a small fridge with small bottles of water and in the lobby there are computers with a printer to be able print out tickets at the hotel is continental style with sausages bacon and scrambled egg costs euro there are lots of coffee shops and cafes less than min walk from the hotel area is about a walk to the diagonale or gracia metro stations however this is a much more relaxed part of barcelona nice bars and restaurants only a short walk the meatpacking bistro around the corner is really nice over the road there is a big food from the airport was around would definitely recommend the hotel if you do want to be in the very hustle and bustle part of barcelona and do mind a amble to the nearest metro stop or bus stop of which we tried the bus turistic and had very few problems as was replied to a previous review,1.0

the hotel definitely feels like a hotel and the service is friendly and attentive the architecture and décor inside are cool giving a welcoming space cocktails in the bar were ok not spectacular and very expensive for two rooms were spacious comfortable and nicely we were not allowed in the rooftop bar at on the saturday evening too busy first time ever i have been refused access as a resident in to a hotel bar maybe you need a policy review one of the reasons i chose the hotel was the rooftop bar expensive error,1.0
hopfully someone contemplating this hotel reads this and saves themselves the hassel i never written a review for a hotel but here i am writing my first review on my way to a new for two nights and checked out after a couple of hours due to the extremely loud music of their downstairs reception told me it would continue until and they offer ear you looking for a hotel room where you want to sleep before this is it,0.0
beware of this hotel they have at least one thief at the main desk and they re lying to cover it up do pay in cash or if you do be sure to get a written receipt at june we gave a cash hold deposit that they demanded the gal at on june refused to give us our cash refund said it would be credited to our visa card that did happen it now over weeks later now they deny we ever gave them a deposit in essence they claiming they let us stay without a temporary hold deposit of euros obviously one or both of the clerks pocketed our should have used our visa card instead of cash we should have demanded a receipt actually maybe we should have never stayed at nh amsterdam so do trust nh amsterdam we certainly never stay there again,0.0
everything about the hotel experience from the communication i had before leaving the states to our arrival room choice support from staff during our stay and our was flawless the managers and front line staff were all delightful and could not have been more dedicated to making our stay at the hotel and in amsterdam a great room had a lovely view of the area which helped us determine the weather each morning we used the hotel bikes to get around which was complimentary and easy to arrange there is a tram stop across the street and you can walk to central station easily it is also located in the middle of the city so you can walk to every neighborhood and attraction bring comfortable shoes overall one of the best hotel experiences we had culture and standards as well as kimpton style are well represented in this property you can not go wrong with the dewitt,1.0

what a fantastic hotel the location is amazing but too many times you book a hotel because of the location and that all it has to offer the fitzwilliam dublin does just stop at the front door all the staff are extremely polite and helpful i could see this by the reaction of other guest who were visiting dublin and possible ireland for the first time asking question and been given the time and attention supporting their every requirement the food is outstanding using fresh locally sourced ingredients try the citron restaurant then relax in the up the good work,1.0
stayed here for two nights from july as a surprise trip my partner booked for my birthday our room was absolutely beautiful and quiet with lovely views of the city and of a garden below we went out on the first night got engaged and when returned to the room the staff had left a meat and cheese board and a bottle of wine the staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much they also allowed us to store our luggage after we checked out so we could explore the city some more as our flight was at night would definitely return to this hotel thankyou for making our trip so special,1.0

we stayed here my wife and i booked a standard room for night it was the middle of the week and they upgraded us to a balcony room we probably would have booked this room had we been there more than one night it was amazing if a little small the balcony was nice had a great view of the canal and allowed us a nice cool place to people watch there were a few quirks here when you leave you leave your key with the front desk and pick it up when you get back i assume this is so you do lose the physical key while visiting the city smart the stairs to the rooms are a bit steep and narrow i a big guy and still made it just fine even loaded with bags the bed was comfortable but not overly we loved it the staff were nice and friendly and spoke perfect english as do many many people here the location was close enough to everything we wanted to see so we could walk everywhere i would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return if we ever make it back to amsterdam,1.0

my mother in law booked this hotel for a family trip i would never have booked this hotel in a million years on the face value however i had no choice but to stay the bare minimum i require from a hotel is its clean this hotel was filthy that enough to not to ever book it please see the pictures quick points was no ac the taps did work shower leaded and was wrapped up with tape noisey view from the windows in our room was laughable lovely roof covered in ac units that do work covered in mould sheets i could go on do not be fooled into thinking the location will make up for negatives of this hotel there are other hotels book those instead that the hotel the dinner show the table layabouts was rubbish the food was it was insanely hot the service was terrible it was so loud you could speak to someone next to you i watched another couple leave midway through their starter it was that bad it over priced and not worth it please i implore you not to book this hotel not waste your money,0.0
my wife and i stayed for days at clayton hotel ballsbridge in dublin upscale location close to restaurants and transportation the staff was very accomodating and pleasant to deal with from reception to housekeeping especially ana and imelda in reception the facility could use some refurbishing but the cost of a stay was about half of the facility across the street overall it was a good experience recommended,1.0
perfect location easy walking to port and ramblas some nice bars in the area for cocktails room was clean and large staff friendly bathroom was clean beds comfortable tv in the walk to hop on and hop off bus stop,1.0
i stayed at this hotel on my own for a long weekend born and raised in amsterdam i try to stay in or near my old neighbourhood in amsterdam east oost i recall when i lived there the manor was an old hospital and always admired the building when cycling into town when my usual hotels were fully booked i decided to give the manor a go and i was disappointed the staff upon arrival were lovely and the checkin extremely quick the hotel has a fantastic amsterdam theme and the three crosses are everywhere bit too much for some but i loved it the room was great very spacious huge bed lovely bathroom everything i needed and even a tv attached to the bed that could swivel round fab my room was at the back of the hotel and there was no noise what so ever had a great night sleep all weekend the hotel location is great the area has improved so much since i lived there and there so much to do fantastic restaurants and pubs a little shopping centre and you a five minutes walk from the tropenmuseum and a few tram stops from the zoo speaking of trams the tram practically stops outside the hotel and that will take you into the city centre within but if you a real amsterdammer like me you like to cycle this hotel cater for that you can rent bikes at the hotel for i think for hours perfect,1.0
just take a quick ferry across to center of everything great hotel very cool vibes beautiful views wonderful people clean friendly and easy access to center i stayed in many hotels in amsterdam this is one of my favorites,1.0

i met a girlfriend and her daughter here for a birthday weekend for the year old and we all enjoyed our stay immensely the hoxton was recommended by some friends of theirs and with no expectations i was thoroughly impressed by this hotel and had a wonderful stay we had room between the of us and both were completely happy with the rooms we had the staff was helpful and friendly they were very knowledgeable as well they helped up book a few things and ensured we knew how to get to the places we were going the staff in the bar was friendly as well the rooms were clean and both my friend and i had canal views that were just gorgeous the bed was comfortable the bathroom was big enough to maneuver in and the room was spacious enough to manage in even though listed as cozy it felt spacious i need to mention the view again totally worth ensuring you get a canal view the breakfast options and delivery to the door as well as the water and mils sticked in the fridge are nice touches that we really appreciated we are still talking about our stay weeks later and how much we loved this hotel and get back to amsterdam i will be staying here,1.0
highly recommended rooms are lovely staff are so helpful and friendly metro and taxis easily accessible beach is a little distance away but easy enough to get to with there services we used metro brought a ticket for got red from clot to urquinaona and then yellow for two stops to barcelona the a min walk to the beach sounds alot but it so quick and easy or taxi is the hotel has a pool which is lovely but only beds it would be good if they got a few more but not essential as most people go to the beach,1.0
my husband and i stayed nights at the abac hotel before departing our cruise wonderful personal service beautiful room and charming property cab ride or subway to city center from this hotel located in a upscale neighborhood there is also a star michelin restaurant here however we were not able to dine at the restaurant during our short stay would definitely stay here again my only negative is that i wish the lighting in the bathroom was better,1.0
got a cheek to call this a hotel an absolute was charged for nights in this hovel how do they get away with this in my opinion per night would be more suitable people take my advice go elsewhere my towel rail in the toilet was a rusty screw on the back of the door and we had lights hanging off the wall above the bed and a tv that went out of style in the s what a dump and in my opinion a death trap if a fire was to break out,0.0
the hotel is in a great central location with railway station and dam square all within easy walking distance and with friendly helpful staff our room was very comfortable and we overlooked the street below,1.0
stay here on a recent trip to amsterdam to catch a gig at the amsterdam arena hotel is right across the road from central station and close to any of the main attractions around staff are friendly from the reception bar and restaurant who all made sure we had a great stay decor through out the hotel is modern and comfortable with lots of expensive furnishings and gallery work rooms are comfortable with all mod cons nice little touches such as pillow spray and wake up balm we had breakfast included in our rate and both mornings we had an enjoyable breakfast which seemed to be pretty relaxed compared to a lot of hotels in the morning when it comes to the buffett fitness area gym is good the spa looks a bit of a mess and afterthought certainly not anywhere near the standard of other star hotels i have stayed at staff lying around reading books with top off relaxing with dirty laundry piled up in the corner it can get noisy at night with dj playing in the bars when you are trying to sleep i did mind this but it something to bare in mind if you are wanting a quieter hotel i really enjoyed my stay here thanks,1.0
first time staying at alma will definitely return the hotel we always stay at was booked so alma was chosen for our two night stay chosen mostly because of location a block from passeio de gracia and number of restaurants surrounding it what a pleasant experience staff is incredible even escorting us to our room welcome bottle of champagne delivered and free mini bar are just a few of so many pluses garden where morning tea and drinks and appetizers into late evening served seemed to be always open,1.0

i stayed from july till august the reception staff and all of them there at hotel balmes are really very friendly and professional big thumbs up to everyone i love the chocolates that you leave in my room everyday after you cleaned the hotel is actually min walk to the metro station provenca which serves lines if you love walking this hotel is walking distance to most of the landmarks you can actually google them only complain is you can literally hear everything in the hallway and the rooms next to your room also if you are booking a single room be ready that it really small but bathroom is amazingly big loved my stay hope to stay here again next time i visit,1.0

this hotel is in a perfect location for anyone touring dublin or the surrounding area it also great for anyone eager to take advantage of the many pubs and discos in temple bar you can party til you drop and then crawl around the corner to the hotel if you need total quiet to sleep bring ear plugs remember temple bar is the party district a monday night here in the summer looks like bourbon street at mardi gras as for the staff here just excellent i do make a habit of hugging hotel clerks but the night before we left i needed to stop by and hug iva to thank her for all she did for us,1.0
we stayed in december but unfortunately we were happy with the room on our return home i wrote an email it was answered by dempsey the manager from that point on things just got better not only were our complaints listened too the situation was rectified we stayed again in the hotel in march as we were attending a wedding and true to his word mr dempsey made us feel like valued guests our room was beautiful the complimentary touches and service made us feel so special i glad to report that the grande dame that is the shelbourne may have changed hands had a facelift and some botox in places but the heart of the hotel the staff and customer service still shines through well done one very happy customer planning on returning to you,1.0
my stay at petit palace barcelona was quite unique it started with a very nice room that unfortunately looked like the housekeeper did finish the job in the bathroom the faucet was still running and there was some dirt in the tub otherwise the room was very clean i do think it was a genuine night manager andy handled the situation very professionally he immediately gave me keys for another room of the same type unfortunately the shape was very awkward and smaller than the other room i would have been able to use the desk for work and it did not have a patio like my earlier room he was very apologetic and provided me with a suite to use for the night my stay would have been unenjoyable without andy next morning i spoke with the gm and she was also very apologetic and allowed me to stay in the master suite and sent a bottle of wine the hospitality was great the staff were very friendly the hotel has bicycles to use in the city definitely try to book the suite with the balcony,1.0
looking for a nice hotel for the last night of our trip in ireland the clontarf castle hotel seemed to fill the bill in fact it did just that the service apart from checking in was friendly and first rate especially in the fahrenheit dining room,1.0
delightful hotel with superb staff and well thought out rooms elegant and in a great district nothing to fault best stay and wonderful breakfast loved every minute and would happily recommend rooms overlooking canals are divine but others overlooking the internal gardens are equally nice quirky artworks and architecture make this a real dutch treat bar was one of the best we visited in amsterdam,1.0

we stayed here july we paid for a standard room and were upgraded to one with a view over the canal the room was very clean and small which we expected but had plenty of well designed storage and shelves etc the windows opened but the location is quite noisy at night there was no air conditioning but a good sized fan was provided as hotel oozes a local staff were always very helpful knowledgeable and friendly as many point out the stairs on entering from the street up to the reception and rooms are a sight to behold steep curved and narrow with short steps oxygen is not provided the staff at the hotel always offer to carry everyone bags from street level to room and back out if you want them to so the stairs are not really a major issue the only problem would be if you ca physically cope with difficult was continental but always kept well stocked as people came and location is perfect for a city centre stay it is within easy walking distance minutes max of all the city centre attractions there are many very nice bars and restaurants within a short you want a basic reasonably priced city centre hotel with of local character and can climb steep stairs this should be on your list we have no hesitation in recommending it,1.0

if i was basing this review on service alone it would be stars but i had to balance it out with the outdated room furnishings let me start by saying that we arrive quite early from a transatlantic flight quite tired and although our room was not ready we were graciously offered breakfast and stored our bags as we explored dublin the rooms were clean and comfortable which is very important to us but they really need a bit of sprucing up the bathroom vanity is made of cheap material and the door was falling off the hinges and the floor tiles were cracked that being said the service and professionalism of the staff far outweighed the quality of the room the location is quiet yet close enough to walk to the action we literally walked all over dublin through stephen green and could have wished for a nicer location this was the priciest hotel we stayed out during our entire time in ireland but we did visit during peak season we would stay here again,1.0
smallish room but we upgraded to a suite for an extra charge as there were of us the service here is old fashioned hospitality very professional the breakfast is incredible and included loved the pool and spa very relaxing a short walk to the main sites of everything,1.0
the marker is a really gorgeous hotel and we had a most luxurious stay the location is great and the rooms are very comfortable the staff are all great and very helpful i highly recommend the marker hotel as a treat,1.0
we stayed here nights total before and after a cruise the staff was friendly and helpful and the room quite comfortable if you do have a view of the acropolis from your room you may go to the floor swimming pool a floor bar and restaurant or the floor roof lots of restaurants and shops nearby,1.0
i visited this hotel right now i was searching for a modern hotel close to the beach and not so far from the city in a quiet district not so noise than in downtown of barcelona which also has a roof top swimming pool itself it is a really reasonable hotel with good service the only issue is the swimming pool it is much smaller that i expected the breakfast was excellent and to walk to the sandy beach took about minutes to go the the city by taxi costs about eur only,1.0
stayed on business on a few times the rooms are spacious and the beds are huge and probably the most comfortable i have ever slept in never want to get up especially with the blackout and restaurant great but can get very busy where there are event on at the stadium or concert really lets it down only thing hot is scrambles eggs bread pastries meats cheese and some fruit nothing special and not enough choice very boring on a night stay coffee is awful stayed several times and for nights last time and on the last morning heard someone asking for fried eggs cooked to order did realise you could ask for eggs cooked to order they do tell you this when they take your room number as you come in not a patch on the breakfast at hampton by hilton,1.0
great staff joey is a great guy location is also very good everything was walkable we got a room with an view on the amstel my friend was celebrating his birthday and they put a birthday card and muffins in our room as a gift really sweet of them,1.0
cormac gave us a lovely welcome and introduction to the various teas and really put us at our ease the girls brought us lovely open sandwiches with a great selection of toppings the deserts were fabulous and we were encouraged to try different teas we loved everything but i think the orange and saffron creme brulee won would highly recommend the afternoon tea experience at clontarf castle,1.0
here we are the three of us having cocktails and dinner with the acropolis either directly in our vision or over our depending on where we magnificent food was really good and service friendly and attentive i have dined rooftop at the intercontinental this is good or better i would recommend the hotel and the rooftop to anyone tomorrow morning at we are off to climb the a place kinnaman,1.0
the hotel is absolutely amazing reasonable trek from city centre but travel cards made it a lot easier the room was well decorated cosy and well equipped the bed was comfortable and the view was nice the customer service from the majority of the staff was amazing we only have one complaint after my partners purse was stolen we went to the front desk when we got back to the hotel but the woman at the front desk did even acknowledge us until we cleared our throats after asking her what we could do about it because we never had that situation and was sure she said to us do know i guess you could tell your insurance or notify the police and showed a complete lack of interest towards the situation we left it until the morning and spoke to another member of staff and they could have been more helpful unfortunately there was much they could do but they still made the effort and showed compassion towards our situation,1.0
best location next to ramblas passeig de gracias and walking distance to the market rooms were great and spacious washrooms were super nice not much for views but you do really stay in your room while you in barcelona definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,1.0
a smallish hotel in a pleasant area with friendly staff the rooms and food were of good quality and the area quiet nearby is sandymount village with shops and pubs and a little further on is a beach which provided a pleasant evening walk,1.0
the hotel is on the main route into the city centre and minutes away from the subway the area itself if you took a small walk heading away from the main road you will find small cafe bars and square and some quaint buildings its dusty but authentic and a lot cheaper than the city to eat the hotel had sufficient staff on the desk to help you and they spoke different languages the room was large enough and had the usual hilton facilities nice bathroom but and this is the only but i could hear my neighbours every move and it carried on until the early hours,1.0
great hotel great area right outside the iconic iamsterdam sign short walk to the action lovely service from the staff too was a great place to spend my birthday only problem was the walls were a bit thin so got a noise complaint from next door,1.0
great hotel within walking distance of the centre of barcleona and really close to metro station staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was lovely and clean with good size rooms and free wifi would def recommend,1.0
very close to st stephens green which only one reason to make this hotel your go to for dublin an easy walk to grafton street a little longer trek to temple bar area if bussing in from the airport the stop is but a block away the breakfast is wonderful but unfortunately that is the best dining experience in this hotel typically arrived very early morning four am they would always pour us a pint or two before breakfast welcome to ireland rooms are adequate pub in lower level was closed the last visit hopefully that is not permanent and may well be operational as it has been awhile since last visit,1.0
we stayed here for a weekend nice hotel not quite sure about the decor of the rooms but it was one excellent feature was the very powerful shower really great though you need to leave the bathroom door open otherwise everything gets wet from condensation very good central location we walked to most places we wanted to see,1.0
june we arrived at our hotel polis grand in athens and were completely exhausted from the flight plus a hour time zone difference the hotel is a in my opinion the hotel itself is clean but like many european hotels the room is very small as is the bathroom however the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it they put out a lot of hot and cold dishes plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast too many things to list including the drinks overall this hotel is nice and the service is friendly and is good for a quick day stopover on your way to see other part of greece greek isles while i am here i will take this opportunity to mention our day stay in we got to our hotel at from the airport they told us that check in time was and after so we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of athens and eventually wound up at the monastiraki square we had a gyros and went back to our hotel to take a nap we woke up a little later and went back to eat dinner at monastiraki in the evening this is a very lively place full of lights music shops street vendors and live bands it was entertaining as far as the food goes it was good but unfortunately being from toronto i can not in all,1.0
the hotel was good nice beds space etc but it a bit of a walk to see things food was good nothing exceptional most staff from other countries tried their best to be understood just have to get used to different accents pretty often bar was great bar staff was wonderful parking available but tight very interesting history of this hotel,1.0
this is a great concept of hotel for young people that want to work and have fun at the same time good public areas to work with a laptop and chill staff is great and they really make you feel at home and free to be yourself excelent wifi,1.0

this hotel is located well outside the city center of amsterdam so that was a big draw back additionally the staff was incredibly unhelpful we accidentally booked this location and contacted the hotel immediately after booking to indicate our booking was a mistake they refused to issue us a refund or even allow us to transfer to one of the other nh hotels closer to the city center we offered to pay the difference in cost we just really did want to stay out there once we arrived and got in to our room there were peanut shells all over the floor and dark hairs on the chair and floor so the room had been poorly cleaned again the hotel staff at this point refused to help us by issuing a refund or allowing us to switch locations pretty awful experience the only good thing was the bike rental which we could have done at almost any hotel in amsterdam,0.0
this hotel is a modern styled multistory property located conveniently close to the local shopping centre and just a short tram trip to the beach or walk rooms are clean and well equipped with essential air conditioning the bathroom is modern and features bath x shower heads basin wc and a bidet a sliding screen seperates the bedroom from the bathroom for thoses who prefer to retain a bit of modesty see images is important and this hotel offers a fully cooked quality breakfast along side the usual continental selection the breakfast area is large and at no time was there any need to queue staff are very friendly and accommodating and very knowledgable with the local area they have plenty of time for you and can offer maps showing you the local to the hotel from the airport will cost around by taxi or just over by train the train can be embarked on at the airport and will take you to within a minute walk of the hotel you may want to remember this in case the taxis are on strike as they were when i visited any negatives well no not really around midnight it can get a little noisy in the corridors due to guests returning to their rooms but there again this is barcelona so this will surely be the case in all hotels as commented by others the rooftop is a really pleasant area to relax and wind down a pint of pisners will,1.0

the staff is incredible at this small boutique hotel my two nights here were very enjoyable the main floor is spectacular with sitting rooms a library area restaurant and terrace the breakfast buffet was delicious and sitting outside for a nightcap on the terrace is highly decor and furnishings of the public rooms really stand out there are examples of fabrics products and ledgers from the building previous incarnation as a club for textile suppliers and tailors even though my room was on the fifth floor i usually took the spiral staircase up and down so as to soak in the sights of the spherical lanterns and the rest of the building there is a very small fitness area on the top floor adjacent to the deck and pool the latter is tiny and is really just for immersion rather than swimming unless you have it to yourself views over the busy street include various hills and highlights of barcelona such as the tops of the towers of la sagrada familia rooms are small and the decorations are simple in a stark white the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom amenities fantastic my only complaint is that i asked for a room away from the street but did not receive one even though there are windows i could still hear the traffic below,1.0
as a family of we stayed in a bedroom bathroom apartment at this small hotel and we were thrilled with our stay what a great little hotel perfect location excellent helpful staff beautifully appointed rooms faultlessly clean great bathrooms well equipped modern cool and comfortable can not rave about this hotel enough you can walk everywhere from this location yet it is quiet small balcony breakfast hamper with local products served in our room each morning and a welcome drink on our arrival it really is fabulous and i would recommend it to anyone thank you for a wonderful stay,1.0
coming in from belfast by train catching flight out next day north star was a great pick across the street from connolly station and a couple of blocks from the flybus stop transit was a snap complimentary upgrade to floor room was most appreciated making for a quieter stay it is close to train tracks had dinner at hotel restaurant and staff friendly and food very good room was spacious and bed very comfortable,1.0
we spent night out of intended on this hotel because it was so noisy and very dirty the ceiling in the batroom was moldy the bed mattress smelled of vomit and the drinking glasses were not washed at all from the previous guests after one night we cancelled the rest of our stay and moved to a different hotel disgusting place,0.0
we enjoyed our stay at the hotel for a great location meters from the beach and almost the same to nearest metro station we had a very good care from the duty manager ms rocio fontelai would like personally to thank her for the great welcome and her effort to make our stay comfortable,1.0
fantastic location for this hotel such a central hotel for all attractions and everything within a walkable distance staff were very friendly and helpful we arrived very early morning and although we could not get access to our room until they were happy to take our luggage for us so we could go out and explore the city they are also happy to store your luggage on check out day until it time for you to leave the city rooms are spacious enough very clean and modern we did not have a canal view but at the end of the day how long are you actually in your room for were certainly not bothered by it would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip in this city,1.0
the location of the hôtel is perfect just between temple bar and the guinness storehouse however you must try to speak an other language for the the foreign tourists the real issue is the food at the kitchen expensive and not good,1.0
this hotel is amazing the facilities and location are second to none the staff go out of their way to make your stay here wonderful a special mention must go to the lovely young man who greets you at the door stavros who has gone above and beyond to assist us we have stayed here on occasions and have enjoyed our times here very much breakfast drinks on the floor have spectacular views of the acropolis interiors of the hotel are just gorgeous,1.0
this hotel was unique helpful fun and wonderfully located near the university stop our balcony was located on the building front on a busy street but the room was amazingly quiet with doors closed the walking time to placa catalunya was a minute stroll upon departure the aerobus was a five minute walk to catch for transport to the airport minute drive loved this hotel,1.0
a great location just off la rambla the rooms were small our double room had the bed against two walls with a small gap to walk around the lift is noisy and can be loud if your room is close to a disappointing hotel the best feature being the friendly and helpful reception staff,0.0
i booked this hotel based on the great reviews from trip advisor and expedia it located about min away from dublin city center it quaint and quiet great when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city i have to admit that the decor is quite cheesy on the inside the hotel itself is overall pretty clean however i have to admit for a star hotel the bathrooms inside were what my friend called dingy they were clean but the lighting was off and the tile grout was black in some portions on another note the staff are very nice and helpful they have a restaurant inside that sells pretty good food keep in mind this is one of the only restaurants around the hotel since you are away from the city overall stay was pretty good,1.0
since i used tripadvisor alot when booking my recent trip i thought it is only fair to review aseell having been to athens before i knew of the idea location to stay and this hotel location is amazing for those tourists with just a few days in athens close to absolutely everything plaka area is probably the best area to sights shopping only thing the area is not close to is beaches however that is anywhere in the centre of athens the hotel itself is very clean new towels etc daily breakfast was quite good and had a decent variety views depend on your room some have acropolis views like we did but that is just luck i think as other rooms view is just the building right next door the staff were actually verrry helpful had to leave at to check out and they had a taxi booked upon request which was there waiting for us definitely would recommend this hotel hard to find any faults for a decent price,1.0
this hotel really gets service and perfectly looked after me and my family in athens they could not have done more to ensure a difficult situation was handled with real care understanding and empathy could ask for more and would never stay anywhere else in athens,1.0

we booked this hotel after a disastrous stay at another dublin hotel was the main draw for our group since this was our last night in dublin and we had seen the more trendy areas the spencer is located in the business district which is more updated clean and modern the down side is the lack of a lot of pubs but there are a few nearby it is about a mile from the temple bar area and very close to the epic heritage tour we stayed in room which had two twins in one large room and a queen in another room it was very modern looking with floor to ceiling windows the rooms were very spacious with a large bathroom that could be accessed from the master or the hallway that lead to the other twin room this had an apartment feeling with a front door that led to our rooms the air conditioner was heavenly and the rooms were quiet the bar downstairs looked nice but we did stay for drinks i would absolutely book here again,1.0
when i stayed here in june with my friends and they sisters we first got there and could pay by card it had to be the one it was booked on which was very awkward we then stayed a night and cleaned the place up the next morning and a week later told there was been takin of our account when the maximum fee was they had no explanation for it or no proof either and it was cheap to stay in for a night either,0.0

i and other friends from the uk who have been with me think that the location is excellent and the airport bus stops very close to the hotel despite the busy road the rooms are quiet and only once have other guests created noise at night the hotel is very clean the staff are friendly the restaurant is attractive with a very good buffet breakfast after a busy day its nice to be able to get back to a very comfortable bed and a better mattress than is usual in greece the rooms are always very clean my last visit prompted me to write a review at last excellent value for the price i did manage to speak to the manager on my last visit and told her that i always found the staff and facilities very good,1.0
our trip to dublin was very nice the hotel was pretty good the city is very nice the weather was great and the concert was extraordinary we also went to bray kiliney where the beach is beautiful and dorkey where we had great lunch at the corner note,1.0
it normally has to be perfect to get five stars from me but this is the exception as i really enjoyed my stay the down points were minor i did like queuing to check in especially as there was someone else at the desk doing nothing they were the concierge i was informed there was no bath in my room but i would not have used it and the shower was great the bathrooms were a bit small and the rooms had no view yet that is the end of my fault hotel was clean and modern the beds were really comfortable the staff were really helpful and i loved the idea of the free wine between and which brought everyone in the hotel down to the lobby and made it buzz a bit the bar staff were fabulous and although we did not use the restaurant it did look quite good it was walking distance to the riik museum and others in that location about minutes also easy access to the amsterdam museum about minutes walk if the red light district is your thing then that is not too far enjoyable stay,1.0
top marks for a great hotel in a great location lovely comfortable room make sure you ask for a quiet room if you do want to be on the busy canal side dinner and breakfast in their jansz restaurant were great can recommend the dover sole the first time i spotted this hotel was nearly years ago on our first visit to amsterdam and always hoped that one day we could afford to come and stay here it been great the service has been excellent and the concierge suggestions spot on of where to eat the seafood bar and canal trip the friendship as the hotel boat was full,1.0

we stayed in the mirror barcelona from till of july we were people in total we were returning customers from a stay in took minutes and all informations were given upfront through a booking room service closed during so we able to order food when we asked the personnel at the reception about in barcelona the answer was no i still do not believe in rooms were nice in the morning we had a visit from a big cucaracha in the room at the the clerk at the reception asked us how the stay was i said we were hungry on arrival and the took too long we were not happy about the cleaning as there was a big cucaracha in the room a few days later we called in to ask for a leftover gadget however as it was charging in the bathroom easy visible it was not found by the cleaning normal compensation for a stay in a hip hotel like the mirror would be to offer a stay for free however it seems like this hotel has some management problem,0.0
stayed at this hotel numerous times always reminds me of the library from the board game clue rooms could be a little more spacious and updated but overall it a great experience staff are super super friendly and go out of their way to make you comfortable,1.0

stayed for days in this hotel i am a spg gold start with we reached the hotel at and the check in was promised for hrs left the luggage and went out to the nearby mall for lunch and came back at was told room is still not ready not ready not ready after telling the receptionist that as an spg loyalist i do expect this from the hotel she called the manager and finally we were given a suite which was an upgrade i would have expected the upgrade without asking and without delay but that the only grievance we had the manager called later on to apologise which was a nice gesture the hotel is clean and green room was great although room service did not replace the coffee capsules it is located in a quite area kms from dam square and adjacent to a mall you can buy eatables and can even cook as the room had a kitchenette the gym was functional and the equipments were of very good quality overall the hotel is good but i think the staff should be trained to be more forthcoming and also some knowledge on spg guidelines would help the hotel become preferred choice for the loyalists,1.0
the best of many good things about this hotel was the terrace on the top floor plenty of chairs and tables from which to survey the spectacular view the acropolis to the north and the city and the mountains beyond it to the east and south we took our breakfast up there on a tray no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift every morning and our coffee or wine every evening it was a spectacular way to start and end each was also well placed not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the acropolis so instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years and joined them a little further up only a little but it was more magical the hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times whether we needed to know about museums restaurants bus routes etc they telephoned hertz for us when our lack of greek and the hertz office busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting,1.0
we only had one in athens wanted to be in walking distance from the historical spots this hotel was the perfect location right next to the temple of zeus and a short walk from the acropolis the hotel staff recommended a great restaurant for lunch were very sweet when we checked in bringing us a bottle of champagne room was clean spacious although we did even use the living room or tv as we spent our time sight seeing having an elevator was great to easily transport our luggage up to our room if we went back to athens we would definitely stay at the ava hotel again,1.0
ideally located in the new toren tower across the ij river from centraal station thanks to the ferry service hotel theme is music each elevator in a different style and music one even has a disco ball in the ceiling and checkered in different colors flickering floor rooms styled in leather and pop walls jam sessions at the groundfloor open space area and best of all a gibson guitar and crosley turntable in the rooms to use at your discretion you can even browse through the record collection at reception and exchange whatever you up to yes it vinyl records also the view from the room is just amazing wonderful and that true for the view from the bathroom shower as well dvery friendly and forthcoming service included,1.0
we are rarely disappointed by the nh chain it always lives up to expectations we were treated exceptionally well even though we arrived early on a busy weekend our luggage was safely stowed allowing us to enjoy amsterdam right away the room was clean well appointed and roomy thanks for another great stay,1.0
we stayed here for one night and it is a good hotel service was good from all staff that we encountered and we were upgraded to a suite on arrival which is always a nice room was good but there was some to it such as the fan above the shower having a huge crack around it we also had to ask for the room to be as there were coffee splashes on the bathroom door it looked like it had been quickly but we did arrive earlier than planned so maybe that was only criticism is of the pricing of food and drink coffees are euros which is expensive for any hotel anywhere in the world coffee was nothing special in terms of size or quality either and a gnt from the minibar came in at euros which in my opinion is just too much given the same is euros in any bar in have read this comment before from others and the hotel has responded that pricing is in line with other hotels in athens just because others have crazy prices does not make it okay in my opinion i believe it should be seen as an opportunity to offer better value than the competition rather than justification to it also costs euros for wifi which given the room was over euros should be included in my in all a nice place to stay but the refreshments offer very poor value for urbanaut,1.0
my wife and i stayed at the crown plaza for several nights after a cruise of the greek islands the staff warmly greeted us upon our arrival and provided us with a map of the area and suggestions for shopping and sight seeing our room was on the club level floor that entitled us to extra amenities that included the club room that was always stocked with a very nice selection of beverages and snack food this was a very nice extra that we took advantage of on a regular basis it was also a nice area to socialize with other guests we also paid extra for the breakfast package that i would highly recommend a very nice selection of breakfast foods in a very nice dining area our room was very nice with a very comfortable bed the bathroom was top notch especially compared to other european bathrooms very roomy clean and nicely decorated the room also included a stocked refrigerator safe and plenty of closet space there were two disappointments with the room that i would not expe,1.0
me and my boyfriend stayed here for nights in june we requested a room overlooking the square which the staff accomadated for us many reviews say the hotel is noisy with the doors closed we didnt hear much noise at hotel was clean modern and comfortable the room had a safe which cost euros per day overall we really enjoyed our stay and will be re booking for next year,1.0
everything about this stay was spot on perfect location just outside really busy areas but within easy reach of all tourist sites the staff were pleasant and really helpful with directions recommendations and even phone calls for us to chase up our airport room was large clean and comfortable with mini bar tea coffee making facilities as well as a small terrace to sit on in the did try the gym or roof terrace but a lovely addition fault the hospitality standard of hotel bar service or happily recommend and if in barcelona again would stay anywhere else,1.0
since we start chatting on whatsapp with citizenm about our booking that we realised that we were in good hands all the crew works there with love they really like to make part of that team they are always ready to help with everything the rooms are small but very comfortable the ipad control everything from lights to tv to films to ac to blinds etc you chose the mood you want on your room and just enjoy the space the bar service is also very good and open hours they are always there for you so simple and to go in the center you can go by bicycle and in minutes you will be there we will be back thank you,1.0
we spent six nights here the hotel rooms are simple but comfortable and clean the service people at the front desk were great the front desk personnel particularly dikra helped us considerably in booking tours and answering questions the hotel is very well located within walking distance of many shopping areas such as la rambla restaurants and tourist sites such as the barcelona cathedral and the picasso museum altogether a very wonderful experience highly recommend the hotel,1.0

after a very long trip from the us and a brief layover at heathrow arriving in athens to the grande bretagne was a real treat the hotel lobby is lovely and the staff upon my arrival was professional and room was beautifully decorated and well appointed in every way the bathroom was large and gorgeous and included all basic amenities this hotel has the feel of world travel glamour that one might envision from a classical european hollywood movie but with the perfect mixture of modern necessities one expects in this age of travel it was a pleasure and i applaud this hotel and staff for creating such a lovely experience for their guests lastly the breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the acropolis was the most amazing breakfast i have ever had the view speaks for itself but the breakfast was beautifully done and honestly i have travelled all over the world and have not seen a more plentiful or thorough buffet of breakfast foods,1.0
stayed for business in june the pros the location the location is phenomenal it in a square with restaurants and coffee shops and a starbucks public transit is easily accessible and we could walk to dinner or drinks with more than enough selections it was about a eur cab ride from also list the as a pro because it was a nice place to relax and work while we were waiting to to our rooms final pro was the staff that was very friendly and accommodating the cons no climate control when i was there this was okay because it was cool enough outside that you could open the window they do leave a fan in the closet if you need additional cooling cleanliness not good when i got into my room after there was a giant wet spot on the floor next to the bed i do not know what that was but it was it wasnt bad but it wasnt good i got it included with my room in a promo deal however i would not pay additional for this breakfast there is a starbucks btw the coolest starbucks interior i ever seen literally yards when you walk to the right out of the hotel you would get a better value going to that starbucks than doing the hotel breakfast value you are paying for the location with other hotels in the same square i would research those hotels for a better in all the hotel was just,1.0

we stayed for days in we were on the floor with a corner room although the room was on the small side it was very clean and functional the shower was very good with toiletries and a hairdryer provided tea and coffee with an electric kettle is supplied but it is paper cups and no milk provided but that is no problem as there is a fridge and several supermarkets close by the wifi in the room was good and a small furnished balcony overlooking the junction the breakfast was very good with a variety of fresh fruit yogurt rolls cake ham cheese etc every day the coffee was unusually good to say it was from a reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and there is a computor on the first floor that has a printer which anyone can use free of charge on the floor there is a solarium with sunbeds and table and chairs but the lift only goes to the floor so the stairs then have to be hotel is a wedge shape on a corner of a fairly busy junction but we did not find it a problem transport is very close by either bus or metro to take you anywhere you can walk to sagrada familia and also to the san pau hospital which is a beautiful building now a museum many good bars and restaurants all close by without having to go too from the airport is the quickest and most direct way,1.0
hotel from hell from the minute we checked in and had to wait five hours for a room to opening the elevator door and finding a vacuum cleaner in the middle of it to having the front desk hit us with additional charges that according to book it were paid the manager in the evening when we address these issues said to me i like americans in a rude beds had big gaping indentations in them very uncomfortable also look like somebody threw something on the walls in our room they were sticky and dirty the showers were very unsafe the toilet and the shower falling away from this place it not even close to the marina,0.0
the w in amsterdam is very well located near the royal palace and walking distance from a lot of the city it also close to the train station we stayed on the bank side the hotel is split in two by a road and it was wonderful the room had high ceilings lots of light and was very high tech with lots of outlets and usb ports the duchess is a fabulous restaurant just downstairs from the rooms which serves breakfast lunch and dinner in a very elegant setting the staff was gracious and helpful highly recommended,1.0
well the rooms are superb and the air con is awesome for athens hot and dry summer also the staff in reception is very helpful but all these became a distant memory very soon after i entered my room i only stopped for hours to get some rest from a long ferry journey as i was catching a flight to holland and within minutes of settling into my room the lady cleaner did her best and all sorts to keep me and am sure other hotel guests awake do know where to start from but here as some of the noise some events that i heard from outside my room vacuuming next to my room and above me buckets loads of water being dropped for mopping cleaning cupboards being opened up and closed at least times the lift which is not the quietest to put it mildly must have been used for the cleaner at least times going up and down plastic bags being shuffled doors opening and closing for several times toilet seats being rigorously hit against the toilet base objects being dropped without care who sleeps in the hotel iam sure i was not the only one that was kept awake its only a small hotel for gods sake with probably around so why the f all this noise in the middle of the night will the queen of sheba arrive by any chance want a full refund and an apology for the inconvenience caused,0.0
my friend and i stayed at the hampton amsterdam east for the first time and rowie front desk agent was fantastic friendly and helpful during our stay she greeted us with a smile daily and helped us plan our excursions the location at the hotel is easy and the breakfast is really good i will be back for sure,1.0
i booked a suite and the room was very spacious we had a small balcony with a view of the acropolis which was a bonus staff excellent concierge ditto the room was immaculate and well furnished also the included breakfast buffet was out of this world with so many choices i never been to athens before and only had a few days so i wanted a hotel in a good location and this fit the bill min walk to the acropolis the new acropolis museum a metro station good restaurants and shopping around pm our first night there was a knock on our door room service which we had not ordered a nice bottle of greek red wine two glasses plates and or pieces of fresh fruit compliments of the hotel nice,1.0
this was our fourth stay at the hotel do and it is still a fantastic place to stay in barcelona the staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is well situated for all the sights in the city the breakfast is great and the afternoon fruit and evening chocolates are nice touches there is also a free mini bar of soft drinks another nice extra we definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay here again if we visit barcelona many thanks to all the staff for another memorable stay,1.0
we ended up staying at the new hotel for one night unexpectedly some other plans had fallen through and we actually been to the hotel the night before for a drink on their fabulous rooftop bar it was one of the best decisions we made on our trip we loved the funky vibe of the place the staff were so attentive and the room was very well appointed we have stayed at many large and small luxury hotels over the years and we really enjoyed the slightly hipster feel of this one very much it made up feel young and trendy but in a nice up market setting which is central to all the key attractions in athens if you are looking for a somewhat different experience to your traditional big chain hotel setting then we would have no hesitation recommending this to you finally you simply have to have a cocktail on the rooftop bar views of the on one side and lycabatus hill on the others breathtaking stuff,1.0
i generally love staying at w hotels and my first stay last year at the w amsterdam was truly special amazing room welcome amenity great sure the hotel has maintained its cool feel and general vibe however the personal touches seem to have fallen away it nice just not as compelling as it once that said the rooms are very nice modern and super clean the staff is personable albeit not particularly attentive the common areas are great the outside seating in the bar areas are among the very best in europe let alone be back for sure just sorry that my last stay was not as special as my past experiences,1.0
had a great stay hotel was nice clean and modern staff were helpful was across the street from great paid beach and tavern balux hotel had cozy pool and outdoor lounge area only prob was safe not working but we did ask to fix it we would stay again,1.0
wonderful service nice breakfast and perfect location to meander around the acropolis the front desk staff helped with every question we had we had a very pleasurable stay would recommend if you are looking for star hotel,1.0
i would definitley stay here again the place was modern clean and the staff were very friendly there are many facilities in the hotel communal area such as table tennis and pool the bar area was also very nice the only thing i was a fan of was the pillows in the room but the mattresses were comfortable,1.0
stayed here with our family of for nights we needed rooms and the melia was able to provide connecting rooms for us which was a comfort as we did want our children on their own the staff was very friendly service at the café was slow but the food was good the pool area is small but lovely and very welcome after a hot day of touring pool is only open from so you have to time it properly rooms were a good size for europe and very clean not quite north american standards but definitely a solid i would absolutely stay at this hotel again recommendation if you are touring athens such as the acropolis there is a red tour bus stop by the melia if you buy tickets for the day you can take the bus directly to the tourist attractions and save yourself the cab fare if you want to go back out in the evening you could take the bus again and get off near the plaka for dinner room connects to or and you must book supreme room category or higher to be given an adjoining connecting room ask at that the porter unlock the adjoining doors to save time later,1.0
fun art deco style hotel with abundant amenities reception staff was professional welcoming and unflappable we were checking in with a very large group of family and the reception staff remained calm and collected staff took the time to sit down with our extended family and go over the hotels location and provided a map and overview of the area complimentary wine and cheese are put out for guests each coffee and beverages available in the lobby all day i did have time for breakfast the day of departure but our teenagers did and gave the complimentary breakfast a big thumbs are small but the decor is fun the bathroom tile is beginning to look a bit worn and in need of a deep cleaning but dual shower heads were a nice touch the bed has a memory foam top not my preference but others in my family liked it pillow selection yes there is an assortment of styles was to travelers with small children you might want to request a room without a balcony there are no screens and a child not highly supervised could open the large windows and have an unfortunate accident the rooms with windows more complicated to open and higher up offer more peace of mind when traveling with curious young children,1.0
stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon hotel is spacious conveniently located has a great hot breakfast buffet staff are friendly and eager to help and even has perks like a business center with printers for any last minute itinerary printing or changes we were even surprised to find a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in our room when we checked in with a note congratulating us on our recent marriage the sandymount has set the bar high for hotels on the rest of our european vacation,1.0
nice clean hotel great rooms were very nice and locality was the best but just one tram away from dam square which takes roughly minutes to get two close by restaurant one chinese and the other lebanese we not enough options to go out to eat around the good experience hotel food was the best but was ok as we had breakfast while staying there,1.0
we loved our stay here location of this hotel is fabulous close to metro stations so within easy reach of all the sights casa mila is only a minute walk away and also a short walk away to the gothic quarter also located near some really good shops which was also very handy we opted for a balcony room that overlooked the pool and were glad we did the balcony was great to just to sit back and relax it was also a sun trap so nice to enjoy the evening sunshine rooms are a good size with all the necessities bottles of water are provided daily and also the room had a nespresso coffee maker also handy we used the pools and they were both nice both surprisingly really quiet breakfast in the hotel was good but again as many other reviewers have said expensive at euros there are places nearby which are cheaper and also a starbucks over the road which proved to be handy hotel bar is also good and the staff were very staff at the hotel are really nice friendly and also very knowledgeable about the area and metro is so much choice of hotels in barcelona and we were really glad we chose this hotel,1.0
a fantastic hotel in the heart of athens so close to the plaka and shopping as well to the museum and the parthenon i would highly recommend staying there the rooms food and service were all amazing must do dinner at the roof top restaurant one night while you are there,1.0
the hotel required a credit card as part of the room reservation process i provided my card details however was notified by the hotel that my card had been declined i then provided another card however this again was apparently declined when i explained that i had no other credit cards to offer them and requested they please reserve the room under a debit card i was told no a credit card was needed and their machine stated that none of mine worked they told me that it was tough and that they would not keep the room reservation as one would expect i booked a room at a different hotel this was done with no issues i then note per my bank statement that the hotel quentin arrive had charged me for a one night stay on speaking to who i booked through it appears that the credit card authorisation had worked a few days later quentin arrive did not notify me of this and as i am not psychic i had no idea that i had a reserved room quentin arrive has refused to speak to me about this directly and only through have i received the message that they will not refund the not book a room at this hotel awful place poor customer service cons travellersi have no idea whether my credit card worked all along and the hotel withheld this information i will never stay at the place or recommend nobody else do so,0.0

i loved the hotel rooms are so funky bed big and smart room ipad bar is hours and check in and out was simple only downside for us was that it was a little to far out from the city centre although really easy to get to from the airport,1.0
do be fooled by the photographs posted of the new refurbished room because like everyone else you will be told that they are not available and will not be available for the duration for your stay the hotel is very run down however it really only suitable for young people who do mind the noise from the nightclub below and do have very high standards the blonde receptionist was very rude but the male night was very welcoming,0.0
our stay started in spectacular fashion we arrived exhausted around after traveling from the states our room was ready of course but we asked if another one was indeed a upgraded room was available right then so we happily paid the surcharge went to our spacious room and had a magnificent four hour nap we had a great bed sofa and tv desk area ample closet and kettle the bath was spacious with a strong swedish shower head quiet is extremely important to us we were right over the road by the liffey river so there was a little noise but the windows had pretty good insulation and traffic dwindled in the evening actually more annoying were the hardwood floors which creaked when we walked and when our neighbors upstairs had breakfast one morning thought it was good but not outstanding there is a pretty simple buffet of breads usually very coarse juices and cereals you order hot items off a menu standard irish breakfast omelettes pancakes etc then again we were never thrilled by any of our breakfasts over days this is france or italy the staff was friendly and helpful i wanted to print tickets for dublin castle and after i emailed it to them they said you do have to wait around we put the tickets in your room and they location was terrific easy walking to all the major sites but not in a crowded location we did feel the price was a little steep but,1.0
the staff at the regency hotel were very friendly and helpful at all coststhere is a weird layout to the hotel that if you are on certain floors the lift does not go to you have to get off at one floor and take the stairs it was a nightmare i got to my room and i asked to be switched and the receptionist got me another room straight room was not much better there were cigarette butts on the window sill questionable stains on the pillow and bed cover the was very the cleaners would come in even when you have a not disturb sign on the door the hotel has a nice pub downstairs which i have no complaints hotel is a bus ride away from the center of dublin and a min drive from am certain that there are much better hotels around dublini wont be coming here againnothing against the staff because they were all good just not a fan of the hotel,0.0
very good very good location near to center breakfast is expensive but very good the room is close to the train taxi service from the hotel is more expensuve its look like the take comissin,1.0
we had planned to stay here for our whole trip but when we arrived we had to move hotels due to a flood on our floor we stayed a night at the alexander location the stephens location is definitely nicer of the two great location and walkable to all the sites it quiet at night and it was great to run around stephens green in the morning,1.0

me friends stayed here for and we enjoyed our stay the staff are very friendly attentive especially the bar staff on the roof terrace the views from the hotel are amazing we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here i would most definitely stay again,1.0
this hotel is new and perfectly located with a beautiful terrace and a good resting area with a pool the staff is attentivethe rooms i tried a room are very well equipped with nice furniture and flat screen tv the bed is excellentthe design of such room is somehow confusing as the bathroom is located in the entrance which provokes a strange sensation to say the least breakfast was nice but some improvement should be made concerning the choices and fresh juices should be served not canned juices as i was served all in all an excellent value for the money,1.0
this hotel has a four star rating but does not offer anything close to european four stars standards our room on the first floor was really dark and we had a view on the hotel ac system we asked if we could have another room but were told they had no other room available when they had rooms available to book online the staff is not particularly friendly either the pool area looks nothing like the pictures i would definitely not recommend this hotel as i have stayed in barcelona several times before and you can get a lot better for value for your money,0.0

where to begin in summary in years as a field engineer i have stayed in many hotels this without a doubt was the worst experience i have ever had i arrived on the monday morning having caught an early flight across to dublin our trusty team secretary had booked a room for me here at the time of booking it was known as camden hotel by thekeycollection arrived early but unable to book in so dropped my luggage off and went to work i arrived back at the hotel at hoping to check in and expecting a rest after my early start the room was available apparently it needed a clean a good sign and i eventually managed to get in at around chance of a rest due to the building works going on so i gave up on any prospect of relaxing until the evening some chance my room directly overlooked the bar area with a single glazed obscured window the music went on until ah well at least i could lie in in the morning nope workmen started at went off to work and then had a repeat of the previous night music until night had the added drama that when the music finished at i was able to grab some sleep until when some noisy guests moved in across the corridor my polite request for them to keep the noise down was met with a threatening response and after a few calls to the concierge they were,0.0
has this a star hotel but it is clear why the rooms are quite basic but comfortable and the staff were very helpful there is a buffet breakfast with a decent range of food and a terrace and pool for guest use we did have swimsuits so did try it out the aircon did struggle a little in the barcelona heat but i still had a comfortable night it is close to the barceloneta port and the gothic quarter,1.0
we were down in dublin for a concert so just stayed one night the hotel is in a good location when traveling from the north we got parked on the street opposite which was handy we stayed in a refurbished family room which was really nice clean and comfortable with cool coffee machine my husband had a meal in the hotel it was good and value for money breakfast was ok seemed busy due to tour groups overall a lovely hotel and would stay here again,1.0
my husband and i stayed at the conrad dublin recently during a shopping trip we have stayed there a number of times before we both agree that it has improved over the years breakfast was excellent those fresh blueberries the layout of the breakfast room is also much improved compared to previous years service was star the only small issue for us was the view from the room i would highly recommend the conrad dublin,1.0

my family and i stayed at this hotel for a few days while visiting the archeological sites this hotel is close to proximity to many sites and has a great view of the acropolis from the roof top the area of the city is so so but we felt perfectly safe i would not get the rooms with the balcony our view was of worn out buildings and there were no seats to even sit out there save your money and get the basic room the hotel serves a wonderful breakfast and they are very accommodating to your needs beware though at checkout the clerk told us we save money if we used our card to convert to us dollar instead there was a fee over all it is a very nice hotel and the price is very reasonable,1.0
whilst the hotel facilities were acceptable standard in general on the day of checking out we discovered unauthorised charges on our card amounting to despite assurances from the reception staff that money would be refunded the same day days later we are still waiting for a refund even though we also spoke to accor who also assured us of a supposed free shuttle was refused from the airport as apparently fully booked and had to pay euros to get to the hotel which is in a middle of nowhere next to a petrol station you have to cross a busy main road to get to the hotel with no pedestrian crossing beware if travelling at night and via public transport,0.0

first the positives very clean hotel and beautifully reception that it goes down worst quality breakfast we have had in an hotel and we travel only went in there twice during our day stay and the best we could manage was some melon a toasted croissant with a cup of lukewarm boiled eggs some strange mix of egg and tomato that looked terrible what was described as peach compote was tinned fruit cocktail with a very funny colour supervised by the most unfriendly and rude attitude was could go on and rooms were on the side of a very noisy gentlemans club pool only has sunbeds and when we went at it was closed off rooms and balcony very would not recommend glyfada much nicer down the the palmyra hotel,0.0
during a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the temple bar hotel since our last visit to ireland three years ago the hotel has been completely refurbished the reception spaces are both welcoming and stylish of course being in ireland means that most people are very friendly no exemption here the staff was excellent our room was clean and very comfortable what important about this hotel is its location right in the middle of temple bar several streets of restaurants music filled pubs and shops it was great fun to walk around and enjoy the sights and sounds the only downside to the hotel location is the noise the streets are busy with throngs of people well into the night fortunately the hotel windows are well insulated and guests are provided with earplugs if needed we had no problems whatsoever it a great place from which to explore amazing dublin,1.0
the ambassade is a beautifully decorated and maintained hotel in a perfect location for easy walking access to many places for sightseeing and dining in amsterdam we booked a classic double which was a little on the small side but would have benefited from slightly less furniture because while beautiful it was somewhat crowded it probably worth upgrading to a larger room front desk staff were very helpful and the breakfast and breakfast room are well worth the extra charge to include breakfast in your booking had a great stay,1.0
beautiful hotel with a great location great bar tea saloon and restaurant are very always rooms are small and do have a good but still a very good buffet can be richer eapeciallt the cold buffet,1.0

it was a very nice hotel but with some shortcomings the single room was nicely decorated but was so tiny that after putting a luggage it was hard to walk around the bed the location was beautiful by the canal but not great if you value convenient location most major attrations are a little far to walk to yet tram stations were not nearby the central station was min walk but was not easy to walk with heavy luggage so took taxi anyway also quite pricy considering the room size these could be tradeoffs considering that it is a canal house hotel but not worth the money especially if you are in town for short time and want to manage time efficiently,1.0
very nice hotel a little off the beaten path but not too far to walk to the tram that will take you to the center of things about mins the staff really stood out for us my mom was not well when we arrived early to check in the hotel was full so our room was not ready as it was only the staff made sure my mom was comfortable in their lobby which had lots of couches and private areas the woman at the desk said they would prioritize cleaning our room we requested single beds and there were only such rooms in the whole hotel they went out of their way to accommodate us and we were able to get into our room by noon full hours before their posted check in time the room was modern and bright with a full kitchen the bathroom was huge by european standards would definitely return to element amsterdam if the opportunity arises,1.0
very nice hotel balcony room was great for watching boat traffic and nice view of the city executive queen room with balcony was nice but small really enjoyed the executive lounge for breakfast and evening snacks and drinks,1.0
we stayed for nights at hotel indigo it was a last minute choice to switch hotel because of advised from our friends to check other indigo is right at the center of the city a few minutes walk to great shopping at passeig de gracia and all the major shops a few minutes walk to la rambla and if you are up to walking sagrada familia is walking distance maybe minutes walk all the must see location are walking distance from the hotel there is a metro station nearby major upscale hotels but the area is less was excellent as platinum members we had water and juices complimentary provided everyday we got upgraded to a ground floor room with a terrace and big sofa area perfect to relax lie down and drink the morning coffee the front desk was awesome patient and always ready to help we requested for a connecting room but after seeing the ground floor room we did not mind and it did not make a difference since they gave us adjoining rooms,1.0
this hotel is within easy walking distance of downtown and central station you can get anywhere from here easily they also have a frequent shuttle to central station which is free there are also quite a number of nice restaurants and bars really hotel itself is very nice clean and quiet the people are great and will help with whatever you need i recommend this hotel very highly if i return to amsterdam this is where i will stay,1.0

the room was clean and comfy if a little close to the kitchen fortunately we live in new york so do mind cooking smells wafting up to our room the staff was friendly and professional best of all the breakfast was out of this world many many choices and coffee to die for yum,1.0
i had a very bad experience with this hotel staying days most of the worst customer services you will ever get especially senior managers of the hotel are not helpful and rude they look tired and they totally dont want to work it looks like if they are making favours to the customers by replying if you booked this hotel just cancel it as it will ruin your holidays which you have worked so hard for they make your stay stressful and without any services at all and its not that close to the centre you still have to get a taxi to the centre by walk it will take you at least min there is no such balcony as on the all you get is one small window looking outside so do even rely on their pictures on the website basically you will flush your money for no service not great room not great view breakfasts has no choice at all very poor prices are too high for such place absolutely waste of money,0.0
the fitzwilliam is in a great location and has a friendly helpful staff there is easy access to stephen green and grafton street the rooms are clean and comfortable check in was a breeze and the glass of prosecco was a nice touch,1.0
we have returned to the hotel since we have an outstanding stay the first time around i say outstanding as we believed small improvements could be made well we were in fact pleasantly surprised this hotel is really at the pinnacle of excellence decor service ordered room service which arrived on time and very well presented the front office staff is efficient and very has earned its place among the greatest and we look forward to returning,1.0
a minute walk from the hotel covered all and more of the tourist spots we wanted to see on our day stay and most were closer than that the food was good and there were plenty of restaurants nearby the only negative in that context was the coffee at breakfast which was so thin and watery that we had breakfast elsewhere on the other mornings the dwarf jar doors along was excellent and even had freshly squeezed orange juice as a bonus being in temple bar meant the hotel octagon bar was mostly empty and a bit bleak not helped by the air conditioning on cool and the barman appearing a bit bored but a quiet bar could be an advantage with all the other noisy ones nearby still we would stay again,1.0
this hotel was a great place to stay while visiting barcelona it centrally located and pretty much walkable to restaurants and shops the room was cozy clean and the cleaning service more than satisfactory the reception staff were friendly and helpful most especially bartosz he friendly and always took the time to help in any way he could i think he was the best thing at the hotel that made our stay pleasureable,1.0
easily my best hotel stay ever the staff especially derek burke was so welcoming and friendly definitely recommend based on my experience the bar has amazing food and drinks and the rooms are beautiful,1.0
i am a big believer that a hotel serves the trip i do need fancy or endless amenities as i expect to be travelling the totally fit that bill the location in the southwest corner of stephen green made just about everything south of the liffey accessible within a minute walk the room was spacious and clean and the hotel bar was a good place for a final drink so long as your day was ending but midnight which was rare there was also an excellent food truck set up across the road after each night for a late night only issue we had was being there in july we found the room very warm and the ac not very effective opening the windows did he trick but we were on the front of the hotel with a busy street and team line below us that said we generally managed pretty well keeping windows open most of the day and closing them our few hours of sleep but the morning were warm all in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay again,1.0
i stayed here for one night after a long haul flight and was so pleased that my room was ready when i arrived at so i could have a room was spacious and immaculate breakfast was luas tram runs past the hotel and it just a few minutes into the city and all the attractions of also right near heuston recommended,1.0

i am a fan of hyatt hotels as i travel often for work i was originally concerned that this hotel was quite in the city center but it is in the canal belt having said that i think the location of the hotel was ideal the city center turned out to be way too crowded and busy i enjoyed the side canal streets of this city more the hotel is within a minute walk to the metro and was very easy to get from and to the airport it was a nice and easy walk to the canal belt which i enjoyed there is also a nice delicious bakery cafe nearby next to the metro station called bakhuys hotel staff themselves were nice and most helpful they were all very knowledgeable if you looking for plan ideas the only two thing that made my hotel stay not as ideal was housekeeping who made my room did make my bed the first night i was there she cleaned the trash and the towels but the bed was left unattended it which was a bit strange the and nights of my stay all the lights came on in the room while i was sleeping for a total of in the middle of the night it was a bit creepy but i was too tired the first night that it happened where i just fell back asleep maybe it was a glitch when i brought it up to the front desk at checkout,1.0
nice and clean hotel woth good location aircondition was very effective luckily temperature was adjustable in the pool was quite small but nice to have great breakfast and service nice cafeterias nearby with also vegetarian options also just around the corner of the airport bus stop,1.0
we stayed at the holiday inn express amsterdam south for nights as soon as we arrived we were bowled over by the amazing customer service nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to be hotel was lovely and clean it was also very quiet due to location and that most people staying here were stay for business reasons breakfast was a continental buffet which was fine for us do not expect to be able to get a english as you will be disappointed the hotel were particularly attentive to dietary restrictions such as allergies or the need to eat kosher unfortunately there is no restaurant on site but there are some local restaurants and a supermarket a few minutes walk the hotel you can use the metro which is again a few minutes walk this line can take you into the centrum and amsterdam zuid station is approximately stops along where you can change to get a direct train to schipol airport stop along i would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend the hotel to others,1.0
photos on booking sites are thought it will be a good deal given the price but then i understood why upon arrival furniture and all decor needs to be changed if it is to be called staff was very polite and helpful though position is quite good too,0.0
we stayed here for a weekend nice hotel not quite sure about the decor of the rooms but it was one excellent feature was the very powerful shower really great though you need to leave the bathroom door open otherwise everything gets wet from condensation very good central location we walked to most places we wanted to see,1.0
lovely hotel delicious food in the restaurant and reasonably priced great location beside aviva stadium as we were attending the man utd match loved the beer garden rooms spacious n nicely decorated,1.0
we decided to take a last minute weekend away to amsterdam and booked a suite here the staff was super friendly and the suite was great the room was clean with a view on the canal behind the hotel the bed was super comfortable and we had a great night s rest there would book again,1.0
very comfy beds big screen tv in room clean and tidy with good size toiletries free wifi worked fine for us free sweets in reception is a nice bonus buffet breakfast was lovely rooftop pool is great swimming pool towels are provided good hairdryer not brilliant for thick hair no iron in room not much storage space in room service on rooftop a bit slow only lay down loungers on rooftop and then just chairs toilet door opens straight onto toilet basin watch your toes dont get caught underneath if your partner walks in,1.0
lovely quiet spot in a beautiful part of amsterdam walking distance to museums centre of town and other attractions staff were completely charming and helpful and breakfast in the restaurant is excellent too,1.0
stayed one night at a hugely overpriced rate got back to hotel at about midnight got to sleep at about made complaint at about to night manager mark who was very nice it must be said about the noise as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably i was aware of the nightclub when i made the booking and was prepared to be awake till around but is ridiculous nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle room faced onto the street and the windows are not double glazed the noise from the street coupled with the noise from the nightclub was deafening on checkout i refused to pay the full fee and without even coming to meet me and apologise the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount now while i appreciated the gesture the reduction only brought the charge down to the nightly rate which in my opinion is still overpriced this is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night and only get a little bit of sleep not for anyone who is going to bed,0.0
the west cord fashion hotel is fantastic the rooms are modern and very spacious the bed is very big and comfortable bathroom has a shower and a bath the staff are lovely and accomodating the pool area is really nice the location is not too bad it a little out of the way of the main tourist part but it in a nice area with coffee shops and parks near by they main part of amsterdam is easily reached by tram or bike we walked and it was probably abit too long my only complaint is that they did have enough bikes we tried three days in a row to hire bikes and they were sold out each time on our last day i called at am and reception said they had bikes by the time i got down at am they were all gone,1.0
this is a good budget hotel the room was clean and functional the bed was comfortable and the staff were pleasant and kindly looked after our bags for several hours after checkout it is also well located fairly close to two metro stations we decided the breakfast was too expensive to justify the one thing to be aware of is the traffic noise in street facing rooms as the hotel is on a very busy street barcelona has more than its fair share of crazy drivers and they thrash around at ridiculous speed including on ear piercing mopeds this starts as early as i know that as i was woken by them at around that time in our third floor room if you are anything other than a very solid sleeper and are in an aforementioned street facing room please remember your earplugs,1.0
great location beside tram stop and canal stop excellent breakfast with plenty of choice concierge was always helpful staff very friendly welcome drink on arrival access to hotel from two streets will be back,1.0
the lloyd is a perfect location not to close just a short tram to the centrum the staff is outstanding robin and the front desk team went out of their way to accommodate an early check in for my sick wife and flora in the cafe took special care of her with a great ginger tea and constant checking till the room was ready the facility is marvelous historic and quaint with a rustic charm when in again we will be sure to check in at the lloyd,1.0
this is a beautiful hotel on a lovely elegant charm is mixed with modern convenience most travelers would expect my husband and i stayed in the hotel for nights before boarding our viking river cruise was quick and easy all hotel staff we encountered during our stay spoke english and were quite helpful the huge brass room key is accompanied by a key card that unlocks you room door if you leave the hotel you drop your key by the front desk and retrieve it upon returning to the hotel we had no issues or long waits with this we had a room on the second floor overlooking the canal i would recommend a canal view room it was quiet and one of the expansive windows opened to allow for fresh air to come in the system is a mini machine by us standards but the temperatures do not call for a turbo there was a large duvet and a rather rough bed spread on the double bed in our room i would have enjoyed if a flat sheet was included in the bedding otherwise the bed was not only beautiful but also quite comfortable despite its diminutive size two water bottles are replenished daily in a rather large wall beverage fridge it seems like a rather large system to fill with two measly bottles of water the bathroom in our room was extremely small but well equipped and it appeared to have been recently renovated the combo was tight,1.0
stayed here before flying out to bulgaria for a family holiday rooms were really comfortable and spacious was so comfortable and staff were so friendly breakfast was really good and an excellent price would definitely recommend it,1.0
this was my first visit to dublin and my first stay at a jurys inn hotel the location was great for us it was a short walk from the christchurch location to trinity college stephen green patrick cathedral and the temple bar the guinness storehouse was less than a mile away we enjoyed dinner at the steak restaurant across the street from the thought the jurys inns was a great value it appeared that most of the guests were like us holiday travelers the room was clean and comfortable but modest in size the breakfast buffet had a variety of hot and cold offerings all of good quality and well presented i was especially pleased with the attentiveness of the staff in helping solve a problem that had arisen during the stay they were helpful with a genuine customer focus i was favorably impressed,1.0
the hotel met all of our expectations the room was clean and roomy the service was they even got us a cab that we needed at the hostess gave us great places to eat nearby we have nothing but good things to say at this hotel,1.0
stayed in the house hotel with friends and it was very convenient beside croke park as we were up for an event the rooms are quite small but very clean which is most important nice and quiet outside so no disruption to ones sleep,1.0
from this hotel has got it all rooms were clean and very nice great location bikes available a must for amsterdam staff that will constantly go out of their way to help you in any way possible and i mean that they have consistency with all of the guests so even when they are busy you do not feel neglected or forgotten in particular stephano this gentleman was our server for breakfast wich was delicious our entire stay not once did we want for anything every morning he managed to impress us with something else and it was a welcome surprise you will not regret your stay at this hotel,1.0
a lovely warm welcome awaited us on our arrival in this beautiful glassed reception area overlooking the canal and the river spacious bright interior with a modern décor gave us a feeling of being somewhere special and different the rooms were bright with lovely views overlooking the river location is excellent for touring amsterdam unfortunately our trip to amsterdam was too short for us to enjoy many of the great sights or enjoy the cuisine of the hotel and surrounding areas however we got to savour a lovely breakfast in a little café across the road and enjoyed tea and cakes in a quaint little cake shop until our lift to the airport wont be sorry to choose this hotel for location and ambience,1.0
loved the décor felt like home we were only there a short while but had everything we could have wanted loved the hotel inside and outdoor spaces will recommend to friends heading that direction thank you,1.0
clean tidy fabulous service excellent help yourself breakfast easy acces to amsterdam rai train station mins schipol airport mins even closer tram stop mins serving all of amsterdam centre or mins euro all day hour travel ideal for business or stayed on the executive floor neither of us liked the strong brown and white horizontal decor in the bedroom but it was quiet and the shower was very good,1.0
we are just back from a three night stay here having previously stayed at citizenm in glasgow i booked here for our stay in amsterdam as we already loved the hotel and the location was in was quick and easy we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who talked us through how to use the self service check room was very similar to glasgow with the only noticeable differences being the shower and toilet were in separate huge bed is incredibly comfortable there is a great choice of channels and movies on the tv and i always love the mood lighting great shower within the room from the curtains to temperature is controlled by an rooms were quiet except for the last night when the construction work at the front of the hotel was noisy and woke us a few staff are what makes a great experience an excellent one all very friendly and helpful we were able to buy our tram tickets at the hotel and staff told us about how to check in and out of the trams and talked through the map with hotel provides bikes free of charge which is another nice little added extra the hotel is next to a tram stop and is a minute journey to dam square and closer to the museum quarter it is a short walk to the train station and a short train journey from the location meant that we could enjoy breakfast in a quieter location,1.0
location location location my room was large and had a comfy bed it had a couch and sitting area as well as a kitchenette i walked out the door and could see the acropolis so amazing you do need a car and the restaurants are plentiful and tasty,1.0
this hotel had poor service and it has employees that do apologise and instead say thank you for bringing this to our attention the location is okay you can get to the city in bedroom was adequate but our shower would flood the bathroom completely and we had to use plenty of towels to stop this i asked them about the shower and they said they would get someone to fix it and have extra towels brought up we came back that evening and no one had serviced our room the shower still flooded and we had no fresh towels when i called they said that it was a busy day with check outs no apology they sent someone up minutes next day they also did service our room i asked them about this and all they said was we will send my colleague with new towels for you they came with new towels and for the first time i received an apology that no one had seen to our shower or serviced our room for our final day someone had fixed the shower and replaced towels but it was too little too recommendation book a hotel closer to the city and avoid this place if you planning on staying more than night,0.0
we stayed at the shelbourne for a weekend trip on my birthday everything was fantastic the went smoothly the breakfast buffet was delicious and we enjoyed the location in the city center it was very easy to explore the city the room we had on the first night was too small and we did like it too much even though it was very nice but too small for people so we checked in the morning and could move to a bigger room for a small upgrade fee our luggage was brought to the new room and we could already move at lunch time we also went to the salon to get manicure and pedicure and i need to highlight the perfect service of christie she is amazing moreover we enjoyed the fabulous afternoon tea they took care of my allergies and explained everything in detail fantastic service,1.0
we had nights here on a sight seeing trip to dublin the welcome was warm abd service was friendly and efficient the twin bedded room was spacious and comfortable two local pubs made up for the rather brightly lit and unatmospheric hotel bar the hotel position close to merion square trinity college and the national museums was ideal,1.0
we stayed for nights to celebrate our son birthday and the whole experience from arriving to leaving was exceptional all the staff were friendly and very helpful especially xavi who went the mile in trying to locate a venue for us to watch the lions v all blacks rugby test the roof top area gave spectacular views across barcelona and was excellent for winding down with a glass of wine at the end of the day watching the sun location with most sights within walking hotel and will certainly stay again if returning to barcelona,1.0
if you are looking for a hotel that is reasonably priced and only a minute metro ride from amsterdam i would definitely recommend hampton by hilton bijlmer arena i did want to be trapped in the centre of amsterdam so finding an alternative location not to near nor to far was my primary motivation for choosing this hotel literally a stone throw from the bus and train station you can travel to and from amsterdam centre with ease and it a nice hotel however if you are adverse to football crowds then that could be problematic because the ajax stadium is in the same vicinity and on match day you ca avoid them otherwise you find the location suited for that small escape from amsterdam centre,1.0
this is an elegantly comfortable was understated yet a psychic courtyard haven from the bustling and centrally located blvd las ramblass sic the staff were particularly wonderful and truly sign of a very fine management team we have free breakfasts in our travel agents packet and it was the finest breakfast we have had in europe wifi was made traveling with computers iphones and ipads particularly dining room staff is amazing but for those who rush out early there is a starbucks on the corner and a very fine bar and grill on the same corner highly recommend this hotel it near the market and walking distance to treasures like el naionelmy husband came earlier for a conference and we were upgraded for the duration of our stay with a deluxe perfectly appointed and well run pools that our grandkids enjoyed and a beautiful rooftop terrace bar that had very tasty offerings and fabulous non alcoholic drinks that were very refreshing at the full service bar,1.0
we loved this hotel it was in a perfect location just a minute walk from the ocean and minutes from las ramblas there tons of restaurants around and the neighborhood is charming i very glad that we stayed here instead of the the cotton house was charming and it actually felt like being in barcelona not a glass were very nice the showers were huge and cotton amenities were provided living up to the hotel name the were beautifully decorated with star service there history to the hotel as well cotton was used here for textiles and the library was beautiful their specialty cocktails were very good and the breakfast buffet was a great continental breakfast that included mint water and green juices the pool was on the terrace with a view of sagrada familia it was a small pool though and the fitness room was small as well i would highly recommend the cotton house and i stay here again,1.0
we stayed for nights in july it a sweet little hotel in a great location everything is a short walking distance the staff was attentive and sweet there coffee machine and a kettle for tea in the room the complementary goody bag they left us for the concert was a beautiful gesture if you book breakfast on the night before you get a discount,1.0
very nice small boutique hotel in athens close to everything very good service from the staff who made us feel very welcome some good tavernas just around the corner great location for shopping and sightseeing,1.0
on a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the morgan for three nights the location of this hotel is excellent for those wishing the fun atmosphere of the temple bar with convenient walking distance and to bus routes to dublin were so tired from our daily excursions that the nightlife noise did not bother us too much and the hotel provided earplugs which were included near the bathroom amenities our room was on the second floor facing the street so with windows opened it was a bit noisy we shut the windows the next night and put on the ac and that solved the noise problem we booked this hotel through tripadvisor which was easy and allowed us to get a better rate we opted for breakfast to be included which offered a great selection of fruit pastries eggs sausage bacon and typical irish breakfast fare breakfast wait staff were great and attentive in fact all staff members were helpful and friendly shout outs to sonia who directed us to a local vendor who helped with our computer issues and to david our personable server at breakfast the morgan is part of the intercontinental hotel properties i would highly recommend this hotel for tourists,1.0
stayed there for days on a vacation staff were great really close to heuston station tram stops and busses we did not want to stay in the temple bar area as others have told us that is noisy and super expensive so we decided to try this location i think we made the right choice the only downside to the location is that there is limited restaurants close by and the restaurants on the hotel are in my opinion over priced with too small of a menu although the food tasted pretty good i would go back,1.0
i am very proud of my experience in jury inn dublin i never stay in hotels and my interactions here were exceptional thank you to the staff for making it extra special for me cheers slainte thanks,1.0
we had planned a romantic trip to dublin as we had not been in around years we booked a very smart star hotel off stevens and looked forward to it a bit of class and luxury however some friends found out we were coming and the aspect of the trip changed and we realised that we would not be in the hotel so much so why splash out we decided to down grade a little and found the address north what a great decision although not having the plushness of the original hotel the quality was excellent ok its maybe on the north side of the liffey but everything in dublin is easily accessible and the hotel is handy for the bus station luas tram and connolly street station you can walk to the grafton street within mins no problem and there is plenty to take in on noted someone mention that the trains from connolly made the hotel shake this was not our experience at all and we overlooked the track around yards south of the train passed directly below our window i could have jumped onto the roof of it in the morning you were aware they were there but no more than a main road and our intention was to be having a lie in a vibrant city like dublin harsh comment i felt used the floor lounge for continental breakfast which was ideal for something quick before heading rooms were excellently furbished and you will be,1.0
lovely hotel nice staff rooms perfect for a hen party or girly night away clean and comfortable the only fault for me was the room was extremely warm otherwise all great pleasant stay the bar serves lovely food cocktails also,1.0
good location to get to metro and sights room was renovated but still basic hotel has few facilities but wo matter if you not spending alot of time at hotel get a room with balcony for extending the size of the room not so much for view employees very friendly and helpful bars and restaurants in area around hotel not so touristy which was fine i would stay here again but would like corner room with balcony on floor,1.0
from the centraal station about a walk nice staff from the porter to the front desk great art deco building room had no so it can be a little unpleasant on warm days can ask for a fan but did not help that much,1.0
the perfect hotel for so many in the gothic quarter pool view from the sky bar and the best customer service ever it was our anniversary and saúl organised cava chocolates and balloons making it such a memorable experience we would never stay anywhere else,1.0
we spend great nights in june on arrival we were upgraded from junior suite room to suit monument thank you are not big but that expected in city center location hotel center location is one of its biggest advantages you can get by foot or by taxi to everywhere in about minutes for just eur sometimes it takes longer to go to nearby metro station than to get to destination by taxi hotel staff is very helpful with catching taxi i tried to do this myself times but never succeeded they did it very are stylish very clean only very minor issue was leaking water from shower flor to bathroom and even room spend days for sightseeing and sunbathing hotel on our request provided us with beach are served carte i prefer buffet way but they are tasty restaurant staff also accommodated our special needs due to multiple food allergies they had everything prepared in highly recommend this hotel we will be back there if we visit barcelona again,1.0

the location of this hotel is fantastic great restaurants shopping and walking distance to public transportation the roof top pool is small but nice the rooms were clean and beds were comfortable check in was very slow but the stay there was worth it i would join their rewards club as the benefits are worth it all of the sites of barcelona are accessible from this hotel via taxi or public transportation if you like good food and shopping would suggest staying in this part of town and the leonardo is a great option,1.0
like any travelodge it very convenient to what you want to stay in it was a good location to all the bars and restaurants but not to close where it was on your door step everyone at reception was very helpful would definitely stay again,1.0

we just stayed the night as a short city break and i chose this hotel from the reviews and the proximity to the city it about min walk from st and mins from temple bar but it far enough outside of the busy centre that it so quiet the hotel itself is fantastic very modern super clean staff were some of the best i had at a hotel and the room was very spacious tidy and not a defect in sight when we return to dublin we will be staying at this hotel again no question both me and my wife both agreed it more of a star than a great work guys,1.0
amazing stay at this hotel that felt like it could be out of a movie about a yoga retreat upon arriving we were given a very comfy pair of slippers and shown to our room the amenities were amazing as well nice washroom espresso machine in the room an impressive spread of snacks in the lobby and a honesty bar after taking the subway all the way from pireus to kat and seeing rough neighbourhoods and graffiti everywhere this was a very welcome change of pace,1.0
i would have given the this hotel a star rating if not for a few issues improvements the hotel staff on arrival were not particularly friendly although some of the staff were very good i booked a love room directly at least a couple of months in advance but was told it was overbooked and not available we were given a suite instead but this was at the front and was too noisy and no air con and would say the decor was a bit tired this hotel is quiet so if you are looking for something relaxing do go for this the bar is lively until very late and lots of outside noisegood love room is excellent quirky and perfect for a couple location is spot on as everything is within walking distance good toiletries from white company given a discount for the room on the night but i would say they should have contacted me in advance to say there was an issue with the room love rooms at the back of the hotel are air conditioned and much quieter,1.0
we spent lovely days in dublin and stayed at the aberdeen lodge it is a beautiful lodge and innkeepers are extremely helpful the accommodations and food were exceptional it was nice to get out of but still convenient to the city center lovely area of dublin,1.0
we were pleasantly surprised walking into this hotel it super cute boutiquey type of hotel reminds me of the ace hotels in the states everyone was so nice and helpful super close to placa cataluyna and from there you can get anywhere min walk to the water the rooms are big for europe as are the showers and the bed was super comfy now here the best part the rooftop pool is amazing small but amazing the view from there is great and only hotel guests are allowed at the pool so it not a big scene up there cocktails are a little pricey but wine at the rooftop bar is euro it a great place to make a lot of english speaking friends after our daily rooftop relaxing and siesta we made it down to the complimentary wine and cheese tasting from we had so much fun tasting wine which in reality was drinking wine they advertised a free wifi box which we wish we knew ahead of time since we had one they also advertise breakfast which is included or was included in our room at the end of the day everything was great at the hotel would stay there again,1.0

my niece had her communion here and we were happy at all with the food i had chicken wings for starter which had barely any meat on them and got about on the plate the mains came out about minutes after and i got penne pasta which was absolutely vile to say the least the pasta was dry and hard and the sauce tasted like tinned tomatoes it was basically day old pasta with a tin of tomatoes poured over it with no meat or anything disgusting,0.0
we stayed at other melias and were quite happy so we booked this hotel this turned out to be a mistake to start off with we found the people at the reception to be quite rude and unhelpful this became a rather common theme in athens a bit surprising for a country that depends on tourism this is not a casual observation as one of our children got quite sick and yet the staff was not particularly helpful this was also the case with trying to arrange tours that said i should point out the concierge called yannis who was the only person on the staff the location is in a seedy neighborhood though convenient to get to both the acropolis as well as the national archaeological museum the rooms themselves were fine too still if you have other alternatives take them,0.0
cubik is centrally located and walking distance to passeig de gracia barcelona central avenue gothic quarters etc stylish design and nice furniture in lobby and rooms the market restaurant is a hidden gem we had a great breakfast had a pickpocket incident and my mum wallet was stolen while walking around barcelona had to call all the credit card companies to cancel the cards hotel staff jenaro and javier were very helpful helped dial the numbers and speak to operators in spanish for minutes separately camilo was also very helpful in providing directions on places to would stay at a again,1.0

we checked into the travelodge as a large group coming in from canada the reception team in the hotel greeted us warmly and their attention to service was excellent from start to finish front desk is very friendly and professional attending to needs and even helping with spanish translation as needed great accommodations and a wonderful breakfast buffet each morning with hot and cold selections and rooms very clean and well kept the location is only minutes walk to the beach and not far from port olympic very efficient metro system in barcelona made this location a great base to return to as the metro stop is a few blocks away and so easy to get to the centre of town gothic quarter la ramblas and shopping around catalunya square well done travelodge,1.0
a fairly decent hotel in good as we got a room towards the back it was impossible to relax and sleep in as there was an outdoor casino at the back with extremely loud slot machines bingo caller of who you could hear every word and loud hits on though we closed windows it was like it all played in our poor ventilation made it stuffy as the windows had to be closed because of the noice,0.0
an excellent located hotel within easy walking distance of many attractions and near the hop on hop off stops and also the airport bus stop is just around the friendly staff comfy beds clean rooms nice restaurant and bar,1.0
this is a european modern styled hotel located on the island across from the centrum of amsterdam minute walk to train station city trams canal tours or across the bridge to centrum on our last visit to amsterdam we stayed right off dam square but prefer this you could take the train from the airport to the main train station and walk to this hotel quite easily hotel rooms are spartan but offer all amenities usually offered tv is an apple imac which i liked internet is fast hotel is far enough from the centrum that nighttime noise is rarely heard good nights sleep here there a refer in the room and bottled water is complimentary only real complaint is the carpet is relatively low nap direct glue down and as a result is dirty in halls and rooms if you can ignore that you will have a pleasant stay we had breakfast buffet at the restaurant and availed ourselves of the starbucks on the main floor sky lounge on the top floor has a great view and really expensive exotic drinks that are worth the price just to look at we also rented bikes from the front desk to ride around and see the real amsterdam would happily stay here again in the future,1.0
so to be fair i did intentionally book this place the company booking system flagged it up as ok and i saw double tree miles from city centre and thought it be impressions of the place was rough it on the wharf and really not an appealing part of town at all kind of in the middle of nowhere and a pretty awful looking hotel however was really well appointed and the staff were lovely the breakfast was good and the coffee ok the gym was not really as exciting as it sounded on the website it basically a runner cross trainer bike and a few dumbbells all n all nice rooms and hotel just not the location,0.0
the staff was so friendly and the room was lovely it was in the business district but there was still a double decker bus stop for touring the breakfast bffet even satisfied my kids i would recommend the hotel,1.0
really lovely people at reception which straight away gives you a warm feeling the hotel is quite beautiful with a stone staircase and two upper floors open to the sky one a restaurant and the other a spa and treatment area with a small nicely designed garden the hotel caters for large american tour groups which makes the breakfast buffet a bit difficult to navigate but once you know how to navigate it without bumping into other tables then there is everything you could want to eat the roof restaurant and bar however have a rather pretentious modern variation of authentic greek food and you could do better by eating in nearby makrigianni,1.0
stayed here for nights as a solo traveler the rooms were very clean beds were comfy and the rooms were quite having a small balcony was a nice touch were very nice and always happy to answer any is in a good location i felt safe walking around the area and it is only about a walk away from the main touristy areas,1.0
we just returned from a night stay at this fantastic hotel one of the best hotels we ever stayed at very professional staff they go above and beyond large room in a beautiful updated decor we even had a balcony to step outside on the rooftop area was fantastic bartender complimentary snacks lounging by the pool full room service menu available nice having a spa in the hotel as well i booked a foot massage after a long day of walking the location ca be beat easily walk everywhere and to all the major sights located on a quiet street daily complimentary bottles of water in the room on the morning we checked out we were handed two bottles of water for our ride to the airport i would definitely recommend this hotel and should we find ourselves in barcelona again we would stay here,1.0
pleasantly surprised by the comfort of this hotel had read some negative report re size of room and hotel furnishings but we were extremely happy with everything including the extra small elevator room was spacious and quite and the included breakfast offered a lot of choice and was enjoyable the rooftop bar with a wonderful view of the acropolis was an added bonus the staff were friendly and helpful and during breakfast we were often approached by hotel staff to advise on sightseeing and inquire if they could help organise our daily activities location was perfect and would stay here again on further trips to athens,1.0
stayed nights in july room on floor was fairly quiet and clean and had a partial view of acropolis which was a special surprise us as we did not pay for a room with view breakfast buffet was above average but breakfast room was a little hot once the sun was up at night the rooftop terrace had breathtaking views of the parthenon staff members were pleasant and smiled at lot bathroom kind of had an odor at first coming from the drain it went away after opening the window and airing it out air conditioning worked well wi fi was not great but a couple of notes the elevator was the size of a phonebooth but did work well the hotel is located up a steep hill we did not mind but i would think it would be inconvenient if you were not used it our floor room you could hear footsteps of the workers in the breakfast area floor very early in the morning if you are a light sleeper you may want to get a room below the was a or minute walk to the plaka district lots of shops and restaurants and acropoiis museum a little farther to get to acropolis itself the metro was nearby and it was how we got the airport as i heard taxi cabs were very pleased with this hotel and it was a good value to boot,1.0
i would like to comment on this plus room hotel in orense is nice and clean change the linen daily bathroom is well stock with toiletries like shampoo shower gel tooth brush and paste they also have a cafeteria and restaurant where you can eat very good food at economic price staff are great happy and very here days and very happy,1.0
had a great stay at temple bar inn dublin writing this review to complement the supervisor of the reception desk simona who really helped me make a change to my car rental made the car rental online out of manchester england hertz and wanted to change the date of pick up extremely difficult to do simona got on the phone with hertz for at least hour and got things adjusted i could not have done that otherwise the full irish breakfast was great as were the staff in the restaurant my only surprise as an american this hotel and others in ireland are not air conditioned it right in the middle of dublin great location,1.0

my wife and were staying in barcelona for five days barcelona itself is fantastic on its own but definetly staying at this hotel made our time in barcelona even better to start you can not have a better location close to literally everything the beach la rambla tourist places and shopping as soon as we come to the hotel you know that everyone from the hotel staff will make sure you are pleased every question was answered everything we wanted from the hotel and staff was always met with a positive answer and a smile great pool and bar on the top floor which usually is open until am so it was nice to be out and about and come back to the hotel and enjoy a cocktail get some relaxing time by the pool beautiful room modern and spacious could hear any noice from the next door room or from think of a better hotel to stay while in barcelona and will for sure stay again thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay johnnorway,1.0
my husband and i spent our first two nights in ireland at the wynn hotel on lower abbey street in dublin the staff was wonderful the bed was comfortable and the full irish breakfast delicious it is a lovely old hotel in a perfect location with both a restaurant and bar no taxi is needed to get everywhere you would want to go close to trinity college and street shopping pubs and restaurants,1.0
stayed nights for the concert at corke park lovely hotel very clean and spacious rooms had dinner one first night and food was excellent and great value very friendly and helpful staff would definitely stay again,1.0

i loved that this property was not in a touristy neighborhood easy walk to the beach and the metro the breakfast buffet was good and there is smoking patio out the back of the dining room we also had a refrigerator in the room,1.0
wonderful hotel excellent staff terrific amenities made the trip w would go back to barcelona just for the hotel terrific views very helpful staff and excellent highly recommend staying at negresco princess hotel,1.0
we stayed for two nights a couple and a child and we enjoyed our stay there we had a single bed in our room for our child and the room still felt spacious enough even though most properties in the area are the breakfast buffet was really good hotel is not super centrally located but with a cab it only a few euros to the city center,1.0
the location is great next to the train station and public transportation the bus stop of to the airport is right next to the train station the breakfast is simple but i have no complaints because of the good price the room is clean and comfortable they gave me a quiet room,1.0
this hotel goes above and beyond you can walk from amsterdam central and there is a great hour of complimentary wine and socialising every evening from to with complimentary tea and coffee and a dark quiet room with a luxury bed its superb value for money would not stay anywhere else in amsterdam,1.0
stay there it is a wonderful experience they have air conditioning and the old style large bath tubs for soaking your tired bodies after a long day of sight seeing the breakfast room in the morning was the best catered one that i have ever experienced they have every type of breakfast food that you could want the bar area at night was also very elegant and comfortable the nicest thing about the castle is its history and inside decor they have a self guided tour to capture and explain all the paintings and artifacts,1.0
enjoyed every minute spent at hotel praktik bakery we used the airport shuttle to and from the hotel and were treated to courteous service the entire time the hotel is right next to gaudi la pedrera within walking or metro distance to other tourist attractions as to the actual room our twin beds were closer together than expected but this was no problem the huge shower was divine finally it was amazing to wake up to delicious bakery food for breakfast each morning we will definitely stay here the next time we visit barcelona,1.0
in my opinion if a hotel is clean and has the amenities i need i am happy after that it comes down to the staff i cant say enough positive things about the staff they went out of their way to make sure all of my questions were answered whether it was about area attractions or how to get from place to were wonderful,1.0
had the pleasure of staying at the westin for nights i booked using spg points at a night which i thought was an incredible value given that the rooms were almost a night i knew the hotel was near capacity so i was prepared to get a double standard room however we were upgraded to a double superior room and they included a mattress for our year old at no additional charge the room was a nice size and loved the marble bathroom with separate deep soaking tub and shower although i wish there was a larger shelf in the shower i love old world elegance and this hotel has it in spades our room faced westmoreland street but barely heard any street noise being that we were on the top floor this hotel is central to everything we walked everywhere from the waterfront to temple bar to grafton street we had the buffet breakfast every morning which was too bad but there is a starbucks across the street and a couple of rolling donuts within walking distance definitely have a drink at the bar downstairs it gorgeous and the cocktails are is a lot of construction in front of the hotel due to the expansion of the light rail but it happening across the city so there no getting away from it and the noise really was i would not hesitate to stay here again,1.0
well located clean very helpful and friendly staff only negative remark is related with window insulation to street noise during the night nice touch the free tea in the lobby area,1.0
stayed due to conference business very nice staff nice bar and perfect reception the place is cozy clean and in a good location for sightseeing would go back although there are as well many nice places around,1.0
the hotel is very conveniently located near athens gate and walkable distance from acropolis the famous plaka district is also at walking distance from the hotel all the archeological sites are in close i found the hotel a bit expensive for stay and nothing exceptional but i must say that they have a breakfast box service for people with early morning flight which you dont find in many hotels,1.0
upon arrival at clontarf one is amazed at the visual appearance it is a lovely property including interior which is state of the art but very reminiscent of a castle colors are royal purple fit for a king and a queen,1.0
hotel was within walking distance to the places we were planning to visit we walked everywhere did not need a which saved us some money staff was polite and accomodating rooms were clean and comfortable we had a nice view of the acropolis from our window breakfast had a nice variety and was well stocked the only glitch is probably their wifi slow and unpredictable,1.0
our shampoo dispenser broke and was not repaired for days our toilet paper was ruined with a spilled soda and was not replaced for days we did like the way rooms were cleaned we killed a cocaroach in our room and left it there and it was not cleaned for days until we informed front desk there is no concierge,1.0
i can not recommend this hotel highly enough everything was outstanding staff very friendly and attentive and couldnt do enough for us good location in a nice area rooms fantastic and really clean ca fault a single thing the park is only a stroll out of the door and is lovely for an early morning walk,1.0
our trip to dublin was spectacular and clayton hotel cardiff lane was a sweet addition to our adventure i like to particularly point out alessia at the front desk for going above and beyond in helping me i was heading to the concert on saturday night and alessia was super helpful in helping me print out a hard copy of my ticket we chatted about teaching and the beauty of ireland it rare to meet someone who is so authentically interested in conversing and helping in the service industry it is a stretch to say that when we return to dublin to stay we will choose the clayton due to alessia hospitality all the best dan and rebecca,1.0
i never usually one to write a review and very easily pleased however found this hotel awful we paid a fair amount of money for a hostel type accommodation a but box room with no window it was very dirty and we did want to sleep in the sheets we did pay for a shared bathroom but we did realise this would mean a tiny bathroom being used by other rooms would never stay here again,0.0
i stayed in the dergvale with two other friends we had a lovely bright three single bed room in my opinion the breakfast was delicious and enough you get orange juice tea which gets topped up if you wish a choice of differently done eggs with sausage and bacon cereal lovely sour dough with jams the people who run it are really lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them it is only about a fifteen minute walk to the temple bar area i would definitely recommend the dergvale and would stay there again,1.0
i booked this hotel as a surprise for my partners was disappointed it lived up to all the previous good reviews and my partner was really over the moon with it we stayed in the deluxe canal view room exactly as described bed was massive and really comfy the shower was great with robes and slippers which is a nice touch coffee pods taste great and soft free mini bar spot asked the hotel if we could have a nice bottle of red wine for his birthday which they provided with a lovely birthday note the location is great with the tram stopping outside cruise and heineken tour just a half kilometre on the other side of canal from hotel we ca praise the hotel and staff on reception enough they were so lovely and helpful the iron in the room is a steam one so you may want to take a spray bottle for stubborn ate in a restaurant called bazar which is middle eastern food very tasty and reasonable it in the same street as the closes later than other restaurants which all seam to close at this closes at there is also a super market on this market you like indian food there is a good one on the other side of canal to the left side over the traffic lights it very reasonable but closes at pm bodywork museum was a rain mac it really does rain at the drop of a hat but the hotel,1.0
cons the location of the hotel is seedy and horrible as we walked from the metro stop to the hotel men were breaking areas of the sidewalks to fill bottles with water from the underground pipes litter was everywhere and the area is severely i was embarrassed to bring my family and international guest to this hotel and arrival we were informed our family room was on the floor once entered it was clear it was a double room in which they tried to squeeze in a single bed and a rollaway chairs from the desk were moved to the foot of our double bed and crammed against the my discussion with the staff we were moved to a family room on the floor facing the back streets of athens we were informed that the room on the floor was indeed a family room which i know it was not here the description copied from their official website dorian inn hotel offers a great variety of standard single double and triple rooms and from the to the floor we offer superior double and family rooms for an stay in athens spelling from hotel websiteupon departure at we saw a man sitting on a doorstep sniffing white substance and a woman sitting on the sidewalk with adult dog and puppies who appeared to be malnourished so very sad for all these reasons i will not stay at dorian inn hotel in the the breakfast was very good and the support staff,0.0
being someone who travels extensively for work i can say i experience my fair share of dump hotels this place however tops them by a good way it pure nasty so where do i begin i start with minor grievance of only towel in a bed room i had towels in a no star hotel in lobito the front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless could not offer alternative room when i complained at the rooms allocated small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it a little on the snug side our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get was the sympathetic front desk reply the all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day the photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of guinness would i be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online to top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of in what way was that even remotely possible the only way i can get my head around that if if the catagory was the,0.0
i had visited this hotel at the past for different reasons but now realize that is very nice also for business meetings and workshops my team meeting was there and was very successful the service was great the rooms nice not hesitate to use this hotel for this perpoze,1.0
this is a very quaint hotel perfectly located right in the heart of town the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff was nice and accommodating the only minor complaint i have is that there is no restaurant to sit and eat breakfast instead you have to order breakfast to be delivered to your room which we chose not to do however there are plenty of places right downstairs to go out to eat so that was only a minor inconvenience otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,1.0
shabby run down room sheets stank of smoke shower door had to be held shut to prevent flooding the bathroom blaring music from nightclub kept me awake until ear plugs in bathroom did help because my bed was literally vibrating from the music this hotel may be good value and right in the heart of dublin but it not suitable for business travellers who value their sleep and appreciate small creature comforts when away from home,0.0
i arrived early due to taking a flight and was overjoyed that reception managed to accommodate my earlier than the scheduled check in time the hotel is about minutes walk from central station and is close to a metro if you are not a walker there is a good range of local amenities and the area is trendy and central rooms are clean with plenty of light a good selection of tv channels and there is a good overall vibe to the hotel itself the only thing i think needs improvement is the nightclub the two nights i attended were a bit of a let down ie sparsely attended and i wasn t a fan of the electronic style music but hey you cant have everything,1.0
stayed here in early june first time in barcelona rooms were modern and of a decent size really comfy bed and a nice bathroom very clean everything worked great wifi air conditioning tv etc great breakfast room with an excellent breakfast buffet and great cappuccinos hotel staff are friendly and helpful there a wonderful lap pool on the rooftop that we loved really enjoyed the outside bar was good very good location pretty quiet at night of places to eat etc also an excellent shopping center right behind hotel with a good choice of boutiques and a food market below ground with a good variety of eateries price levels would definitely stay here again,1.0
we enjoyed staying here our room was small but modern the bar was great for getting a beer before heading out they looked after our bags all day before we flew home the only problem is the painfully slow check in and out,1.0
we booked this hotel last minute at a very reasonable price and were pleased with the location it is very close less than minutes walk to the food market where we walked for breakfast each day it is also less than minutes from las rambla and a short walk from the waterfront the nearest metro station is also very close and allowed us to get to park guell very quickly with no train changes and also to several other main sites everything else was walkable the rooms were clean a decent size and had excellent air conditioning facilities the pool on the roof is small but is just what is needed if you fancy a lazy afternoon on a sun lounger staff dealt with a leak in our room which was the fault of those staying about us calmly and quickly so that it did impact on our stay at all would definitely stay here again if i return to barcelona,1.0
this is the worst hotel we been to in several decades of matchbox bathroom where it was dangerous to take a shower a toilet door that would close exorbitantly priced mediocre breakfast in a dining hall where they rarely clean the tables and do refill buffet trays when they are paper for the printer in a tiny business center slow bad unsmiling in a strange old building with poor furniture and lots of dark is great,0.0
very good location near to the diagonal avenue and near the best stores of barcelona rooms are very confortables and the attention was very good maybe the breakfast need more options very clean and all the people working in the hotel are very kindle,1.0
hotel is ok kind of location is not bad but not a walking distance from attractions rooms are quite small and breakfast is very basic i would explore another hotel if i go again to barcelona it has elevators one was down during my entire days stay staff are quite helpful with good english communication,0.0
second time that we have stayed here excellent service individually decorated and extremely spacious rooms very central and within close walking distance of museum quarter and nine streets staff could be more helpful elderly parents had to take care with steep steps but certainly manageable thoroughly recommend,1.0
we got to this hotel very late and were exhausted we were greeted at this hotel by a very friendly reception water and snacks the hotel is very clean and had the best shower of the entire trip it is also located in a great location close to all tourist sites,1.0
completed a vacation by staying at the ava hotel for two nights things could have been better wonderful staff beautiful suite and an excellent location it was a very spacious two room suite with a balcony to look up to the parthenon walking distance to the parliament shopping and many fine choose any other hotel than ava when in athens,1.0
my wife and i spent four nights at the park hotel and enjoyed the stay the hotel is very clean modern and quite it is a block from vondelpark and very convenient to many other attractions and the trams are handy and easy to use for more distant attractions bed was very comfortable bathroom was spotless and well stocked with towels and toiletries very diverse only in amsterdam range of items for sale in the room we did partake staff members were all very friendly and and out was a breeze we checked in early and left our bags until later it did rain a bit while we were there but hotel provided umbrellas for guests great place to relax and enjoy amsterdam,1.0
we have not even stayed yet in the herbert park hotel and i must give a thumbs up for the reservation staff especially karen my hubs proposed to me in herbert park in when we were just years old we met when i was and he was herbert park was our park so to stay in herbert park hotel for a couple of nights years ago kids and baby grandchildren later means so much to us i rang just now to reservations karen and i was complicating the booking with special requests she was so kind and understanding she rang me back a short while ago with everything in place that is good service but more importantly i had a slight problem and she gave me the solution that is the ethos of customer relations excellent service i will have my second review after the weekend having actually stayed and hopefully enjoyed the food romancestillalive,1.0
this hotel is a wonderful luxury hotel set in a great location it is quiet enough for you to feel distanced from the hustle of the city life yet close enough for you to get a great breakfast and even walk to the city we had a lovely stay here our room was perfect i have no complaints i would definitely stay here again,1.0
very friendly and profesional staff nice swiming pool and terrace everything modern clean and nice spa is so qute very well decorated massage is excelent rooms are very confortable wifi is ok everything clean,1.0
once again another great stay at the ashling from our first contact st the reception to checking out two days later every member of staff was friendly pleasant and super efficient the breakfast choices were as on previous occasions excellent the hotel is very convenient for heuston station and the airport express service as well as local buses and the lucas thank you to all concerned and we will be back in november if not before,1.0
my family and i stayed at this hotel for nights every thing is new in high is very easy to reach from airport to the hotel and to the main attractions as the metro station is only minutes by nice professional and very helpful staff thak you i recommend this hotel,1.0
we stayed for nights in march the roof top view is breathtaking though the food beverage offer was very poor the view is totally worth it our room was spacious very confortable king size bed big breakfast buffet with the amazing greek yougurt in case you are taking the early morning ferry do worry they have your breakfast ready,1.0
first impression the reception staff was really good very friendly and helpful as should be up to my room junior suite and the first thing that came to my mind was how small it was but to be honest it was enough space and that is what i care about in the end just small for being a suite so keep that in mind when you book and might be expecting a larger room room was very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable free wifi was fast and reliable and there is a nespresso machine in the room as well i got a welcome gift that consisted of a nice bottle of cava and fresh fruits to go with this very nice of the hotel and unexpected the hotel is located perfectly and you are within walking distance to most of the touristy things as long as you do mind walking a bit everything is within right opposite to the hotel there are a large shopping hotel offers free of charge a buffet from that has hot and cold food sandwiches smoothies snacks etc etc really good breakfast was of the buffet style with the option to order eggs anyway you want selection was ok but overall i found the breakfast to be a bit of a disappointment one thing that i find in many hotels is design before function and it was the same here when it came to the shower even tho there is a door,1.0
efficient experience from hotel staff and conveniently located with supermarkets and everyday article shops located minute walk down to the expo center to see the musical fountains and then les ramblas another ten minutes breakfast layout made the start of the day more problem was that the street did not have facility for parking of large buses and as we were a group of the getting the bus was a rushed recommend to friends and,1.0
we stayed three nights at camden court so got a good idea of what the hotel is like the customer service was good the rooms quite large and well equipped and breakfast was outstanding the hotel has an indoor pool and well equipped gym there is much more you could want in a hotel is also well located with easy access to the main attractions it is outside the temple bar zone so it relatively quiet but not too far as to make the walk to see everything too great it is also surrounded by many bars and thought overall it was good value for money,1.0
staff in the hotel did an excellent job however service in the restaurant was quite disappointing it seems like the wait staff are attentive to your first drink order and food order but after that their rarely check on you and it can be quite an effort to have your finished plates cleared order dessert or get and pay your bill,1.0
we spent two nights in this hotel i was centrally located near the heuston train station which was important for us as we were traveling to galway during our trip you can also catch the luas dublin rail train at the heuston station as well this hotel was some what dated but that did not bother us much the only drawback we had was that there was no air conditioner or fans just to circulate air we had a family room which was a interesting because my husband and i slept on a double bed in the middle of the room with our kids on the sides of us on twin beds the hotel is located west of the main dublin area but it is only a min walk or a luas ride this hotel was located in a more residential area and had limited pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood the staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel had a large area i can not talk about the hotel restaurant as we did not eat there overall we had a nice stay rooms were clean and safe,1.0
a very stylish place in the middle of the city action that said there is no balcony as in vinoteca or garden which was a bit surprising staff does not speak english very well and cleaning until pm is a bit too early if you stay for over a couple of nights,1.0
really cool hotel not far from center with nice bar on rooftop room was cozy staff was friendly breakfast also was good city center is couple of metro stations away also accessible by bike or even on foot if you do mind long walks,1.0
everything about the hotel was perfect convenient location beautiful large room very helpful and friendly front desk staff i would recommend it to anyone visiting amsterdam we splurged on one of the glass walled rooms and it was really worth it,1.0
we arrived at midnight due to a late flight the staff greeted us warmly and checked us in in the morning we enjoyed lunch by the pool the staff held our baggage after while we explored the neighborhood taxi were parked out front during the day making travel to our next destination easy it was a taxi ride from the airport the train was an option at midnight when our flight arrived we originally thought it was closer to the airport but the room bathroom pool made it worth the extra taxi costs such friendly staff,1.0
we were in an executive suite for a family of we had a bedroom with a king bed and they brought in a roll away and made up the couch for the two teens very nice hotel very close to the center of amsterdam we flew into ams and took the train to the central station it was a short walk with luggage to the doubletree the staff were amazing all very friendly and welcoming the room was a perfect place to recover from jet leg and to walk around a busy tourist hotel but the executive lounge on the floor has a lovely breakfast and evening appetizers and drinks we stayed on the top floor where there was also a popular sky lounge with a roof top deck to look out over a the old town of amsterdam there was also a starbucks in the lobby of the hotel as well as a few restaurants that seemed popular the cruise port was also a short walk away and we were able to walk with our rolling luggage or a short cab ride if you have large luggage i thought all the hotel prices in amsterdam were very expensive but felt i received the value from the doubletree and would stay there again if i back in amsterdam on business or vacation,1.0
nice hotel with friendly staff and clean facilities my only critisism would be that the buffet breakfast is spread out around the restaurant a little so you have to go hunting for things which makes things interesting in the morning but the food was good,1.0
the room was clean steday wifi freat th floor and secent breakfast pretty far from the city center but all pales compare to the bed we ordered a double bed and got teo twin beds pushed togeter with a flat twin mattress on each which didnt even fit the bed i dont know how a hotel which respects itself can call this a decent bed i understood that all beds were like this very disappointing,0.0
stayed for a short break in july room was up in the gods and a bit compact and bijou but all looked reasonably fresh a very different approach to the decor which you will either love or hate but we found it comfortable being in temple bar and at the front of the hotel there was a little noise from the streets but a guinness or two soon sorted that out or the ear plugs that were provided could be buffet was okay but juices seemed thin and watery no real passion in the staff and no space from your neighbours who do not always want to speak the reception team were all very helpful and the housekeeping team polite who we spoke would not have an issue going back to stay,1.0
i stayed here with my family for nights and i have nothing but good things to say the staff is wonderful and they do anything they can to meet your requests leonidas started helping even before my trip when he answered all my emails he arranged to have our luggage stored while we took a short trip to the islands thank you leonidas the rooms are very clean and modern the hotel is closed to all the main sites mins to placa mins to monasterati mis to the acropolis the olympic stadium and much more worth every penny,1.0
hotel is situated in center and metro is not far away minutes but neighborhood is big problem drug edicts pickpockets jobless etc at evening armed security in front of hotel so recommend to order taxi to leave and return to hotel we were warned each tome from taxi drivers to be careful in that part of is ok but not enough tables for all guests cue for elevator as it is small and there is only are old dusty and carpets are full of stains beds are comfortable units are silent so it is possible to sleep if you leave them switched is ok with hairdryer but we were missing liquid soap dispenser was empty for all safety deposit box in all rooms some have some not that was a problem,0.0
this place is far enough from the airport that you are not annoyed by airplane noises all night long and in an area with walking and biking paths the food is much better than typical hotel restaurant faire and the price is right,1.0
ok hotel needs improvement but no negatives with staff or rooms i stayed in room on the of august when dublin was very busy right from our entry at reception until we left the staff were exceptional reception staff and bar staff excellent i lost my bank card and the receptionist made sure i did not have to pay for parking but was more worried that i got it sorted it was the girl with blonde hair on at pm on the staff one bar man in particular made it his to make us feel at home i think his name was niall the hotel has had its fair share of negativity but from belfast it great if you driving as it next to motorway again dated but if your in dublin to comment on a family trip this is the bus outside every mins fare into city centre,1.0
we stayed here for one night after getting married in the city the hotel staff were fabulous and really made the stay extra special for us on account of the special occasion the room had fantastic views floor to ceiling windows over the river the city and the mountains in the background bathroom was well equiped very good location in the city,1.0
granted this place is clean and in a good location however this is where the positives walls are paper thin so we can at this moment hear the couple on one side of us having a conversation and the cleaner vigorously cleaning the room and possibly rearranging the furniture on the other every time our neighbours take a morning shower at or this morning at it sounds like a waterfall is running down the wall beside our bed we can hear lights being switched on plugs being put in and out conversations tvs hangers being battered in the cupboards and people walking on the laminated flooring the hotel has a pool which attracted us in the first place but do let that entice you since it only gets sun in the morning and the loungers and swiftly taken by people who do leave them all day so no chance of using it until the sun goes down avoid at all costs if you want a good nights sleep in preparation for your busy trek around the city,0.0
i booked this wyndham grand for the quality of hotel facilities i was not disappointed the rooms and hotel at star we booked a junior suite with city view for my husband myself and year old daughter for was very spacious enough privacy for sharing with a self conscious teenager bathroom was very spacious also and plenty towels were super helpful with info on athens hotel and booking taxis etc for onwards journey and ordered driver for pick up at airport breakfast excellent lots to choose from and views of the acropolis from bar and the bar is itself a great place to hang out later in afternoon or in evening however i given a star rating as service is very poor on rooftop there were times we waited mins from ordering at bar when supposed to be table a couple of occasions we had to wait a while on pool towels being delivered to bar area this is the only place the hotel is let down location it not the nicest however the tourist buses stop across the road the underground station is across the road and taxis sit outside are very cheap would definitely return to this hotel if visiting athens again i highly recommend,1.0
the hotel is small and modern great breakfasts excellent shower i stayed for a conference and brought my teenage daughter who enjoyed the hotel very much the reception team were extremely friendly cyrielle in particular went out of her way to help us every time she saw us we had a great stay and would recommend the hotel highly,1.0
we normally stay a little way out of the city centre when we visit dublin but as were in town we had struggled to find accommodation and the parliament hotel turned out to be the most affordable option we could find hotel prices had inflated everywhere in town by at least however we were disappointed the location of the hotel is excellent on the edge of temple bar which we normally avoid like the plague so really accessible without being ridiculously busy and loud i slept really well on the third floor with the window open even with the fan in the room it would have been too warm and stuffy without there was very little noise though yes the walls are thin and floorboards creak could hear the music from the bar at all the doors slam a little too easily i suppose but that down to other guests not treating people with the level of respect that we afforded them when coming and going from the room the staff are approachable and personable and the downstairs has a pleasant atmosphere free entertainment in the evenings and is badly priced we ate there the first evening and the food was excellent the hotel has already stated on here that they are having a refurb in the coming months so i wo comment on the decor other than to say it just a bit tired the bed however i will not have a bad word said against yes it two,1.0
welcoming staff at reception very slow no eye contact we have to approach and asked the staff for checkin we were the only guest at that time should explain to the guests the facilities hotel offer while giving the room keys,0.0
this is a nice hotel the staff is friendly they offer free that works quite well the rooms are spacious however sometimes it can be noisy the breakfast is very good and the breakfast staff are very friendly however i think it is a little bit to expensive euros the rooftop swimming pool is minuscule it more like a oversized jacuzzi the location is excellent it is possible to walk to the sagrada familia cathedral the tram and the subway station are just minute away,1.0
generally the hotel is fine but there are no bars restaurants nothing outside the hotel to go to center you need to take a tram often overloaded for minutes or a taxi euro so unless you want to suffer and be a commuter be ready to add this amount on your room bill and finally it must turn out more convenient to stay nearer the center being an international hotek chain they could offer a navette to center but doing so obviously they wouldnt share your money with was clean but if you forget to switch on the green light no cleaning lady will you do turn it green the cleaning lady does do anything else than roughly your bedsheets no one cared of dirty glasses on the shelves or to arrange the room and make it look bath is sad is comfortable and room is idea of breakfast i thought it was included actually but it was not and to add another euros would have made it really out of price considering the taxis is ok but if you dont have your you need an extra euro and another to access the is good fine service and good meat no complains so generally not comfortable due to the location and the lack of a navette and euro for nights no breakfast do make it a place where i want to return,0.0
staff was wonderful hotel was very clean we did have one glitch and when we told the staff about it they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and provided us with a free dinner hop on hop off bus passes by every morning at so you have no problem getting to great attractions,1.0
this was truly an outstanding experience from the beatuiful facilities to the gracious and accommodating staff we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in barcelona dining and a fun and vibrant rooftop bar experience i only wish we could have stayed longer staying at hotel omm is a must when you in barcelona,1.0
enjoyed final nights in ireland at the westin dublin and very happy we did the facility itself is very clean and comfortable staff was friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was excellent location is also great one block to trinity university and one block the other way to temple bar area also many other shopping eating and drinking options right nearby highly recommended,1.0
we did know what to expect arriving into barcelona spain let alone the hotel we chose on the moment we arrived the hotel was in the heart of the gothic quarters which was a place i really wanted to visit during our stay the fact that the hotel was in the thick of it all was awesome all the employees at the front desk were very friendly one person stood out was jean she worked in the restaurant and was very approachable and was very friendly she knew the moment i walked in that coffee was my go to drink overall if you want an experience a great hotel this is definitely one of my favorites places to stay and i definitely come back in years completion of sagrada familia thank you to all the staff and jean at catalonia catedral for making our visit an enjoyable one,1.0
i have stayed at several places in ams but this is my favorite i am a marriott platinum member so i may get some perks others do but i think the location is what makes this place very good the various attractions are all within minutes walking from the red light district to the historic hotel itself has a good bar and the club lounge is typical of a marriott the rooms are modern and consistent my only complaint would be some of the experiences i had with a few of the front desk staff nothing too serious but i didnt get the sense they were the most it was a big deal my overall experience was great and the overall quality of service excellent,1.0
location location location large clean updated rooms with excellent amenities very friendly and helpful staff small gym has limited exercise equipment but serves the purpose fine for vacationers excellent new spa and sauna facilities,1.0
we stayed one night at the marker before returning home to san diego the next day we were welcomed by staff from the moment we arrived they were extremely helpful and very friendly our room was spacious with a large bathroom the hotel has a modern and attractive feel located in the dockland area with pedestrianized areas coffee shops etc i really like this place i booked one of the special rates online which included breakfast a room upgrade and access to the spa it was worth it and to be honest the price was still way better than i could have got for one of the hotels in the heart of the city the marker was just a short walk or uber ride from the key sights in the city if i come back to dublin i will stay at the marker i doubt that i will even look at other options,1.0
arrived on sunday morning at at was greeted by friendly professional staff it was to early to check in so we were prepared to leave our bags there and look around dublin while talking to the lady at the counter i think it was the supervisor who came over and said there was a room available and we could check in straight away after only two hours sleep this was excellent and little gestures like this would make us stay here room itself was spacious clean and very pleasant to stay in and the beds were was excellent and the chef did a good job overall an excellent hotel in a great location with excellent stay here again,1.0
not a bad were bar was is and gym great i gave out of for value because naturally it expensive to get such a great hotel and star treatment,1.0
we stayed here nights over two rooms the rooms were fine although one had a musty smell that room also had some noise from adjoining rooms my right i was quiet and clean it is very close to the parliament building so we easily saw the changing of the guards and it is a short walk to the plaka area it is an easy walk to the acropolis too as long as you do get lost in the winding streets the top floors have a good view of the acropolis breakfast is up there on the floor i would say suggest booking the floors to if you want a room view the lower floors have terrible views fortunately for me i do not travel to sit in a room and look outside i am only there at night and do mot care,1.0
port veil looks from the outside like most old buildings in central barcelona nice but not exciting now getting inside of this hotel you re welcomed with something very different a very modern and pleases design very service oriented staff just as elegant hotel room as the rest of the interior and then the roof terrace with bar pool and a great view towards the mediterranean,1.0
i would stay here again in a hearbeat the rooms are small but comfortable clean and functional the location is fantastic but above all the staff are friendly helpful and professional food in the restaurant was delicious and fresh as well,1.0
loved this trendy hotel very clean and nice the staff was friendly and very helpful the room was clean and the beds were comfortable the breakfast was fantastic and well worth the money the drinks were just a bit too expensive on the rooftop although we enjoyed being up there all in all a great stay,1.0
loved every bit of my stay at apollo the staff remembered my name and my birthday throughout the weekend i was very pleased with the location very close to vondelpark and the shopping center of amsterdam,1.0
we spend nights in this hotel and we were pleased especially with the club lounge services our room pool and hotel gym also the rooftop bar is nice in the evenings offering great views to the city our room was spacious with nice views to the acropolis and it was always kept very clean by the staff beds are comfortable hotel staff was very friendly and helpful we used the complimentary shuttle bus to syntagma few times but also taxis were everywhere easily available the shuttle taxi drive to syntagma takes mins and taxi costs euros overall a very good stay,1.0
perfectly situated in the centre of the city close to plaza catalan and the stops for bus tours metro and airport boutique feel super decor nice trendy feel drink on arrival at check in free use of wifi dongles as you go out around the city we used the aero bus for airport transfer at euros return such a convenient minute nearby is superb nice walks restaurants and bars min walk to sagrada bar and pool is small but comfortable though the barman has to be the most unfriendly and rude i ever met unresponsive unhelpful ignores you at the bar never a smile or friendly response bad are small but nice check out was a bonus i certainly have this as my first choice hotel in barcelona and hope to best thing was free wine and cheese every evening brilliant way to relax and meet other travellers staying at the this hotel but sort out that awful bar man,1.0
the hotel really is a good base for exploring barcelona the rooms are small but i doubt you will spend much time there with all of barcelona at your feet i love that the hotel owners are so community minded they donate the profits from one hotel to charity and they offer discounts for neighbors whose family are visiting the hotel also has a discount card for restaurants and shops in the neighborhood i love it,1.0
the westbury is a grand hotel located in the heart of activity in dublin just a few steps off main pedestrian shopping mall and surrounded by restaurants and pubs rooms are very comfortable and service was excellent,1.0
from arrival to departure the family had a great stay in the croke park hotel aided by the view of thee croke park for all fans of stay play free car parking was a bonus while bedrooms were comfortable bar areas equally good,1.0
a wonderful clean hotel with a park located outside the hotel the amenities were very good breakfast was at a cost but well worth the fees the hotel staff was wonderful especially during breakfast the hotel has lots of little cafe shops within walking distance the hotel is located a distance away from the general bus pick up area taxi are available with very cordial drivers eager to know where you come from very safe neighborhood i recommend this property with an excellent rating,1.0
for our second family stay at the royal olympic the impressions were the same and have even worsened this hotel is a bit deceiving for a but with a perfect location in the city center of rooms are comfortable clean quiet and spacious the wifi is working correctly only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand despite the easy control system this was much of a problem for one night but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel beginning with the reception hall arriving at the royal olympic does feel like arriving at a we arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time similarly the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our snacks to come a bit later on i also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected this was corrected only after we noticed is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the acropolis and the city center there is plenty,1.0
stayed for two nights at the hotel it is close to all public transport which means you are only minutes from all tourist attractions and city centre hotel was very clean in all areas and had everything you need,1.0
as somebody mentioned there is a shocking deposit of euros per day per room other than that the rest is quite satisfying quite attentive staff can cater for everything from museum tickets to umbrellas the rooms are nice with lovely products and well replenished daily superior rooms get free minibar breakfast is good quality but small in size maybe a bit overpriced the hotel is in a quiet posh residential area min away walking from the museums and with plenty of restaurants nearby,1.0
this is not just a beautiful hotel this is not just a hotel with charm and tradition this is not just a hotel with a great breakfast this is a hotel that will take care of you for the moment you arrive until you depart thank you brid cecilia and goran i sure that not spelled right thank you for going over and above the general warm welcome thank you for helping our large group out when the coach forgot to pick us up for the airport and thank you for helping me with my daughter and her hospital stay you gave us peace of mind and comfort love this place and those who work here i feel like you are friends,1.0
great and friendly breakfast was delicious and plenty of room we had a room on the floor at the back near the tracks but had no issue with noise the location is great to avoid lugging suitcases through the city right next to the station so easy to catch a bus tram etc beds were comfortable and room very clean we felt the space was decent they have fast which was nice would stay again and recommend,1.0
we had a great experience on our first two nights in athens hotel staff were great and always friendly rooms and hallways were well maintained lobby area was beautiful with very cool artwork well located and took advantage of the free shuttle would stay here again,1.0
we chose a room with a harbor view it was lovely it had a juliette balcony which was something i did quite see from the website i thought we be able to sit outside my dislikes of the room were minor it wad a poorly lit bathroom and was lacking conveniences like an electrical outlet in the bathroom also lacking a waste bin by the sink good shower though the coffee maker in the room made good coffee and we were supplied complimentary bottled water daily the hotel is well located close to barri gothic and el born easy walk to metro stop the staff at reception was friendly welcomed us with a glass of cava,1.0
when i came back to the room i found that my jean and got stolen they were all brand cloth i informed the front desk but they did do anything and told me to call the police even though they know i had to check out and leave very rude service never again back to this place,0.0
this is in the plaka area which is great if are just into the bar and night club scene there is a lot of graffiti everywhere so much that it is in your face everywhere you turn there are also a lot of gypsies constantly begging and following you around it is around the corner from a main street where you to go go if you want to meet a tour bus to the left of the arion you go right into plaka on the other side of plaka are the zeus and acropolis ruins minutes away so if you are in athens to enjoy the historical sights this would not be a convenient location with that being said the front staff at the hotel are unhelpful and seem to not care about customer service the older gentleman constantly smoking in front of the hotel is less good than the younger one he was also housekeeping and you call him if you need towels etc as we got out of the cab he remained smoking never said hello and offered no help with our suitcases we proceeded to the front desk and waited for him as he finished his cigarette about minutes later yes i timed him there was no coffee pot in the room or a mini bar they charge for use of the safe bathrooms are extremely small and there is no privacy the view from our floor room was a view to trash the free wifi never,0.0
location central about mins from airport and mins to ferry portstaff extremely friendly and helpfulappearance tidy and cleanroom comfortable and not too tightservices amazing restaurant a must see we only stayed here for one night and would recommend the athenian callirhoe to anyone traveling to athens no complaints about this hotel,1.0
our room overlooking the canal was fabulous the service was impeccable and we loved the library bar the decor was incredible and the brunch was delicious location could not be beat close to everything but on a quiet and charming street we will be back,1.0
we had a pleasant night stay in buswells i booked a small double room and it is small limited space around the bed and no seating it has been remodeled and has modern amenities the wifi worked well the bathroom has a long shower room and a rain shower with good water pressure and hot water supply however there was no place to put the shampoo and shower gel other than the floor plenty of towels were supplied but there were no towel bed is comfortable and we slept well there was no air conditioning and it was hot during our stay the provided fan helped circulate the air opening the window cooled the room comfortably but also let in road noise so i had to wear earplugs to breakfast included a buffet with a selection of breads cheese jams natural yogurt fruit fresh and dried and hot breakfast the coffee was good the rooms are not on the same level and you have to go up and down some steps after getting out of the lift to get to some rooms if you have trouble with stairs best to talk to reservations to select a room the hotel is well located a minute walk from the museum of archeology and close to grafton street we would happily stay there again,1.0
overpriced but new holiday inn express in an excellent location in dublin very few vegetarian options at breakfast staff are very helpful and friendly though airport bus stops right outside the hotel very convenient,1.0
this hotel offers wonderful service in a great location perfectly located close to city center as well as minutes to cruise ship location and minutes to train station would highly recommend this hotel while visiting amsterdam,1.0
location very good less than a minute walk to ramblas segrada familia and gauti house metro was nearby room we were on the ground floor and had a nice patio the shower was indescribably powerful it was like a gas powered pressure common areas chic hotel many attractions in spain require you to get your tickets in advance and they provided access to a computer and printer to help accommodate that the pool is small and very very shallow like feet shallow it was nice to be on the rooftop and put your feet in as needed but do expect to get a workout easily a star hotel and they were very friendly i went for my birthday and during the whole trip it was the only establishment that recognized it was my birthday and provided a free bottle of cava,1.0
we chose the park hotel because of its proximity to the museum and antique district we were not disappointed a special thank you to the staff who were quite accommodating and friendly it was quite helpful that they have a parking garage at the property also the breakfast was delightful,1.0
we had an adjoining room king bed and bath in one room king and pullout and bath in the other fantastic rooms great breakfast in the morning and extremely helpful hotel staff hop on hop off bus has stop right at square very near flea market and many other fun parts of athens,1.0
the hotel has excellent facilities and links to the airport to make it the ideal place for those on a layover flight or short stay some of the features are a little via the website but this can be overlooked when considering the great staff and cleanliness of the rooms i would not recommend this hotel for families or couples who are looking to see amsterdam city pay the extra price for somewhere in the city centre,1.0
everything was perfect from arrival to our leave only place for improvements is the breakfast menu a little bit of shuffling the offer would not hurt we stay for a week and had the same breakfast every morning,1.0
just had nights in this lovely hotel for the rds show hotel was spotless service was excellent the food was good and the staff could not have been any more helpful and friendly the only slight down is the fact you get charged for parking your car a resident i do think car parking charges should apply that was the only flaw in an otherwise perfect stay,1.0
my daughter and i recently stayed at this fantastic hotel we spent weeks travelling around spain and barcelona was our last stop we arrived a little early for check in but our room was ready for us we chosen a cathedral view room and i really recommend spending that little extra to do the same was a beautiful view to wake up to and listening to the bells was wonderful the reception staff were all very helpful and so friendly and knowledgeable in all the places to visit we had booked for breakfast and really enjoyed the selection of hot and cold food the rooms were spacious and the bathroom was well stocked with all your needs would definitely book this hotel when i next visit barcelona,1.0
i booked the hotel for one night as we began our day journey to ireland i really only booked it because i had marriott points and was not paying attention to the hotel probably should have very classy luxurious old hotel priding itself on its service when we arrived the desk clerk thought he had a room open but when we arrived at the door luggage in the hands of the bellman and used the key the room was occupied much embarrassment led to our enjoying a complimentary breakfast i used the word breakfast but again i am understating as there were two rooms of beautifully prepared foods at buffet and a waiter who stood by the tables ready to provide any drink or food and complete service the hotel is nice rooms are nice pool is beautiful and long enough for laps exercise room very nice location can not be beat,1.0
our tour company choice this is a sleek luxury hotel but further from central city than we choose though there a tram stop almost opposite and we used taxis to save time our room was as stylish and tastefully decorated as you expect and windows with electric blinds onto the bathroom gave the impression of even greater space the bed was perfect and the large picture window gave us a lovely view of a small canal staff were very helpful and the buffet breakfast was excellent,1.0
danilo was a friendly ahd helpful man who got us quickly registered and tried very hard to help us get registration problems sorted out he was back in the morning and promptly got us checked out and called a cab to get us to the train breakfast was good and it was filling the room was wonderful and comfortable we recommend the hotel to anyone who is going in this area,1.0
interesting hotel of very contemporary design with a theme which continues into the bedrooms the staff were very nice and happy to help and the location is excellent for transport links or for walking into the centre we did not have breakfast at the hotel as it seemed overpriced but enjoyed the bar area and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of drinks on offer including cocktails,1.0
lovely hotel really friendly chatty staff make you feel welcome the room was clean had everything you need and the bed was comfortable if you like half a wilder beast order the rack of ribs from the restaurant take a doggy bag huge messy and delicious,1.0
we stayed at the fleet street hotel in dublin in july the location is really good right near temple bar and very close to the bus stop for galway the hotel is above the street level so you have to take the lift or walk the stairs and they have security at the door in the evening and at night to control access the decor is modern and the staff were very friendly my brother a smoker was pleased to learn that they had two outdoor terraces available for smokers,1.0
this was our visit to this hotel and again the quality of service was second to none can not fault this hotel the staff are so amazing and committed to the guests and daniela our waitresses were excellent and so professional julia alejandro roger and gisèle were so helpful full of knowledge and extremely friendly can ask anything to the staff they will assist you anyway they can you again we will be back beaufils and family,1.0
the place it self is good also old fashioned but the out side view is near to omania sq metro helps alot the printer thing was useful for printing your boarding passes the overall is ok,1.0
the hotel concept is pretty cool but i was left pretty grossed out by a blood stain on the mattress that was simply covered by a white fitted sheet housekeeping put a second fitted sheet over the mattress when i said something but there was still an ick factor that bothered me otherwise the hotel is ideally located if you need to get to or from the schiphol airport minute walk to amsterdam zuid train station then minutes on the train to the airport pretty far from the city center but the tram seems convenient,1.0
my family and i stayed at the hilton diagonal mar on a recent drive from southern spain back to switzerland even though the hotel itself is not in the centre of barcelona it is only a euro taxi ride to all the central attractions several barcelona tour buses pass the hotel the pick up spot is a minute walk away and there is a taxi rank next to the main hotel is luxurious and the rooms spacious the hotel is located just opposite the diagonal mar shopping complex which has a fabulous outdoor food court with a good selection of restaurants there is also a children play area i would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on our next visit to barcelona,1.0
i had been stayed here for two nights location is perfect which located walking distance from central station cleanliness in the room is also perfect regarding quality of service sky lounge f b housekeeping room service and reception staffs goes above and beyond only few staff at reception i am still feeling uncomfortable one female staff by chance i wanted to asking something due to my sickness plus long flight from asia i was difficult to speak loud she told me speak louder as for me if i wish i can speak louder with throats pain overall quality of service was excellent only few staff like this female staff please management watch out and take action accordingly what a waste entirely teams are doing great job besides high occupancy like this most busiest summer season,0.0
the hotel is immpecable with a well equipped and stylish room the staff are very pleasent and helpful the breakfast was excellent with a massive selection of hot and cold foods and a variety of fruit hotel is placed extremely well for access to central station buses trams and canals shopping restaurants bars and red light district all within a short walk is one of the best hotels i have been in and will definatley be the next time we come to amsterdam,1.0
two nights at and service as you expect from a holiday inn walking distance to minutes to city hall and the old is easy to walk in safe and a pint at the crown gin saloon,1.0
ink amsterdam is trying to live up to the new definition of cool in the fierce competition of modern boutique hotels and is successful in being in with too much luggage the ambiance of the hotel once we were inside was an immediate calmer on a so far stressful was personable kind and the room was great value for it price a notch ahead of similar concepts i experienced in other parts of europe from bed to bathroom to power outlets we felt that a lot of smart design and through interiors had gone into the process take for instance the wallpaper which actually gives a pretty good and fun guide to amsterdam and what to expect and experience during the stay moreover the room offered well airconditioned quiet and uninterrupted sleep and the room felt as private as should be expected from a the hotel is built in a way which values its secluded though transparent spaces and we registered that both a birthday was celebrated and business meetings were being held without anyone distrubing one came back several times to the hotel rather than staying out late simply because of the bar and lounge area which added on to the experience the signature ink drink picture as well as the artichokes are recommended breakfast was a bit busy but still worth the additional price,1.0
we have stayed at athens gate several times and always love it the rooms are comfortable and clean with great bedding the best pillows and their customer service is top notch on this past trip we have several stays as we popped in and out of athens while traveling around greece for each stay they had our room keys ready for us on arrival even though they did know exactly when we arrive and warmly welcomed us back they great at helping with transport arrangements too the breakfast can not be beat and it offered in a dining room with a spectacular view of the acropolis right next to plaka and short walk to acropolis so it is a great location for everyone you want to do in athens the only downsides are tiny elevators and limited air conditioning in the central hotel areas though every other small hotel we stayed at were the same also you do get some street noise in the rooms that face the main road but those are minor problems and are countered by an overall excellent experience,1.0
close to railway to access central district clean and comfortable rooms staff very friendly and helpful to service ipromptu needs nice and delicious breakfast quiet area excellent room cleanliness,1.0
we stayed for a night as a family stunning hotel great location there is a less formal if you have kids little pub in the hotel which is fabulous definitely worth a beautiful breakfast is class as was the service,1.0
i spent almost one week at this hotel last april when i was looking for hotel to stay during my holiday i thought that this hotel will be far from downtown but i found many positive reviews regarding the transportation and the hotel services and utilities in general i happy i did book there my experience was great and and i would like to come back again there are two stations near the hotel metro and tram small walking distance also the supermarket is next on the corner where we found everything we needed to eat during our stay the neighborhood is safe and there few nice shops too close to the hotel flower shop bookstore cafes staff in the reception were very friendly and helped us a lot the team who was working in the restaurant during the breakfast time was very nice and used to offer their services in general the location is good for one who want to visit many places as it located on acceptance distance to dam station the airport van gogh diamond and other i did gave is that because there is no small fridge which i think is important in summer also the restaurant only opens for breakfast,1.0
my wife and i stayed here on the tail end of our honeymoon before heading back home we really enjoyed our stay at the stanley it an old and historic hotel that has been well maintained and updated through the years we felt it was very well located with respect to the main touristic highlights and the view of the acropolis from our room was amazing it very well priced and i highly recommend it to someone looking to experience athens,1.0
great location in the center of amsterdam really great staff an amazing breakfast in this small hotel entirely decorated in the art deco style i do recommend to take rooms with canal view much better than the big hotels nearby,1.0

i booked this hotel recently for a trip with my two teenage children it is in a great location however i had a number of problems with my stay which i do think the hotel staff seemed to give enough attention to firstly when i arrived i was told that i had only booked a double room i explained that i had double checked my email and it says triple room and i paid more to which the receptionist pointed to his form and said no it was a double clearly this was not my fault or the receptionists fault but his response was pointless there is obviously an issue between the booking site and the hotel details he did find me a room with a double and single bed and i was grateful as we were all very exhausted from an active i got to the room and ready for bed we discovered a problem with the electrics only one plug in the room worked as it was late i decided to get some sleep and report in the reported the problem to the receptionist on the morning and he advised he would get someone to look at arrived back to the hotel late that evening and i asked the reception staff if he was aware if the plugs had been fixed in my room he did know anything about it and i hoped this was a good sign unfortunately when we got to the room there was no,0.0
well what can i say after an amazing week trip staying in a lovely villa in the mountains of tarragona and traveling the historical coast visiting towns like reus and tortosa the trip was for my fiance birthday and we wanted to end the trip with a short city stay in barcelona we booked one night at this hotel on the last night of our trip our flight was at the next evening and we were drawn by the good reviews and complimentary late check out giving us the opportunity to have a late night out enjoying the nightlife while still being able to rest until before check out we arrived at via taxi after dropping our rental car at the airport we were greeted by the worst arrival i have ever experienced at a supposedly hotel our greeting by mr feran consisted of a very cold reception charging our card on arrival leaving to pay on departure which was the city tax very strange on asking why we were told maybe you are not used to this class of hotel at per night i have stayed in many hotels which demand double or triple this price and we have also stayed in many hotels which were less expensive but much nicer he then proceeded to try to joke around with us that the payment was being made off my fiances card insinuating i was being cheap or needed her to pay for it its a joint american express account,0.0
after reviewing other critiques on trip advisor i decided to stay with my husband for nights at the serras on my first trip to barcelona it a fabulous location facing the waterfront on the edge of the gothic quarter so close to many la rambla la boqueria the picasso museum and the barcelona cathedral just to name a few the rooms are very modern they give you a phone to help you navigate the city streets and leave you a scrumptious treat nightly the restaurant food day or night is fabulous but the real star is the staff they greet you with a smile drink offer of help set up itineraries i want to recognize angela and the daniels x who went above and beyond in this beautiful city i can go on and on just check it out for yourself,1.0

the novotel barcelona city was surprisingly easy to get to by car it has a very good underground car park with large parking spaces this costs but is worth it i think for arrived in the city by so parked up and explored until the evening when we checked in the room was a good size and had a big walk in shower in the bathroom rather than a bath breakfast was a let down it felt like eating in a conference room the choice of food wasn t great so we didn t get great value for the only other comment was that the lift to the underground car park and the car park itself smelt of bad drains and was quite unpleasant,1.0
pay the additional charge for a view of the parthenon on the acropolis from your room each night when i rolled over i could see lights on the parthenon it looked like a painting but it was actually my hotel window worth every penny hmmm the rest of the hotel a little dated but they do a good job keeping it clean and modern bathroom was luxurious with thick towels and strong water pressure breakfast buffet was delicious,1.0
very nice stay would return again the service was wonderful we lost our drink tickets somewhere on way to sagrada familia and they replaced them for us no problem the bed was comfy and bathroom was awesome with a bidet even enjoyed roomservice and it was very affordable,1.0

what a funky hotel if you want ordinary then do stay at the soho but if you want delightful extras such as mood lighting romantic rooms comfortable beds excellent reception staff and a huge superior breakfast using locally sourced fresh produce then book at soho with confidence and the central location tops it off we loved visting barcelona and staying at soho was the cream on the cake,1.0

wonderful breakfast amazing staff very helpful with recomending restaurants and placec to visit the only downside is that the rooms was a little small when staying persons in one room the hotel was close to the tram and metero station taking you directly to central station in centrum,1.0
my wife and i stayed nights at catalonia magdalenes in early april we loved this hotel check in was friendly and informative the room was clean and fresh the breakfast spread was probably the best we have ever had in europe and everything was really good and fresh i really like the snack and drink service offered throughout the day that was a really nice perk the rooftop terrace and pool was also a great plus the location could not be better as we loved being in the gothic quarter when i return to barcelona i will definitely want to stay here again,1.0

i just returned home from an absolutely sensational stay the staff were lovely efficient welcoming and gracious we were upgraded to a phenomenal suite with butler service plenty of space and creative daily snacks the breakfast buffet was wonderful and the location was perfect it was extremely close to the most sites and within a very short walking distance from just about anywhere worth going in amsterdam the courtyard at the front entrance provides an area of tranquility comfort and security i could not possibly recommend this hotel with greater enthusiasm and it is the only hotel that i would consider staying in at my next visit to amsterdam,1.0
this hotel is on the banks of the liffey in dublin financial district the surrounding area is spacious and quiet with many shops places to eat and drink if you take the time to find them the hotel itself is run very professionally with great customer service the rooms are clean spacious and the quality of sleep was excellent with the luas just around the corner and busaras connolly mins walk away it is a great location just off the city center,1.0
the hotel a very nice and central location in the the rooms are very small and are not in the best shape also it quite smelly in the hole place so this is not a standard and not worth the money,0.0
the main positives we experienced the location is of the canal district everything touristy in walking distance radius the canal view room was tastefully decorated and a good size the bed was comfortable the large windows opened to a beautiful view the housekeeping was room was spotlessly cleaned every day the library area was a nice quiet place to have a drink the main negatives came from our first encounters checking in and the subsequent days there have been very good reviews about the staff so it was confusing to us to have such a cool reception the staff was distracted even though there was only one other person at the desk they overlooked us then when they did serve us they were not very hospitable we kindly asked for a recommended barber but were given the name of a hairdresser they thought might do shaves that seemed odd to us they said they would book it and get back to us and did neither my husband researched his own barber and found a good one within min walking distance should they know these things the interactions with the desk staff were disappointing we had lovely service at the four seasons and we thought a smaller boutique hotel would be just as good we wanted that more intimate experience over days and were disappointed the last night there was a female attendant who was warm and helpful while the other younger male attendants continued to stand around looking distracted and,1.0
the location is perfect allowing quick access to explore barcelona located next to the beach lots of terrific restaurants shops and night clubs the gm raul has created a superior team and guest experience elena coordinated every detail of our travel arrangements and gave us lot of ideas before we even arrived to help us plan they were wonderful and made this trip so perfect for us we stayed at club level at the hotel arts a ritz hotel and it was definitely worth the extra cost for starters the club lounge offers panoramic view of the city and relaxing environment that lets you take in the city and beach while being catered to like royalty it is open first thing in the morning until midnight and is staffed with concierge to help with reservations answer questions about the city make a cappuccino keep the amazing endless buffet of food fresh and stocked there is everything you could want to drink from sparkling water to juices to champaign wine and mixed drinks while out an about we would swing by the club for a quick glass of wine or coffee and get some small plates it made our trip more affordable and so easy it was also nice to have a quieter place to get a way from the city for an afternoon break every morning i started my day running on the pedestrian path by the beach you can easily get a good five mile run in along the,1.0

to penthouse suite lap of luxury this is a relatively new hotel with a good spacious hotel layout and modern interiors location in dublin is very good and the setting of the building on herbert park is especially reception staff and breakfast room staff are excellent,1.0
i visited with my wife for just the weekend and we found this hotel good the only problem was that they gave us a room with singles instead of a double we were offered to have the bed changed but since it was only for nights we decided not to go through the is good just walk from the centre plenty of nightclubs and restaurants within mins walk,1.0
my wife is a heat seeking missile for the truly special things in life you know those things that sit at the intersection of great price and fantastic quality it no mean feat then that gran hotel la florida sits among her list of favorite places to stay from to expect a sterling quality of service from everyone the whole staff radiates a sense of pride at their jobs and for the place that they work in they expect to serve you well and they expect that they will be good at do always like dining in the hotel but you should for this hotel the views of barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the barcelona attractions that because the hotel is nestled atop mt tibidabo it overlooks barcelona that means you trade easy access to barcelona hot spots for the view and some particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast an opulent affair spanning all the spreads from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore i particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at la sagrada familia still imposing from a rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable i stayed in parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in gran hotel la florida the turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed our room featured a balcony from which i could check,1.0
lovely hotel in good location staff were very friendly and helpful room was a good size and breakfast good the only negative was the fact that there is no air conditioning in the room and it was very hot once the sun came up in the mornings our room was also very noisy each morning with bin lorries just below we had to have the windows open due to heat,1.0
this hotel is a five minute from the and bus stop which is the only mode of transportation i would recommend from el prat to the city the praktik is located on the rambla de cataluyna and is very central and a bit away from the main rambla and the place de cataluyna where the madding crowds congregate the property is amazing the rooms are great and the service is friendly the only issue we had during this our third stay at this property is that the internet did not work well at all the hotel is also a stones throw from some really amazing restaurants we highly recommend this property,1.0
this hotel is very close to the main train station in amsterdam very conveniently located there is no parking but there are two very close i recommend the center oosterdok which is cheaper than the train station lovely hotel very well decorated very friendly and helpful staff the room was very spacious and bright the bedding was perfect and the bathroom very nice and clean the nespresso coffee machine available for free is a free wifi connection works very price is a bit high but in amsterdam for a quality hotel be aware that you have to pay the price,1.0

my young adult daughter and i stayed here for nights to explore barcelona before a great bike trip with creative then returned for one more night days later and it was like coming home to family the rooms are quiet with great double paned windows we were on the floor facing the street and i am a very poor ear plugs in the street noise was barely audible until am when the mopeds were time to get up and explore this wonderful city by then staff are very professional helpful and go out of their way with their clients treat them with respect and a smile and the staff will reciprocate their manners are much more formal than in north america but please do misunderstand this as being cold that is not the like hot herbal tea before bed so although there is not those facilities in the room very common in europe i went to the front desk staff each night with my tea bag and travel cup and they were more than happy to prepare this for me in their breakfast always felt safe in the neighbourhood and the staff are quick to observe the comings and goings at the front door as far as clients that are water bottles on each floor were a godsend as it was for several of those days,1.0
if only i could take the decor home with me this hotel is lovely rooms were exceptionally clean the decor very modern the breakfast has a great spread and despite the location being in what seemed like a area i did hear a thing from my room location was great in my opinion though i like walking around and exploring the service was good as well nothing over and above but good would recommend,1.0
after reading other reviews we decided that ariel house would be a good place for our night stay upon arrival in ireland it was a bit longer walk into dublin town center than expected about minutes and we are not slow walkers however we enjoyed the stroll on several occasions light outside until pm in june and the quiet stay away from the noise and activity of downtown our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean despite the older bedroom carpet and decor a highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room traditional eggs benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads muffins fruit juice cereals coffee and tea we also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee tea with china cups saucers and mini cake bites there was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at dublin airport we did not use the car while in dublin but did not want to spend time obtaining it before starting our ireland road trip on day there is a steep staircase to reach the front door so do pack light,1.0
my wife and i arrived on july with a child and others off price was supposed to be at reception we were charged on asking why it costed more i was told it was because of the exchange rate doubt that this would have fluctuated by also time i have ever had to pay to park in the hotel car park which cost honestly though the rooms were a bit grubby and dated we we told that we had been upgraded to an executive room as there was construction work going on next door we were grateful of this however if we stayed in an executive room i would want to see the standard room found the staff quite rude in the breakfast in all not a grate experience will not be back,0.0
the minute you walk into the king george you know it going to be a pleasant experience doormen are very friendly and helpful as are the front desk staff coming from the us we needed a room in the morning and kleopatra did everything she could to get us into our room as soon as one came available the rooms are small so if you can try to upgrade to a larger room or suite we did that on our way back through athens the breakfast is a feast the staff so nice and attentive you could ask for better service and they should all be commended for that location stay here when visiting athens,1.0

my daughter and i stayed at this hotel last week and we liked it quite well it was clean the staff friendly and the breakfast was good and we didnt need to stop for a lunch break as breakfast was filling the view was great too we were on the third floor and we saw and heard lots of seagulls and life going by on the millenium and ha penny bridges which were directly opposite the hotel the location was great you could go nearly everywhere on foot as it is very near to nearly all the attractions one negative review for people who tend to have dufficulty sleeping is that there is a pub under the hotel so there is a lot of noise till about in the morning however when one books one is told when booking that there will be noise in the evening till the early hours of the morning so one knows what to expect in our case we both slept well as after a long day of sightseeing shopping and ending the day with a beer or two we were usually tired out all in all we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to be within easy reach of main attractions,1.0

we stayed in this hotel for a scientific meeting in athens the rooms are spacious and well decorated and the breakfast is served in the roofgarden with view to acropolis it is situated in the center so a lot of interesting places could be visited on foot it is not expensive so it is one of the best value hotel in athens,1.0
stayed here with some friends last week what a fun little hotel tucked away yet close to everything rooms are small boutique style but we equipped the bakery first thing in the morning was absolutely fantastic so fun to watch the bakers and pastry chef create as you enjoy eating their creations because of the small size of rooms i can say night stay here would be a great base while exploring barcelona are area would love to come back very soon,1.0
we stayed here for two nights after a seven day drive around ireland i could write a great deal about things that are excellent and very good about this lovely unique hotel but very little about things that went slightly are very efficient and make you feel welcome whether it is the reception bar or catering personnel room was very comfortable and clean with all the normal support for the weary traveller we use the fahrenheit restaurant on both nights and have no complaints but plenty of praise looked after excellently by the staff there plus the food was very is located out of dublin but there are good access routes available by bus or taxi if you do want to or ca drive large car definitely use this hotel again if we are retuning to this area of ireland,1.0
the location of this hotel was brilliant for us there is a square just outside the hotel that does get busy as other reviewers have mentioned but we did find this intrusive and were pleasantly surprised by how clean it was again by the next morning lots of little streets to explore with a wide variety of bars and room was nicely finished in a contemporary if slightly minimalist style the bed was incredibly comfortable and we both slept well there were a few minor niggle points in that there was no fridge iron or tea making facilities within the room in fairness they were not listed within the amenities but we felt the room would have benefited from having them the biggest problem for us was the sliding bathroom door this had obviously been fitted as a space saver which would have been fine except we really struggled to get it to slide across and could get it to move at all after our first day so it possibly needed to be a higher spec this left us a little compromised in terms of bathroom access we did mention this problem at reception but unfortunately it was not resolved for the rest of our did use the ground floor bar or dining room but both looked pleasant the rooftop terrace and pool were lovely for relaxing in the sunshine drinks and snacks were available from downstairs but would have benefited from an order system down to were friendly and,1.0
we booked this hotel last minute literally the day before and were very happy with our one nights stay as it was our anniversary i requested a double bed as opposed to a twin but because they were all taken we were upgraded which was lovely the lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and as we arrived a little early we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room so we could explore amsterdam before our room was ready the hotel is in a great location to explore and was very clean and tidy the room was a good size and the bed very comfy we had breakfast included and there was so much choice from hot to cold food a big choice of juices drinks good coffee and the breads available were beautiful and fresh we loved all the art work in the hotel too we would have no hesitation staying in your hotel and recommending it,1.0
there are two ibis in amsterdam google maps the very helpful well meaning locals were trying to direct us to the wrong one we can laugh about it now but when you been traveling for hrs from australia hauling two suitcases around amsterdam i did see the funny side at the annoying thing is with hindsight all we had to do was to come out of amsterdam central turn right it was only meters you live hotel is fine only negative is the rooms are a bit on the small side but great view of the center we requested a high room as it is a bit noisy below due to traffic stayed there twice have no regrets ate in the restaurant every night the staff in the restaurant were some of the nicest people i have ever met i work in hospitality the food was good recommend the lasagna stay there again,1.0
i would strongly recommend the hotel nh city center amsterdam the receptionists are very kind and welcoming and answer every question with a broad smile the rooms are spacious comfortable and extremely clean great breakfast there is a wide range of food and options and everything is fresh the price is good but the most important thing is amazing location very close to dam square walking distance to any site and we did not need any public transport,1.0
this hotel is at an excellent location both tucked away and close to monastiraki and pretty much everything the staff are also very helpful the rooms are well maintained especially with the beautiful acropolis view the only reason i went for a stars instead of is because of the beds they are quite hard to sleep on and could cause a back ache if they change their mattresses to quality this will be a real hotel,1.0
this was our trip to dublin for my parents and i we were looking for hotels around the same location we stayed last time since it was a zone we were more familiar with and camden hotel stood out because of its location within walking distance from the center of the city noting that dublin it not that big modern look facilities and one of the few that offers family room triple room in our case saving us from having get an extra room the room itself was comfortable and spacious the staff was there are a couple of bars around is right outside but from our room we did hear any loud music or voices so we were disturbed by it a great hotel i would recommend it,1.0
hotel had large rooms with good sized bathrooms there was no but hotel provided fans and the nights were cool for sleeping their web site says they are air conditioning some rooms but when i asked i was told that this is not happening as yet it was unusually warm when we were there was very good and the staff friendly and helpful were only about from some of the downtown sites and they give you a map which is easy to follow,1.0
for what i thought was a budget hotel this was a very nice surprise i dropped my bag off earlier in the day and i was immediately impressed i was expecting an ibis type lobby but this was very plush arriving back to the hotel at having been dragged to club smokey live music and open until by some clients i was greeted by the lovely birte and bart on reception i sure they were only delighted to chat to me for i was in jovial form and when i finally got to my room i was again very surprised it was a very spacious room with a very comfortable bed although considering it was i sure i would have found the ground comfortable and the was exceptional laid out with absolutle no feel that this was a budget hotel it also made the short walk to the rai very easy the next morning considering i may have had a headache i would highly recommend and i will definitely be back from my next trip to the rai,1.0
we visited the terrace bar of the hotel for a drink and for a hotel this nice we were surprised at the aperol spritz specials although you ca see the sunset directly or the plaza cataluña the place is rusticly decorated with wood beams and lots of plants it provided for a nice there not much of a party scene although there is some music in the background at low volume it makes for a nice place to hang out with friends and chit chat over inexpensive drinks,1.0

i stayed at this hotel before but last time it did stick out and i hardly remember my stay this time however it truly amazed me the rooms are very comfortable with soft carpets enough electricity outlets a large safe which will fit your laptop and a giant giant flat screen tv what surprised me however was their call for reusing the towels and promising to plant a tree for every towels reused also if you put a notice on your door that your room does need to be cleaned you receive a bar voucher of euro i would say for dinner there are plenty of nice places in a km range so if the weather is good and you fancy a walk go in the direction of scheldestraat breakfast blew my socks off i felt like i was in a all inclusive there an omelet service a incredible wide choice of meats and cheeses yoghurts and cereals the omelet was better than i ever had with exactly the right amount of cheese and salt the jam is served in eatable cups orange juice is freshly pressed and very important to me coffee cups are real mugs so that you can get a decent cup in one go the restaurant is devised in compartments and therefore does not feel as big as it is and a plus staff is friendly great job novotel i be back,1.0

this hotel was a great find in athens it located in a great area in close proximity to lots of nice bars and restaurants away from many tourist traps the room itself is nice modern and has everything you need in it plus the amazing bed and pillow menu it easy to walk to all the main sights from there and then in the evening enjoy the views from there cosy roof terrace which provides a great vantage point to enjoy a few glasses of their own wine if in athens again we stay here without a doubt,1.0
this was our second time to amsterdam and we decided to stay just outside central amsterdam because it would be cheaper this trip was our honeymoon we loved being here last time so came back when we arrived the staff were very nice and our room was wonderful the bed is really comfy and the little kitchen is great if you want to just stay in one night or have breakfast the hotel is in a great location minutes on the train to amsterdam central i would highly recommend this place if you do mind a small train ride in out of amsterdam and want a small little type of room,1.0
hotel centrally situated although we arrived very early in the morning the reception staff were able to hold our cases pending check in later all staff extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean and our twin room was very spacious i did email prior to arrival for a high floor but unfortunately enddd up on the second floor at the front which was very noisy through the night with people coming and going but you are in a city centre so it can not be helped would highly recommend,1.0
i really love the shelbourne and stay here every time i visit dublin every time i visit it gets better and usual the excellent service starts the second you drive up to the front door bags and car are taken care of with ease allowing you to seamlessly check in my wife and i arrived with a hire car having driven around ireland that week and it needed to be back with avis a couple of hours after our arrival rather than parking the car for us and charging a parking fee the doorman simply offered to leave the car out front for me to pick up later no dramas and made my life easier was easy and they recognised and arranged all of the appropriate amex fine hotels resorts group extras we were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor which was great beds are super comfortable and room amenities are staying at the shelbourne a number of times i had never eaten in the saddle room restaurant the experience was fantastic and i would highly recommend separate review the number bar has become exceptionally busy all day long and so i would recommend getting in there early to avoid disappointment however my favourite has to be the horseshoe bar which is a buzzing secluded bar serving up great beers and lord mayor lounge is always a highlight and my wife and i had a lovely afternoon tea before we had to head off to the airport,1.0
my friends and i stayed at adonis hotel for nights the room was clean and fit of us just fine the staff are all kind and are always attentive the bar upstairs has good drinks and a nice view of the acropolis my only issue there was only one powerpoint for of us which was hard but that is definitely not a deal breaker the location is also perfect minute walk to the acropolis and minutes to heaps of restaurants and market stalls,1.0
pros in my opinion this hotel has the best location in barcelona right in center of placa catalunya which is where many of the public transportation lines converge can easily get on different buses and metro trains right outside the hotel also right next to la rambla which is the main lively street in the city all of the staff were super friendly especially laura who checked us in and out rain shower was amazing one of the best i used in a hotel anywhere aerobus from bcn airport comes right outside the hotel for euros one way just under min ride computer station with free printing available cons wifi was very slow took a while to load websites and pictures toilet area is really small and the door was malfunctioning would get stuck hard to the sliding door also a bit inconvenient that rooms did not include iron and ironing board fridge was a small but this seems standard in europe,1.0
let me start by saying we booked this hotel through a service and had heard wonderful things about it we were disappointed in the reception the manager was not very helpful the main restaurant of this hotel was not open on sundays for guest which was is problem as there were no restaurants close by the lounge though was open and so crowded you could not get a seat but the staff in the lounge especially maria were outstanding the food was good as was the service i do understand how the food could be so good in the lounge but the restaurant was very bland and everything tasted the same no matter what you ordered the room staff left a lot to be desired also the bed was made but that was all they did we stayed here a week but was tempted to change hotels we were book here again,0.0
the hotel is perfectly located to visit athen s main attractions you can easily walk to monastiraki or the acropolis to the syntagma square but also to the national archaeological museum just to mention a few the metro stations at monastiraki and omonia square are just a five away we came back to the hotel for the second time and stayed two nights as the first time our room was clean the staff was very kind and helpful and the roof top terrace with its view to the acropolis is just door of the bathroom could not be closed well and during the night from saturday to sunday it was quite loud outdoors music,1.0
this is our stay here absolutely perfect location and amenities comfortable rooms great bfast buffet awesome lobby bar and great restaurants great staff too highly recommend it a bit pricey but well worth it,1.0
this hotel has a great location and should bar food is average and the service very slow it also is intentioned staff need better customer is my first experience with half a cup of coffee for the price of a full coffee top ups lot of work to is a reason why three sets of tourists walked out service needs serious improvement in this bar there are much better options in dublin,0.0
to start off with this hotel is right in the middle of barcelona and exactly where you want to be the hotel was very beautiful and from the outside very well kept we are a family of four so went with the family room which essentially is paying for two rooms our nightly fee was for this price we had high expectations once in our room we noticed a horrible smell coming from the vents that was definitely something deceased in the ceiling we immediately alerted the front desk and nothing was done therefore all four of us slept in one of the rooms as our kids did sleep in the other because of the smell the next morning i went down to talk to the front desk i was told there were no rooms available to move into therefore i booked a room at the fairmont for the price of this hotel upon check out they magically said let me talk to the manager the manager was very kind and went and acknowledged the state and smell of the room he did offer us an upgraded room but by that time it was too late as we had already booked a different room at the fairmont being told previously told there were no other rooms available we were not offered any type of discount and paid full price for the night we stayed even though we only used one of the two rooms we are currently now at the,0.0
we stayed here the last night of a trip because it is close to connolly station we arrived back in dublin and had an early flight home we booked a family room and it was comfortable two single beds were placed in a room with a double bed the shower in the bathroom sprayed water everywhere as the glass shower door would not stay closed it was a bit messy but as we were there only one night and did not shower until the morning there was no point in hotel has a nice restaurant is close to the train station and red luas line and is within walking distance to the airport bus,1.0
we arrived to early for check in but were able to leave the luggage at the hotel the room was small but clean and well equiped the bed was had our breakast at the panoramic canvas on the floor and it was great and more than you soon volkshotel,1.0
good little boutique hotel set away from hustle of main streets very clean rooms and lovely bathrooms nice touch with free coffee on first floor would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends,1.0
comfy familiar and straightforward front desk was pleasant and helpful rooms and lobby were pleasant and clean maids were prompt and nice beds were comfy towels were big and soft plenty of hot water no in rooms window opens marginally fans available large bar that was under staffed but had great drinks and food bar staff was funny and friendly restaurant buffet breakfast was super with large selection dinner food was great but wait service was horribly forgetful with slow kitchen location is residential takes minutes walking to get to city centre some other sights within walking but most will require no view from rooms but that not what this hotel is about it one that meets all your requirements with good quality and comfort without any particular pizzazz warning lots of tours stay here they were superbly managed by hotel but some travelers do like to stay with roaming herds,1.0
lovely hotel in a wonderful location adjacent to the bullring and plaza espana room very spacious and well equipped with large comfortable bed bathroom a good size with separate toilet and shower over the bath beautiful pool and bar area on the rooftop with fantastic views to the light and fountain nightly show extensive breakfast would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
this hotel has an interesting history and a character of its own the room was clean and comfortable the food for breakfast is good but advise guests to get up and eat early as the tour buses really impact the food options quickly service was always pleasant but also always slow it is a nice location and gives good access to the sights in dublin,1.0
we enjoyed our stay the room was very large by european standards typical size about a mile from the city center it if you up for it or you can take a bus or a taxi very busy on game weekends but it did hinder our agenda,1.0
an old theatre converted for hotel accomodation in central barcelona was a real find on arrival we were offered an upgrade to one of their musical theatre themed roooms westside story lion king les miserable phantom of the opera or selected westside room was decorated with unique theatrical wall paper pictures murals and decor that matched the musical film was great enjoyed our stay the rooftop bar and breakfast room all of which were very good special call out to mohammed who looked after us with evening drinks at the rooftop bar excellent the staff were very welcoming and location of the hotel was excellent close to port vell restaurants and la rambla,1.0
the central location stunning views pleasing breakfast and general comfort made our stay enjoyable front office staff were friendly and helpful we appreciated being able to leave luggage at the hotel prior to booking in and we would return again to this location in amsterdam,1.0
we loved everything about the hotel there was nothing to be a bit unfair to name two of the staff members they were all so good but martin and eric on arrival and check in stood had a fantastic room on the floor the room was larger than we expected and it was really great to have a separate bathroom shower and bath and breakfast was superb and well priced for the buffet full selection of hot and cold breakfasts at bar is so eclectic and very beautifully hour access to the coffee hot chocolate machines in the lobby with biscuits and other snacks is a bonus we did use the nespresso machine in the room hotel is perfectly positioned within easy walking distance to any of the major sites it about m from dam there are numerous good restaurants within to m from the is one of the best hotels we have stayed in we prefer smaller boutique hotels to the larger chains and estherea fits the bill perfectly,1.0
i a picky sydney sider on a budget and was very impressed by the service view and location of this hotel beautiful and friendly staff beautiful view from our room and rooftop pool delicious and wide variety buffet breakfast,1.0
the grand hotel central in barcelona gave us a good experience when visiting the city for only a few days the hotel provides excellent service at almost all levels and i would like to mention ruben as an especially service minded member of the hotel staff rooms are not big but nicely designed clean and really well equipped the bed is very good but the pillows was a bit hard the possibility to choose a softer pillow would be great the terrace on the roof top is nice but a bit small the pool could have been bigger the view from the roof over barcelona is great but the service on the roof top was not as gentle as in the rest of the hotel all in all a good hotel with an excellent location,1.0
a very modern and hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the service was everything was we would definitely recommend this hotel the staff was very helpful in booking tourist tickets,1.0
delightful hotel in a wonderful location near rijksmuseum tram restaurants galore and express bus to the airport room rates seemed high but were comparable to others in amsterdam which are always high especially in single room was quite small with no view but the friend i was traveling with had room also a single but slightly bigger and brighter with a view of the homes across the street so if you booking a single ask for room also lonely planet said something about complementary pastries in the morning but we were offered any were just told that there was a breakfast for overall we were very happy with the hotel facilities super friendly helpful staff cleanliness and location we would hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend,1.0
great hotel every time i stay here i have nothing negative to say the staff are friendly efficient and helpful the beds are so comfortable and room temperature easy to manage it also very clean and well furnished,1.0
first of all the hotel itself is beautiful very classic charming the staff could not be better very warm helpful and efficient that being said our room did not have ac and it was the tiniest room i ever remember staying in morning breakfast was exceptionally good and again great service although not having ac in an unusually warm july was rough the location was good and we really enjoyed our stay and i would recommend the hotel patty patrick and robert were very helpful and really made our stay memorable,1.0
central loation with access to train and bus tons of options around the hotel for restaurants and ten minute walk to popular front desk was excellent pleasant polite and helpful we were walked up to the room by front desk staff coffee tea champagne and light snack available in reception area when you walk in room was clean and cozy with everything you need,1.0
recently stayed at the hotel for nights absolutely great location the hotel feels like a business hotel although it seemed just the opposite by the guests we observed the hotel is very lovely but you feel like you could be anywhere the and concierge area is very confusing when we arrived we were shuttled around to the side for additional area the concierge and other check in area are together but they wear different colored jackets some of the people do both jobs the hallways on the floors were beautiful and well decorated our room was very large but uninteresting the long narrow drain in the shower was blocked and water went all over the floor it was hard to understand how it had just become blocked they did sent maintenance up right away to fix the swimming pool bar area was great but very hard to get a seat beautiful views of city breakfast was very mediocre the area to choose your buffet food was very congested and staff rushing around to refill most of the pastries i saw at nearby places looked much better fruit was constantly empty the only time i observed a good selection was the morning we were leaving at,1.0
the shore is only a few minutes away there is a great deal of food options down the road the staff was really great we really liked the bar the bartender was very nice i will stay here the next time i am in town,1.0
excellent hotel great staff and attentive we were two nights at different times in different rooms and in both cases was great and cleanwe arrived early and received a room in fifteen minutes in both cases did not let us wait call us taxis minutes drive from all attractionthe rabinovits,1.0
we stayed here last week it was amazing a great location as was out of the hustle and bussing of the city but close enough to walk to places took us half hour to walk to la sagrada familia right near the harbour lots of lovely bars and restaurants hotel was very clean staff very attentive and safe in the room if you happen to have your car there is secure underground parking breakfast was amazing so much choice could fault it if you looking for a place to stay i highly recommend would stay here again,1.0
we have just returned from a day stay at the olivia de balmes hotel in barcelona and having travelled many years already to many hotels this one now is considered within our top of best stays ever the hotel is well located to shop to visit tourist attractions restaurants and other things one wants to do in hotel itself is ranked with stars and that correct however its staff is worth stars in the reception restaurant virtually in every department helpful skillful truely friendly and making you feel valued as a guest we can only recommand this hotel to all that plan to visit barcelona and get real value for money and a wonderful again many thanks to all at the olivia balmes hotel,1.0
a good minute walk from train station good location for sightseeing room was clean and reasonable size nice bathroom and well equipped would have benefited from full size mirror in the room was slightly annoyed that the mini bar was not fully stocked on arrival and there was a charge against the room for missing refreshments reception were happy to resolve once reported room service was friendly and food was good,1.0
bad old value for qulaity wold definitely not go there again the staff was jjhghvvnm op b,0.0
i booked this hotel following the reviews on tripdvisor and it is really what i expected position in the rambla but quiet rooms simple but comfortable and clean the one where we stayed was refurbished and also bathroom was new i will sure recommend a stay here special thanks to the reception for their precious and punctual information,1.0
located in a beautiful neighborhood just outside dublin great location loved the medieval decor friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast comfortable rooms that have all the modern conveniences including usb ports,1.0
excellent hotel which is very central to all the shops restaurants and transport fairly priced lovely reception staff got upgraded to superior room with balcony and view recommended mcds close by which is great they have a triple cheeseburger omg,1.0
stayed here recently for one night as i was in town on business great hotel friendly staff bed was perfect great wifi and fantastic location there is also a roof top pool with a bar that had great views of the port,1.0
in terms of value i would give this hotel mainly due to the service the cleanliness and the location the breakfast could be better for the price it is not included in the cost as the selection is minimal however as stated the service was good they offered a special irish dinner and show with the neighbouring my girlfriend even got asked to try irish dancing which she did to her dismay the experience was enjoyable and memorable however more so for me i think it is located in the centre of shops restaurants and attractions and i would definitely recommend getting the euro bus pass as it enabled us to go everywhere for the days we were so much easier than paying for a ticket each time i would also recommend going to the guinness factory and the hotel is very close to this attraction as it is in the centre we assumed it would be noisy however they provide ear plugs to help sleep overall it was a great trip and we enjoyed coming back to this hotel at the end of a busy day,1.0
very nice hotel with good location clean and good design very conformable bad breakfast was reach and very good thanks for frendly staff on reception for all help and advice every day room was cleaned very well,1.0
we spent one night in this lovely hotel from the moment we entered we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome from the wonderful lady on reception her name is roberta and she made us feel as if we were royalty what a lovely person who is an asset to the hotel we got a great room looking out onto abbey street it was furnished beautifully and it was spotlessly clean the whole hotel was so clean we remarked about it to the staff at breakfast too as i dont remember when i stayed in such a clean hotel the breakfast was fabulous and the staff were second to none i cant say enough good things about this gem of a hotel right in the centre of dublin,1.0
its a great hotel so close to the city center lots of light a very nice terrace to have a cup of coffee great staff great coffee shops around it has it all i cant say that is pricey is not you pay a good amount of money and you receive great quality and location i can assure that is a great place to enjoy barcelona,1.0
sorry but this hotel was not good stayed in room which faces over the internal courtyard where park to access the hotel no air con so window needed to be left open to keep room reasonable temperature woken at by delivery lorry which was noisily loaded this is street noise this was directly outside the hotel and appeared to be stuff from the hotel reception told me this was a quiet room when i checked in sorry but they were having a laugh,0.0
the hotel was clean and modern and room was very only complaint would be that there was no air con in our room and as it was facing the main road it was too noisy at night to keep the window staff were very helpful and the location was very good would stay again,1.0
we booked this hotel last minute at a very reasonable price and were pleased with the location it is very close less than minutes walk to the food market where we walked for breakfast each day it is also less than minutes from las rambla and a short walk from the waterfront the nearest metro station is also very close and allowed us to get to park guell very quickly with no train changes and also to several other main sites everything else was walkable the rooms were clean a decent size and had excellent air conditioning facilities the pool on the roof is small but is just what is needed if you fancy a lazy afternoon on a sun lounger staff dealt with a leak in our room which was the fault of those staying about us calmly and quickly so that it did impact on our stay at all would definitely stay here again if i return to barcelona,1.0
we just spent one night here and really enjoyed it found the staff great all round very friendly tapas drinks good quite reasonably priced ate out elsewhere then returned to a fab evening in the bar which was like a nightclub great dj and atmosphere overall really enjoyed ourselves and would hesitate to return at some stage many thanks,1.0
good hotel in a great location in the city people in the reception where very welcoming and helpful we also ate breakfast in the hotel which was very good lot of places to eat and shops around the hotel,1.0
stay in dublin on business frequently have not stayed here before very central and easy to find rooms slightly dated however very comfortable and clean had dinner in their restaurant food and service were fantastic great breakfast and to put the icing on the cake great value for money compared to other big chain hotels would highly recommend will definitely stay there again,1.0
let me start by reflecting on some of the reviews i read about this hotel before booking is a nice quiet hotel that is situated close to the metro which makes it good for exploring the city rooms are a good size and have all the necessary amenities you would look for in a hotel like this however the temp can not be regulated which is frustrating in high heat and wifi in rooms is checked into the hotel late in the night following a trip to the islands we had previously dropped some bags at the hotel before we left for our trip to the islands and found the reception staff to be in was fairly straightforward however it took a few attempts for them to understand we had bags left in the storage went up to our room floor and were instantly hit by the smell of stale smoke we had requested a non smoking room and there was a sign stating non smoking but on the other hand there was a ash try on the table the smell was really bad and when i called down to reception to complain and i was told the room was non smoking and that the hotel was fully booked and nothing else was available i was not happy and asked for someone to come up to the room the male receptionist was not the most helpful but i understood he had nothing else available and accepted that we were stuck,0.0
easy to get to as the aerobus from the airport stops right outside and there are several metro lines at placa espanya so very convenient for getting around within easy walking distance of the national musuem of art and the magic fountain the pool bar on the roof gives excellent views of these montjuic is also close by large room with efficient and quiet air conditioning i kept this on all night as it was too warm without and too noisy to have the windows open no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which i would have liked breakfast is a buffet with a wide selection can get busy at times may be difficult to find a suitable table do use the water provided for tea as it not hot enough use the hot water function on the coffee dispensers several restaurants beware if you are vegetarian as eg the goat cheese pizza comes with ham even though the menu gives no hint of this i sent it back and it was promptly replaced but worth stating if you do eat meat service in the gourmet corner can be slow i did use the other retaurants so ca comment staff very helpful i stayed one night on my own account and thereafter on a group booking and the staff arranged it so i did have to move rooms other members of my group also found the staff helpful if issues arose the hotel looks awful from the outside,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel i am ambassador member and we were upgraded to junior suite the room was available from as we arrived early the staff were very friendly and efficient the public areas are so elegant and comfortable especially the whisky bar and very spacious all the furniture and flower arrangements all so tastefully chosen breakfasts offered plenty of choice including the omelette station the indoor swimming pool was a good size recommend to go after when it tends to be quiet i would say that the room rates are expensive much more so than say frankfurt which is also centrally located this hotel is a fair way out of the city centre a good minutes walk to trinity college otherwise there is a reliable and frequent bus service in to the city,1.0
great hotel good location lovely friendly staff and fab buffet breakfast thank you for making it a pleasant and happy experience the pool was a little small but the cleanliness and maintenance was excellent the room service was excellent with daily cleaning and towels changed,1.0
everipidou street is located very close to monastiraki square the room has all the essencials including air conditioner witch is the more important quality in an athens hostel room in the what we paid the room was very good and i would rent it again and recomend it to someone else who planning an affordable central stay in is very nice and they even carried our bags to our room at when we arrived that was very nice of him and very apreciated,1.0
first of all i would not rate this as four star especially as the pool was closed for alll of our night stay hotel is situated overlooking the sea with beautiful view if you can overlook the busy road which separates hotel from beach rooms and breakfast were fine and the staff extremely helpful especially alexandra on the front desk the best thing about this hotel is if you use it to stay it took us just under an hour to get from our room taxi ride check in and into our stateroom on board maybe we just st had a good run but would definitely recommend it to other cruisers,1.0
becky simone from beach bum vacations recommended and made the arrangements for me to stay at the sir albert hotel the hotel is centrally located and is charming inside with a fireplace in the lobby the bed was superb in comfort the room was also very quiet with no outside noise the staff are very helpful there is also a place to eat across the street that has a must try salad,1.0
no where during the booking process were we told or is there any information to let you know that this hotel has a no alcohol policy there is a minibar in the room but it is empty and does work i would mind this if i had known before i booked so that i could have chosen to stay somewhere else very disappointing,0.0
fabulous in every respect is not hyperbole centrally located across the street from stephen green within walking distance to most central dublin points of interest actually within walking distance to almost everything and a accommodation makes this a top spot in my book the breakfast buffet or menu is a very reasonable option you have the option consider staying in the rooms with balcony overlooking the stephen green they are lovely our internal view of the courtyard is quite nice atypical of most european hotel rooms space is tight although it is just fine,1.0
very nice hotel within easy reach of plenty of bars and restaurants close to dart station and about minutes walk from connolly are well kitted out and comfortable nice coffee machine and mineral water rate did not include breakfast so we went out for brunch plenty of choice little way out of the centre if you are staying for a few days and want to be in the heart of the action however excellent for events at the stadiums nearby,1.0
we had two rooms at the alfred for nights rooms were clean staff friendly and helpful and the location was good located a few blocks from the museums it was an easy walk to transportation the alfred rented bikes which we tried warning be careful riding bikes the people of amsterdam are proficient bike riders and they have it down to an art mopeds bikes cars and pedestrians share the road and for novice bike riders it can be dangerous if we could have stayed longer and got the hang of the rules of the road it would have been better anyway would stay here again there was construction on the road to the side of the hotel but it really did effect us,1.0
very clean and well maintained helpful and welcoming staff great variety of food at breakfast bar well suited for children amazing views from tower executive suite great location in the vicinity of dam square and close to tram and metro stations,1.0
we had two nights here in a junior suite in july and were very impressed with the room the bathroom rituals toiletries the view over the canal and the complimentary mini bar we had sofas and a coffee table as well as a large desk it was extremely spacious robes and slippers were provided and a very comfortable bed it was quite a quirky hotel with i guess slightly dated decor in the room and an odd huge marble landing on our floor which was used for storage of tables however the room was delightful and we loved staying here and would hesitate to stay did eat at the hotel at all so ca comment on any of the restaurant facilities as vip guests i think via our expedia booking we had a voucher for off dinner however my daughter is vegetarian and the options for her were practically non existent so we ate the staff we encountered were charming and professional and very welcoming you can hire bikes from the hotel but we did realise this until too is good as others have said we had a wonderful view and the station is only minutes walk away we would hesitate to stay here again,1.0
this hotel should be investigated by the tourist bureau in athens if one thing made me rethink my affection for greece would be this hotel by its staff anyone that has children should think twice before booking here as you may be find surprises,0.0
hotel de has established a unique identity together offer a array of contemporary arts and classical had a pleasant stay at the penthouse the classic design and the modern design were mixed together and the result was the european modern classic interior design the furniture was not very modern but still comfy it was simple and has less carving on it the amenities were fantastic and so the bed was very comfortable throughout the penthouse carpeted flooring and a big painting on the wall help warm up the interior and white emphasize the clean lines of furnishings a warm earthier color set the tone on the walls of the living room area serving as an upbeat yet interesting background for furnishings in accent colors inspired by the outdoors a balcony with breathtaking the canal views illustrated a historic view of amsterdam sunsetting from this balcony was so relaxing this is what it is like imagining of living classical way in urban society my dinning experience at was perfect and spotless i highly recommend a business lunch at a romantic dinner at hofdstaad brasserie an dining experience offers a wide selection of chef specialities i would suggest to experience an authentic afternoon tea at hèt terrace and to chill out at freddy bar with friends or truly enjoyed everything that the city has to offer benefiting from the hotel perfect location touristic attractions like rijksmuseum and heineken experience are on walking distance i suggest to go for biking in the city,1.0

great building inspirational areas the restaurant lounge and library liked the staircase exhibition telling stories the plants area in the basement are a pleasant surprise overall great place staff is helpful and friendly great to have sparkling water at the free internet throughout the near tram lines line straight to central station and line to rozengracht and leidse plein could not be better for jogging enthusiast the quay along the waterfront provides great opportunity to get some fresh air and to jog over the newly developed ex shipping company islands giving great view to the city near supermarkets to stock up on drinks and snacks etc before exploring the city,1.0

stayed here at the beginning of the summer holidays and we were more than happy with our room floor the king size bed was an actual king size rather than two single beds pushed together and the bed linen was so soft the bathroom was sizeable and had a jacuzzi bath which we did use no locks on the door though which may bother some people the rooms had blackout curtains and the control for the air con was right by the bed and it worked really well the wifi in the room worked but was the best and we did use the tv although it was a big flat screen lg the rooms were really clean and cleaned everyday to a good standard other reviews i read prior to going said you could hear noise from other rooms but we only heard doors slam once our entire stay the reception staff were helpful and spoke good english they gave us a city map and recommended the best metro ticket to buy as well as letting us keep our bags there until we needed to leave hospital clinic metro was about a walk and they gave us good directions the negatives i am going to write about are a bit picky and do have anything to do with the the hotel restaurant is actually a restaurant it a bar so when we were tired from a day exploring and hungry during the hours restaurants were shut we could have a,1.0
we spent two nights at croke park and we were very satisfied with our stay we came about our reservations via a travel agency but they were experienced and knew about this particular hotel we had a great stay with no issues whatsoever,1.0
i stayed in this hotel from until and am so happy i did to summarize rooms are on the small side but tidy rooms have a small balcony breakfast buffet is served on the roof terrace with a great view of the acropolis hotel is located near a church that will wake you up between and am walking distance of all hotspots restaurants stores and sightseeing points great service of personnel overall great experience what i loved most about the hotel next to the location of course was the personnel you are required to leave your key when leaving the hotel so there is always some interaction with the person behind the desk we met three persons and all of them had such great personalities they asked what our plans were for the day and gave some advice on where to go change of the guards that only happens on sunday in syntagma square i got sick on our last day the day of checkout and they arranged for us to stay another two hours in our room and even made us some pineapple which they said would help recovering i am very grateful as i did not see myself walking around the city with degrees when having the flu i will definitely stay in this hotel again when traveling to athens,1.0

when we first arrived we were offered a dark room on the first floor with only one window facing the lobby fortunately we were able to switch to a much better room on the floor the room was very fresh and clean and the bed was very comfortable the only thing missing was a wardrobe to put cloths in nice roof top terrace although the pool is tiny we never tried the breakfast instead instead we chose to eat at some cafes just around the corner great location in the old gothic quarters and very friendly staff,1.0
clontarf castle definitely exceeded our expectations the staff was warm and friendly the rooms were spacious and well kept and the grounds were simply stunning your close enough to enjoy downtown dublin yet also away from the traffic and noise i would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again someday,1.0
rude staff from the very was told off as i was the third person to ask for beds when given a queen hardly appropriate to share with my year old son was then ungraciously switched to a smoking room and when she acknowledged it was indeed a smoking room then tried to blame her colleague for giving me the wrong room to start with could be bother to move a fourth time but room was on a noisy bus to town is a ridiculously infrequent service at stupid times gym was denied my year old as he needed parental supervision not to mention the euros extra when already paying a reasonable sum for an average room then after room was serviced no bath towels were in the room and it took a phone call and several attempts before they finally materialized and then only one at a time and with bad grace i would never stay here again and would certainly not recommend anything about this hotel apart from the rooftop pool but make sure it before pm because then the staff come and almost pull the deck chair out from under you,0.0
we stayed at this hotel this weekend when we arrived we were shocked about how lovely it was and the settings we went to check in and were told that was not available till it was only so we were provided lockers for our luggage and went to the hotel bar this is the reason that i never gave hotel arena stars and in all honesty i near gave only there were of us and we tried to find a able without a reserved sign on and finally managed to get a we asked for food and drinks menus after minutes we still have no menus so went and took some off the surrounding stand then we tried for another minutes to get someones attention to take our drink order put it this way we had been in the bar for over minutes before we had got one drink we even tried to go into the bar area but was told that someone would come and take our order when our drinks did arrive the wine was warm we asked for ice but once again too this point it was around so we decide to check into our rooms my key came first so up i went have too say the room was lovely although very small room it was a twin room and the beds were very close together but for a night stay it was sufficient thankfully we did have much baggage as there would have been much,1.0
my partner and i have recently stayed at his hotel for two nights the hotel room was clean and tidy but was overly large however there was more than enough room for the two of us the bathroom was sparkling and had plenty of towels the staff were great very helpful with any questions we had including allowing us to leave our bags at the desk after we checked out saving us from having to carry them around until we got our bus my only fault with the hotel was how thin the walls were we could clearly hear the people in the room next to us talking walking and opening their wardrobes other than that one issue i would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again,1.0
hotel is nicely appointed and rooms are clean and modern except for the most important detail of them all room has no air conditioning we stopped in at the desk on three separate occasions to complain about how hot the room is and each time was told that it would be fixed only to find out right before bedtime that our room is one of the rooms that actually does not have air conditioning probably my miserable night in a very expensive hotel drenched in sweat and i travel a lot no excuse for letting out a room in summer with no air conditioning while it has a great location and pleasant staff this detail alone makes me put it on the never in summer months list,0.0
this hotel is for you who are looking for a gay hotel in barcelona and a more affordable alternative than the other axel hotel the hotel is stylish and clean and the receptionists are really friendly and helpful there is for sure a gay feel to the hotel although the hotel is a little more laid back than the other axel hotel the roof top is nice but normally not as busy as axel rooftop the hotel is located in the sant antonio area just a minute walk from the gay neighborhood of eixample gaixample,1.0
we were first given a floor room overlooking a construction site from very early morning the noise of construction became so terrible that it was impossible to sleep the climate control also did not work so the room was super hot on reporting the noise problem to the front desk they transferred us to a subzero level room from which one could only see other windows of the hotel above no one pays per night to stay in such a room however the room was quiet and we also got a fan hence we could sleep well the remaining nights the front desk sent us a complementary champagne bottle and the minibar was free if you could manage to get a room overlooking the canal then the stay could be really nice,1.0
i spend several months at a time in amsterdam and have been looking for a spa for mani pedi service this was one of the worst experiences i have encountered the price tag for both exceeded which is fine if the service is the filing and treatment was painful and uneven one foot had cuticle treatment and the other did not i was often asked to hold uncomfortable positions in order for the technician to attempt to file and shape second the polish did not have a base coat or top coat and as a result chipped within days finally the space was not set up for drytime and i felt rushed out the door with no help of gathering my belonging or shoes despite my nails still being wet overall there was nothing pleasant or relaxing about the treatment extremely disappointing given i get better service at a nail salon at half the price,0.0
superbly located away from the hustle and bustle of dublin centre city but only a minute ride from it depending upon which area you want to go to the food in the knights bar is extremely good with great portions and a range of lite fare to hearty dishes the beds are comfortable but pillows are not the most comfortable though both are fine for one night the concierge and front desk are friendly and helpful and were able get us checked into a room before our flight landed at the tv in the room have internet and youtube as well breakfast in fahrenheit provides both full irish and continental fare and is the perfect start to a morning of exploring the only problem found overall was that our door handle was falling off besides that wonderful stay a,1.0

we last stayed at buswell in december of and were curious to see if a change of season and level of tourism would make a difference it did the stay was a good as the first we like the kind of quirky charm of the building and rooms but this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel it is a period place that is modernized but not modern for people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms a picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation you can see that tbuswell is made up of several old buildings joined together and the rooms do line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay not every room is accessible at buswell the location really is ideal the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along kildare street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at stephen green everything in the city center is a few minute walk room was ready when we arrived at about pm and the manager very graciously bought,1.0
it is a nice hotel but it could do with a revamp getting a little run down looking rooms are nice and big shower not great power was good but heat kept altering no shower creaky to open we were unfortunate that there was building going on right across from our room and it started really early in the morning breakfast was nice but could do with staff been more informative a lot of people had to ask for coffee and tea to be told they had to help themselves from a particular area the pot of coffee i got was cold no member of staff enquired at any time if we were ok the meal in the dubliner was nice good price and nice staff not sure if i would stay again but rumour has it that it may not be there for long,1.0
gallery hotel was conveniently located right by diagonal station and a few minutes walk from the casa mila there are a lot of restaurants cafes and supermarkets close by the staff are very welcoming and i especially loved the bed they have at the hotel very soft and comfortable by far the best bed i was on during my one month in europe rooms are not enormous but the bathroom was very spacious the pool i must say was even smaller than the photo looks definitely more for soaking than swimming there are no pool chairs either and just normal seating for the which makes it hard for guests to for a long period of time breakfast was euros so i just opted for the nearby cafes,1.0
i prefer not to be in a cramped noisy hotel in centre of tow i prefer my comforts in a peaceful setting which is a short walk from where i want to go we could walk into any of the interesting areas in minutes lovely clean hotel with great friendly staff tiago in the bar is the man for serving the gin of your choice whilst the rooms are not large they are big enough with great views over the boats in the dock a quiet refuge after a lengthy day touring amsterdam,1.0
hotel cosmos is a hotel which is located quite central in athens the room was basic but clean takes you minutes walking to many main attractions and the metro is min walking from the hotel hotel staff was friendly and welcoming despite the central location the neighborhood of the hotel is not the best especially at night you should take care as streets hardly have lights and you meet strange people apart from this recommendable for a short stay days,1.0
my husband and i stayed at ariel house twice in july and were very pleased the beautifully converted victorian building is conveniently located near restaurants laundry and dart station the bedroom was small but well furnished and we had access to a comfortable drawing room for reading and afternoon tea an ample and varied breakfast with table service was provided in an attractive setting what made this hotel truly outstanding though was the extraordinary concierge service anything we needed from advice to ice for a sprained ankle was immediately provided with courtesy but no fuss i have traveled extensively for five decades ariel house tops every other hotel staff experience,1.0

great hotel cosy nice rooms good amenities just opp tram stop away from the city hustle good facilities provided in the hotel breakfast was expansive and coffee was excellent however things they provided nespresso machine we were so looking forward to a great cup of coffee however the machine did not work on most days it used to swallow the capsules and did work for couple of days despite all our refrigerator in the room and that ok but the can dispensing machine also did not work so had to order cans stuff from room most disappointing issue for us was that the housekeeping cleaning service was quite bad food stains hairs soap scum in bathrooms remained as it is and was never cleaned i had raised a complaint with the front desk and was shocked to see the same stains hairs even on our return it remained that way for all the nites we stayed there such was the quality of housekeeping other than that this hotel is great value for money lovely restaurant called cedars just walking distance from hotel food was excellent there overall a nice place to stay,1.0

stayed here with a group of friends and the first time in west amsterdam near sloterdijk the rooms were nice and clean and beds were comfortable there is making facilities in the room itself which was ok the room has a safe which is free to staff were friendly and welcoming and there were no issues during my is a nice cafe which is situated just over the road from the hotel where you can buy a beer or have some hot food staff are very friendly and the prices are transport links from the hotel are good and go to most places as long as you know the route you need to take to get to wherever you going google maps is a good app to have as you can enter where you want to go and it will help you with which type of transport would be better for you to had the breakfast on the last day in the morning and you pay a set price the food is good and you will find something to your liking there is no limit to how much you can eat in the one sitting so an endless supply of coffee and tea was a plus for would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future,1.0

we stayed in a triple room in late july the hotel is virtually on dam square and you can walk to most places we walked pulling luggage from central station in minutes entrance lobby is large and a bit dramatic we were at side of hotel and had very little street noise room was a good size fan provided not quite powerful enough for the room bathroom nice with range of toiletries reasonable breakfast with a few hot choices such as bacon and scrambled and boiled eggs plus the usual cold meats cheeses cereals etc so good choice although fairly expensive internet searches kept saying that amsterdam was virtually full for our travel dates at euros a night booked directly on hotel website safe and fridge in room too,1.0
if you looking for an aperitif with a good view of the city try this rooftop bar the venue is perfect for taking good pictures and for enjoying the city from a different point of mojito cocktail is quite good and the staff can improve the service but is not too bad,1.0

lovely hotel with helpful staff good selection at breakfast room was almost perfect and fully stocked just on the minute side ask for a room with an outside window the rooftop bar was a great retreat after plodding the streets and also cheaper than local bars,1.0
stayed there for a conference for three nights comfortable rooms and mine even had a view of the acropolis could really fault the hotel facilities and less than minutes walk to the acropolis but the area around the hotel is pretty run down given the hotel itself is so upmarket not helped by the bin strike while we were there and i guess few guests tend to walk out but did feel great,1.0

unique hotel as its a boat but thats were the excitement stops we given a twin room rather than a double room that was requested but did mind as the room were so hot that sleeping separately was an advantage you have to request a fan for a refundable that is not powerful enough but helps to make the room bearable in the heat luckily when we went it was degrees c and not any hotter the rooms are extremely basic no modern amenities at all the tv is small with poor reception the bathroom is what you expect from a boat the shower provides good hot water but is not a traditional shower head and you have to adapt its more of a tap up high reception stuff need customer service training as they are not friendly lack empathy and have a general poor maids were good smiled and cleaned to a good standard wifi was good and had fast speeds the catering staff were always smiling and quick to assist the breakfast was good except they need to replace the toasters took to get slightly brown bread getting to the hotel via the fery shuttle is a highlight and unique experience,0.0
on the plus side bed very comfy room large and for the negatives accessing the hotel by car you have to park underground accessed down an alley way used by drug addicts you can not get directly into the hotel without a room card so have to walk found with all your bags we got lucky as a staff member was in the lift and took us to our room was fine and room itself was ok nothing extra special but the heat hit us immediately and the ac was not yet commissioned windows hardly opened and the noise from gulls and roadworks was unpleasant water scalding hot even on low setting then the shower made an odd scheeching little sleep due to heatexpected better for the price,0.0

stayed in dublin one night had reserved parking which is very safe secure on entering hotel was surprised how large it was although it has kerb appeal from outside its very deceptive as to how large this hotel is staff were very friendly and our room was just superb top floor with surround balcony view not great but it suited us smokers room was very clean spacious,1.0
we stayed here for three days and were very happy with it the staff was awesome the hotel was clean and the food was great what more could you ask for we were central to everything we actually walked to the acropolis in just minutes the thing that really impressed me was the staff they went out of their way to help with anything and everything you needed we had to leave really early in the morning before breakfast was served so they made us a breakfast to take with us without us asking for it very nice touch that the way they were the whole stay there,1.0
service was great buffet was great room was spacious and the staff extremely helpful highly recommend staying here the location is fantastic with numerous restaurants at the front door and a tram stop mere meters from the front door also all for a reasonable price the only slight on the place is the lack of air conditioning but the air conditioning that spills in from the hallways is enough to keep the rooms at a comfortable temperature highly recommend you wo regret it,1.0

whilst the novotel did say it is in central it is out of the central zone for cabs the area surrounding the novotel may have been great in its day but at the moment it is in transition more of the less lovely parts of athens hookers addicts and homeless all harmless but none the less a difficult conversation with the younger members of the family about why these people had no home to go to,1.0

great value hotel with big rooms for it price good continental breakfast the best thing about the hotel is the accessibility it is beside sloterdjik station and it is mins away from amsterdam central and mins away from schipol airport there is a supermarket in the hotel at the entrance great rooms are decent for a budget hotel spacious because we can still open two international long haul luggages on floor and we can still move around no minibar or refrigerator definitely stay here again when i come back,1.0
lot of great restaurants nearby walking distance i prefer the beauty of ireland more than the party areas temple bar hotel room was great the double windows kept street noise quiet and it was nice to have a place that had air conditioning it was humid the hotel has a great location not too close to the party scene but close enough to walk there i only stayed one night and had to leave early so i did get to use all the amenities,1.0
stayed here for nights in august and it was the most beautiful hot weather the location of this hotel is perfect for a first trip to dam as it centrally located so your within walking distance of most tourist spots could have picked a better hotel for my birthday i had requested a smoking room before hand and they delivered had a beautiful view of the canal also was greeted with warm cookies on arrival the sky lounge really must be appreciated all in all i would return,1.0
we stayed at this hotel as part of a group trip that was arranged through my place of work the hotel has a very nice exclusive feel to it owing to the lower number of rooms that you find in more tourist centric hotels this works out great as the hotel never felt crowded while we were there save for one night where the rooftop bar was packed owing to an event timing on our part in no way the fault of the hotel hotel breakfast was very good though they would run out of bacon before i got my shot at it again this was probably more due to bad timing on my part more than a couple of late nights beforehand the only minor gripe i would have is the duration of the pool hours just felt that pm was a bit early to close the pool off especially given the summer heat in barcelona that said a minor issue and in no way did it affect the experience for the rest of the were great and our concierge eri went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of special thanks to him hotel location makes it very well placed for shopping eating drinking or just simply exploring the beautiful city that is barcelona highly recommended to anyone considering visiting barcelona and especially anyone looking for somewhere that wo always be swarmed by tourists,1.0

we stayed just one night in rooms and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful the room was great value about e and having stayed in other hotels in greece that were close in price it was far superior the room was much larger than standard and the decor facilities and cleanliness were top class the location was also really convenient to public transport and to drop off and pick up for tours at short notice i decided to go on a tour on a day when some roads were closed for a state visit the hotel staff very kindly helped source it and in the interest of time the hotel shuttle took me to a convenient meeting place for the tour they also allowed us to check in early which allowed us to see more of athens i only had meals there at an informal restaurent in the hotel ground floor and both were good,1.0

we checked into this hotel at the last minute when we discovered that our other hotel did have and that temperatures were quite warm in july even in the evenings my reasons for stars and not five are the following i called the hotel and reserved the room for an immediate and i was told over the phone that an outside room was ready for our arrival at the bank building however when we arrived we had to wait minutes for our room we were so this seemed like a long time when we got to the room it was an inside room so we went back and they promised us an outside room but said we have to wait another minutes and gave us two drink tickets for the bar the bar was fabulous but after minutes nothing after minutes still nothing so i went to check on it and was told to wait awhile longer after hours we were able to check into a gorgeous king room with a beautiful view they had upgraded us because of the wait which was very nice but still it was a long wait the room itself had a huge comfortable king bed elegantly crisp and soft white sheets motorized blinds a large closet a unique light fixture a coffee machine a large shower stall with excellent soaps and shampoos and was quiet and extremely comfortable after that the service was excellent we loved the rooftop bar and pool as well i,1.0
we recently stayed at this hotel for nights at the start of our europe adults and teenage children in a deluxe family room june it was fantastic reception staff cant be more helpful and friendly our room was a good size for europe it had single beds and a double futon sort of enough space for large bags not large enough to comfortably spend the day in the room but we never planned on doing that large bathroom hotel is located minute walk to las you could find a better location minute walk to a train station and buses the breakfast was wasnt fantastic but good enough to start your day scrambled eggs bacon cereal yoghurt dry meats plenty of options for toast croissants mediterranean options clean dining room with plenty of space we used the pool daily it is quite small but my kids found it better than nothing after a long day of touring it isnt about hip height but enough to refresh and cool down on a hot day they provide towels for a small deposit which you get back when you return the towels there is also a bar service by the pool which is nice at the end of the day wifi worked well for people on devices whilst in the room all the time no noise at will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family,1.0

excellent location and attentive staff the rooftop was nice but it was a little smaller than i expected it was also strange that i could control the temperature of my own unit i had to call in temperature requests but otherwise a pleasant stay,1.0
this hotel is amazing and when i return to amsterdam i will be staying here again first off let talk price this is a star hotel and was euros cheaper than any airbnb i found and more affordable than hotels or hostels within the city center incredible deal staff is wonderful and friendly and the rooms are great the beds are ridiculously comfy my only gripe is the wifi can be finicky but it always worked in the end last thing to note is the location it is about a minute tram ride into the city which truthfully never bothered me as i got to see some lovely parts of amsterdam i had never seen before i love this hotel and i quite sure you will too,1.0
i met a client here for a pub lunch i had the chilli burrito and he had the burger both of them were tasty and the service was prompt and reasonably food was nothing fancy but it was good value for a pub lunch in one of dublin most expensive suburbs,1.0

we stayed here on a couple of occasions attended a wedding and frequented the cellar bar countless times it has never disappointed we stayed once in the old house and once in the garden wing love the old house it character and rooms while the garden wing is modern and spacious if i ever asked to recommend a hotel in dublin it always the merrion excellent rooms excellent service lovely atmosphere am quite partial to their afternoon tea too,1.0
one night spent in dublin on business and in all respects the fitzwilliam hotel met expectations nothing would have been too much trouble to the helpful and friendly team if i had any suggestion for improvement it would be to provide a slightly less exclusive dining experience without the need to spoon cereal into breakfast bowls using silver the arrival experience could be tweaked as the desk is tucked away in the corner of the lobby while a tourist information desk is most prominent in the hotel entrance,1.0
fantastic place fantastic people fantastic rooftop bartender all star place the theme and the deco is really fantastic live the room the headshower really cool rooftop chill place with really fantastic bartender doing super tasty food at great value just at the spot keep on the good work,1.0
we stayed in lots of riu hotels all over the world mainly resort type properties for a couple of weeks this was our first city centre riu plaza hotel for a few old building that obviously had an extensive refurbishment the rooms are well finished with a roomy ensuite this hotel is right in the middle of the action on street and is therefore a great base to explore dublin the writer bar hankers back to a previous age of sophistication and was made complete by a group of guests dressed to attend a great gatsby event it felt very the service is just formal enough to feel a bit special but the friendliness of the staff stops any chance of an added bonus to anyone flying to dublin the express aircoach stops right think this now is our go to hotel in dublin really enjoyed our stay,1.0
stayed for nights with friends for a city break the hotel is in an excellent location very central with plenty of nice bars and restaurants around the staff were very friendly and efficient breakfast was extremely good buffet style with freshly cooked omelette of your choice even a glass of cava if wanted the downside was the size of our bedroom very small but clean and manageable for a short break no view at all the room our friends occupied next door was bigger with a view i would certainly recommend this hotel for a short thoroughly enjoyed amsterdam the city bus tour and canal trip were excellent although we did enjoy beautiful weather which made a lovely change all in all a really enjoyable stay,1.0
stayed in the mercer bcn in bottom line the entire experience was wonderful i ca recommend the hotel enough as a luxury option in the mercer is just inside the gothic quarter with el born about a block away that makes it easy for car access and very convenient for walking both to the historic sights and to more food in born the building is a renovated apartment complex with an old exterior but contemporary interior with elegant guest services staff were extremely solicitous and helpful with setting our itinerary including a great walking tour guide mark and making restaurant recommendations i ca say enough good things about the entire team they were also responsive to email requests in we stayed in the mercer suite which has a very large living room and smallish bedroom the decor in the living room was brilliant bright and airy despite the low light levels you tend to get with the narrow streets in the bario gotic the only complaint i have it bathroom design awkward doors took away usable space and detracted somewhat from the we had a small tapas snack good though not great on arrival and the included breakfast which was excellent,1.0
it was nice hotel located in barcelona and the gentleman at the door in front was very precise and receptionists were okay however before the last moment the hose keeping opened the door without noticed when i was naked i wish it wo happen to the other guests,0.0
my wife and i just checked into this hotel last night what a treat the axel group hotels is apparently for gay men however in their advertisement they say they are hetero friendly and indeed they are great staff great room great service great location etc etc there are a few gay men staying here but plenty of hetero couples like pool on the roof is open hours love it recommend,1.0

i have now been to dublin a few times and stayed in multiple hotels i love the city and have stayed in great locations but this is my favorite and where i will stay from now on first the location is perfect you can still walk to temple bar and grafton for all the main shopping areas and bars but you are in a lovely quiet area with everything still at your fingertips you also have more locals around you than just the tourists that take over temple bar the hotel is beautifully designed and very artistic we had a king room with an entire corner of windows the rooms are also designed very creatively but also very clean and elegant we had a record player with and a vintage speaker with modern technology blue tooth adapters etc at level of it was so loud we are actually going to order one for our own house we have a samsung sound bar but this speaker was so clear and crisp i love the unique art in the rooms with the artists i took pictures and plan on ordering art by them the bathroom was large and clean with a great shower and even heated towel racks a lovely bar and beer garden also a full rooftop restaurant i loved this place it was truly unique without trying too hard ca wait to go back,1.0
this used to be called bewleys hotel and it had been a couple of years since my last visit however the hotel is ideally situated next to the british embassy and for central dublin spacious rooms pleasant helpful staff breakfast was buffet style and plentiful will be back,1.0

staying here at the moment on a busy match day staff in restaurant and lady seating restaurant guests could not be more helpful to us a family with young children i hope management appreciates them other restaurants and hotels in dublin should learn to train their staff in a similar way i would definitely recommend this hotel to families with young children their zoo package is also very good value,1.0
great location within walking distance of just about every place we were interested in visiting in amsterdam city center transportation was near by trams buses train grocery store fast food bars and restaurants were within an easy walk tour office was at end of the pedestrian only street the hotel was located on staff members were helpful with every request i had starting with me sending an email asking for rooms near each other in a quiet location unfortunately my room had a stench that did not go away at first i thought it was food from the previous guest but i was there for nights in retrospect i think it was the when i checked in there was a dirty on the floor thick dust on the tv and no shower cap in the box left in the bathroom the reasons for my rating for cleanliness my sister room was fine lighting was odd in my bathroom as the ceiling light shined downward behind you as you stood at the mirror which made it difficult to see what you were doing as you put your make up on particularly since i wear glasses breakfast was adequate choice of cereals yogurts meats breads beverages bonus pop machine served cans of heineken all in all a pleasant stay,1.0
easy minute bus ride from dublin airport centrally located in city my husband i walked everywhere clean comfortable room bathroom by american standards but typical for a european city we did try the breakfast as we were in out each day of our stay,1.0

as the name suggests art is the theme with many works by dutch artist and musician herman brood it certainly hits you when you enter do be fooled by the star and star rating it is one hotel with the main entrance in the big red building not the grey one next door reception staff were helpful upon checking in though they had assigned us with a double room we wanted a twin room but our booking was for either this was quickly rectified and we were given another the original double room had a view of the street not much to look at the twin room my friend and i settled in had a view of the pool and surrounding green area which was better there was a nespresso machine in each room a fancy coffee machine but very noisy room was clean though like most hotels though i wish the usb plug sockets were near the bed rather than near the tv which worked well and had channels from all over europe the bathroom had a large and powerful shower there is also an electronic to get into central amsterdam by the bus heading east also useful when getting the train from sloterdijk station to wherever bus heading west as it is less crowded than amserdam centraal station and many trains pass through sloterdijk,1.0
this hotel is a member of the leading hotels of the world which is usually a good sign but not here it was nearly impossible to sign into the internet the phones were fancy but not labeled so that i had to call the hotel from a cell phone to order a were supposed to be entitled to special services like early and but in fact our was after pm and we got no early at breakfast we had to order eggs from the waiter we did but they never came there was a bright light shining in the window all night and there were no shades see picture the elevator sometimes failed to stop even with the floor causing the users to trip as they exited i needed to find a space to make a business call after checking out and some of the workers were positively nasty about providing it we could get a drink on the rooftop terrace as it was only for diners we could take advantage of a credit for a similar reason,0.0
i found the roxford lodge to be a good quality place i only stayed one night at the end of my time in ireland the staff was very pleasant and helpful breakfast was good with a variety of options the dining room is not large i went when it opened and it filled up rather i was staying longer i would have liked the location to be closer to the city center it is within walking distance about to minutes depending on where you are going there is a city bus stop right outside the front door and a stop for aircoach the airport one block away bus greystones the location is in a nice neighborhood,1.0
the location is perfect close enough to the busy downtown far enough to have quite the hotel is clean the staff was very helpful and friendly breakfast not included unless you purchase it before hand a five minute walk to the buses tour bus airport bus perfect,1.0
i visited the gibson a few times when in dublin mainly for conferences and events but no experience of actually being a guest at the to get a week here recently and it did disappoint given i stayed in a few dublin hotels over the past year staff are very friendly and welcoming on arrival rooms are very nice and airy you can see where money has been spent and i told further improvements refurb will take place in the foreseeable does show this hotel means business and does forget about its clients to ensure the best surroundings during their the hotel is right near the port and there a lot of development work going on but i did hear any building work during my stay hence the double glazing works distance not a problem as the tram can take you into the city as there the final stop outside the hotel it only a ride to st,1.0
i chose this hotel as a special last night treat to end my holiday from australia a beautiful hotel that is brilliantly located amongst the fresh development of dublin it sophisticated elegant and minimal style was appealing the delux room was lovely and bed very comfortable i would stay here again,1.0
the student hotel at amsterdam city was overall just what we needed at the end of our week backpacking trip we stayed nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with people so we really appreciated the privacy cleanliness and an actual quiet and comfy bed however i do have two criticisms that i believe can be easily fixed firstly our room was never cleaned even though we put up the please clean our room sign not a big deal but just letting you know secondly when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city we accidentally biked all the way to the student hotel amsterdam west when we tried to return the bikes we were sure why our bikes did match the bikes there i checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at my boyfriend and i did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel when i was about to check my email receipt my phone died but we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel we started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when i saw that our bikes said amsterdam city and the other student hotel bikes said amsterdam west this was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place it turns out we were,1.0
we loved casa mimosa comfortable and spacious room with balcony and good selection of tv channels in multiple languages clear wifi friendly staff awesome deck and easy walk to metro things barcelona bathroom was spacious and the bed was great after long days on the go no complaints as our stay was a quick and enjoyable one,1.0
bit grungey but great location great price run by great friendly people i would recommend this place for or days stay just around the corner from great bars and restaurants walking distance to main shopping and main museums and attractions,1.0
we stayed here on our last night in amsterdam because we had a very early train to catch and wanted to be close to the station the check in process was easy no time slot or curfew and the room was clean and modern the staff was friendly and the building was secure they also provided free and very fast wifi the only note in our room there was no bathroom door which we did mind but i know some people might prefer a bit more privacy,1.0
hotel has a really nice atmosphere when you enter the lobby bar area is bustling with people having a good time the rooms are decorated in a unique sort of vintage hotel is really well run some good ideas excellent service and rooms are very you can book a room with a canel view have the lovely reasonably priced breakfast in the restaurant and on one evening enjoy the jazz in the lobby with a cocktail,1.0

this hotel is lacking in atmosphere basic facilities rooms and especially bathrooms in poor condition it an overpriced coach trip stopover in the middle of nowhere i did enjoy my stay here at all,0.0
perfect location very slick breakfast is wonderful and spa is a brilliant bonus pool is open interiors all inspired by and polished great for only super small gripe is that there a chance of feeling a bit clinical,1.0
top place and close to all touristy sightseeing spots staff were well versed with both english and greek and were happy to show us plenty of spots to go and visit and were able to help on getting some bargains,1.0
my daughter and i really enjoyed our stay at the harding it is perfectly located in the christchurch area near many of the attractions you want to see the room was clean and comfortable and the staff thanks johnny was friendly and helpful if you driving the parking lot is nearby at a hotel discounted rate our only regret is that we could stay longer,1.0
i love the london hoxton to meet up with friends this time we met in amsterdam in the lobby with great interior déco the atmosphere is good the staff is very attentive but i miss the extra excellence of the london branch for dutch standards it above par,1.0
hop in the balcony for a good joint even if the rooms are smokers free the balcony allowed fresh air and a good view requested flowers for my fiancee on the bed and it was like i imagined i wanted the best for her and hampshire manor proved me right we had an amazing stay with help at service just excellent the front office was quite polite with meno the tall guy who is indeed very nice and the chinese guy who always smile that how a reception should be but i feel sad that the ladies at the reception were at the hotel level else everything was just right,1.0

hello i rarely write reviews but at this occasion i and my wife have two kids aged and and were travelling with friends to sitges our friends minded our kids for hours so we could go on a getaway to barcelona we booked at this hotel which is the most fancy place we have ever been to the experience was in one word only because this place is ridiculously tasteful and cool but because of the people who work is a roof top bar i must talk about before going further it is insane with a small pool overlooking the whole city and during the day time it is only open for customers of the hotel which makes it super quiet and nice for a lazy read in the back to the real deal there is a guy who fronts the reception of the hotel who is called saúl canal this man is some sort of a super god to us now cause we have seriously never ever been treated so wonderfully as he did when he found out our made our trip in one word amazing he gave us some sort of superstar treatment the whole time a little due to his love of iceland where we come from but also just out of his kind heart i think we will never forget this and all we can think about is we can get back to this heavenly place where the man with the big and generous soul runs,1.0
stayed here in mid june with my daughter for four nights originally she had booked with a friend however plans changed and i decided to go in their place we had done a bit of research so we knew which bus we wanted to be on to get to the hotel number once we arrived at the airport once we got on the bus the incredibly helpful driver looked at her phone and worked out what stop we needed to get off at for us to get the tram to our hotel she shouted to us when we reached the stop this was our first experience of amsterdam friendliness and it did stop there after a short tram journey we got off and we felt at a bit of a loss as our hotel was nowhere to be seen we stopped a passer by and he was able to direct us the walk from the tram stop is around minutes and takes you through houses however once you know where you going it check in was efficient and you must pay a city tax on arrival which was around euros the hotel itself is stunning inside with lots of quirky artwork and the rooms are quite stylish done out in dark wood mini toiletries are provided in the bathroom and there is a kettle with and a free safe which you choose a digital code to use there is a tv however we never used it our break was during,1.0
the hampton by hilton is by all means fair value for money especially for amsterdam the room was very clean the breakfast was good and staff were professional compared to many city breaks and many other hotels i have stayed in europe this is a good hotel however the price is still a little on the pricey side and if you are an avid traveler like me you actually do not spend so much time in the hotel however we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would seriously recommending this hotel to others dependent on their requirements thank you for looking after us,1.0
this hotel has a great location next door to the acropolis museum and a short walk from the entrance to the was small but that is like other european hotels great which is not always found in some rooftop restaurant with the best view of the acropolis and the parthenon and the nighttime view of the new acropolis museum is fantastic great food at good prices and the staff was perfect we ate there three times,1.0
kimpton is one of the best hotel i ever stayed with friendly staffs that gave good recommendation of restaurant reception the room is cool close to shopping good food van gogh and security is good i left my ipad in the hotel and they sent back to me in a week time by the way i stays in singapore will sure to stay there again if i visit amsterdam,1.0
we have been to barcelona numerous times and this might be the best place we have stayed literally right on las ramblas and only a few steps from the mercado de san josé de la boquería plus it right across the street from the metropolitana as if that were not enough it about blocks from the aerobus stop at placa de catalunya the hotel staff was terrific in both spanish english the room was very comfortable the price was right what more can you ask for,1.0
staying in centre of amsterdam make me and family save time of journey and expenses from here we can travel by trains trams boats buses go around city and urban or airport also walking along canal or shopping are easy ways to do hotel have arrangements of services excellent staff with the best bilingual gave fell safe and relax in the meanwhile rooms are no noisy because of its double proofing wall we stayed here one week we will come back here for sure,1.0
super location with a really discreet service from the staff really relaxed and complete breakfast with a great selection fresh food we really enjoyed the few days we spent there and would highly recommend perfect city hotel,1.0
firstly i advise anyone booking the hotel to do it through as my partner and i had know where booked we just were going to see what was available so i searched the different sites when we arrived at the hotel i asked for two nights stay and reception told me no problem that would be plus another for parking i explained about how it was cheaper on so receptionist told me to go book it online i got the to nights bed n breakfast and parking for hotel was very comfortable shower was fantastic i want like that breakfast was brill set you up for the everything was in walking distance we will definitely stay again,1.0
stayed at hotel notting hill or our visit to amsterdam this hotel is beautifully furnished and an excellent location with the central station only a few stops away by tram which stops right outside the hotel the rooms bar dining room are comfortable and pleasant service throughout our stay highly recommended,1.0
they do a great job service is high level and the people are very friendly the breakfast is very good and will suffice for a brunch so all you really need is is located near all the bars and shops so you do have to walk far for shopping food or entertainment,1.0
was very impressed from the moment we pulled up in the shuttle they had someone that greeted us at the curb took our bags in and they checked us into a concierge type of check in room around the way from the main area from there a person explained our room and every detail and susanna made sure that everything worked out for us she made sure that our stay was special i was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful i was able to book this on expedia with my flight and so i believe i got a very good rate i been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and i would say this is been one of the best hotels i been to and it walking distance to everywhere and i especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub if there was just one tiny thing that i would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made real dark strong coffee instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere i would surely stay there again and it made barcelona even nicer oh there was a man at the rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender he was quite arrogant and unfriendly yet marissa was a hostess up there on,1.0
we recently stayed at the novotel amsterdam city the carpet in both our rooms were threadbare and badly stained we had to climb into the bathtub to use the shower and when you have year old parents with you this can be both very difficult and very dangerous there is no fresh milk in the rooms only whitener there are no coffee mugs in the room only paper cups you receive only one bottle of water for two people the most disappointing part was we were charged per night per room as a safety deposit when there is no mini bar or snacks in the room to purchase in the first place we have stayed in other novotel motels around the globe and we have never encountered these issues we will definitely not recommend this hotel,0.0
the hotel is in the centre of the city however very quiet and is in a very prestigious place the sky bar is great with the pool overlooking the sagrada familia staff were great rooms are very clean and comfortable,1.0
the staff are friendly and could help us enough but the breakfast menu was a bit overpriced apart from that it was a lovely hotel it was close to the beach and shops i had a decent night sleep and really enjoyed my stay,1.0
very nice new hotel very nice reception and rooms are very clean i love the way your dont disturb sign is good location i really recommend this hotel for anyone whos visiting amsterdam you can rent a bike from the reception employees are very kind and helpful,1.0
my friend came over to visit from canada and we wanted somewhere central to stay in dublin we got that and so much more from the trinity city hotel starting with a warm welcome the moment you step through the door by the concierge to the friendly receptionists to check you in all staff were friendly and helpful rooms were spotless with beds you had to force yourself to leave i been here twice and look forward to another visit in the future,1.0
i really enjoy the time in meininger it very well organized rooms are very good clean comfortable i always try to find a meininger hostel when i travel i really recommend it it very good one,1.0
there is no other hotel in dublin which provides you with more modern amenities it quiet for sleeping yet he bar downstairs is always buzzing with energy the housekeeping staff is second to none our room was serviced twice daily the beds are incredibly comfortable the area is so unique you can see out your hotel window to the top tech company buildings in the world the bord gais energy theater is practically in the lobby it so researched in dublin for months before our trip i narrowed it down to the merrion the westbury and the marker we visited the westbury and the merrion during our trip for drinks and dinner we are so glad we chose the marker to stay it is out of the busy tourist areas but yet they are still a short walk or cheap cab fare away euro the docklands area is a remarkable sight as well the three tourist buses stop around the corner if you desire that and the buffet breakfast make sure you have a meal at osteria lucio which is about minute walk away casual and delicious meal,1.0
we stayed five nights at the four points we were given room but i wished for a better room more floor space given my hubby platinum status in the end the room was comfortable the bed was great and the linens are nice bathroom was comfortable although the shower around the glass base could use a little scrubbing the breakfast was nice with good food choices i really liked the grilled vegetables the staff is what makes this hotel top notch truly lovely and pleasant ladies and gentlemen the hotel location is good the tram is walking distance a shopping mall called glories and plaça catalunya is not far by poblenou is right there with several restaurants it super safe the beach is about minutes on foot we had room service the first night and the food came super fast and was delicious we appreciated the daily water bottles we also rented a car through the hotel and the process was very simple recommend this hotel,1.0

i like this hotel first of all is everybody friendly the hotell are very clean the receptionist are very respectly people also the people are working in breakfast are verry good person i am really satisfied and when i come back i come in same hotell i love amsterdam also west cord hotell,1.0
i loved the cotton house it is very surprising when you get to a hotel and a doorman opens the cab door and takes care of your luggage and offers you water and sweets while you wait to check in and he asks you about your trip and everyone is so nice and they take care of you and when you get to the room you ca believe your eyes because everything in the room is so gorgeous ans there a room separately for the shower and the bath tub and another one for the toilet and the room is so modern but at the same time you are on a building that has a whole history behind it that how you will feel at the cotton house it so lovely and gorgeous and i out of words,1.0
hotel gaudi was perfect for our first visit to barcelona it literally located steps from las ramblas a main street in the center of the city with lots of shops and restaurants the hotel staff was very accommodating for my brother food allergies which we greatly appreciated they were always available to answer questions and show us places to go on a map the rooms were clean and nice the best part was the rooftop it has comfortable couches a small pool and great views of one of gaudi works and the rest of the city skyline it a great place to watch the sunset and enjoy a glass of sangria,1.0
this is a top location hotel with very nice stuff however the building is old and not well maintained beds are very uncomfortable what is worse is the noise from other rooms the walls are very thin you can hear every word your neighbor is saying we were not able to sleep at all there is also the noise from the underground metro which is every minutes it stops after am though we were on the floor the water pressure was very bad as well it is a challenge to even brush your teeth a fairly good breakfast buffet was included however outside the rooms and the reception area the hotel is not it is too expensive for what the hotel offers overall,0.0
we stayed one night arriving and departing by train the hotel is very close minutes to sants surrounding area is quite pleasant we enjoyed two good meals in nearby street hotel itself looks rather grand we were allocated a rather grand room on floor do know why but the restaurant was a bit too fancy for our needs it lacks a simple cafe in the hotel but there is plenty of choice nearby,1.0
my sister and i spent nights in this perfect hotel in barcelona we had room on the ground floor just off the foyer as it was alongside a park with windows on two walls we thought we would never be able to open the curtains and would have noise problems no this area has the best soundproofing and privacy we could ever want no one could see in we tested it and we could hear anything from outside the room was spacious and beds extremely comfortable bathroom and shower were had the breakfast included and found that we made this our main meal of the day so much variety and you could also have eggs cooked to your liking staff were extremely friendly and hotel reception was also amazing asking if you needed a taxi was your day near the reception is a wonderful bar which serves delicious meals at a very reasonable cost all in all i feel it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in,1.0
we are returning customers time who love this charming place staff always nice and smiling impressive design very tasty perfect location to walk around barcelona few meters away from a cab station or an underground parking easy access to restaurants and a marketplace blocks away we will be back for sure we tried other hotels in barcelona and this one is the best,1.0
hotel less than mins from ramblas not really a swimming pool more like a paddling pool taxi rank outside so easy to get to beach helpful staff except at buffett breakfast would definitely class hotel as star,1.0
great hotel central to all the major tourist destinations we were here for days and the room was clean with enough room for my husband and i the hotel staff were very friendly and were very helpful with all the questions we had the train station is steps away and there were great little restaurants all around we would stay here again,1.0
as the headline says unpleasant personal a dirty feeling in the room a damp and moldy odor were constant in the privacy in the bathroom as the door is like the ones that used in showers and beware of a ridiculous breakfast price that you wont be informed ofthe location is ok though,0.0
my friend and i stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago i booked thorough hours before we stayed the hotel advertises no booking fee on their website but apparently according to one staff member in the print it states that the hotel will put a holding fee on your booking but your card will not be charged when i checked out i paid for our stay that was two weeks ago and the holding fee is still on my account and there is essentially euro in my account i can not access i just wanted to let future guests know as this has been a serious inconvenience for me this last two was fine bed was fine bathroom,0.0
this hotel is probably the best value for the money i have ever been to in all my travels my parents traveling with me could believe the hotel was double the price where else have you been to that offered free drinks and a nightly cheese course for a regular room rate the staff is amazing and the rooms were well appointed my first time in amsterdam wo be my last and we will absolutely stay at the banks next time,1.0
while i was enjoying my vacation in barcelona a friend and i figured to go poolside for our last day we researched this location which is a little outside the city limits upon arrival the staff was very welcoming however we did get out sunbeds the wait staff we all very friendly accommodating and attentive the service time was a little slower yet was to be expected knowing how service is in barcelona the food was quite enjoyable however swallowing the price was less than enjoyable all in all a great day was had would definitely go back,1.0
nice hotel with spacious rooms much larger than usually found in barcelona location is great to go to the beach while still quiet because it is not too close to the hectic city center we checked in late and ariel was great in fact all front desk staff was super friendly and helpful we also enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the morning and the rooftop pool which is a bit small but so cool definitely recommend,1.0
not cheap at nearly for the night i stayed but i loved the hotel it could be hard to find the sign discreetly hidden behind some trees but the staff are terrific and have perfect english the decor is imaginative the aircon was a blessing and there were ingenious touches like having the aircon in the bathroom set to a higher temperature and having a little light by the toilet so you do have to turn on the light if you have a call of nature in the middle of the night it had the most comfortable mattress i ever slept on it was so handy too to have the vending machine right outside my door i liked my private balcony and that the hotel had a the price for the room the price for breakfast and the fact that the crisps in the vending machine are heavy enough to activate the release mechanism of the machine so you have to get someone from reception to rescue them oh and the free wifi was so weak that i turned it off and used my own data,1.0
excellent hotel very good attention rooms centrally located with possibilities to use the metro and bus i recommend the hotel for its services location comfort attention the metro that can be used is the red line and the bus also take you to plaza catalunya,1.0
this was the worst hotel experience i ever had i was hesitant to book in the first place but had issues with my flight and needed a place to stay the hotel offered a off promo on their website which they then did not honor when i explained my booking experience and showed the discount to the hotel staff member at reception he said the discount had already been included but he was able to tell me the full price before discount it was a complete scam he was incredibly unprofessional do stay here the area is also not that great getter off finding a hotel south of the river,0.0
i was a little skeptical about booking the student hotel for my boyfriend and i trip to amsterdam as we not really anymore but i was very wrong first location is great easily accessible by metro seriously so simple and one of the best we used in europe second the reception is inviting and the place itself is a trove of colourful areas to sit lounge and enjoy we loved the pool and tables as well as the photo booth in reception fun ways to pass a little time or cap off a hard day of sightseeing and drinking the staff were great the room itself was really big and the bed very comfortable as well as surprisingly big we really enjoyed our stay at the student hotel including drinks at the pool and all the many things to do in the surrounding area volkshotel has a rooftop and behind the tsh is a long street with some great places to eat overall would recommend and would definitely not hesitate to book again for a return back to amsterdam,1.0
the location is perfect it is very close to grafton street which is much nicer than street area to trinity college is about minute walk and to the templo bar about minute walk although it is so centrally located around the hotel is quiet we were a small group so i get to see different rooms some triple rooms are larger than the others in some room the faucet did not work properly the hair dryer stops every second and you have to wait until it cools down if you can tolerate inconvenience like these this hotel is very comfortable and nice the breakfast is amazing great variety of hot dishes to order service is very friendly if i come to dublin again i would stay here again,1.0
one of the highlights of our stay in barcelona was the beautiful hotel it was in the perfect location for our sightseeing the staff was warm and friendly helping us locate a tour for the same day that we arrived the included full breakfast was absolutely delicious and really made the price seem even more of a great value our room was clean modern and comfortable every detail was excellent and we will most certainly return if we ever have the chance to visit barcelona again,1.0
we had tea time at the westbury it was fabulous elegant and sophisticated great tea selection lovely sandwiches scones and pastries the only thing that threw me off was when the reservations were made we were told there was a dress code and yet we saw people there in shorts and ratty tshirts i not sure why they allowed them in the room dressed like they were pool side i still recommend doing tea time at the westbury and indulging in the surroundings the tea champagne and treats,1.0
i love the hotel it is in a great location the staff is very friendly and helpful and breakfast is included the rooms are small but i think that is expected in amsterdam the beds are comfortable the room was clean and the hotel has an elevator this is a bid help for people with lug gages i say a lot of families there so it is a great place for kids,1.0
i spent a few days here visiting family the hotel is beside a wonderful park so its like being in the countryside even though you are really close to the centre of dublin the food is delicious and the staff are very nice and helpful the rooms are spotlessly clean,1.0
soaking in a jacuzzi with a full view of the acropolis unbeatable blissfully quiet next to the pedestrian alley of the acropolis area no car noise great breakfast with home baked bread and cakes,1.0
i lived in europe and have traveled extensively throughout the continent but had never been to ireland until recently kellys hotel was definitely a great place to stay perfect close to everything and i walked everywhere i was unaffected by the noise from the bar had requested a room in back but i will say that the seagulls were pretty loud early in the morning when it was still dark bed was very comfortable and was easy breakfast very convenient loved that they had an safe but it was a bit small my ipad would fit the shower was small which was an issue for me but larger people might be upset water pressure was in the back was great for noise but horrible for any kind of view kellys should commission an artist to paint something bright and colorful on the concrete wall across from their hotel,1.0
avoid the breakfast box much too simple and plain not worth the money and spend a little extra to get an acropolis view room they small but well appointed and the view up the hill is lovely in the morning my boyfriend and i stayed in a twin room with a view and it was great for our needs it was soundproofed which was sooo nice we slept deeply and did hear any other guests the whole time taking in the view with a cocktail on the rooftop at the end of the day was service and friendly reception all over a great experience,1.0
myself and friends had rooms all spacious comfortable beds and the front desk were great in sorting things out for us we used the pool a lot which was great in the mornings to freshen up we did use the sky bar but it open late and has dj on apparently you can rent bikes cheaply from the hotel but be sure to book in advance as when we tried they had all been booked already,1.0
cons double bed smaller than bathroom could not literally fit people at the same time only two power outlets and shower gel was in individual paquets air conditioning was controlled by the front desk and therefore you can not chnage the temperature as you wish quality of the breakfast is mediocre the room soundproofing is great pros great location minute walk from the nearest metro station which has buses and metros straight to the airport ton of restaurants and shops nearby the view from the breakfast area to the acropolis was great as well,0.0
most of the other star reviews state the exact reason i gave it a instead of a so i wo rehash all of them in short the good nice spacious view of the acropolisclean common tasting breakfast with bad the breakfast area is absolutely chaotic and do nothing to make it pool area is tiny long waits to get a place to prices at the bar are absolutely crazy that why almost no one is in generally unhelpful staff not would stay again,1.0
lovely rooms unusal as the shower is glass and in the middle of the room lovely bar with good selection of gins food very good too shuttle bus to station or minute walk from there you can get into the centre taxi is about each way to town for the shuttle to the airport,1.0
this was perfect from the start reception staff welcoming polite and helpful as were all the staff we came in contact with kudos to the breakfast staff who were a delight and very hard working breakfast buffet was repeatedly supplied with fresh perfectly cooked food and noting the huge number of guests passing through did a far better job than other places we had stayed at on our was surprising as well as a good sign that the general manager murtagh was actually at the desk checking people in helping out her staff and not in some back office room spotless and well the work going on to convert this from the old jury inn like other properties around europe and add a floor which seems to have become protracted we would not have known if it were not for the scaffolding located we will definitely stay here again when we fly back to ireland thanks murtagh,1.0
check in there was a small line at check in however it moved quite quickly we arrived a bit before check in and we were quite delighted when the staff member advised us that our room was ready room we had a standard room that was very nice it was immaculate and very quiet as it faced the inner courtyard it had all of the lovely westin amenities and i loved the extra desk space location this hotel is very centrally located we did not have any problems finding places to eat or things to do it located very close to trinity college which is a great place to check out staff the staff at this hotel are so friendly whenever we be leaving the hotel to explore the city the staff at the door would ask us if we needed any recommendations for places to eat or things to see and i thought this touch was amazing i really felt welcome at this hotel and it has left a lasting impression overall i loved my stay at the westin dublin and will be back on future vacations to dublin,1.0
walk of about ten minutes to red bus good hotel clean and updated wonderful staff was very accommodating and efficientgood location in town for those who like to stroll restaurant is very nice with fresh veggies good food and fast staff,1.0
our room was not ready when we arrived dublin so we went out lunch pubs dinner and more pubs we walked everywherel we did not check in until we over slept and ended up checking out late at reception was very understanding and courteous ask for a room with a view christ church is across the street,1.0
i booked this due to it location and i really happy with my choice my room was on the second floor with the window looking out on to the anna is a nice little hotel is very clean i think it been redecorated recently the walls curtains and bathroom look pretty fresh the beds are comfortable as are the pillows this is really important the shower has great pressure and is easy to adjust the temperature the staff are friendly and helpful the only thing i did like was breakfast i would bother unless you happy with toast or a had a spoonful of yoghurt which tasted artificial and it had beef gelatin in it that a bit also had a bite of an apple it was a nice apple so i ended up buying my breakfast from the local i think if you ca provide a nice breakfast then do bother providing breakfast because half of it will be thrown in the bin anyway other than that everything was fine i would stay here again,1.0
very hip hotel with the best bakery in town downstairs it is buzzing all day the rooms are very well styled would compare to the ace hotel as far a budget boutique with a vibe instead of being stale and bland like most cheaper hotels location is perfect too walk everywhere,1.0
lovely hotel on the very outskirts of amsterdam to walk to town centre very comfy rooms with large soft beds and modern clean bathrooms though ours had a large shower very good restaurant and bar area and a serious amount of art work on all the walls of the hotel quick process and the counter has a lovely water dispenser flavoured with fresh fruit hotel has an outside pool for adults and a shallow area for children i did use it so ca tell how warm the water is on the whole a very nice hotel,1.0
were there from to july and had a great time with the family and especially the dinners at the sky lounge with the scenic view of the acropolis at night is a sight not to be missed i never seen such hospitality of the staff at the sky lounge what love and courtesy they serve is just love to visit athens again and stay here congrats to the team for an outstand no show,1.0
a great place to stay if you have a room on the river the historic vibe is nice if you are not looking for something modern the service attentive and the spa good all in all just about worth the price,1.0
unlike the pictures on their website the room was very very tiny the two twin beds were actually pushed together and with a nightstand on both sides of the beds that was the extent of the width of the room the floor boards in the entire hotel creaked and moaned as you walked across the floor the window opened all of inches with no air conditioning and only a fan to cool down the room we felt like we were sleeping in a sauna it was horrible the shower had no cold water we called to get it checked out twice when they fixed it the second time the water went from scalding to hot and for some reason the cold water from the sink no longer was cold either try brushing your teeth with warm water yuk we tried to spend the entire day sight seeing because we dreaded spending any time in the teeny hot room,0.0
hilton gold member hotel was very helpful prior to arrival i was upgraded nice room great tub which we all took turns enjoying after a long trip if any complaint i think the exec lounge could have a nicer range of food and drink more to choose given the amount of people using facility very nice hotel highly recommend given points and price skybar fabulous view but a bit pricey i would recommend nice hotel great service,1.0
i can not recommend gran hotel la florida enough it is beautifully styled and the staff are fantastic they provided us with a very professional yet personalised service that could not be faulted and truly added to making our stay all the more wonderful with regard to the room it was finished to an very high standard we stayed in room which had beautiful sea views and a balcony the hotel itself is something to behold each room is tastefully decorated and it has an exceptionally relaxing atmosphere the hotel is outside of the city which is exactly what we wanted peace quiet and tranquility with the option to hop on the bus and go into the city when need be the bus is located right beside the hotel and was only taking you directly into the city centre the bus runs every and most attractions are within walking distance from the centre i can not recommend this fabulous hotel enough we had a fantastic time and will be back,1.0
very nice staff great with amazing mojito sunbeds at the rooftop pool tend to be occupied really fast so go early rooms are nice and the hotel serves a good breakfast with times,1.0

returned to dublin for a quick business leisure trip and once again the intercontinental was a great place to stay the hotel is bright airy and spotless and is classy without ever being or uptight the rooms are lovely with great linens and toiletries wifi is good pool is great bar is small but good and the good weather meant we enjoyed drinks outside and the restaurant has recently revamped its breakfast offering which was already really good staff all seem friendly and open huge shout out to the lovely lady who greeted us for breakfast,1.0
great location to be able to get into temple bar and other areas of dublinbar is well stocked and bar team all know what they are doing good service same with the roomsparking is next door but easy to find,1.0
fab hotel as you walk into reception you are struck by the cool air con a relief from the heat and a spa style aroma reception staff are friendly and professional the hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms spacious and the beds very comfortable we did book breakfast initially but were offered it for at checkin a saving of and the breakfasts were well worth it huge buffet style of hot and cold fruit cereal veg meats cheese eggs breads etc catering for special diets also the rooftop pool is small but big enough to cool off in and offers amazing degree views of the city the spa contains a pool with jacuzzi and a steam room there is also a small gym spa treatments are available if you want a little pampering a little expensive but what the hell it only money a great nearby restaurant for dinner is el clot,1.0
stayed nights in august the air conditioning is almost non existent when we phonedthe front desk to complain we were told sir it is very hot outside and that is why the air conditioning does not work well the rooms are very small with ugly decor the room was very noisy you can actually hear people in the next room and especially in the hallway on the plus side the shower was good and the staff was nice small rooftop pool with very few travel quite often and stay in upscale properties and this hotel is not worth the high price that they charge do yourself a favour and avoid this hotel,0.0
i made the booking at athens lotus hotel and mentioned that we will arrive by am from the airport however we arrived and they informed us the hotel full and they can not give us the room until pm we are honeymooners and did sleep since two days arrived the hotel so tired but unfortunately the receptionist was a bit tough and she could show any kind of helpful no sofas or any place to have short nap we were extremely tired so we slept at the chairs at the lobby few people checked out front of our eyes requested to have their rooms but they refused the first day in greece and the first hours in athens was as expected because of them were planning to have some rest and go around the city afternoon but they destroyed everything up for us,0.0
i can not in good faith recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the area our room was dirty the floor was not vacuumed so there was hair all over the floor there were stains on the wall our bathroom was dirty moldy and a moldy shower curtain,0.0
excellent service and staff so helpful will definitely return loved the little treat left in our room for wedding we were unable to go up to rooftop bar as when we arrived back to hotel it had closed which was disappointing,1.0
my boyfriend and i stayed here for nights for a cheap getaway to amsterdam it the cleanest hotel i stayed at and is so easy to get from from central amsterdam took us minutes or less to walk from amstel station the roof top bar is so lovely drinks are abit pricey but the view makes up for it is also excellent they arranged a taxi to the airport for us when leaving very good facilities ca fault it,1.0
this is a beautiful hotel but the rooms were hot and stuffy one window that only opens part way and a cheap fan did not help much they show care in most details but our south facing room was just about unlivable no ice in the rooms the lobby was like a meat locker and even the halls were cooled breakfast was very good but with little sleep almost nothing is good,1.0
the clarence is a beautiful hotel in the heart of temple bar in dublin the staff is very welcoming and attentive there is a lovely restaurant with a wonderful breakfast buffet the octagon bar serves wonderful drinks and is roomy enough to meet up with friends,1.0
you ca recognize the hotel from the street it charming centrally located and the first floor makes you feel like you are in a giant living room the staff is amazing the rooms are great the courtyard is so serene and the artwork is among the best in any hotel in the world,1.0
really enjoyed time at this hotel last week friendly staff always there to help out and recommended local restaurants and places to go we always used the free shuttle bus to go into centre runs from outside the hotel and drops in syntagma square but only a minute walk so hotel is in brilliant location the hotel offers free wifi and has great rooftop pool with amazing view over to acropolis and degree views over the city it is a little small and the pool bar is very expensive though the breakfast was euros so we did have this great stay recommended,1.0
located near to the main saints train station easy five minutes walking distance train journey to and from airport easy at a cost of just over euros tickets available on the day from the machines metro line in the station was that brings you near to all central meeting points in the centre of barcelona bought a ten journey ticket that worked brilliantly very helpful reception staff always spot on with answers clean comfortable room rather small cramped bathroom but adequate great plunge pool just right after a full day sight seeing towels provided excellent sangria from the bar and only a few euros more than elsewhere food menu could be a bit more exciting ok for a snack but main courses not brilliant went in search of staff on a couple of occasions service can be slow on the terrace the kiddies park at the rear does go quiet after ca be heard inside the hotel would recommend this hotel as a clean quiet place in a very very busy city,1.0
location is fantastic the staff are so friendly and helpful the overall appearance and cleanliness of the hotel is very good felt very welcome and safe here our room was cleaned and towels changed daily honestly ca fault palmyra beach thank you so much for a wonderful night stay,1.0
good value for money hotel in a great location rooms were clean and staff friendly nice large walk in shower location was great in between urgell and universitat metro stations aerobus from airport drops off a few blocks from hotel,1.0
the staff was very nice the room corresponded to the description everything was super clean the mattress was excellent the breakfast buffet offers healthy options and even fresh lemon and ginger to add to your tea the location is very good in top of that with plenty of restaurants in the area it outside of the city center which is what i wanted but very easily accessible,1.0
stayed here in may for two nights saturday and sunday check in was quick and efficient and the staff could not be nicer the room on the floor was large with a very deep tub and excellent bathroom nice touch of aromotherapy sprays for the pillows we went for my birthday and was given a small treat of waffles and some chocolates which was very thoughtful left bags in the afternoon until the flight home not in the centre put the train from the aiprort took ten minutes ten mintue walk to the hotel from the zuid station from zuid the number metro took you all the way to the centre excellent option if the centre is too busy or expensive breakfast was shocking at per person per day so we did try this out would recommend,1.0
i stayed here with a friend for nights this summer i have previously stayed at the serras which is also an exceptional hotel nearer the marina but i would say the ohla in eixample is very much in the same league the property service and location are all the hotel is modern clean and the room design excellent the pool on the top floor is also a great never feeling too crowded and again attentive service the concierge assisted us with etc with ease the location is great far enough away from the bottom end of las ramblas but instead situated at the top of the more chic shopping district i would recommend this hotel without exception,1.0
we loved this hotel the staff super friendly the location just perfect in the centre of barcelona the room was perfect king size bed with comfy pillows and crisp linen plus sizeable bathroom the breakfast menu is both continental and hot menu the roof top bar and swimming pool offers great views of the city they also offer a shower facility post check out in the downstairs gym great hotel definitely recommend,1.0
when in athens on business i have resorted to staying at the hilton hotel based on previous amazing to the hilton normally stay at the king george or grande bretagnia being a five star hotel one expects excellent service and good value arrival we where greeted outside by the car concierge well received and a polite really nice guy apologize for not having asked his name a queue on check in however i was promptly checked in my first complaint here is that a hotel of this class should have a dedicated concierge as is the case of other establishments on this level and not have to rely on on checking in staff to do room allocated was away from lifts which was great however it looked tired and slightly worn only one tiny shampoo and conditioner no tooth paste or blade looking in the cupboard no dressing robes this was all disappointing i had to phone twice to house keeping to bring them along with toiletries when i received them thanked the staff with a smile how ever they were sullen and i got the impression they were doing me a favor i had a cup of tea and asked house keeping to replace it with a fresh cup and as i went shopping that day asked if they would remove all the empty boxes and packaging alasnone of the above was done and i just left a positive note got an invitation for a welcome cocktail thank you,1.0
my husband and i ended our trip to spain with fabulous days here perfection in every way the location was a perfect base for exploring the marina opposite las ramblas a short distance away and the entire gothic quarter our junior suite with sea view was a sanctuary to come back to after long hot days exploring and had every amenity you could wish for the sound proofing was amazing no sound from the street below a special mention to the shower my husband is still raving about the design we did eat at the restaurants as i always prefer to get out into the city but we did speak to a couple who had eaten there every night of their stay and they had high praise for it a special mention to daniella at reception she helped us with every request no matter how minor and every lunch and dinner recommendation we were given was spot on overall the service was exceptional i did get the busboys name when we were checking in but he was a joy to interact with for the duration of our stay we travel extensively and always in boutique hotels and i can definitively say for a city hotel this is one of if not the best if you are debating whether or not to stay here stop debating and just go ahead and make the booking,1.0
excellent location clean room good service was excellent and friendly would definitely recommend close to market and many sights i from us and found this hotel one of our best on our vacation overseas,1.0

the hotel is perfectly located to visit athen s main attractions you can easily walk to monastiraki or the acropolis to the syntagma square but also to the national archaeological museum just to mention a few the metro stations at monastiraki and omonia square are just a five away we came back to the hotel for the second time and stayed two nights as the first time our room was clean the staff was very kind and helpful and the roof top terrace with its view to the acropolis is just door of the bathroom could not be closed well and during the night from saturday to sunday it was quite loud outdoors music,1.0
one of those hotels that if you do ask you do get if you do kick up a fuss on check in you will be given the smallest room on the floor as they try to palm it off on some if you do ask for your room to be fully cleaned you return on the night to find last nights mess still in your location is great staff are very friendly as you walk about and the rooms are nicely executed,0.0
we stayed here for a night break with our grandchildren rooms are very very comfortable clean and tidy with loads of space beds were also very comfortable so we slept well we all had breakfasts for mornings during our stay a very wide selection of food on the staff were very polite and helpful only downside is no late check out on rooms so no where to shower if you have a late up,1.0

while the amenities rooms at this hotel are all very good especially the pool and sauna area of the spa the real winner for this hotel is the arrived after a ordeal from sydney where both my son wife had suffered some level of flight sickness etc so we were pretty was also but the reception staff were so polite helpful in sorting out our needs that we felt like we had come there was no room ready they took care of our luggage checked us in so all we had to do was wander back in at midday when they promised they would have a room ready and that is exactly what hotel staff throughout our stay continued this level of good humoured helpfulness made this one of the most pleasant hotels we have ever stayed guys you were great,1.0

everything about our stay was perfect i did read a couple of reviews previous to visiting that were making reference to staff letting them down etc etc where they staying at the same place as me my experience of the staff from the word go was brilliant friendly helpful discreet maybe as this is my first hotel experience in europe i have the blinkers on but the hotel is so clean quiet the level lounge was always clean well stocked and a joy to be in the pool is lovely and as on the floor had a lovely breeze keeping us cool whilst baking in c heat the gratis drinks for level guests only was fantastic barca is a great city and we will definetley go back we both loved this hotel and have already recommended to work colleagues well done melia bareclona,1.0

great hotel looks very well i loved the sofas and big mirrors food was quite tasty and the guinness was perfect rooms were lovely and cosy the shower was great some small little things like loose shower fittings and one of the bedside lights not functioning are keeping this hotel from getting stars other then that it deserves them,1.0
location is good about minutes walk to the beach and close to metro taxi cost us between euros into the city center depending on time of also the hop on hop off tour bus stops minutes down the road which is great to get for sightseeing and costs euros for day tour first impressions of the hotel were good the reception area is large and brightly decorated and very modern reception staff were always very happy and helpful very informative about the local area and transport links we stayed in room no faults really comfy beds air con worked without a hitch plenty of towels available room cleaned every day the only thing i would add would be for more lighting in the room as there is only a few spotlights which was ideal when we were getting ready but we managed okay breakfast was really good so much variety for continental english breakfast choices was average but i was happy to eat croissants and fruit the best thing about this hotel is the decoration make sure you visit every floor to have a look at the different artists it really is fabulous the roof top bar is great too nice food and cocktails with a friendly service the pool is small but okay for a quick dip and plenty of beds to relax and sunbathe on we went thursday sunday and managed to get a bed every day i really enjoyed this hotel and would definitely be returning if,1.0
we were given a large room on the third floor beautiful room with high ceilings nice bedding comfortable chair it overlooked gran via de les corts which is a busy street but is also central so we had a little noise at night but at the same time the location is great for walking to the gothic quarter bathroom was very small though looked great but toilet was wedged in a corner which made it difficult to use and the shower door did close properly so we had to keep the shower pressure low so we did flood the bathroom we reported this to reception and they said they would have the facilities person check it out sink was also narrow so could put razor shaving cream and toothbrush on sink inconvenient but the niceness of the room the lovely terrace with afternoon tea delicious mini sandwiches and pastries made up for it,1.0
this hotel was terrible i requested a quiet room but i was given a room opposite where a music concert was playing until about so i got no sleep on my first night the windows are useless so you can hear everything outside i moved to another room after a lot of discussion for my second night in this room the aircon did work as the window was broken i had to push a chair up against the window to keep it closed so the aircon would work in this room you could hear chairs dragging across the floor in other rooms one of the worst hotel experiences i had,0.0

a lady checked us in who was nice and as we arrived at agreed to let us check in at rather than the usual she left and got another receptionist to take over name was emilio who was comparably less accommodating than the first lady he was very rude and made us feel like we were school children being told off rather than enduring good customer service we asked for adjacent rooms and he said if its available and not that he try he was very dismissive and had a very bad attitude inside the hotel it was clean and the rooms were clean but the shower cream was empty but luckily there was a supermarket where we were able to buy some toiletries as the toilet provided none but tissue paper hence the price we paid for it the room was too hot and the window only opened a few inches there was no other ventilation or air conditioning so had no choice but to sleep in a very warm room we had breakfast at the hotel and considering we had it at and it was not very busy it was a big let down that they had ran out of orange juice but we had no other drink but milk the area was a bit rough and because it was a warm room we had to have the windows open we had to listen to drunken men outside shouting at each other also witnessed one of them urinating,0.0
recently got the chance to stay at this hotel on business for nites food offerings in coffee bar and breakfast were excellent and staff at coffee bar and breakfast were warm welcoming and friendly we will be returning,1.0
the hotel is attached to a disco bar loud music until the nights were warm and there was no the staff not the typical irish hospitality it is centrally located definitely not worth staying worst hotel of our month long trip,0.0
i love this hotel i would definitely stay here again the next time i in barcelona the location was perfect with metro at the doorstep to easily get around the city i also liked the fact that the property is surrounded by many places to eat and shop i would also note that it is very easy to get to and from the airport from the hotel is very easy,1.0
just a single night in a twin room river view room was newly refreshed and a comfortable size for sure the building work needs to be taken into consideration particularly if you have arrived off a transatlantic flight and want some rest as previously mention there is no aircon yet this made it a little uncomfortable during the the best part of this stay was the breakfast certainly in line with or in some cases better than a normal hilton breakfast which is hard to beat would recommend it,1.0
this hotel is just stunning from the impeccable reception and staff to the beautiful sheltered hidden courtyard with suspended seats i loved it all our room was on floor with views of the city and was stylishly simple and luxurious top quality bedding and towels and quirky ornaments i loved the idea of the yoga mat and although i did use it it a really nice amenity we enjoyed the most exquisite food in the bar compliments to the staff in the hotel from reception team to bar staff are just lovely taking time to chat to us yet very efficient and nothing was too much will definitely stop at this hotel again and highly recommend it to all our friends and family when they visit amsterdam,1.0
stayed here for nights on first visit to barcelona situated just off the famous la ramblas promenade and close to subway not exactly inexpensive but rooms were excellent and hotel service good staff very friendly and helpful only downside was the breakfast which at is overpriced for what you get but that seems to be to trend in barcelona hotels rather do take the breakfast and instead go to a taverna or the great food market down the road,1.0
great overnight stay in a classic hotel good amenities and rooms very well furnished to a good standard within walking distance of the main city centre and not far from the very pleasant and helpful breakfast very good choice and tasty,1.0

no surprises here exactly as comfortable hip rooms and a location right in th heart of the front desk staff that went out of their way to explain everything and welcome our daughters,1.0
we had three nights here as part of a group tour the rooms were very outdated with lots of stains and the hotel often smelled like cigarette smoke the in the rooms worked just enough to allow you to sleep but they were not great it actually stopped working in the middle of the night one night but seemed to fix itself we had our breakfasts and dinners here and the food lacked imagination and flavor especially the dinners were very basic and did not stand up to what is available in greece,0.0
very good place in a great the street from a beach min walk to a beach with chairs etc many tavernas and bars just outside connects with all public transport within athens loved was decent and is served in a room with amazing view over the sea,1.0
on a girl s trip to ireland we stayed three nights in kilronan house upon arrival we were invited to sit down with a cup of tea or coffee and cookies vio answered any questions we might have and then showed us to our rooms both rooms were just one flight up with skylights the beds and linens were comfortable and the bathrooms and showers fine the wifi also worked well breakfast was served in a charming dining room each morning we had juice fresh coffee or tea delicious yogurt and fruit and a choice of pancakes omelets or eggs as you liked them we found kilronan house to be in a good location you just have to walk out the front door and make two lefts and you are near stevens green and only a short walk to trinity college book of kells graffton street and museums etc although kilronan house has free parking we found it easier not to have a car in the city it was an easy walk to many fine restaurants and pubs i would recommend kilronan house to friends and family i hope to bring my husband here in the near future,1.0
i was highly satisfied with all over the setting atmosphere and centrally location of the hotel too i would come again service was good and hospitality rooms clean and location of hotel is highly appreciated,1.0
i am baffled at the star reviews of this hotel i only stayed here one night because my airbnb place was not ready until the next day i was shocked when i opened the door and saw a room that only fitted the bed i felt like i was in a cage window opened to the wall on the other side there was nothing in the room they take minimalistic to a whole other level i was thrilled to leave the next morning i think i would cry if i had to spend my whole barcelona stay in that cage of a room,0.0
this hotel is very central and we love the area the staff are all very professional and have been visiting barcelona for the past years and are happy to say that hotel dante has become like a welcome home family from all the staff and management who always go out of their way to make our stay breakfast buffet is outstanding serving a wide and delicious choice to suit all tastes we would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in barcelona,1.0
this hotel had everything you need to make your stay in barcelona enjoyable the staff was friendly knowledgeable and spoke english the roof top pool was perfect the hotel offers free snacks from when i heard that i thought little appetizers but they had sandwiches salads hot foods fruit yogurt and more they were amazing the hotels central location was perfect for walking around,1.0
i am staying at the hotel as i right this review i originally picked this place as the internet is offered for free i have not been able to stay connected to the internet for any length of time my iphone and ipad will not stay connected i called the operator and she stated it was due to high usage in our bathroom i can easily hear the people in the next room over all the rooms are clean we have a boombox in our room for some reason little odd smell when we walk in but after that we ca smell anything there are some great places to eat just outside so that is a plus,0.0
great location on a beautiful wide avenue surrounded by barcelona most iconic buildings the waterfront is within walking distance minutes or a very short taxi ride everything you would expect from this category hotel highly recommended,1.0
great hotel that very close to metro links the staff were very friendly and were happy to give helpful hints recommendations and suggestions would recommend this hotel to any friends who wish to visit,1.0
exactly what it says on the tin the hotel is very pricey so do expect star luxury however it is right in the centre of temple bar so ideal for that the room was to a good standard and always kept clean daily however many improvements could be made but can not complain with the price we it is above a very busy bar i did hear this once during our stay but we were on the floor ideal for those who are planning on spending much time in the hotel and want to be right in the heart of temple bar,1.0
good choice for a city trip in barcelona the rooms are small studios with small kitchen in the living room bedroom and bathroom the reception is in the nearby hesperia tower where we also had the chance to enjoy a small breakfast the day of the departure we did not have the breakfast included it is a great value for money not being so expensive to be a stars downsides are the distance from the city centre around minutes to be in plaça catalunya with the red line and the fact that many services are not included there is the coffee machine but the coffee tabs have to be paid apart swimming pool and other amenities to be paid in addition on the other side it is close to the airport that is perfect when the flight is in the early in all it was a good choice with a good service,1.0
all staff was super helpful and friendly loved the hotel clean modern rooms great room service pool is super nice and great view food was good loved the beds and shower will stay here once back in barcelona,1.0
this is a very good stay which is near to tram station the hotel staff is friendly the rooms are very large and also affordable but its very far from the city which is not an ideal location when you are for a short visit,1.0
my fiance and i spent two nights here the weekend just gone the start of the british summer holidays and had a fabulous time the staff could not be more helpful on and throughout for which we arrived early our room was ready so we left our luggage and when we returned we were pleased to find out it had already been taken to our room rooms are average size and have everything you need bathroom and shower is amazing and toiletries are above average bed was large and very comfy black out blind is a great touch wifi is free and reliable which is always a plus the rest of the hotel is very pretty and well maintained pool and terrace is small but lovely and afternoon nibbles and drinks were very much enjoyed location is also superb walking distance to plaça de catalunya la rambla and many fantastic bars and restaurants in the gothic quarter you can walk to the beach and harbour as we did but it a little further say a min walk however walking through the beautiful alleyways you do mind we ca wait to go back the only negatives i can think of are the noise from the hallway was bothersome at times i think because the hallways are carpeted the noise is amplified although this did not affect my sleep quality but i never have a problem sleeping a lighter sleeper may be woken up also a minuscule detail my coffee cup was,1.0
travel party of my time in ireland my wife second and my year old son first really enjoyed brooks we drove but found the hotel and car park with only a little difficulty front desk and valets were friendly and helpful room was clean we had a queen bed with a twin bed and had plenty of room for the of us bathroom and its amenities were great only complaint was the shower curtain liked to join you as you cleaned yourself included breakfast of buffet and hot breakfast was very good with great selections the hotel is right in the middle of dublin and makes sightseeing very easy we did a with the green bus team and it worked out very well only caution is that while all the stops are visitable you need to buy tickets in advance maybe a day or more for kilmainham gaol easy walking distance from multiple pubs ssg temple bar trinity dublin castle etc we would stay here again,1.0
we loved our trip to barcelona and enjoyed our stay at this classic and beautiful hotel the views from the rooftop was amazing both at day and night the location was perfect the rooms and staff great highly recommend,1.0

we had a lovely stay at the wiechmann hotel we loved the world charm throughout this hotel our rooms were full of antique furniture which made you feel like you were really in historic amsterdam we booked canal view rooms and loved seeing the boats travelling the canals breakfast had an excellent selection to cater for all tastes this is a family run establishment and the staff are so very helpful with everything the hotel is an easy walk to the main tourist loved our stay here we would definitely stay here again,1.0
from start to finish it was brilliant a good location close to the metro and a reasonable walk to the main areas the car park is great as well the staff took care of our case as we arrived early and set off for our exploration of the city we came back later to check in and were taken to the club lounge as we had booked club rooms the staff were fantastic and we enjoyed a drink there with our children and checked in our case was taken to our room while we were there breakfast was great exactly what we needed and was also served in the club lounge there is a new roof top pool which is small but enjoyable with a great view the bar is also nice with a good selection of food we had a late check out so returned here after a trip to camp nou for a drink and some nibbles i would not hesitate to stay here again brilliant,1.0
we stayed at the hotel for nights and were really pleased with the was easy to find a short metro journey from centraal hotel was decorated really colourfully and is very cool both in the lobby and our room there is a retro black and white photo booth in the lobby too and it just to room was clean and spacious the tv included some english television we had a kitchenette in our room too and a small coffee machine there was no cutlery though we had to get plastic spoons from the restaurant downstairs the hairdryer was good a properly sized one and not a travel one that you would normally find in a hotel the toilet paper was that cheaper more tracing paper like stuff room was a bit hot at times and we could seem to adjust the thermostat also we booked a city view room and had a view of another high rise block there is a supermarket across the road a good place to pick up some snacks overall a really good stay and we would return,1.0
one star for the location thats it small very hot room with windows that open only a crack stifling air quality actually you can smell some kind of fume when you walk in the room fans going and i can barely breath very stuffy i had to remove the synthetic comforter and sleep only with the cover was so frigging hot tossed and turn all night barely slept whats worse there is some sort of bottle recycling plant crunching bottles so you have to close the windows to get some sleep not much air coming thru the crack anyway absurd the fridge is even warm it smells like something died in there not could do so much better then this place for less money i stayed at a hotel on abbey street right across the hapenny bridge twice the size and half the price with windows that opened reception has air conditioning its almost a cruel sick checking into an airbnb tomorrow ca wait to gtfoh,0.0
excellent choice of hotel if you want to be in midtown athens located two metro stations to syntagma square main city center you can also walk the min distance if it is not too room lacked space to hang clothes rooms in and floors have been recently renewed air condition worked and front desk excellent more than adequate eggs cheeses cold cuts salads bread coffee book long in advance to get the lowest rate,1.0
spent two nights in this hotel friendly staff very nice structure good size room a little bit far out from the center of dublin but overall it perfect if you want to spend few nights and do want to pay too much,1.0
my friend and i stayed here from july and found the hotel staff very helpful our room was just a comfort one but was very clean and adequate for a base for our sightseeing around another mirror full length would be helpful in the bedroom especially for two ladies trying to put on their makeup the breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed sitting outside on the sunny terrace every roof top terrace bar is great for a relaxing drink in the evening so all in all i we were impressed,1.0
this hotel has it all it is historic yet modern it is beautiful in design and has artwork worthy of a museum the staff is friendly and attentive but not intrusive we discovered no major flaws in the hotel operation the front desk and the rest of the staff were great the restaurants and lounge were wonderful with superb food and great service we would not hesitate to stay at the grand on future visits to amsterdam,1.0
thanks to the very friendly and accommodating staff our first night as a married couple was beautiful and very special they offered a complimentary bottle of wine and upgraded our room leaving us with an pleasant surprise upon our arrival the reason we opted for this hotel in the first place was because we wanted to sleep on a bed that felt like being on cloud nine and so it was we woke up feeling refreshed and had our delicious breakfast enjoying the great view from the loft highly recommended kostis hara,1.0
the pros it is inexpensive and connected to the metro the rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are nice the service was great at the pool and upon check in and check out the desk clerks were helpful we had a hour flight and the room was ready when we arrived so we could rest for a little while the cons the neighborhood is not great the is horrible so plan for that the air conditioning was not great and it was very hot the pool is fantastic but there are not enough lounge chairs and they close at pm which was disappointing this hotel is good enough for a day or two at the most,1.0
we booked the royal penthouse for something special for our trip to amsterdam and it did disappoint i have special needs as i ruptured my achilles tendon just before our trip and i have to wear a moon boot on arrival we were met at the front door and given every assistance the checkin in process was seamless and our suitcases were whisked of to our suit was fantastic i had arranged for the vip black diamond package and there were beautiful red roses and a lovely black diamond encased in glass in a nice presentation box and a bottle of veuve clicquot on ice throughout our stay the staff could do enough for us from ordering taxis fast room service when required suggestions for nice restaurants close by making special cocktails etc would highly recommend the luxury suites in amsterdam if you are looking for something we will certainly return,1.0
easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,0.0
perfect position in the city centre very reasonable rates and on site parking very comfortable room and a comfortable hotel overall had good bar facilities and very nice restaurant free everywhere and the best bit tea and coffee making facilities in all rooms will definitely be back,1.0
loved the hotel beautiful room updated everything and yes it in a good area however even with a map it is very very difficult to walk around without getting lost when the concierge tells you it right around the corner have him highlight it on the map here a view from the room,1.0
stayed for four nights staff was pleasant and helpful stayed in a twin room which was furnished just as pictured room was clean and reasonably quiet only noise was from other guests in the hall on one of the nights location was nice really enjoyed staying in the smithfield square was a bit of a walk to high traffic areas like temple bar grafton etc but completely doable and the location encouraged us to see parts of dublin we might not have ventured to otherwise did not really avail ourselves of many hotel was unclear how paying for breakfast worked so we skipped it and used the fresh market next door which had a coffee bar and fresh grab and go type food as well as full grocery there were good restaurants and bars just in the square and jameson distillery and bar just across the way would definitely stay again,1.0
location is perfect just minutes by bus or stops by metro room was nice with balcony hotel staff friendly and helpful really recommended for everyone the barcelona beach was near only minutes by bus,1.0
it is located in the heart of the tourist district and the door for the entry looks like you are walking into something not so great actually all the rooms are designed by fashion students and are very comfortable and kind of cute breakfast is ok a bit noisy and you have to walk outside of the hotel to the building next door to enter if you have any troubles walking avoid this hotel because the steps are very steep there are elevators of course but they leave you somewhere where you have to climb stairs which are steep and narrow aside from that nice views and welcoming person at the desk,1.0
this is the fourth time i stay at the clarence and yet again the service was great the room spotless and the view over liffey never dissapoints the only thing possible that could be better is the continental breakfast buffet although everything on it is good it could be more substantial,1.0
got upgraded on check in so that was a nice bonus beautiful room a little on the small side but very nice all the same location excellent to see the heart of dublin and staff were so pleasant and helpful a credit to the hotel,1.0
located near the ancient monuments the outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff constandina made our stay special with her recommendations on how to get around the city with her help we saw more than we would have thought possible,1.0

this is a very comfortable very well appointed hotel it is conviently located in the ou zuid district close to vondelpark and walking distance to the busy museum district and the old part of town but far enough away that it is quiet and easy to live in,1.0
this is an ideal place to stay very clean friendly staff little extras and attention to detail leave this hotel high on our must return list though close to the city the noise level is low although there was nothing in the stadium the night we stayed free secure car parking for guests is another hotel prices are rising and this hotel is competitive in its call again,1.0
this place had gotten fine reviews in my home country but i was still surprised how fresh and clean the rooms were this place is in a good location for exploring dublin and is great value for money only complaints would be that there no elevator and that the pillows were a bit too hard for my taste but hey all in all this is a excellent b b highly recommended,1.0
the hotel it located a little far from the city center or plaza cataluña but it really close to the green line of the metro station and about stops to las ramblas there is a very complete supermarket just around the corner the room are renovated and very spacious with mini fridge and cable tv ac works just fine the housekeeper removed the card from the controller and when we arrived at night looking forward for a cool room was hotter than outside breakfast it average very friendly and helpful personal internet is free of charge,1.0
the location of this hotel is enough to make it a perfect stay it in the heart of barcelona and real close to everything the rooms are rather big and clean the breakfast is great for europe wifi is free and it the negative reviews here ignore the fact that it a star hotel the only drawback i can think of are the pillows being too hard but maybe it a local thing,1.0
room was cute cool i stayed in the summer clean and well serviced i loved that i could open the window for fresh air well located easy bike ride to the main tourist area hiring the bike was an added convenience breakfast upstairs was pretty good but an added extra charge and excellent views of amsterdam service was good staff seemed a little cool at first but i suspect that just the dutch way they were actually warm and friendly once you asked or initiated contact and i found them really helpful friendly at the front desk i loved the werkplatz full of people activity and great music i especially loved the pianist who played in the afternoons and even jammed with the soundtrack after his own i was nervous about club music but i was there when events were on and was disturbed in the least the only disappointing thing was no tea or coffee facilities in the room pretty standard ask and makes a big difference if you there for some days overall a very relaxed relaxing fun funky and place to stay,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel it is all very modern and nicely decorated the bathroom was nice and clean and had a huge shower we even got a welcome card and complimentary water when we arrived the staff was helpful and nice throghout we would definitely recomend this hotel to everyone who likes to be close to the city centre but enjoys to have a quiet good night sleep,1.0
the hotel is subtly located inside it brings a welcoming atmosphere and the staff are very very helpful i was needing to print some papers for a presentation and they were very glad to do it for free the business lounge though small is also cozy with a great view of part of the city the person in charge of the lounge she is very courteous with a lovely smile she helps a lot to make you settle comfortably thanks,1.0
we stayed for nights in july to see at croke suited what we wanted mins cab ride from the airport easy walk to town or take the tram or jump in a cab well positioned for croke park or lansdowne rd and very close to the point and the a very modern quirky spacious hotel very well clean and tidy the foyer has a pig and sheep reception staff on check in were very good in fact all the staff were helpful and friendly are flowers to take to your room from the lobby sweets to nibble on and apples on the way to your room and a soundtrack around the hotel all great room was spacious comfortable very large bed and a great bathroom with huge very good all you could want a very minor moan the toaster is not very the balcony to sit out on with a drink in the all like the fact it was a quiet hotel area if you want buzzy it not for you we had had a buzzy weekend in town so it was ideal for us to come back to quiet comfortable see other reviewers have complained about the building works going on well we did hear any disturbances friday or saturday the whole quay area is being regenerated which nothing to do with hotel and is good to see it an up and coming would all stay at the gibson again,1.0
as mentioned this hotel has a great location next to the market gothic quarter la rambla st great dining options and snack bars bus stop was min tops walk to and from airport price is fair and hotel is clean but it did wow me we didnt spend much time in the room so we didnt care about the wow factor staff was friendly but the breakfast was just okay nothing exciting,1.0
we are not picky traveller by any means but we were very disappointed by our stay at hotel piet hein this was our last hotel stay after three weeks of traveling through germany czech republic and the netherlands and it was not what was advertised on their website our positives are that the hotel offered free water in the lobby and that they successfully scheduled a taxi for our early morning trip to the air conditioner was broken during the entire duration of our stay even though multiple staff members told us it would be fixed when we inquired about it on different days we were told that the hotel had been struck by lightning and that someone was coming to fix the ac but this never happened during our five day stay after reading recent reviews on tripadvisor it is clear that this is just a standard lie that they tell hotel guests upon arrival the ventilation in the room was horrible especially on the two warm days we had during our stay even with the window wide open we slept with the window open each night and the security arm on the window was broken which allowed the window to swing completely open due to this we could hear late night conversations in the garden area while we were trying to sleep and cigarette and marijuana smoke would blow into our room when it rained it allowed water to come onto the windowsill on the side of our,0.0
very friendly staff and service room was very clean and comfortable excellent buffet style breakfast and a wide choice of dishes rooftop pool was smaller than it looks in the pictures and the bar snacks a little pricey although the view from the roof was fantastic,1.0
we found this hotel and the staff to be remarkable everyone was very interested in making sure our stay was perfect although they have no ideal spot for automobiles to pull in as a new streetcar line is being put in right in front of their front doors the bell hops doormen and concierge were all present to help with directions and luggage our rooms were not large but adequate and not cramped probably bigger than most european hotels it was odd a chair was placed next to doors that led out to a balcony it was wet and cold and not particularly inviting so we did not try to use the balcony breakfast was included with our tariff and it was extraordinary both buffet and menu service we would recommend this hotel and stay there again,1.0
this hotel was nice enough good location for the tram line and bus route from the airport hotel had decent enough standards what was exceptional though was being greeted by the man kevin what a character great banter and so helpful louise at the bar was also very kind and helpful in summary a good hotel made great by the people who work there,1.0
the best place to go when you in dublin the food is delicious and the service is perfect ca recommend enough great selection of restaurants and bars beautiful patio area with blankets when it cold outside lovely selection of good wine plenty of healthy options in menu fresh pastries provided everyday,1.0
my wife is a heat seeking missile for the truly special things in life you know those things that sit at the intersection of great price and fantastic quality it no mean feat then that gran hotel la florida sits among her list of favorite places to stay from to expect a sterling quality of service from everyone the whole staff radiates a sense of pride at their jobs and for the place that they work in they expect to serve you well and they expect that they will be good at do always like dining in the hotel but you should for this hotel the views of barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the barcelona attractions that because the hotel is nestled atop mt tibidabo it overlooks barcelona that means you trade easy access to barcelona hot spots for the view and some particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast an opulent affair spanning all the spreads from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore i particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at la sagrada familia still imposing from a rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable i stayed in parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in gran hotel la florida the turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed our room featured a balcony from which i could check,1.0

the location was a bit out of the way of the centre it took us about half an hour to walk in however just outside the hotels is a tram stop which takes you into the centre in about minutes it was close to any restaurants so you would have to go into the room was lovely it was very clean and comfortable we stayed over the new year and we did have any issue with noise,1.0

the monument hotel in barcelona is situated in a fantastic part of barcelona away from the hustle of la rambla yet walking distance to many major attractions of gaudi buildings are a block away and the bus stops a block away the hotel itself is well equiped with excellent jo malone amenities and a generous mini bar which should get replenished everyday as part of the offering of complimentary soft drinks juice water and snacks unfortunately this didnt happen with many items not being replenished each day in either of our families rooms its these little details that can let them down breakfast at the hotel while service is slow is excellent the quality of the food is high and the variety is large having breakfast cooked fresh for you is a nice touch along with the platter that is provided when you arrive which includes fresh ham cheese and pastries the room configuration we had was a little unusual as there is small lounge attached to the bedroom which is dark and something you would struggle to utilise room another issue with this room is that the metro train service runs directly under the hotel and every minutes you can hear and feel the vibrations in the room very difficult to sleep as the metro runs from to approx but to give the hotel credit they moved us to another room on a higher floor which was superior to our original room and thus very generous of them its,1.0
my family and i stayed at this hotel for nights we throughly enjoyed our stay and would return again we had the family room on the ground floor which was really well arranged to maximise space only drawback was that it was quite noisy later in the evening staff were excellent good value for money in a great location,1.0
excellent professional and friendly quality service food and terrace with swimming pool and wide variety of food to eat any would definitely stay there next time visiting barcelona,1.0
very nice and welcoming hotel excellent service and very very kind stuff i been here now the second time and would go here anytime again too located in the heart of athens just a bit far from the airport nice roof terrace with a pool good breakfast with everything you can ask for again i stayed in many hotels but the stuff here is very very professional are big and clean,1.0
we stayed here for days to explore the beaches the sights in athens the parthenon etc the flea markets the food it was all fantastic the hotels location is perfect the tram is literally a min walk away and takes you to the centre of athens the hotel itself is lovely spacious rooms beautiful pool the food at the pool bar is good but for us it was the staff namely alex marios mary and giannus who could not have done more for us from directions to beach recommendations they were so helpful and will definitely be visiting this hotel again,1.0
noise from other room is so big that i could sleep well every some water that where it came from are all around my shoes so my new shoes from barcelona became wet two things above was bad but other things about the hotel was good,0.0
stayed at this gorgeous boutique hotel in temple bar dublin extremely helpful and friendly staff each time we went to reception they would ask if we were ok for directions to anywhere and very helpful for tourist information very convenient location to the night life in the temple bar area beautiful room although the mattresses could do with an upgrade as they were a bit uncomfortable but that was the only thing to find fault with in this lovely hotel very clean and modern decor and attached to oscars bar which was also lovely,1.0
super nice hotel with restaurant roof top pool in a great location walkable to all if you like walking great accommodating staff but the room was not super clean there were dust bunnies not a big deal it was a very enjoyable stay although i was too fond of the set up separate bath room and shower but did have much privacy my friend stayed with me for nights out of the nights i reserved was a bit awkward our room had twin beds not sure how the bigger rooms are configured the value was great though i would stay again if i were traveling solo the whole time,1.0
at arrival we got some confused information that the first night our booking had been changed to a nearby hotel if we accepted these changes we were promised a compensation for this inconvenience the hotel also assured us that everything was taken care of no need for payment etc at the spare hotel despite the assurance from sansi diputació we were requested to pay at check out from the spare hotel both for the stay and the breakfast both already payed for at return to sansi diputació no one had any knowledge about the the discussions additional transport etc took significant amount of time and energy despite repeated contact from both our side and the hotel has not responded or given any additional explanations or apologies and we never saw any breakfast that you can add to your stay is not worth the money save this and buy your breakfast at some nearby café also recommend to avoid this hotel due to the customer treatment,0.0
the casa hotel is a really good hotel in the south of amsterdam city the rooms are modern and the beds are comfortable the staff in freindly and parking is affordable if you wan na go to town you can take the tram or the metro which are both very close to the hotel we would love to come back and spend a bit more than just one night at casa,1.0
the central hotel is in an amazing location right in the heart of temple bar area and super close to all the amazing bars and shopping areas it minutes dander to the nearest tram stop jervis making it so easy to get anywhere in the city there is a bit of noise from the street at night but that really all you can expect from being so centrally located the hotel is a bit old fashioned if that means anything to you but it clean and the staff are all lovely i do think the look of the place really matters anyway a hotel is a place to sleep and especially in dublin where there is so much to explore i was certainly not worried about the décor it an incredible price for the city especially when you consider the spectacular location and i would recommend it to anyone,1.0
excellent location friendly and helpful staff the room was luxurious and the afternoon chocolate was a lovely treat pool and roof terrace were hidden treasures that we thoroughly enjoyed would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning on my next visit to barcelona,1.0
wow the location could be better right near the acropolis about from the entrance lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel itself is suit old and dated and could do with a refurbish bieber it is clean and adequate the staff are what make it they are so friendly and helpful and nothing is s problem we also were able to store our luggage there whilst visiting the islands the breakfast was amazing,1.0
we had a family of us three night visit to amsterdam we arrived early and the staff were great checking us in with no problem even though were were hrs early throughout the stay the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble there is a pleasant bar area and the drinks prices are reasonable for hotel is just from the bijlmer arena station with trains from schilpol taking minutes and an excellent metro into rooms were standard clean and comfortable and the air conditioning worked well and was quite the breakfast was a buffet and i think that they provide just about everything you could ask had flights late in the afternoon and the hotel provided free secure storage for our you for a really great stay,1.0
stayed for nights in july at the start of our trip and could have asked for a better hotel to start off with the hotel is in the perfect location right in the centre of athens the rooms are very modern and spacious staff are incredibly helpful and attentive not to mention amazing views from the rooftop restaurant where breakfast is recommend staying at this hotel while in athens and i will certainly be back,1.0
this hotel is in the temple bar district i was disappointed with the price of the hotel and the size of the rooms when we first got there i was given an room that was already occupied than was given a room that was so small you could hardly move in it is in the temple bar district it was very noisy at night until am due to the night club in the hotel and clubs on the street the breakfast in the morning was wonderful i would recommend this hotel for the young at heart,0.0
the junior suite was spacious the pillows confortable the three of us slept very well the bed and the sofa were large and confortable i like having an espresso machine in the room and there was also free bottled water go for the breakfast good,1.0
the hotel is in a perfect spot from the airport with a train that cost around euros with metro to the city centre of amsterdam which is cheap as well hotel is one of the cheapest in the city in a star range it is clean and i know something about it because i work on housekeeping in a hotel my self i am defenenetly going to stay there if i come back to amsterdam highly recommend no more no less one of the receptionist looks like mammed khalidow by the way xd,1.0
the food was very continental and there was no attempt to provide food to the largest population segment in the world asia and china and the middle east the kitchen was ill equipped for turning up even basic food say rice and lentils or curried veggies the bangladeshi cook paritosh served thai condiments and passed it as indian curry asians are big spenders so take care of them and the vegetarians second kindly drop the euro service charge for sending anything to rooms,1.0
coming to dublin for a gig our main priority was a hotel near to croke park hence the dublin room was probably but that was the only downside everything else was were upgraded to a family room on arrival so the room was spacious and very comfortable good amenities and an excellent night sleep with a good shower in the morning that most of what we look for in a hotel room straight next morning was great ok so that not unusual in ireland but still exactly what we wanted after a big night at the sets the skylon apart though is the team and their service they claim to be and that just what it feels like really welcoming friendly and professional with a bigger hotels could learn how to do it from the skylon came for a great show we be back at the skylon next time we in dublin whatever the excuse,1.0
we had a lovely day stay at dublin jury inn christchurch my boyfriend and i wanted to book a nice trip away for new year to have a special closure for and beginning for hotel is very if you do mind a little the hotel is within walking distance of the temple bar street with the famous temple bar guinness storehouse kilmainham goal penny bridge etc the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything you to my opinion they offer real comfort with an ironing service we had a room with a view towards the christenchurch which was a big pro only thing i missed was a little mini bar i do want to point out that most hotels who provide breakfast have a small offer but here it was a big breakfast with a lot of variety and normally i do speak very highly about breakfast because i do love my breakfast and it not easily to please me with that but this one just ticked all the boxes everything is also very clean and hygienic furthermore i also would definitely recommend to visit bar and elephant castle restaurant bar is a perfect typical irish pub with live typical irish dancing and they have a food buffet bar with great food and a variety of beers available i had the best chicken wings at elephant castle ever never ever did i have such good wings try them both out i ca stress enough about,1.0
i have been travelling several times to barcelona for work and stayed at the ohla eixample hotel the rooms are nicely decorated bright clean and provide everything needed for a comfortable stay like daily changed water bottles bathroom accessories service is exceptional and welcoming providing a nice environment when working abroad the level of service is important to me due to the numerous business trips the hotel offers as well two bars and a restaurant with tasty food or even an alternative working spot for long working days the common areas as the gym and outdoor pool enable all needed facilities under one really recommend this hotel and lloking forward to continue being its guest,1.0
the first thing to get out of the way here is location its on a square that also includes the basilica santa maria del mar if you are the sort of person who prefers to have a hotel close to all the action this is a great choice less than a minute from la rambla the lanes adjoining the hotel in the gothic quarter are fascinating and even after a week in the hotel we left feeling we not done all of them justice it very close to several metro lines i was attending the barcelona rock festival at can zam the other end of town and it took me about minutes to get there and back even past midnight thanks in no small part to how well connected this area is i wo waste time talking about the numerous food options which have more than adequately been covered but this is also five minutes away from some of the best music stores in the city from big box retailer fnac practically extinct in india and singapore a city i live in and one that i visited of late to revolver records who have two stores one of which specialises in progressive and mainstream rock and the other which is more skewed towards indie and alternative and heavy metal specialty store pentagram the staff at the hotel were pleasant unobtrusive and very helpful whenever we went to them with a specific query the breakfast quite adequate and the wifi fast,1.0
the rooms are clean and well appointed the check in was quick and easy with a lovely friendly staff i would encourage anyone to stay here as the hop on hop off bus stops practically at the door and it is within walking distance of all sights yet slightly away from the rowdy pubs of downtown the hotel bar and lounge are very nice as well great place great location,1.0
i am writing reviews a few years now and i tend to not leave one if it too for the price i paid for this room i was giving single beds in a room the room had a damp smell in it disgusting the most disturbing part was when i put my toiletries down i noticed thick hairs all over the sink and tap nobs the bathroom was not cleaned no wonder there was a bad smell they need to change the shower curtains as well because when there left up too long they reek and this is the first hotel i actually stayed in where they were going to charge a late check out i had to rush my things out of the restaurant staff were very had a nice pint of heineken,0.0
the right location very nice hotel with big rooms and great service the food is at best very friendly with children have plenty of spots to set and have drinks close to everything outstanding view from your rooms,1.0
the location was fantastic with cute little cafes nearby and shopping right at your door step the rooms were very well appointed and it was easily recognisable that there was a high level of sophistication and attention to detail i absolutely loved the decor and velvet that flooded the hotel it was amazing how the windows in your room opened up like a balcony the bed was super large and comfy the bathroom was all dark and glitzy with an excellent rainfall staff were incredible also i will definitely be returning xx,1.0
we had a great stay here not only was the location fantastic right across the bridge from temple bar but the staff was very helpful and nice in particular we landed very early in the morning from an overseas flight hours prior to being able to check in and they were able to provide us with a freshen up place to shower so we could get started on our day prior to even being able to check in,1.0
my wife and i had planned a four day visit to barcelona and chose the raco del pi on the basis of its central location we were a little wary of being able to sleep at night knowing the spanish and catalan love of late nights and being in the city centre however the hotel turned out to be a real gem clean and comfortable with modern decor our room was very quiet and we had no disturbance at all despite being only a few minutes walk from the cathedral la rambla and myriad bars and restaurants being able to walk to many sights was a great advantage and when we traveled further afield the sagrada familia and the fc barcelona camp nou experience the metro ride was only minutes the only downside is that being in a pedestrian zone taxi access can be difficult our taxi driver dropped us off at the nearest main road and we had a five minute walk with our bags to the hotel the staff were attentive and friendly and check in and check out was no hassle the welcome glass of prosecco was a nice touch we have stayed in many hotels around the world and whilst this was certainly not the most luxurious it rates as one of the best value for money options we have found on our next visit to barcelona we will definitely be staying here again,1.0
really friendly staff and a wonderful atmosphere at this clayton hotel within walking distance of everything i needed going to the aviva stadium took me minutes heading into town for shopping took mins loved this spot and the food was to be a never mind a i be back,1.0

we needed a convenient hotel to stay in with airport shuttle for our early morning flight out of dublin this place is located in a sort of wasteland we pulled up the cab driver did even know this place was here seemed afraid to just leave us here there was a group of loud guys from the pub next door outside our room was typical travelodge but the view outside was a crappy apartment complex with loud people we were hungry but i did want to walk around the sketchy neighborhood no way would i ever go here again,0.0
excellent location the hotel is situated on temple bar very helpful pleasant staff a bottle of fizz and box of chocolates were left in the room for my birthday great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of temple bay,1.0
chose this hotel as is ideally located to be able to walk to croke park there are loads of shops bars and restaurants within minutes no taxis needed as is so central we arrived at our room was ready until which we expected we were able to leave our bags go and have lunch in cafe en seine then do some shopping on return our room was ready we had a queen room excellent facilities hair dryer safe full size mirror nepresso coffee machine kettle toiletries bathrobe and slippers we went to the concert and when we returned housekeeping had been that night and had left more toiletries and chocolates the bed was the most comfortable that we had slept in for a long while for breakfast we had a mixture of continental and full irish both were excellent and the table was cleared away quickly wonderful hotel great location,1.0
the hotel location was very convenient for us as we had a meeting on our return with our car to barcelona and the car parking was a big plus easy to access car space for a day in central barcelona seemed reasonable the hotel twin room was very comfortable with good beds and linen and so was the bathroom too a relief as we paying over for the room and parking and no breakfast there are plenty of very good cafes and bakeries nearby so no problem especially as the check out time is there is a roof top pool which seemed to be very popular judging by the number of people in swimsuits going up to the roof probably a real bonus on a hot summers day in barcelona all the reception staff are very helpful and made for a pleasant one stay,1.0
the hotel was so much better than we expected we left booking our hotel for barcelona quite late so everything was quite pricey we booked this hotel due to the location and price and were pleasantly surpised when we could not fault the cleanliness everything was tidy clean and we did not notice any issues during our night hotel is a minute walk to espana underground station which links directly to the city centre stops away from placa catalunya this was perfect for us and barcelona pubic transport is so cheap buy a ticket for under euro which has trips that can be used by multiple only downfall of this hotel is there is not many nice restaurants around the area but this did affect us too much as it is so close to the city staff were friendly but could have been more welcoming on check we were very happy with our stay the room was clean and very large and it was the perfect location for definitely recommend and stay again,1.0
the hotel was excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel had great facilities the room was spacious and very clean the pool was great to relax in after a day looking round the city the location of the hotel is very good near to the metro and also not from the train station on passeig de gracia,1.0
we stayed at plaka hotel just for night as we were passing through athens and getting a flight to santorini the next hotel is about a minute drive from the airport its in such a great location and everything is at your doorstep so if you are in athens for a short amount of time or a couple of nights this hotel is perfect lots of restaurants close by and little shops the reception staff were so nice and funny we also got an upgrade to a bigger room which was great ladies if you are after some amazing cheap leather sandals head out of the hotel and turn to your left across the road you see a giant sandal shop i was in shoe heaven also head up to the roof top bar to get a view of the acropolis very nice,1.0
very clean nice and safe area many cafes shops around not too close to the center but transport makes it easy helpful staff nice sleep quiet at night we got the information we needed for nightlife called a cab for us when we asked separate room to guard our luggage before the flight,1.0
this hotel is lacking in atmosphere basic facilities rooms and especially bathrooms in poor condition it an overpriced coach trip stopover in the middle of nowhere i did enjoy my stay here at all,0.0
seems reasonably new but has an established charm about it directly opposite croke park it might be wise to check if any major events are scheduled before booking here it also a minute walk to the more touristy areas of dublin and the restaurant precinct he rooms a good size they were quiet and there is also free parking and beds were comfortable but the saggy pillows were a disappointment the bathroom was huge with a long deep soaking bath greta after all that walking those not from need to be aware of safety latches on some hot water taps our showers were cool to cold and we could work out why especially as we could have scorchingly hot baths hotel staff were efficient and friendly with the exception of those we encountered at the a latte seemed to take an indication the croke park is similar in both style and price to a mid tier accor properties such as novotel but it has a little more character i stay here again if returning to dublin,1.0
first of all location is horrible rooms are old dark dirty and bathroom smells of urine breakfast selection was limited and even the coffee was not appealing we stayed at dorian for nights because we could get a refund they never cleaned our room do stay at dorian it not worth it,0.0
i like this hotel for large and clean enough staff to serve lots of in the center of breakfast has multiple mini market beside the hoteli will definitely will book it again,1.0

this was our first trip to dublin and my wife and i were very happy with our hotel location was nice very close to stephen park grafton street the national gallery and archaeology museum and trinity college temple bar the city centre bus station and other attractions were all very manageable walks also you are on a main road so the outside noise level was quite good for being in the wife and i love classic hotels and this one did not disappoint the lobby was very attractive and the room was nice we had the triple room it was clean and the bed was comfortable it had plenty of room for the two of us free water was a nice touch there was some outside noise but nothing unexpected for being in a city except perhaps the seagulls room amenities were nice and the bathroom was quite was fine we did try the restaurant or bar at any time the service was our first trip to ireland i do have a lot of experience with pricing but this seemed comparable to other hotels in the city and seemed like a good value for the location and room quality,1.0
i stayed at this hotel nights after week at a hotel in central barcelona it was like a second vacation the views from the rooms are amazing the rooms are very fresh and spacious i had rooms wonderful and fabulous rooms they were exactly the same expect one fabulous had a view of the beaches north and the other wonderful had a view of the harbour the breakfast is average and i expected more of live was many children under that filled the pool it was funny to see the pools as deep as for an adult targeted hotel pool service is very good the food is good and there is a good selection of restaurants below the pool terrace you will have short access to the sea and the towels will be handed to choices of dining and night life eclipse is the place to meet others and drink,1.0
an excellent hotel in the center of athens rooms are very nice and clean and the staff very polite the breakfast is very rich offering to visitors many things to enjoy on the top of the hotel their is a bar where you can see around the town of athens especially during nights where the scene is fantastic from the hotel you can walk easily to the market area or to akropolis also it is very easy to use bus or taxi,1.0
the room i got had a beautiful view of the acropolis but the air conditioner did not work and it was a very hot night luckily i only needed one night because i was leaving to the islands the next day the hotel is outdated and the towels looked old and overused like everything else you get what you pay for the location of this place is a plus thought it close to plaka and monastiraki the area is safe and it has a lot of restaurants at walking distance,0.0
from the moment we entered this hotel our stay was perfect room was beautiful and had everything we needed all of the staff were extremely friendly accommodating and were willing to go the extra mile a special thank you to hazel who found out we had just got engaged and gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco this made our stay extra special we did eat in the hotel so ca comment on the food but the bar area was lovely and the afternoon tea looked amazing although the room was incredibly hot we were provided with a fan without even having to ask this hotel is in a great location with lots of shops and restaurants on the same street number bus from the airport it takes about and it drops you right outside the hotel it is also a short bus trip to the city centre and buses are very frequent i will be recommending this hotel to all friends and family and wo hesitate to return when i dublin next,1.0
we booked this hotel fairly late notice at a great price for the location we were very happy with the service and room etc the rooftop pool and bar were excellent for early morning swims too will return again here for my time in barcelona thanks,1.0

the hotel is very nice you definitely need a car if you want to see barcelona getting taxis is difficult and the city bus can take a long time too the rooms are spacious and in good condition with very nice furnishings and decor the food is just ok better to have a breakfast in the city for less than half the price and there nothing to walk to so pick up whatever snacks and small items you need before you get there we had a mountain view and overlooked a large fountain at the hotel which made it sound like it was lightly raining all night a nice feature,1.0
the vincci gala hotel is perfect in many ways firstly the location in near urquinaona is between the old city with the restaurants monuments plazzas and shops and the new city with the beautiful buildings in paseig de gracia casa battlo and sagrada familia you will find yourself in walking distance to the barcelona catedral casa battlo and casa service is very good with very professional people a special thanks to cristina the day manager that helped us solve a problem with our rooms are very nice clean and tidy it really feels like home to open the room door and smell the fresh air with no dust beds are well made and the mattresses are hard but is a restaurant with a good offer in and i recommend the jamon iberico with tomato in all a great place to spend days in,1.0

my partner and i booked this hotel without realizing we were doing so during pride week we aren t really the party type and weren t really sure what to expect we were apprehensive to say the least i can absolutely recommend this hotel without hesitation in fact we can t think of anywhere else we would rather stay when visiting barcelona the staff were extremely kind and helpful special to jaime who has an excellent sense of humor i m a sucker for jokes they upgraded our room upon so we had a nice balcony overlooking the street this was much appreciated the facilities were modern and clean we really enjoyed the rooftop pool in the afternoons when it was entirely too hot to walk or generally move around the city drinks are expensive up there but it s expected that you pay for the convenience fyi you have the option to pay at the bar and not charge the drink to your room we liked this since we didn t incur a huge charge there s also a nice little community park behind the hotel with plenty of places to sit and relax we enjoyed purveying neighborhood life here the hotel is located a bit outside of main tourist zones but we liked that it felt more like a local neighborhood there s a metro station located less than a block away that will get you anywhere in the city very quickly still plaça montjuic and the lovely,1.0

we enjoyed our stay at the attalos hotel very much we knew they had a great view of the acropolis from their rooftop bar but were amazed when we saw the view from our balcony as well everyone from the staff was friendly and helpful the room was spacious and clean we chose not to spend the extra euros for breakfast but rather chose from the many options very nearby the location is great very centrally located near major sites as well as multiple cafes and tavernas,1.0
my husband and i had a great time the hotel is right off the metro station and is clean with friendly staff we rented bikes for the day to explore the city and hung out in their downstairs bar for food and drinks after a long day of adventures we would definitely come back next time we visiting amsterdam,1.0
this hotel just gets it right their most important assets are their employees people who stood out for us were the front desk especially maria and dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend extra days in athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship the location is excellent and close to almost everything the area seems a little dodgy at night however it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world perhaps safer than most there are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel with an excellent dessert shop right next door the rooms are spacious the public areas well laid out the food really good especially the breakfast and room service and the decor is modern yet functional this is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment i especially like the interactive smart tv in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device the wifi is free and fast the beds and pillows they have pillow menus are extremely comfortable and all areas including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after they have plugs next to the beds and also a usb charging cable for telephones or ipads the ac worked well especially during the celsius heat whilst we were there the rooms have fully stocked minibars and a highly quality brand of soap body lotion and,1.0
this was our third stay at the academy plaza and it will always be our preferred stay in dublin as ever the staff were really pleasant and helpful our double room was just fine bed adequate sized room good amenities iron and ironing board plenty of drawer space hair drier etc good sized clean bathroom tv the breakfast facilities are to be highly just off street is ideal just a short walk from the city gave this hotel a good review after our first stay years ago and i still rate this hotel will certainly be back next time we in dublin,1.0
my husband and i stay at two for two nights three days and just found it to be excellent we total enjoyed the experience and will be sure to return again and again two of course is the sister hotel of alex hotel who facilities were also available to us two is a little quieter and maybe more relaxed with fine rooms and showers we live in the us and prefer walking showers with doors that close complete all of the hotels we stayed in in lisbon porto and san sebastian had step in tubs with petitions that did not close so for us it was difficult to get a great show two has great showers if you looking for a spa the full service spa is in alex hotel a short walk away where we had the best massage ever,1.0
i was a bit dubious coming here with a child as on the website it looked too cool for school but when i arrived at looking to leave in bags and deal somehow with tired children who had taken a flight yup a mistake and they allowed us to our room without paying more then i this place has core values of hospitality covered children rested we hired bikes they had children ones too and headed much thanks to making the holiday,1.0
our first taste of ireland we checked in early after an overnight flight the front desk was more than accommodating everyone was so friendly and helpful the room and bathroom were spacious and spotless the hotel is conveniently located not in the city center but easily accessible nonetheless and the neighborhood is can not stress enough how helpful everyone was at one point we saw a woman who was a manager of some sort first she was delivering trays to tables when the coffee bar was getting busy then she was escorting folks to the restrooms not just pointing the way not more than minutes later we found her out front assisting guests in getting taxis all with a smile and kind word we would highly recommend clayton ballsbridge,1.0
the location of the hotel is one train away from amsterdam central which is essential i paid for a day transport pass to get to central amsterdam and surrounding areas i brought this from reception the hotel is clean friendly and has positive vibes i yet to see the place quiet which is surely a good thing right would definitely recommend,1.0
we have stayed in barcelona many times times this was the first time at this hotel it was mainly chosen because we came by car from southern france so it was very easy acces from north and you did not have to drive in the city center and there was a fair prized parking in the were pleasantly surprised by the very friendly staff and the hotel quality the hotel was very fairly prized compared to more citycenter hotels and were absolutely better quality breakfast was very nice are used to stay closer to the center so we thought it was a bit of a walk to the center there were however metro stations close by,1.0
we stayed here en famille for a few days in june the staff are incredibly friendly and chatty while the rooms are small but comfortable it was great to be back in dublin having not been in town for years although very close to the centre the quiet canal bank location allows one to rest peacefully the beds are very comfortable and all the amenities were perfect the hotel is full of character with rooms named after famous literary characters my wife and i stayed in the christy brown room breakfast was the traditional full irish although other options were available i hold them largely responsible for my holiday weight the perfect location for visiting the historical sites in dublin trinity dublin castle etc it obviously equally good if you can get a room for trips to lansdowne road for matches or concerts we loved the hotel and will definitely stay again if we can on our next visit to dublin,1.0
our rooms were ready when we arrived the front desk staff was warm welcoming and thankfully spoke english beautifully the rooms were very comfortable and the beds were great lush towels bath robes and slippers pamper hotel itself is very beautiful the pool area looked like the place to be if you were young and in really good shape however i would not say it was very family was a great location and i would recommend this hotel and stay there again,1.0
nice hotel cool art in the hallways and modern rooms with all the expected features staff are very friendly helpful and overall dutch good of a trek to the centre but there are bikes to hire and a local bus very near the home avoid the hotel bar and restaurant for although pleasant a bit too expensive for what you get there are plenty of cafes and bars in amsterdam in all a lovely place to stay for a long weekend away the gorgeous receptionist also lent me an adapter which may make this review slightly biased,1.0
the hotel itself is great we had a junior suite which was quite spacious for european standards nice updated bathroom comfy bed huge balcony with a wonderful view of the acropolis the location is fantastic as well very central and within close proximity to most main areas of the city the only downfall was the service it was terrible but not what i used to front desk is just there to give you a room key or take your payment waitress at the hotel restaurant upstairs was the friendliest nor very quick to take our order calling room service was good but when we just needed some extra coffee pods or towels etc it was forever and we still could get what we needed all of the time only one gentleman downstairs bellman was extremely helpful throughout the whole trip it a shame because such a good hotel could be great with just some tweaks to their customer service,1.0
our hotel recommended the lobby restaurant at the nesplein hotel it was a delicious way to start the day in a lovely and comfy living room style space as always the service in amsterdam is top notch,1.0
divani palace acropolis is a wonderful hotel we stayed nights and loved the hotel and their very nice staff the pool area is very nice and lovely food the roof terrace has a fantastic view and the rooms a very nice and cosy also the area is so charming we can only recommend this hotel to everyone we loved staying here you divani palace best regards the engholm family from dk,1.0
splendid location near diagonal but away from the noise two small swimming pools one of them in the terrace quite comfortable rooms with space and very good ammenities friendly and well decored public spaces very very very good lot of nearby options for dining within walk is a little bit the hotel than the city itself which is have visited frequentelly barcelona for years now and it seems it has improved so little compared with other options but casa mimosa it a must go in the city,1.0
this hotel is right in the heart of temple bar although the streets were very busy with hen and stag parties we couldnt hear any of this from the hotel room lovely decor and spotlessly clean children received ice cream when we arrived and they were delighted to find mini crunchie bars on their bed the breakfast is very good we will return again hopefully,1.0
as soon as you walk in the foyer of this hotel you are like wow there is a dog statue that i could help but hug the door man was so helpful you could ask him anything and he would help it is very central so when you drunk and trying to find your way back you lucky as temple bar is only minutes away also a heads up go to the doughnut shop on the bridge you will not regret it,1.0
most visitors probably leave lloyd with mixed feelings but the positive ones prevailed in our case take your time to walk around the building and discover its rich history i appreciated the fresh flowers and funky design elements on every corner we had a room with a right in the and bedroom with floors and windows which was quirky but really amazing the breakfast has a great selection of fresh breads crazy croissants covered with thick layer of chocolate champagne and bloody marry plus everything most people need we also got a bottle of campaign for free using the promotion code from the the hotel is located in a modern amsterdam neighborhood right on water the canals and most attractions are walkable on foot but you also easily get around with tram or in all the place may not be as suitable for families with small kids or elderly but youngsters and adventure lovers like us should absolutely love their stay,1.0
very nice hotel with great deco nice views and nice rooms large and clean with all the necessary equipment whatch out with the boilers though the quality of service of the staff at the desk is fluctuant from great adel to average,1.0
comfortable room with comfy bed and helpful and friendly staff all spoke english with views to die for of the acropolis on one side and the temple of zeus on the other side while enjoying your breakfast in the rooftop restaurant,1.0
very friendly service good location and clean room unfortunately there was no hairdryer at our room there is a metro station nearby the hotel and de hotel also offers a bike rental service so you can get to the inner city in about ten minutes,1.0
my travel tour agency recommended this place i have since told them to stop i am on my second and final stay of nights room came with air conditioning but it was broken mentioned it times and was assured it would be checked out i still have no air conditioning i have sleep apnea and cooler air makes my breathing easier i did request a fan and after second request it finally showed up could not sleep with windows open as i was next to fire house and road noise the first nights dinner took hours to show up and my wife lamb was cold my sons fries were old and stale not acceptable one positive is the morning breakfast buffet it has a great selection of foods they even offer gluten free bread i found staff to be dismissive with discussions about food and rooms i have a large family and will tell them not to stay here on their next visit to ireland i am unsure if problems stem from management or owners who do not care about maintenance and upkeep avoid it like the plague,0.0
do waste your money coming here i not a complainer at all but i would come back or recommend this hotel breakfast is rubbish poor selection of food reception staff cant be bothered helping out site seeing all day and just wanted a cup of tea when we landed back but they do serve drinks on the ground floor in summer so you have to go upto the floor if you want a if you do like lifts rooms are basic and nothing special right next door to the hotel is some kind of outdoor disco which goes on all day till about really loud and does your head in location not that great with a lack of decent restaurants close defo not not come back,0.0
we stayed from july to august with our two children the location was minutes walking straight to the centre of dublin the room was very spacious toiletries were very good quality very comfortable beds included children and the breakfast was fantastic great variety in a spacious the staff from the reception desk to the waiters and cleaning staff very very nice and helpful it was a great experience for us all,1.0
i stayed at this hotel twice two days in june at the start of my travel in greece and two days in july before i returned home i was very pleased with both stays although my rooms were very different this is a bright hotel with a lot of unexpected touches my favorite was the lobby chairs with outlets for convenient charging of cell phones laptops while you wait for friends or taxis breakfast was included in my price and you can get made to order omelets and orange juice the staff is the real star of this hotel they are friendly professional and superbly attentive during my first stay i stayed in a junior suite which was nice and roomy with a super clean bathroom and included great amenities such as a room safe flat screen tv hot water pot and a mini bar that leaves room for your personal food items free is included they also have an restaurant where you can get anything from a burger and fries to greek salad on my second stay i was given one of the newly renovated rooms on the floor and while they were and absolutely stunning it just was my style and so i asked for and received a room change they were even kind enough to have one of the bellmen take me around and show me other available rooms so i could choose what i wanted now that is service the room i have now is one,1.0
although the hotel is about a minute walk from the plaka area it is one of the nicest hotels in athens beds are very comfortable and rooms are large with good air conditioning which is hard to find in athens spend the extra money and get a club level room the club level has breakfast every day which is very good along with snacks canapes drinks and desserts throughout the day sandwiches and wraps at lunch and free drinks in the evening this made it very nice to wind down after a long day of sightseeing in athens service was also very good and the club lounge had excellent views of the acropolis and out door dining,1.0
o b was perfect for our less than hour stay in athens at the end of a fabulous greece trip the front desk staff was incredible from assisting with transportation to booking a stellar private tour guide peggy was so so so so wonderful to packing us breakfast to go when our taxi came to get us for the airport thank you for being so wonderful the hotel is cute in a really fun gritty neighborhood walking distance to plenty of hip restaurants bars and of course the acropolis the only reason i do have stars for o b is i think the rooms themselves could use a little love the bedding and towels felt a bit old the mini bar was lackluster no wine and the cd player in the room is more or less a good example of the last time they were upgraded very comfortable bed and spacious for a big euro city though overall a lovely stay,1.0
this is the coolest hotel i have ever visited nice design all over the hotel relaxed atmosphere nice staff in the reception and the restaurant the roof top baadplats with bathtubs with panoramic view is a great experiance unique,1.0
i spent hours on tripadvisor trying to find the best hotel in barcelona for our day vacation cubic was our winner and i am happy to write that everything about our stay was just perfect we booked the suite with breakfast our room was reasonable big the breakfast buffet offered a huge selection of everything you may think of to eat in the morning the interior design of the hotel was very creative and unique it definitely did not have the usual hotel and the best of it staff members were just simply great very professional and attentive the location is exceptional right in the middle of everything evening drink at the roof bar was another great surprise the views from the bar are stunning thank you cubic for making our stay just awesome,1.0
we are on our day of a day visit to the ambassade i cant recommend the hotel highly enough the staff at all levels are highly efficient and extremely friendly nothing was ever a problem we had a really quiet room at the back of the hotel which helped our sleeping after a hour flight from australia breakfast was included and at a high standard and staff were very courteous and attentive it is also located close to all attractions highly recommend,1.0
very comfortable hotel with all amenities food in restaurant and breakfasts excellent reception staff polite and knowledgeable particularly about local transport pool very clean and quiet stops on metro into barcelona or a bus stops outside hotel big enough to accommodate groups without affecting couples and families,1.0
although the hotel looked nice from the outside the inside was beautiful it felt very luxurious we had a superior king room overlooking the guinness room was huge but it was clean and comfortable the bar bar staff were great huge comfy sofa to sit on attentive bar booked the hotel restaurant for our night it looked lovely it was advertised as a candlelit dinner but in reality was a tealight on the table with fairly bright overhead lights despite the opulent surroundings there was very little atmosphere though the waiting staff that night were downright miserable we wished we had stayed in the bar to eat breakfast was euro for a full cooked buffet a great base for dublin minute walk to the guinness storehouse about the same to dublin zoo the tram is a minute walk away that will take you in to the temple bar area took about minutes cost to reach from the airport too just take the airlink from outside the terminal it a minute walk from the last stop at heuston station for a euro return highly recommended,1.0
i stayed at this hotel as a solo guest and as part of a tour group and regularly stays at the hotel during peak season as a solo guest my room was nice and comfortable and the restaurant up on the top floor serves amazing food and the service was fine but coming back to the hotel as part of the tour group my experience much like others part of my group was beyond lacking i was put in a room that was made for people but the third bed was just a uncomfortable mattress on the floor which is unacceptable as i have paid the same amount of money for the room as the people who have proper beds and if the room is for people than make it for people we all later that night went up to the top floor to dine at the restaurant our tour group had to order and pay at the bar as table service was allowed for tour groups as in the past people have left without paying there bill which i was understanding of but after of us waiting hours for our food and then meals also coming out not the way they were described on the menu no wonder people have left without paying waiting and half hours for food is unacceptable and not apology was given to us for our would not recommend this hotel to anyone and would never stay here again in greece,0.0
we stayed at die port van cleve for nights in one of their superior rooms with beams in the oldest part of the hotel our room was refurbished to a good quality large king size bed excellent linen very modern bathroom with good shower and bath all very clean and well maintained the room was noisy as it looks onto a road at the back of the hotel which is part of the busy canal area with lots of pubs cafes we understand that a central city hotel is likely to be more noisy but suggest that you think about secondary double glazing which would not affect the great character of the original hotel staff are very friendly well trained and nothing was too much trouble the food in the restaurant was delicious on both occasions we dined there and breakfast was a substantial buffet the blauwe bar is a great place for a drink in old amsterdam surroundings and we would definitely recommend the jenever enjoyed our stay here and we will look forward to returning might bring ear plugs to combat the noisy revellers outside at night ha ha would have been a definite star but for that thank you to all at die port van cleve,1.0
stayed here many times and was more than happy until latest stay made a friendly advice to staff that the toaster did work and was asked standards are slipping i will stay elsewhere there a many hotels in this price range with good srvice,1.0

for those interested in architecture the conservatorium is a feast for the eyes the blend of old and new is masterful even unique for a hotel it was exciting to walk through the portal and anticipate a luxurious experience did happen that way the room was extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient the corridors are gorgeous san ac that omission was a mistake maybe the ac was on the blink watch your step as you leave the room as a is not marked or illuminated i had a deluxe two floor suite with a view of the street a bit noisy but tolerable after climbing the steep stairs to the bedroom and having my luggage carried upstairs i went to unpack surprise the closets are on the first floor back down the steep staircase with my luggage in tow but how do you open the closets or turn the lights or even the tv my remote did work even the bedside lamp required instructions when using the desk it was inevitable that you hit your head every single time on the light fixture that hangs over the chair and my knee got a bruisin from hitting the desk drawer when trying to avoid the pendant light the furniture is low to the floor a trip factor comfortable to net the experience the designer thought about clever unusual or even and not guest convenience yeah there is a user manual to explain it all but who wants to read a manual for normally,0.0
nice friendly hotel clean and location for getting around distance from the segrada familia local supermarkets and bars and restaurants and metro witch is great for getting is continental and the same every rooms have no balcony this is an extra and i wish i had payed for it as the hotel has no pool only a small sun terrace on the check in staff spoke english and were helpful in helping us plan out barcelona not many people speak got back to this hotel for a weekend,1.0

this hotel is worn out the tile in the bathroom is cracked and mold is growing in the corners the faucets are so worn the chrome is worn off in places and carpets were thread bare and stained our first night we had a first floor room facing the street yards away to our surprise was a disco the is open until am the sound proofing is non existent so sleep was hard to come by the staff was great and we were able to relocate to a top floor room in the back for the second night this only reduced the noise by dinner was above average and breakfast was good,0.0
up until my last day i would have said i loved this hotel it was clean a great location helpful front desk staff i stayed here for nights on my last day i noticed money had been stolen from the safe in my room of course the hotel staff said this was impossible i am sure it happened being a solo traveller i keep close tabs on my money i allow myself a certain amount each day and count my money every night i was extremely upset and disappointed this happened and on my last day since i was catching a train early the next morning i did have time to report this to the police i did fill out a complaint form at the hotel needless to say i would recommend this hotel it was expensive to stay in and then i was robbed,0.0
as business trip transportation is for fully booked appointments outside the hotel overall experience is good however the hotel location is a bit far from the center without conveneient stores surrounding for personal trip,1.0

the rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building i had to change rooms and i had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total the price is just too high for what you actually get considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc is limited and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block the trains that pass connolly station shake the whole building every ten minutes the walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by as well as what your neighbours are up to go figure the carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh the most positive thing i can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented when i told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue but for the price paid i would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast,0.0
lovely hotel staff the pool is perfect and the staff sent up a bottle of champs as it was my birthday during our stay very thoughtful would defiantly stay at on our next visit the location is perfect as in the middle of all the main attractions,1.0

maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,0.0
stayed for nights at this cosy and warm hotel well located in the city centre close to shopping areas and the historical part of the city very nice and spacious rooms overlooking the green park pedio areos across the avenue the breakfast rich and tasty the staff always attentive to our needs and always with a big smile fantastic roof top with great view over the city of athens you think you can touch the acropolis dinner we had around the swimming pool was simply magical and service impeccable really an excellent value for money,1.0
we liked the spacious and modernly decorated room and the small terrace in front of the hotel i very much appreciated the fact that in the in the room we also found products the subway is a walk and in minutes you reach the central station,1.0
the location is fantastic we stayed in a two room apartment at botany bay it is basic but fine there were no cooking pots although there was a cooker but maureen the cleaning lady was extremely nice and helpful and she found us some pots main issue is the price we paid euros for six nights plus for a camp bed for three of nights this was the best part of euros for student rooms for less than a the door cards stopped working several times and we had to go back to the accommodation office repeatedly to have them restaurant in the campus closes at which is very friday night the students upstairs were extremely extremely rowdy and disruptive and were shouting and jumping around like a herd of animals,0.0
spent three nights at hotel which had very clean and generous sized rooms location is minute train ride from attractions but the train is right out front one great hotel amenity is on premise parking which is rare and even rarer is the nightly rate of euros on the downside hotel has a bar but no alcohol and only offered stay if had small children but if older that would look to stay closer to all the action,1.0
the start of a fantastic vacation began at the royal olympic we stayed in the same room we were in two years ago but stayed longer this time we had a view and balcony overlooking the temple of zeus just across the street and a view of the acropolis up the hill the old town of athens was just a minute walk from the hotel and close to everything traveled with friends who all stayed here and everyone was happy we found the prices cheap compared to most places we stay but the quality and service equal i do think we would stay anywhere else while in athens,1.0
my husband and i absolutely loved ink hotel amsterdam the rooms are a bit small but this is standard in europe once you step into the hotel the interior is absolutely amazing each room was decorated with a comic map of the city i had a blast reading the commentary the artist had on the walls my one pet peeve was how cramped the shower area was and how water would leak out of the door on the had to be careful to make sure the shower door was always fully arrived to amsterdam quite late but the train dropped us off from the airport straight to the front of the hotel just around the corner there were various late night restaurants location is always key and this hotel was perfect we were away from the noisiness of the city yet just around the corner from the hustle and bustle of would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back,1.0

we stayed two night at the hotel estherea it is located in the heart of amsterdam and we walked everywhere the hotel lobby was gorgeous and the bar and restaurant were very good they have a free machine in the lobby that was great and made really good coffees and lattes etc the room was quaint and beautifully decorated the bathroom was large and updated the only negatives were the free wifi and the noise outside on the street the wifi dropped constantly and very frustrating to our room was on the backside of the hotel ant the street was quiet when we checked in that changed dramatically in the evening and was very noisy late into the night i recommend a room on the front or interior of the hotel,1.0
wow a great hotel if you are looking for somewhere smart but not in an ostentatious way then this is the hotel for you tucked away from the hustle and bustle but not too far to walk in what we would describe as a trendy up and coming area modern quirky and a great place to stay we loved the feel of the hotel right from stepping of the pavement friendly accommodating staff who spoke good english sorry our spanish was so bad just the type of place you would want to be seen in a lovely room with an amazing shower that i need in my life for days of the year not the we stayed a hand written note welcoming us on arrival the latest edition of a glossy fashion magazine to read on the desk bluetooth speakers comfortable beds controllable air conditioning great lighting a good choice of products for all those things you forgot to pack good quality towels and linen lots of considered touches that we enjoyed we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends we are now looking to stay at another hotel in the chain for our next break good value for money too we had a great stay thank you,1.0

we had an excellent time at hotel olivia balmes the members of staff could not have been improved they were efficient friendly and always helpful the hotel is ideally located for seeing the sites shopping and enjoying cafes and restaurants the buffet breakfasts were good and we enjoyed being able to choose to sit inside or outside the room was spotless and very comfortable the pool is small but considering that the hotel is so central having a pool was a real bonus the terrace and poolside were relaxed but benefited from the usual excellent service if i was to change one thing it would be the loud music played on the terrace in my opinion it did nothing to enhance the relaxed atmosphere and at times spoilt the atmosphere but that is as stated only my opinion as a hotel i can not recommend olivia balmes highly enough,1.0
we stayed very clean rooms wth staff very friendly breakfast is very very good with a wide verity the hotel restaurant food is very poor quality for the price an we waited for a cocktail we ordered an the place was empty with two members of staff doing nothin that was a major let down to a lovely quiet hotel in a nice location,1.0

absolutely amazing hotel nothing was too much trouble and got great recommendations from the staff for nights out cocktail bars and restaurant choices also enjoyed a manicure in the spa located within the hotel and could be happier for people going for the nightlife the bar also has great deals for cocktails and they do the trick would return great place,1.0
a great location to know amsterdam very nice staff always willing to help proper cleaning the breakfast good although too expensive the only negative thing was the bed too soft even si we would repeat,1.0

we first got a wrong room but the staff was very friendly and helped us out the location was nice with short distance to several metro stations and restaurants the beds were really good as well but there were quite a bit of noise from the hallway,1.0
we were in town for so rooms all over were at a premium and charged at a premium we were lucky to get the only remaining room at the croke park hotel and given everywhere was expensive were please to fnd that our room gave us access to the executive lounge with free snacks fruit soft drinks tea and coffee available it also meant we had a bar before and after the gig the room was comfortable the mattress wonderful and all the staff unfailingly charming the tv was rather small and the room was soundproofed so we could hear the noise from the courtyard bar below us other than that our only criticism is that the hotel decor and furnishings look rather tired all in all it was a great stay but the hotel could probably do with a little refurbishment,1.0
this was our hotel for the final few days of the trip it was the cleanest and most elegant of the properties we stayed at in spain the location is great because you are in the quieter part of the main stay area of barcelona great location for shopping dining and touristy type walks the rooms are big the beds were comfortable and the best part if the warm cookies that they have hidden behind the front desk,1.0
we stayed here last week it was amazing a great location as was out of the hustle and bussing of the city but close enough to walk to places took us half hour to walk to la sagrada familia right near the harbour lots of lovely bars and restaurants hotel was very clean staff very attentive and safe in the room if you happen to have your car there is secure underground parking breakfast was amazing so much choice could fault it if you looking for a place to stay i highly recommend would stay here again,1.0
just terrible stay never wrote a review before but feel the room was so bad people should know no air conditioning in degree heat needed to leave windows open so sea gulls and other birds squawking sounded like something out of jurassic park inch tv about years old with patchy sevice could use the shower as it was broken honestly worst hotel room i have ever been in ca say anything about staff as we just went out as soon as possible oh and for parking a day do stay here,0.0
lot of great restaurants nearby walking distance i prefer the beauty of ireland more than the party areas temple bar hotel room was great the double windows kept street noise quiet and it was nice to have a place that had air conditioning it was humid the hotel has a great location not too close to the party scene but close enough to walk there i only stayed one night and had to leave early so i did get to use all the amenities,1.0
stayed in this hotel for days with my boyfriend in mid june the hotel was gorgeous very clean and had comfortable beds location was good there was a bus stop less than mins from the hotel that went straight from the hotel to the airport the hotel was massively central but the walk into the city centre was lovely on top of the hotel being excellent the staff could do enough for myself and my boyfriend during our stay they gave great suggestions for activities restaurants and sights to see within would highly recommend to this hotel for a short stay in amsterdam,1.0
my ipad phone and aftershave were stolen from a supposedly locked room the hotel offered me no support other than to try to prove none of their staff had accessed my room with a keycard if you travel here keep valuables with you,0.0
me and friend stayed here for nights in june location is great and it was really easy to find coming from the train station only around a minute walk depending on how fast or slow you walk taking in the sights of amsterdam hotel was clean we had a room with single beds and it was lovely the hotel is next door to an amazing bakery that serves the best churros so make sure you grab a free sample off the counter because you will be guarantee to be lured in after tasting them for more churros i would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again,1.0
everything was perfect except one tiny thing on arrival the woman checking us in could hardly crack a smile and was not polite or cheerful talking to us it put a downer on the buzz of finally arriving there was no are you all or was your trip here i stayed in star hotels who ask these questions with a smile they really go a long way to making you feel welcome at the i have to compliment the bar staff they could have been more helpful and nicer they the reason this review is stars,1.0
nice small hotel stayed there with family for week between the staff at the desk friendly and helpful above all the breakfast was very good thanks to the young ladies who always made sure to give the best they could would recommend a microwave cooker for improvement,1.0
stay one night in this hotel with the family very good location and definitely a four star hotel easy checkin reception had cooled ice water on a hot day for all hotel guest rooms were cleaned and large breakfast served on the tenth floor had excellent views and wide range of choices services exceptional,1.0
this was a truly appalling experience one night in this dump and i was bitten to distraction by bed bugs check the photos when i complained the next morning i was asked by the receptionist whether the bites were the something i eaten yes madam i had a tasty tapa of bedbugs and then crapped them out in the night and they came back to bite me an absolute disgrace of an hotel,0.0
a very nice hotel in the plaka district perfect for spending some days in athens walking distance to the acropolis and to nice restaurants and bars the staff was very helpful and gave us great advices for visiting the city the hotel is kind of very charming,1.0
this really is the gate to athens fabulous service rooms are great and clean fab food the views of the acropolis and temple of zeus are not imaginable until you are there close to all the things you want to see and right near the plaka the old shopping district,1.0
this hotel was perfectly located in the city centre only a short and very direct bus ride from the airport within walking distance of many attractions but they also bus stops on the square outside meaning was very easy to get anywhere in the city we were offered a glass of bubbly on arrival and complimentary drinks were available from daily our room was lovely and the complimentary toiletries were of a very high standard service was excellent the staff on reception were always very friendly and helpful great value for money my only slightly negative comment is that it can get noisy throughout the night due to the rooms overlooking a central courtyard above reception and any noise in the reception travels up to the rooms this was easily resolved when a kind member of staff advised where i could buy some earplugs from i ca believe this was a three star hotel it felt far more like a hotel i would definitely recommend the hotel and plan to stay here again,1.0
need to offer earlier check in ensure charge is actually cleared from guest credit card also was not advised of where breakfast was second floor at check in so when i checked out i gave my room key back and then had to wait in the elevator lobby until another guest went upstairs as the elevators are only activated by a room card swipe,1.0
my partner and i stayed in the niu barcelona during a night stay in the city in mid hotel appears to be fairly new i not sure of the exact opening date but it ca be more than a year or so old as a result everything is very clean and everything works as expected the staff were very pleasant and helpful we arrived a few hours early on our first day and were allowed to check in slightly earlier than the advertised time which was much appreciated after a long room itself was clean with comfortable beds a flatscreen tv a table and a nice bathroom with a large walk in of the best parts of the room was the system going back to my previous statement that everything is fairly new and works as it should this air conditioning was a godsend especially in the high degree heat of barcelona in the middle of july after a day of exploring it was great to be able to come back to a nice chilled room before heading out again at night the location of the hotel is fantastic you are within minutes of la rambla and the gothic quarter but the area the hotel is in el raval is great for bars and restaurants too the doors of the hotel open out on to rambla del raval which is home to many bars shops and places to eat a short stroll along career de will take you right on,1.0
hotel is perfectly located within minutes walking distance of all the major attractions very clean and specious room very helpful and friendly staff can highly recommend this hotel good value for money for hotel in the city centre,1.0
ok hotel needs improvement but no negatives with staff or rooms i stayed in room on the of august when dublin was very busy right from our entry at reception until we left the staff were exceptional reception staff and bar staff excellent i lost my bank card and the receptionist made sure i did not have to pay for parking but was more worried that i got it sorted it was the girl with blonde hair on at pm on the staff one bar man in particular made it his to make us feel at home i think his name was niall the hotel has had its fair share of negativity but from belfast it great if you driving as it next to motorway again dated but if your in dublin to comment on a family trip this is the bus outside every mins fare into city centre,1.0
great end to our dublin holiday at balfe at the westbury tonight exceptional service from gabriel our waiter who went the extra mile above and beyond our expectations friendly and welcoming perfect we will be back,1.0
we visited barcelona for a business trip and we stayed at grand marina hotel for nights the location is perfect due that it is near the city center rambla colom barceloneta the staff has been kind and welcoming among them the director has been also very willing and,1.0
we came here as a treat for my birthday for nights entry to the hotel was clean smells of lemons every member of staff from reception to bar staff were pleasant professional multilingual and helpful hotel is quirky lots of artwork and would appeal to many it about a minute walk to las ramblas hotel also hire out bicycles i believe for free for guests i did go into the gymmy partner booked us a standard room and we were put into room there was an ice bucket with a small bottle of cava there which was a nice touchthe itself was quite small facing a busy road but the glazed windows seem to block out most of the traffic noise the room had everything we needed tv not many british channels kettle with tea and coffee bathrobes and slippers minibar and safe it did have any drawers so we are limited with space for underwear etc the bathroom had everything we needed including hairdryer and they also supplied the usual the only negative criticism is that both carpets in the hallway and bedroom were looking very tired and the paintwork in the bathroom was pretty bad and needed attention and not what you would have expected in a hotel on our last night at am the failed and started leaking we had to switch it off as the water was coming from the ceiling and my partner was sure whether this was anywhere near electrics we reported it in,1.0
booked to stay here without knowing that it was just opening this week friendly staff could not be more helpful the hotel is really well designed and to a very high spec close to the centre and train station but quiet compared to being right in the centre the room was lovely well designed large and very comfortable breakfast was great also i will be using it again much nicer than a big chain,1.0
hi friends i stayed at the pestana arena barcelona it was a nice hotel with a nice lobby to relax and have a delicious cup of coffee or cappuccino our room was spacious and clean with a large glass window that opened no screens the bathrooms were very nice modern and clean as well breakfast was a buffet it had a lot of things eggs bacon cereals cheeses ham pastries etc and delicious hot chocolate it was like you were drinking melted chocolate yummy it was close to the bus stop train restaurants and had shops near by i hope you have a great stay,1.0
i went to barcelona in a business trip and stayed at the hotel due to the great location i was very pleased with the room and friendliness of the personnel in particular i have to mention javier and ricardo at the reception for their help and suggestions and bianca at the swimming pool she is a treasure i managed to get a full operating office under the sun overlooking the city from the pool at the top of the what a treat after that i reserved the same table every afternoon until my departure i got my ideal office there,1.0
my husband and i recently spent nights at central athens hotel we are very pleased with our decision to stay in this hotel the rooms are spacious by european standards clean and modern the staff is very friendly and were helpful with any of our questions about the city or traveling in the area the rooftop bar was excellent we made a point to have at least one drink there every evening of our trip and we were never disappointed by the drinks or the view in addition we very pleased with the complimentary breakfast buffet you get a wide variety of choices including those that are and more authentic greek dishes central athens will even pack you a breakfast if you must depart before the buffet opens as was the case with our last found the location to be fine it is an easy walk minutes from the syntagma metro station which is a major stop for most modes of transit to and from the airport it is also less than a minute walk to the major flea market area of athens which we loved the walk to the acropolis was a bit longer but it could not have been more than minutes evidently athens is currently summer experiencing some domestic unrest but we never felt unsafe during our only problem that we have with the central athens hotel is the spottiness of their wifi it is free but it is also incredibly unreliable just be aware,1.0
booked wondering if cheap rate meant cheap service thankfully we were wrong large clean spacious rooms extremely helpful and friendly staff minutes walk from train station then minutes to central station fabulous bar to relax in with great bar staff would highly recommend,1.0
we stayed at the sandymount on our last night after a week in ireland i had picked it due to price and as we had stayed in ballsbridge previously which is nearby i knew that it would be a nice area what i had realised was that it was withing excellent proximity to the port which was perfect for us as we had an early ferry to catch in the morning the staff were immediately very helpful we arrived early but they let us into our room and gave us details of how to get into dublin they were really friendly and lovely with our daughter who was a bit shy we had a lovely stay at the sandymount albeit short however i would definitely return next time i am visiting dublin,1.0
the hotel was well located for transport links and also for shops restaurants the hotel was also close to the hospital in case whilst staying anyone needed it it was very clean throughout and staff were very helpful there was a hairdryer in the room if you needed one and the rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed as well as complimentary toiletries i traveled alone but i felt very safe there breakfast was very nice buffet style pool and jacuzzi was also very nice the hotel is not in the central tourist area which was nice but it was close enough to be able to get anywhere in the city,1.0
we had a great stay here and i recommend to anyone with the budget to stay here the hotel itself was of a good standard if not quite being the absolute top end and our room was functional if unspectacular what really stood out were the excellent staff who from the management down made us feel exceptionally welcome and really comfortable we moved from another hotel of the same price point and there was a notable improvement in the care and attention the staff gave us here on top of that there is a fantastic bar and pool on the rooftop as well as the great food and drinks,1.0
great hotel on the doorstep of all the vibrant pubs of temple bar min walk from the river liffey all local buses and tour buses within a few yards lovely breakfast in the floor restaurant entertainment every night in the vat bar in the hotel look forward to coming back some day,1.0
the hotel is very close to sloterdijk station you can go everywhere where you want from there hotel rooms are clean beds are comfortable and also hotel stuffs are very friendly rooms has own kitchen it includes microwave owen water heater so you can cook in your room enjoy and another thing is breakfast it is also perfect it has a large menu,1.0
my girlfriend and i spent a week at this hotel and had a great time the location was perfect great breakfast and cozy rooms for improvement purposes i like to focus on some things that could have been better starting with the service and employees they were friendly and helpful when we asked for help also that it was staff there we got the feeling that it was a lot of staff working there but only one for the hotel part and the rest for the bakery so it was not so much of personal contact which often is appreciated just to have someone at the hotel help the tourists that staying there with things that can improve the whole vacation to barcelona by guiding to restaurants public transportation sightseeing and other the beds they had some extra madress that was awful to sleep on so during the last few days i had to take that off the bed to get some cleaners did a good job to make it tidy every day though one simple thing to improve the stay would to have toilet brushes to stay in the bathroom so we can keep the bathrooms clean ourselfs which would have improved our bread that was served for breakfast was delicious though it would be appreciated to have some more yoghurt cerials etc and more things to put on the bread and eat also the logistics for where the glasses plates bread toaster and drinks are placed is not,1.0
a group of visited for nights with of us per room the rooms varied in size and though some were perhaps on the small side my friend and i were fortunate enough to share a larger room which included a large bathroom plenty wardrobe space and a nespresso machine all of the rooms were very tasteful and clean and tidy being a large group of scottish girls we were rather noisy when getting ready for our nights out so we were advised on a few occasions to be quieter but staff were very pleasant about it which makes all of the difference the majority of time we got taxi into the centre though the heineken experience and some lovely bars and bakeries were close by would highly recommend this hotel and would consider returning again providing it was only to a room,1.0
this hotel was a short tram ride to the city centre minutes the hotel was spotless friendly and helpful staff free bike hire from was included in our night stay which was self service good selection of cereals with a choice of yogurts dried fruit bread and cheese along with a selection of hotel focuses on healthy lifestyle which reflects the type of breakfast served our room came with a kitchenette which was more than adequate even had a dishwasher the hotel is attached to a small shopping mall so if you want to prepare a simple meal or a picnic it worth getting your groceries from one of the bed was enormous and so comfortable slept really well after being out and about all day,1.0
family with kids stayed nights in an executive corner suite second visit friendly check in process with drinks offered large suite with lounge area queen sized beds bathroom with bathtub separate shower and toilet room was cleaned twice daily this is a huge hotel with a lot of guests from all over the world so it tends to be a bit busy especially the pool area which might be a bit small compared to the size of the hotel it can be difficult to get a sunbed by the breakfast buffet with and its also possible to order eggs any style etc from the attentive staff great by the pool and a nice cocktail bar close to the reception area world class spa on the floor top notch concierge service and we got some great restaurant distance to the beach a ton of restaurants nearby the hotel is first class all the way and its easy to recommend definitely worth a try a good tip is to use the express check out form so you do not have to wait in line when leaving,1.0
stayed here for nights great location terrace bar and restaurant lovely in the heart of the city with plenty of things to see and do would recommend boat trip from hotel euros each worth every penny hired bikes from hotel good rates overall lovely only small moan room service not the best dirty glasses not picked up some items not replaced or restocked,1.0
this is a lovely hotel and i enjoyed a large heritage room on a recent trip to dublin while the property is well located and clearly a fine hotel more than a few staff parade around with a sense that they are tolerating the great unwashed who are also customers mind you on balance there are far too many traveller who seem to confuse casual dressing with sloppy this snobbish behaviour amongst staff was most apparent with the method they use to seat people in the bar or restaurants very few of these service staff sport a smile and carry the mood of one making funeral arrangements i did not encounter anyone on staff but the concierge desk who was a native irish person good this be a eu cultural issue hard to say but it was notable despite being a gold level marriott customer for a fine hotel alternative i would opt for the merrion or westbury on my next visit,1.0
the nice big star room it was hotel was at walking distance to our ship very easy to walk along the boardwalk even with the employees at the desk were very courteous and helped us a lot for roaming around the stay,1.0
this is such a fantastic hotel we stayed here for nights in february and it was super cool to stay in such a hip place the decor was awesome the room was clean and comfortable and i really wish i had just purchased some of the amenities when i checked out because i still kinda miss the scents even though it was in the middle of the winter the albert cuyp market was in right outside the hotel i have such a great photo of fruit at one of the booths we walked everywhere for those few it was very easy to do the locals would be riding their bikes through the snowfall but i definitely saw a tourist take a pretty mean fall while trying to slow down going over a canal bridge winter biking is not for the faint of heart the hotel was pretty easy to get to from the airport getting off at museumplein and walking a couple blocks we did choose to trudge through the deep snow with our giant wheeled suitcases we were traveling for a month and it was dumb but a cab might be the more reasonable option or perhaps not winter travel no regrets,1.0
the hotel is located on the premiere street of barcelona passeig de which is known for its shopping restaurants and spanish is a small boutique hotel which has an awning in front with the hotel name then several magnificent doors but at first try none seem to open it lobby is small but there is a breakfast room on the next floor up which is a lounge with coffee tea and cold flavored waters during the day and cava from every evening we arrived in the early am and since our room was not available our luggage was stored the front desk associates would not confirm what floor our room was on but indicated that the jr suites were only on one of two floors one of which was the first floor which was not acceptable to us it was puzzling since we were the first to why we could not have the room we had requested however upon we did in fact get that reception associates are quite helpful with reservations and directions the breakfast buffet was plentiful with pastries meat cheese yogurt cereals and eggs on room was quite contemporary keeping with the hotel decor there was a king size bed a nice television a closet and no drawer space if a guest weto stay more than a few days we did not so the space was bathroom had a shower with a ceiling rainfall shower and a handheld as well as a bidet the toiltetry kit was,1.0
the fresh hotel was a good hotel to stay very clean and friendly the only thing we found very expensive was the restaurant on the roof top these prices were way more expensive than your local restaurants in the area and at the plaka bit of a shame really with such a good spot on the area is a bit run down but safe and easy walking distance to the square for min walk to plaka easy walking,1.0
worst stay ever they are renovating the whole place you could not even find the enterance it looked like no one was living there should not be up an running could not sleep through the night due to extreme noise from the builders try to compensate with breakfast but it does not make up for it we were super excited to go here and could not have been more disappointed the room did not look anything like they show you in photos and it was extremely dirty our bedsheets had holes in them and the bedside table was so gross i didnt want to touch it but what was true is that you get a big it just not possible to use it worst stay ever do go her staff is not very helpfull or welcoming not going back,0.0
this large hotel offers an excellent price for value ratio probably one of the best on this side of the city nice staff good breakfast with table service for hot drinks and buffet for the rest pretty high standards in the bedroom and bathroom i really liked their orla kiely soap shampoo and body lotion this hotel also offers a rather quick access to the city centre min walk or appropriate for business trips i have stayed there many times over the past year maybe less for a romantic stay as this is mostly a business one issue the restaurant downstairs is specialised in burgers and beers not the ideal place if you on a diet,1.0
hotel is beautiful and liveable staff anticipate needs and are examples of helpfulness the entire staff are gracious and anxious to please but in a quiet reserved manner food is excellent and well presented i recommend that you stay here if you are in dublin,1.0
my husband and i just spent three nights at the gibson we were very pleased with all aspects of the hotel including decore cleanliness and comfort all staff are helpful and there are various aspects that give the hotel an extra touch of class such as fresh apples by the elevators and beautiful roses in the lobby to take to your room there is a tram stop outside but we preferred walking to the center,1.0
i have traveled far and wide and this is by far on the top of my list of hotels i had a million questions prior to arrival i would email and get instant responses anastasia was always ready with an answer the staff organized dinners and trips prior to our arrival which made everything go so were greeted by jan as soon as the cab pulled up they do have a car that will pick you up but the cab is cheaper he brought up our bags clearly loving his job jan also went out of his way to come to our room with recommendations as he knew we were off to begur other amazing receptionists were daniella and sergio meziane who worked the rooftop bar was so fun and interesting to talk to and then there was sandra i just loved her i asked for coffee with half and half she did know what that was and we laughed and laughed as i explained our strange american ways then she brought me half milk and half cream in different containers and the next morning there she was waiting with my coffee what a were many other wonderful staff i missed some of their names give them all a raise everybody had a smile at all room gorgeous we had the standard room it was huge but it was just perfect the bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in big fluffy pillows and great towels and robes,1.0
the hotel is typical stars with a minibar and safe box it is clean and the towels cosmetics etc changed daily the hotel situated at the intersection of the streets carrer de viladomat carrer de valencia and carrer d arago in a calm area the noise from the construction work across the hotel front was felt just one morning for days spent at the hotel the closest metro is at m called roca fort exit cambria the station has exits on one hand the hotel is not far away from the downtown boutiques and department stores and tourist attractions on the other hand km in the humid and hot nevertheless such a position beyond the tourist area has an advantage you may eat better and very good seafood restaurant called the crown marine is located at the intersection of carrer d arago and carrer rocafort esquina carrer carrer de rocafort barcelona normally it is not cheap but the menu served from pm to pm is only euro the dishes of the menu are changed every day and they are all delicious because of the local clients it is almost impossible to find a table up to pm later it is quite possible the trip from the airport to the hotel is possible by taxi subway metro or express bus the bus stop is m off the exit from the main terminal of the airport baggage claim of arrival area on your right the bus is called aerobus the cost is,1.0
what a great hotel in a fab location lots of road works going on all around but that really ca be helped we arrived to a free room upgrade to a junior suite no idea why but it was a big clean spacious room so who were we to argue the bed was huge as was the bathroom the hotel is situated in a great location a short walk to all the museums and not too far walk to anne franks house which was a pleasant walk along the canals hotel staff were really helpful and very informative would definitely stay here again,1.0

this hotel promised a lot however we had a few hiccups the front desk ladies were lovely and extremely helpful however the owner is an elderly gentleman who got involved in a dispute we had i was unable to pay with my travel credit card loaded with euros as it came up on the payment screen with the option to pay in my jo currency i said no as i did have any of my home currency on the card just euros but they would accept it i had to go down the road and get cash out costing me fees instead of using my card like i normally would in every other place it seems like the owner runs his business before the computer was invented with piles of folders behind the desk with all the paperwork i felt sorry for the girls working there another issue we had was that our room was in another part of the building so we had to pass through two locked doors with difficult locks to get to our room we also had no way of looking outside as we had double windows open one to reveal more frosted glass which was very claustrophobic the room itself was fine although the handheld shower was a pain,0.0
we stayed in a family room which was plenty big for adults and children the hotel was very accommodating and provided an extra bed for my brother when he arrived early before his hotel was ready the rooms are clean and the location ca be beat you can walk to all the main sites in dublin the hotel is in an area that has a lot of nightclubs so if you are a light sleeper you will be awoken when the clubs let out about from street noise but if you want to partake the hotel is partnered with the harcourt hotel up the street and allows you admission to their for free,1.0
good friendly staff at reception and was very requested an additional bed for our son and it was promptly brought in and set for is good but bbq restaurant is even was a pleasant experience to stay,1.0

this was my first trip to amsterdam and i was super exited the check in went smoothly and the rooms were quite spacious there was some construction going on at the hotels higher floors which were a bit of a disturbance apart from that the overall stay was great the rooms were clean the bathrooms were well taken care of very easy access to all the attractions of the city,1.0
good quality hotel which we chose mainly because of its location next to the cruise port room had a superb view of the harbour and the cruise ships in port only a short walk into the city centre for good sized room friendly staff especially the concierge who guided us on the best way to check in for our cruise we did not have breakfast at the hotel as it was very expensive at per person may be okay for business travellers on expenses but not for a family,1.0
hotel is centrally located this hotel is spotlessly clean very friendly staff excellent breakfast airconditioned the reading lamp above the table should be at a higher level though location is brilliant walking distance to all amenities such as the shopping street minute walk for the temple bar area,1.0
casa mimosa was a very nice hotel located on a quiet street but very close to major attractions sagrada familia and plaza catyluna our king sized room was quite spacious with great amenities upon we were greeted with a welcome drink and a very nice overview of the city my boyfriend and i actually got lost walking back from the beach because our phones died and of course we left the map but we spotted another property and they were just as nice in getting us on our way back to casa mimosa next time we are in barcelona this is where we will stay hands down,1.0
we stayed at athens cypria hotel three nights in late june to booked several months in advance rooms for two families a family unit for four people that included two double rooms with a connecting door and a superior triple room for three adults that included one king bed and one single bed separated by a partition also had a jacuzzi rooms were spacious clean and hotel location is excellent in a small and quiet alley that starts from the famous ermou street within walking distance to all major sights in the city minutes walk from syntagmatos hotel has been recently renovated which is a big plus its design is modern and pleasant the breakfast was excellent it included everything needed to open the day staff was friendly and courteous a very good choice to explore the city by foot,1.0
beautiful hotel roof top bar and pool we did see any of athens cause we were only there for one night but the hotel is perfect the staff are friendly there is a bakery across the road that has some nice foods in it for an extra euro we got a check out you have to organise this when you check in though would have liked to see a bit more of athens so next time maybe we have the opportunity to explore the beds in this hotel were the most comfortable we had during our four week trip in europe great views of the city from the roof top restaurant,1.0
boy did we learn the hard way do your research before booking the only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location close to the city if i could grade this hotel with a or even a i would this is a star hotel with a popular nightclub on site warned about noise after check in even found the hotel provided ear plugs which did work we were provided with twin beds in a claustrophobic hotbox one small window which had to be closed at night to minimise the noise from the nightclub the ensuite was small and had a broken toilet lid and seat in the room there was outdated information regarding meals in reality we found breakfast available everyday lunch only mon friday no evening meals for guests on weekends bar on a saturday not open until for the nightclub no room service no obvious facilities for the nightclub proved to be a nightmare for us with the amount of noise generated and also the noise generated by the staff cleaning up and disposing of glass bottles at around am hotel does not provide parking and after being directed to a car park minutes walk away from the hotel that supposedly gave hotel guests a discounted rate we found that we were charged the normal rate wifi poor inconsistent unreliable the staff came across as indifferent and brusque towards hotel summary grossly overpriced accommodation for the poor accommodation and service it provides we do not recommended this hotel,0.0

the hotel location is perfect for anyone on business or is on holiday it walkable to all major attractions the rooms are large well equipped with everything you would need and are very clean my only gripe would be that the shower was that powerful but if i came back to dublin i would look to stay here again for sure,1.0
my husband and i stayed here for four nights recently the hotel is a minute walk to the main la ramble strip so not far at all lots of lovely restaurants on the hotel is lovely the rooms were huge but well equipped for what we needed the hotel was quiet for being on the street only negative had to be the roof top pool it is lovely up there but only has sun loungers which were impossible to get and once someone did they stayed on all day the rest of the seating is a mixture of table and chairs and deck chairs which were very uncomfortable to try and sunbathe in i not sure why there are more sun loungers if it for space most people were using two decks anyway one for sitting on and one for legs the second negative was the pool bar service we were lucky if bar tender came up once and when he did he waited until he got a lot of orders then got the elevator down floors to bring up your drink this took about an hour from ordering we also ordered some tapas to the roof which took about hrs mins to arrive it a silly way of doing it would be better to not offer the service and let people take their own drinks to the pool which people were doing or have it manned from lunch than the roof top issues we would return here as everything,1.0
as a ihg elite member we have been lucky enough to stay at a number of crowne plaza hotels and i really have to say amsterdam south is our number one following our family weeks stay from the july until the july rooms on the and floors were perfect had everything we needed were quiet and were impeccably cleaned and made up every day when the hairdryer broke just one call to reception and a replacement was in the room within minutes a crisis diverted the meal choices were all you could ask for with breakfast and dinner within the hotel providing excellent choice and quality of food presentations it surpassed even our high expectations congratulations to all of us would very much like to thank everyone on the front desk and housekeeping for providing great customer service and those little touches that mean so much to a guest we would like to highly recommend angela cindy and annelieve hovenor for exceptional service at every breakfast time and michael behind the hot plates they deserve individual recognition miss not certain why other contributors have criticised the hotels location yes its outside of the city centre but you know this before you make a reservation it is perfect for the peace and quiet it brings and its location within the business district gives one a great insight into the modern architectural building designs being brought into the five minute stroll from the hotel in one direction and you can catch the,1.0

this hotel was outstanding in many ways loved staying in the gothic quarter of barcelona with it many tiny pedestrian only streets and great shopping just around the corner not only did our second floor room have a beautiful view of the cathedral just across the plaza but the rooftop views were outstanding rooftop has a small wading pool with at least deck areas with high top tables to enjoy the views and take photos our room was gorgeous updated with a beautiful tufted headboard lovely fabrics throughout on curtain panels bedding pillows and upholstery in different shades of blue and green very clean and nice large bathroom with sinks nice water pressure in shower room also came with a great espresso machine and fridge too would highly recommend this hotel because if it location views and luxurious feel,1.0

this hotel is in a great location only around mins from the airport and mins to the city centre the breakfast was amazing and the staff friendly and helpful the lobby area is a little dated however the room was a really good standard and we always had a peaceful nights sleep for the nights we were there there are a couple of places you can eat across the road from the hotel as well as a fish and chip shop and a dominos buses run from outside the hotel and only cost euros taxis are expensive but dublin is expensive overall anyway so it is expected overall a nice comfortable hotel in a good location,1.0
recently i took my mom to dublin for a day of sightseeing and tracing our family roots at the national library we stopped into to shelbourne for lunch and were pleased beyond belief the service was outstanding and the food was incredible the signature burger was all it promised and more the wine selection was fabulous and the atmosphere made the experience complete,1.0
really cool and nice hotel situated within walkable distance to many sights in dublin stayed for nights the room was nice superoom comfortable bed and lots of amenities as we stayed over the weekend and on the floor there was a lot of noise from the hotel bars luckily they provide you with earplugs so we got a good night sleep either way had dinner one night at sophie topfloor and had tasteful gnocchi reservation is recommended aspecially during the weekend as the place was packed would like to come back at another occasion recommended,1.0
i had a very bad experience with this hotel staying days most of the worst customer services you will ever get especially senior managers of the hotel are not helpful and rude they look tired and they totally dont want to work it looks like if they are making favours to the customers by replying if you booked this hotel just cancel it as it will ruin your holidays which you have worked so hard for they make your stay stressful and without any services at all and its not that close to the centre you still have to get a taxi to the centre by walk it will take you at least min there is no such balcony as on the all you get is one small window looking outside so do even rely on their pictures on the website basically you will flush your money for no service not great room not great view breakfasts has no choice at all very poor prices are too high for such place absolutely waste of money,0.0

if your main priorities are getting an excellent location without having to pay much then this is for you it just a short walk away from monastiraki station and a number of the ancient sites and is surrounded by places to eat the price was amazing but the facilities were basic i had a private room with shared bathroom but the walls were and did block out any street noise there were some opaque windows for light but no view to be had but if all you after is a place to sleep at night it does the job and i no complaints,0.0
my partner and i stayed here for days in august and we loved it the hotel is very modern and the tablets in the rooms to control temperature mood lighting tv etc was a really cool touch the staff were very welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived until we left the tram into the centre of amsterdam is a few seconds walk from the hotel and runs really frequently the breakfast at the hotel however did look very appetising also the prices in the canteen were a bit extortionate for small nibbles and refreshments apart from this it was a really good hotel to stay in and would recommend,1.0

i honestly wasn t expecting too much before i arrived here but was really happy when i did the room was spacious with a comfortable bed and really nice bathroom the aircon worked great and having the balcony with a really nice view made it even rooftop bar and pool was amazing offering stunning views of the city and and a secluded way to relax even though the pool is fairly small it is normally quiet and so wasn t much of an breakfast buffet was simple but nice and there was a decent selection of hot and cold food,1.0

singel canal is an amazing location with flower market at one end and central station the other has red light brothels cafes and restaurants churches and arts eclectic like all of the netherlands our delux rooms were a decent size some with spa ordinary rooms you would struggle to have two suitcases open at the same time staff are brilliant decor is extravagant old world charm elevators minute taxi service ca fault the place,1.0
after looking dir a good central hotel we found this hotel nice help staff they even allow us stay longer until for extra for people was big breakfast was nice is perfect,1.0
the room was terrible it was so small with no sunlight and ages old carpet the pictures on trip advisor and other party sites are deceptive there might be some rooms which are better but the room that was offered to me was not at all i would have booked if i had seen earlier me and my friend arrived here at around midnight and as soon as we saw the room we decided to leave the receptionist gave us another room to check out but it was no different so we asked him to cancel the reservation and give us our money back which was around he said due to their hours cancellation policy he could do the money back with all these back and forth by this time it was and since we paid so much already we stayed in the night we stayed in with a suffocating feeling the whole night and the old smell on top of this there was only a thin sheet to cover no comforter or anything and the bed was like a box spring so disappointed not how i wanted my vacation to start i would not recommend this hotel,0.0

excellent hotel great family suites incredible breakfast with lots of food options toys and coloring books for kids super friendly staff will come back ca say enough great things was super impressed,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay nice location t a lovely property with caring staff the check in process was very easy note there are a few steps at the front entrance they helped with the luggage but it could be an issue if lobby has a living area with comfy lounge chairs and sofas they have coffee tea and sodas during the day then break out the beer wine spirits and snacks around they leave it out all evening fun the rooms are nicely furnished but quite small when we return we opt for a larger room the beds were really comfortable and the air conditioner worked complimentary breakfast was outstanding the evening desk staff was really terrific,1.0
very nice clean up to date art deco style hotel in the heart of perfect sight seeing easy walk to christ church cathedral patricks dublin castle temple bar trinity college stephen green plenty of restaurants and pubs staff was very professional given that there are plenty of hotels in that same area i would stay there again as long as the price remains competitive i would not pay more for it,1.0
the hotel is virtually right across from the main station which is a plus we found the hotel a walk for most things we wanted to do but not a overly taxing distance the staff was helpful pleasant knowledgeable and had very good recommendations on restaurants in the area not a terrific value but not certainly not bad very clean and meticulously kept hotel certainly not a bad decision to stay seems many rooms lack much of a view,1.0
outdated no air conditioning tiny dirty rooms soiled bed linens no screens in windows loud music every night until am rude staff overcharged on bill upon departure all around huge disappointment only saving grace is location not worth the money,0.0
stayed here on a day break for my bday lovely hotel clean and friendly staff stayed on floor with stunning views over the city hotel surprised me with champagne and cake which was a nice treat hotel is a good distance from ramblas and will cost between in a taxi which will get expensive if you use it a lot metro and public transport is right outside so good to get into places only downside was we had a leak from upstairs toilet blockage leaking through our ceiling which was dealt with asap by hotel staff the lifts in hotel are painfully slow when its busy but apart from that it a lovely place i would visit again ps from airport to hotel,1.0
hotel glories is clean with large rooms and the staff are had a very enjoyable stay in our air conditioned room located close to the strada which was the main reason for our visit perfect,1.0
from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff and management could not have done any more for us they are very professional kind and understanding no matter what you ask of them the answer is always no problemthe king room was perfect and very bright and a view of o connell st the location was very good especially for anybody with a disability of any kind the hotel is central to all transport shops and concert venues with many theaters near by james is peter collins deputy he took us under his wing and our every need was seen to the food was excellent and the staff at the bar restaurant were also excellent in particular beata we award her employee of the month as she was so patient with us at mealtimes and went beyond the call of duty to see that we enjoyed our stay a big thank you to you all,1.0
with less than a block to walk to catch the tram you are in the city in minutes and can easily navigate the city rooms are clean good beds and the front desk is excessively helpful do get a room on the front if you are in the three lowest floors because street lights shine in and the noise from the restaurant across the street is loud the other room was on the floor not on the front and had no street lights and no traffic or pub noise,1.0
we walked from the station in under minutes would have been less if we not trusted g maps very friendly and helpful welcome and check in the staff here are young friendly efficient and bright good english and great at telling you everything you need to know to make the most of your time in amsterdam our room was a little dark but had everything we needed for nights and just a short walk from jordaan in our opinion the best of amsterdam we recommend sebastian,1.0
my husband and i stayed at the brooks hotel immediately upon arriving in ireland the hotel was a great welcoming to the beautiful country first and foremost the staff was wonderful and very friendly it was also centrally located to all the main attractions which we loved being able to walk every where one down side to our experience is that our hotel overlooked a roof with a generator so not really what we were hoping for but we did spend much time in the hotel anyways the only thing holding me back from rating stars is that this hotel was a bit overpriced in total my husband and i were in ireland for and a half weeks and this hotel was the most expensive one we stayed in however not the nicest the price may be in large part due to it being in dublin however there were far fancier hotels we stayed in across the country at a better value overall great staff and wonderful location,1.0
the hotel arts was meant to be one of the best hotels in barcelona but it does not live up to this hype at those reading this you will probably see all the other star reviews and think this guy is talking nonsense but the truth is that this hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre with no soul or atmosphere if you are a family do go here stay at the there was a queue for the lifts and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a paying customers should get priority i think the swimming pool was as small as a fish tank the water was as cold as the atmosphere for a hotel with floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area furthermore there were no changing rooms on the pool level disappointing for a five star hotel on the contrary when we visited the w hotel which was cheaper saw it had multiple panoramic pools large and spacious enough for a luxury food was another problem our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of euros for a family of the pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed euros at max to make but was sold at over euros just because this is,0.0
look up when you get near dam square the hotel name is up on the walk from central station location is everything to was first you want a good place to sleep and a great breakfast look no further,1.0

we wanted a hotel close enough to dublin to explore and to easily get back to the ferry as we only had night here this hotel was perfect rooms are very modern and roomy the white company toiletries are a nice touch we did eat here but had a drink in the bar in the evening the service was quick and the staff very helpful would recommend a stay here and would definitely return,1.0
pros the staff was extremely polite friendly and helpful the breakfast had the best display of all the hotels we stayed at during our trip rooms were clean but a bit small we just chalked it up to being european first stay had the small shower but at the end of the trip we scored a room with a normal size location is a bit shady hotel itself is nice area surrounding hotel not so much area seemed a bit shady we did walk around the city but only during the day and took cabs back after dark definitely watch purses and wallets etc as you do get approached for handouts we really did have any major problems and found most people helpful elevators although adorable are very small people with a suitcase small but quaint,1.0
loved the hotel great location easy to get to everything staff was very friendly breakfast was a bit pricey but we did opt to get that beds are very comfortable i was very happy with the hotel and would gladly stay there again,1.0
something went wrong with our booking through airtours but the staff at belmoral let us sleep over one night and have breakfast buffet before finding our booking the next morning strongly recommend the hotel really nice room and breakfast buffet on top of that,1.0

my partner and i stayed at w for nights and it was hands down one of the best hotel experiences we ever had we felt both at home and immediately connected to the city and it surrounding beauty thanks to w wonderful facilities services and obvious w places an enormous emphasis on the small details from their retro design influences stylish decor immaculate rooms and wide range of facilities to their personal friendly and very helpful staff so much thought has been put into making this hotel stand out from the rest all staff on the door reception providing room service and housekeeping attention to detail were clearly as a result of a well organized team that communicate efficiently and effectively there was even a fire alarm thankfully no fire on one evening and we were so impressed with how professional and stress free the evacuation procedure was dealt with by the mod security and all others involved the spa facilities are equally unique and professionally run super friendly and genuinely interested staff clean and relaxing environment and one of the best massages i ever had thanks michelle and team for the wonderful leads me to my final and equally special moment at w the rooftop terrace restaurant and bar spectacular sunset view delicious food veg and meat lovers alike and a really great atmosphere once again thanks to w top class family of staff w has something kind of wonderful with kind and wonderful staff we look forward to,1.0
we stayed at the metropolitan hotel in june for nights and were incredibly disappointed with this hotel the lobby appears reasonable however once you enter the elevator that is where the illusion stops the hallways are old and dark and you feel like you are going on a school camp rather than an apparent star establishment the room was terrible a very old looking room in desperate need of an upgrade the bed was horrible a regular sized double bed which felt like we were sleeping on pins as the mattress was very thin the overall room and bathroom state was very disappointing once we saw the room we thought perhaps an upgrade to the suite may help once again it was marginally better however we had no choice but to stay due to our travel commitments the outside noise travels in very easily will never stay here again,0.0
i think this hotel made our stay in bacelona this was a splurge for us but might be pretty basic for others the staff was always outgoing and helpful the location was perfect i am of limited mobility and ca walk long distances this was our first trip abroad since i became thus so planning was a bit stressful i communicated via email with the staff in my also limited spanish several times before the trip they were very patient my english interpretation of their emails seemed to tell me that they were reserving two rooms for us when we arrived their room on the ground floor pisa was awaiting and by that time i was so fully aware of my travel limitations that i never even enquired about the regular room i was so glad the accessible room was great a bit dark perhaps but it had a small patio where we could sit with coffee and look up at the apartments of barcelonans very near above our heads the room was very quiet but there is absolutely no view this is a not a truly full service hotel one is supposed to take breakfast to the room and then leave dirty dishes outside the door awaiting for instance but when i did commit this faux pas the first morning the woman who ran breakfast explained the policy in spanish but then let me do it anyway i never did it again but her attitude bespoke my experience of,1.0

i returned for my third visit to this hotel last week for an overnight stay in dublin the first time i visited was when the hotel was a doubletree that was an excellent stay with a large room and good views i returned in april this year for the first time as the clayton and also enjoyed the stay although that time i had a much smaller room and a view of the buildings at the back of the hotel instead because of this i booked an executive king instead of the standard room for this visit as i hoped it would be for a larger room similar to my first stay you can imagine my absolute awe when i was out of the blue upgraded to the presidential suite upon checking in the member of staff who checked me in was so so lovely and i only wish i had asked for her name to be able to mention her directly in this review she even took the time to ask the next day how the trip had been and i left feeling most looked after thank for the presidential i was speechless it was beautiful with wonderful views a living area dining area kitchen two bathrooms two coffee stations a wardrobe a study area and the most comfortable bed needless to say none of the intended plans for the city that night took place as it was much more enjoyable to just have a few drinks in the,1.0

we celebrated our honeymoon in ireland and my husband booked a room at the davenport hotel from the outside it a beautiful hotel and when we checked in it was a beautiful lobby i was really excited and then we walked into the room when we walked there was an issue with the electricity within the room we called to the front desk who called several electricians into the room to fix the problem the electricians came in and out of the room for an hour and were able to fix the issue but we lost an hour of our time with no apology or compensation the room was comfortable but a bit dated and really needed to be remodeled the bathtub had wood on the sides additionally there was spots of blood on the shower curtain and the clocks were set at the wrong time which made us an hour late for a tour with all the hotels in dubin i would book this one again,0.0

booked the hotel initially for being close to the train station as we were heading to madrid we directly got the feeling that we should have stayed more there as the room was so spacious and the staff very friendly breakfast was great with wide variety and a great view of this part of the city,1.0
we stayed as a couple in the hotel based on reviews however we paid over euros per night for a tired room on arrival the reception area was very impressive however on check in we were directed up a corridor through a security door into what seemed to be a back hotel the room we were given was in a back corridor with tired facilities that overlooked another part of a hotel very disappointing especially considering the price we paid for nights,0.0
hotel staff are friendly helpful and speak many languages the hotel has all the amenities expected of a star hotel with the added surprise of a wonderful roof top terrace with pool and spacious sun lounge area and amazing views over the city prices of drinks and food in the hotel are reasonable for a city hotel room was very clean comfortable and well equipped a bit smaller than expected but in good condition and with a very effective air conditioner the hotel has excellent access to the local metro and a superb bakery which also does some take away food during the day in front of the hotel there are bars if you do want to drink in the hotel and a small estatorio lots of typical greek mezze and gyros as well a decent round the corner called alexander the great whilst the area is somewhat run down it is not that different from most of the other areas of athens unless you are right in syntagma square i would definitely stay here again,1.0
hotel is situated in center and metro is not far away minutes but neighborhood is big problem drug edicts pickpockets jobless etc at evening armed security in front of hotel so recommend to order taxi to leave and return to hotel we were warned each tome from taxi drivers to be careful in that part of is ok but not enough tables for all guests cue for elevator as it is small and there is only are old dusty and carpets are full of stains beds are comfortable units are silent so it is possible to sleep if you leave them switched is ok with hairdryer but we were missing liquid soap dispenser was empty for all safety deposit box in all rooms some have some not that was a problem,0.0

the location of this hotel is great and i could fault the staff they were very friendly and helpful the main issue was that the room themselves are very tired and extremely noisy whilst we stayed we did manage to sleep the good due to being kept awake or woken up by people walking or talking in any room adjoining or even above us due to the laminate flooring and thin walls this was extremely disappointing considering it is meant to be a hotel,0.0
the waldorf is a beautiful hotel that is centrally located the location and accommodations were as perfect as it gets from our gorgeous room that overlooked the garden to the lively lobby to the bar in the basement everything was perfect the staff is as helpful and polite as you can possibly be they always greet you with a smile and do whatever it takes to exceed your expectations the waldorf is a storied iconic brand and the waldorf amsterdam lives up to it reputation service style are their hallmark,1.0
although the hotel needs a little refreshing its location near christchurch cathedral puts it near most of the major attractions in dublin the hotel is very clean and comfortable the breakfast buffet was wonderful a great way to start the day but the thing that really made the stay a great one was the staff they were very helpful and accommodating loved my stay there,1.0

i strongly recommend this hotel as it excelled in every aspect other than the check in process more on that later once we were checked in and parked the bartender walked us to our room in a separate building a bit down the street to tell us all the benefits of the hotel and instruct us on everything we needed to know about the room he was most charming and personal and did not leave before he was assured that we were satisfied with our room the room was nicely sized and decorated seductively with genuinely comfortable beds and a very nice and modern we especially loved the outdoor garden and intimate feel of the hotel though i am not sure whether it was part of their duties the three bartenders we met were keenly aware of what people generally needed at the hotel and quick to make sure that guests were looked after in every way my only criticism of the hotel was the check in process which left me ignored and waiting for too long while the staff answered phones and ordered taxis it should be noted that there is no designated place to unload leaving guests to utilize an illegal spot and risk being ticketed overnight parking is either on the street if you are lucky enough to find it for per day with a valet service that the hotel will phone for you at per day or in a garage that is a minute walk away,1.0
we wanted a light lunch and found just the thing in the merrion lobby bar we had the number each which consisted of a small bowl of delicious soup a small assortment of crust less sandwiches and a small chocolate dessert it just hit the spot the surroundings are beautiful with some excellent decor and art just sit and de stress after a days shopping on grafton street,1.0
we had the misfortune in encountering a taxi strike the day we left barcelona and would probably have missed our flights had paula not alerted us to the problem and arranged a solution this hotel is close to the gracia neighbourhood which is a great place to eat and explore and is only away from the metro which takes you to place catalunya which is central stayed at this hotel for a week and was totally rested,1.0
we traveled in july as a family of adults kids so the set up of this apartment was pretty great it had bedrooms with queen bed with twin beds and a pull out couch in the living room our room was top floor i believe and had an obstructed view of the sagrada familia but a view nonetheless loved our view and having drinks on the staff was not very warm we never once were greeted with a smile or offered assistance proactively though to be fair they were happy to help when asked we travel a lot so really appreciate courteous front desk day of days we decided to do laundry only to find out the washing machine was broken would have been the end of the world if the machine had partially filled up with water so at pm we had to insist that they find another place to wash our clothes since we could pack wet clothes it was a bit of a drama and the lady at the front desk helped but it was a less than ideal way to end our i would still recommend this place had the washing machine been functioning properly we could have lived with the rest of it the location is fab walking distance to many little grocery stores more authentic restaurants and of course the sagrada familia no matter what you heard otherwise book tix in advance another tip we never had a chance to eat at the restaurant,1.0
stayed with husband and son for a long weekend location is fab very close to beach and fab restaurants cafes and bars a stones throw from the hotel due to recent surgery i have mobility issues so this was just perfect we walked to beach and picked up tour bus which allowed us to see barcelona without much walking pool is small but sufficient for our needs no pool bar but plenty of supermarkets round about to buy your own drinks etc that you can have at pool no towels either so most people used towels from their room did have breakfast in the hotel as plenty of places round about to try rooms are a good size and very clean air conditioning very effective perfect location for us and we will definitely return,1.0
really high quality hotel lovely pool on the roof with the view of the acropolis was worth the price alone also the balcony with the view of the acropolis was definitely worth the situated for the major attractions and really near the tourist area shops and restaurants do hire a car and drive here though the streets are a nightmare we saw many cars damaged on the side of the streets taxis are plentiful and relatively was well worth the cost very extensive range good quality and lovely courtyard to eat in with separate smoking area too dinner was nice for the view but we found the menu bit exotic or foodie for our tastes and not so much greek however if your tastes run that way you might really enjoy the food here alternatively there are some lovely traditional greek restaurants within a few minutes room was quite large relatively for europe with nice decor and a comfortable bed very clean as addition we left a dress and a jacket in the wardrobe and once we contacted them it was shipped back to us as a very reasonable cost so we highly recommend their staff and customer services,1.0
this is in the old section just a few minutes walk from metro which made it very convenient narrow streets with shops and supermarkets close by the hotel had a nice courtyard with rooms all around it the service was friendly and the breakfast very good and plenty full,1.0
this is such a stunning hotel stayed there for nights in july and loved it the style the architecture the location and the service everything was up to the highest standards i did have the chance to try the food or the breakfast here but based on the hotel grounds and room i will definitely recommend it,1.0
i really want to like this place and write a great review and it is great in many respects funky quirky designed room great bar and reception area and friendly staff but i in a room which is literally a handful of metres from copperface jacks nightclub it on a tuesday night and the music has only just stopped pumping out i booked via and did see any reference at point of purchase to the noise level and it fair to say i have experienced anything like it in a hotel really disappointed i here for business have barely slept and will be knackered tomorrow the earplugs were not a good sign when i first arrived if the hotel owners know it that bad specific reference needs to be made to the noise issue when booking i being moved tomorrow night but having now seen the other reviews on trip advisor it clearly a common issue shame,0.0
modern hotel well located with friendly staff comfy beds and spacious rooms only two stops from the airport and tram stops to city centre makes this hotel an ideal base to explore amsterdam nicely decorated rooms with separate bathroom and toilet the room also has a kettle and a nespresso machine for tea and coffee for extra you can upgrade your room to add slippers fluffy robes fresh fruit water chocolate and a late check out of on day of departure skkybar on the floor has a great cocktail menu accompanied by barbites which are nice did eat in the restaurant except for breakfast which is well presented but at each a little expensive really enjoyed staying at the hotel and would definitely return,1.0
i would have to say excellent even though one thing needs addressing start with all the positives great location mins from train station and everything is in walking distance we nearly got a day transport ticket so glad we did hotel check in faultless we arrived to drop our bags off hours early to be told our room was ready floor overlooking amsterdam great start room perfect in both appearance and practicality had been some mixed reviews over the executive lounge we found this on the first night we got back at ish only to find no food or drinks until only tea and coffee never booked a ex lounge with these constraints then created a stampede at family also saw this as an opportunity to feed the kids for the evening did bring out meals rather than smaller the drinks were very limited wine and on the ground floor everywhere previous have been high up with views not a relaxing pre evening drink by any means however two things to add did complain and had a hand written letter in room with drink vouchers to main lovely bar area and also the breakfast on both occasions was nothing like evening great food selection and quiet atmosphere we went around ish roof top bar was worth a visit drinks not cheap but would you really expect two drinks for euros in that location that is what you are paying for our two drinks a cocktail and red wine euros so,1.0
stayed three nights rooms spacious coffee tea maker free safe in room supplied with very nice bathroom products combination room checked daily kept orderly robe and slippers available bottles of water provided everyday staff very helpful out stay included breakfast which included ordering from a menu as well as an excellent buffet very high ratings for this hotel,1.0
see photos below i took a photo of the broken bathroom door handle upon arrival so i could show the reception being my first time in barcelona i forgot to tell them on the way out as i was keen to see the sights the next day the entire metal handle fell onto my toe causing considerable pain i hobbled to the reception with the broken handle and told them it fell in my foot and needed ice reception not only did apologise they asked me to get it myself from the bar next door the manager attempted to quell the matter with offers of room upgrades and a free taxi ride to the airport i took the latter a real mood dampener in otherwise a fairly decent hotel the beds are quite uncomfortable though like being in a bag of unforgiving springs,0.0
what an awesome place to stay if you are arriving by train it is a very short walk across the street to this hotel centrally located it just does get any better a quick tram ride to any part of amsterdam walking distance to shopping restaurants and canal tours the hotel concierge was very knowledgable and helpful clean i am a germaphobe it passed my inspection,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay the staff were very professional and friendly the room was extremely comfortable and we would definitely stay there again the location is great for visiting the museums a great hotel,1.0
stayed for days post cruise and could not have been more pleased with hotel spacious room and canal view with well appointed bathroom large closet and in room safe complimentary bottled water every day in your room bed was extremely comfortable and air conditioning worked well staff was very helpful and definitely stay again,1.0
our room had large windows which provided ample light a high ceiling and lots of old georgian house charm although there was street noise from fitzwilliam place we got used to it and it was a problem our first impression of the neighborhood when we arrived from our flight before was that it was very quiet perhaps a bit isolated we soon discovered that we were wrong on that there are numerous interesting restaurants within close walking distance and stephens green and city center are also only a few minutes walk away a very nice offer by number is to invite folks arriving early like we did to join other guests for breakfast and their breakfasts are outstanding so we were able to get a good start on our first day in dublin an excellent experience,1.0
we stayed here for nights during a week trip clean room comfy bed and a decent sized bathroom the shower was a little difficult to get into with the height of the tub staff was awesome super friendly and helpful ate at the restaurant both mornings and it was good dinner was also good i would stay here again,1.0
i can honestly not say anything negative about our stay perhaps that it was just way too short stairs outside the front door appeared daunting but the ladies from the hotel immediately saw us and came to help with our heavy room with tea and coffee making facilities a small minibar with free water soft drinks and beer and a tray with decanters filled with cognac gin and whisky free the room had a tiny balcony and overlooked the gracht extremely central location the beds were excellent and the breakfast absolutely delicious with eggs to order tea and coffee with cake was available in the foyer area when we arrived nuts sweets and crisps and between and pm there is the most wonderful cheese and wine etc for free lots of alcohol that people could just help themselves too water and soft drinks excellent bread and lots of different snacks with the cheese and wine lots of people enjoyed this and it was fun meeting other people there we arrived very early so our luggage was safely locked away until we returned and were able to get to our room we had reservations for many attactions so time was of the essence we walked to the anne frank museum and later also to the rijksmuseum and van goch museum we are very glad we ended our day in amsterdam with a canal cruise and dinner as that showed us so much more of amsterdam that we would not have had,1.0
reserved this hotel for parents visiting me from the us and it was a great property they are accustomed to travelers landing early from international flights so early check in is usually possible for guests with status rooms had outlets for american appliances which was interesting and shows they understand their clientele will continue to send out of town visitors to this property,1.0
i stayed with my boyfriend for nights and it was a nightmare the staff staff members are friendly as long as you do have complains location location is good its station away from central station and you can get into the city within min the hotel is located close to the station so its a very short walk there not much around the hotel area but you can just go to the the room was nice and clean however no one came to clean are room for nights out of the shower was broken and it flooded the entire bathroom we called every night to get it fixed and get someone to clean our room the response was thank you for letting us know i busy atm with checkout i let my college know we would get extra towels and that would be it no one came to fix the shower this happened for three nights in a row obviously they did do anything to fix it or were apologetic about the problem if you can avoid this hotel i recommend you do it is an ok price for amsterdam but sometimes it just not worth the trouble be aware that it might be charge for city tax,0.0
took the kids to the panto at the olympia this was the perfect location everything was fine staff was fine family room plenty of space however the family room stunk and my wife found an old sock at the foot of the bed the bathroom however was so smelly did even bother with a shower before we went home we took it to the managements attention they did offer us a different room but would never have fit the of us,0.0
highly room was great wooden floors so no hotel carpet internet easy password no space for two so both can get online without a and normal shower excellent for weary size bed with headboards against one wall too a really nice more than a bedroom touch makes the bed into a leisure area we did watch the tv but there a huge to ceiling window the place has a bit of a japanese feel but in no way the windows do can control mood lights and temp from a tablet if you want yes it all works or there are switches on the definitely be back it a dream to have found this place on a budget,1.0
modern hotel and very beautiful stylish decor very good restaurant open kitchen with excellent quality modern rooms but not very practical for those who travel with children only negative is the reception that counts on the official to check in check out help with the bags need officials for these functions,1.0
this property is very unassuming conservative in decor with very basic furniture but it makes up with a magnificent view and the friendliness of the staff who will do anything to accommodate hotel is located about minutes from the airport it also offers a breakfast buffet very basic but serves the purpose i had a room on the third floor overlooking the water which glimmered with many shades of blue although the room has air conditioning if you open the balcony door a subtle breeze comes through with the sound of waves they also coordinated the shuttle transport from the airport i will certainly consider this hotel again,1.0
my girlfriend and i stayed at silken ramblas barcelona for three nights from july the hotel was a short taxi journey approx euros from the airport and when we arrived we were amazed at how well the hotel is located there is a metro station catalunya less than a minute walk away and it is a very short tube ride from the main tourist attractions of the city the hotel is right outside la rambla street which is full of high quality restaurants markets and high street shops it is also a short walk from the gothic quarter the hotel itself was very smart and clean with very friendly staff who were happy to answer questions the bedrooms were well designed although we were given two adjacent single beds which seemed very light and moved when sat on the bathroom was very smart although of all things we found it strange that there was no soap holder for the bar they provided the rooftop bar decking area was nice to relax by although it did get very busy the photos online being deceiving as the pool was very small all in all a fair stars the best factor being the location,1.0
what a wonderful quirky hotel great transport links into the city good value accommodation with witty comments everywhere excellent food in the white moose but at an additional costbonus was that burnley beat shamrock rovers budget hotel,1.0
very impressed with this hotel arrived at central station from airport and caught the no tram minutes ride and minute walk to hotel from tram stop no reception desk checked in online easily with the help of the fantastic staff great room with probably one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept in amazing bathroom large walk in shower room very clean and modern with quirky touches throughout the hotel based on the tyre factory this hotel used to be located in lovely area lidl over the road and to the right which was handy for bottled my sister has an allergy to feather and these were changed immediately on request would definitely recommend and stay again,1.0
we love this hotel it is stylish the staff are great the location on las ramblas could be better the rooms are extremely comfortable especially the pillows and there is a lovely pool and rooftop bar what not to like,1.0
the hotel is excellently located with most touristy sites within walking distance it is also next close to placa catalunya for excellent metro and bus services the hotel itself has a wonderful lobby and room was perfect for our needs we did eat in the restsurant but had a very good light dinner in the bar area the staff were very friendly and always happy to help especially with directions the hotel also stored our luggage on the day we were leaving which was very useful,1.0
i am staying in amsterdam for nights so i booked the tulip inn amsterdam riverside the location was not great but at least it have a river view and the street view the room was clean good lighting great presentation and bed work this is a bit too good for a hotel the restaurant breakfast was superb lots of variety and good quality the and was clear no confusion there overall good rooms worth the money and you can easily visit there good job hotel keep it up,1.0
rooms are small but clean breakfast selection is ok you can find all basic staff what i did like i super slow lifts you can wait for minutes for lift to arrive in the mornings hotel should consider replacing them with something more fast,1.0

had a wonderful time during our stay here last summer the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly especially the reception staff and the lady at breakfast who on one of the days went out to buy croissants for us as they had run out before we came downstairs breakfast is plentiful and the hotel in general is very quaint and well location minutes from monjuic fountain and super easy access to tons of restaurants and cafes minutes walk from a huge mall too so you get the best of both worlds with the local places on the street right next door to the hotel and the fancier places inside the mall the metro is also right near the mall so again a minute walk plenty of authenticity in this area room was clean and very roomy we booked a quadruple room and were not disappointed the cleaners also found my watch which i had misplaced in the room and left it on the bed truly enjoyed our stay and when we come back to the beautiful city of barcelona will definitely be staying here again,1.0
very well located hotel room was comfortable with nice flat screen tv that was very good a bit of noise from the street because hotel is downtown the windows in room open and fresh air was a bonus the beds were very comfortable two restaurants that were fine the bleeding horse pub is adjacent to hotel and many other restaurant in walking distance grafton street shopping area and stephens green as well as the dublin museum of natural history were close walking distance we would stay at the hotel again when back in dublin,1.0
fantastic location great staff amazing views from room rooftop pool restaurant breakfast and great wifi this is our third stay with the family and it our place of choice when visiting athens,1.0
great location near a subway station the hotel lobby is nicely decorated service staffs are very polite helpful and attentive the rooms are comfy although a little upgrade of the amenities could be considered,1.0
stayed here for one night location is great very chilled atmosphere the rooms are great so innovative from a record player to the mini bar and munchie tray and the decor there is a bit of noise outside from the night clubs but typically at the weekend did really bother me i slept like a baby on the comfortable beds i will definitely come back to raid the munchie tray and the mini bar and chill out and watch some netflix,1.0
on june we had a reservation for people fo rthe rooftop at la isabela we received a confirmation for this reservation this was for a surprise birthday two of us arrived with them stating that there was no reservation and we could not come in i showed them our reservation and they stated you need a second he also advised that he did not have the staff to manage a group of people and continued to be very rude to us the attitude of the manager was completely unacceptable i advised him that we had people arriving and i expected a table within min to be ready he continued to give me a hard time at which time i advised that this was not acceptable customer service considering i had been there multiple times prior with clients and employees i had never received such ignorant behaviour after a lengthy discussion and my continued damand for a table they proceeded to set up a location for us in the meantime we had guests arriving and downstairs at the elevator they were informed they were not allowed to come up as they did not have a reservation first i will never come back to again and i will ensure i will recommend anyone against this hotel i do not have the managers name however this was the afternoon of june,0.0
great hotel central location very friendly helpful staff thanks to dafne on the reception the rooms were spotless beds were very comfortable the pool area was lovely and very welcome in the heat pool towels safe is free wifi also freewe did not try the hotel food there are lots of cafes and restaurants around the minutes walk to las ramblas the airport bus and hop on tourist bus both stop in the square around the corner,1.0
i booked this for a city break with my daughter and was attracted by the central location accommodation in dublin is relatively expensive particularly the city centre hotels i booked online and chose a twin ensuite room but what we actually got was a whole apartment with single rooms a bathroom a lounge and a kitchen we were only there for one night but if we been staying longer we would have made more use of the lounge and kitchen it was clean secure had free and was located in a nice quiet corner of the campus ideal for our needs there was also luggage storage available before and after which was handy,1.0
we paid for the upgrade to include the executive lounge which was not very executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed it was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel have clearly cut back on the staffing of this area at one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty the toilet door lock was broken the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol i thought this level was over there was little or no food available at the key walk in times like this was repeated in the afternoon this is the year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason i booked the hotel but over the last couple of years it seems to have gone downhill and has got progressively worse i thought last year poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days i stayed there this year it is the last time i would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year i did complain to reception but there was no,0.0
it caters well for all needs the reception team were extremely helpful and friendly the rooms have all the you need and everywhere is clean great to have breakfast in the the courtyard would stay here again,1.0
this hotel has amazing california beds that made me so blissed out to collapse on each night it honestly the thing i remember about the breakfast and smooth no complaints there the location is just ok it is very convenient for the museums although a bit of a trek to guinness and the came down with something here which made me feel awful the turndown service maid was a godsend i felt bad about it but she was very kind when i was sick the cellar restaurant also kindly sent up our food to our room when i had to rush out of the restaurant and specially made me a plain salad to eat when i could stomach anything else i wish i could have eaten it me from giving it stars the pipes in the toilet are really loud every time we used them it would go on for ages afterwards this made for an unpleasant experience if you had to wake up to go to the the steam room and pool were nice but there is no sauna in the spa also the slippers they give you are very pleasant to walk around in in the we were told we got a room upgrade but i was very impressed our room overlooked the ceiling of the walkway below so almost no view to speak in all a solid and a nice stay in dublin although it did exactly have the factor aside from the beds,1.0
a wonderful hotel with skybar where you go up and can see athens with all its atractive buildings and folkmills to sit there with a nice drink in the hand and watch the sunrise over athens beat everything,1.0
clean hotel pleasant staff only fault was not being aware of construction work nearby which woke us very early each morning when we were away also breakfast not included in our price which may even have been a nice guesture considering we chose there as a rest period from work and not pre warned about the noise overall a lovely hotel,1.0
great hotel in a fabulous location but a little on the expensive side compared with other hotels nearby very small rooms but staff were very helpful and efficient pool area was lovely although a bit small,1.0
after visiting dublin many times the spencer is definitely the best hotel i have stayed in in dublin the bar has a cool relaxed atmosphere in the evenings as the live dj plays r b the cocktails are amazing and the food in the thai restaurant is incredible after telling the spencer the trip was for an we got an upgrade and rose petals were put on the bed as well as a desert plate saying happy birthday the staff were efficient and ensured we were happy with our trip would definitely visit again,1.0
no king beds even though they confirmed king charge for ice desk service is not nice air did not work we told the front desk and they said it takes a while to kick in we only stayed days but we have yet seen it kick in front desk just did not care i bet you they even had kings beds but they did not want to bother putting us in the room that we reserved,0.0

we absolutely loved this hotel but first i want to talk about the staff who went above and beyond to make this trip great at check in we mentioned to monika that we were traveling for my husbands birthday so they upgraded us to a room with a great view of las ramblas we arrived a little before expecting to store our bags and return at to check in monika said they could have the room ready in a half an hour so we left our bags and took a walk through the neighborhood when we returned our bags were already in our room and it was ready to go is there anything better after a long flight that an amazing shower well this hotel has the perfect shower although the bed looked inviting at that point barcelona awaited monika had annotated a map for us to get our bearings it was so helpful so we headed off by the time we returned to the hotel almost hours later we we so ready to enjoy a long sleep in the hotel amazing bed the curtains are blackout and the lighting is completely adjustable so we slept in until almost am the hotel is extremely quiet despite being right where the action is the next afternoon we spent on the rooftop deck using the pool and having cava and snacks lounging on the bali beds on the roof great views and yummy food especially the tapas we also utilized the pool,1.0
great hotel for a trip to amsterdam it is located on the tram route with a stop right outside the door number the room was large clean and comfortable and the bed really comfy breakfast is the usual buffet style but had just about everything you could want including freshly made pancakes and waffles the best aspect of this hotel was the staff very friendly helpful and a real credit to the hotel i would heartily recommend the golden tulip to anyone and would definitely go again,1.0
i went home yesterday from lovely days in athens and i stayed at wyndham hotel for this day and right now i am very happy that i choosed this hotel a new hotel in the town i think they open in the last days in in that moment i order this hotel its was long down on the ranking list on trip advisor but before i travel then running up hundreds of places i like to know what other people means about the hotel and everything around it like neighbourhood and whats include and what you can do also on the hotel i choosed this after short thinking because of they could give me what i wanted i am only in a small contact with hotel before i choose where to stay and maria was answering my mails very fast i am not a very difficult person for the hotels i only have a few wishes and they promise me them hotel is located in metaxourghio not the most central place but for me i dont have problem for jumping on the metro who was minutes away the hotel have a lot taxi outside and they bring you to central places for around euro i took metro blue line from airport to syntagma station and then changed line to red line for next step i guess i used around hour i didnt look at clock the metro price i euro since its the airport line taxi cost around euro and,1.0

we have made four visits to this wonderful hotel in recent years the setting is beautiful the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms are all full of only issue this time was access to room my wife has some mobility issues and so we were shocked to see the access was up a tiny spiral staircase it was our fault as we know the hotel has lots of small steps and two lifts but we never thought to mention my wife problems when we booked and we had come across this staircase in earlier stays if you have similar walking issues please ensure you inform the staff when booking or you may find yourself in room or the hotel was fully booked as it often is so changing the room once you arrive is not a practicable option the other initial disappointment was the lack of a kettle and facilities however this was quickly rectified by the hotel but it was odd it was there already our luggage had fortunately been taken to our room for us up the stairs so that was a bonus the advantage of the room was as it is so high it was completely quiet at night and the kept it just right but we could also open some windows and it was still room was very clean when we arrived and the hotel had thoughtfully given me a wonderful bottle of red wine as i was during our stay a really nice,1.0
started out with a snafu hotel was supposed to have car service meet us at airport but it never came so after waiting over minutes we took a cab to hotel when we got to the desk the chap there asked who arranged for that car and it was him he was quite embarrassed and to make it up to us paid for a cab to a restaurant later in our stay the room on first floor with a view of the river was a bit larger than other rooms and so worth the extra money paid to include breakfast and that was well worth it if you ask for them to make eggs a certain way they accommodated it so that was quite nice for us as americans the biggest drawback was the bathroom the flush for the toilet is a metal bit sticking out of the wall and to push it into the wall for a small person such as myself meant standing and leaning over toilet to push full body weight on thumb and then you got a pretty weak flush so you had to do this multiple times for not a great result and the tub again for a short person was a challenge to get into to take a shower it was up too high and quite a step over and down to reach back to the floor maybe if they have a shower stall in a room that is safer and easier it was,1.0
stayed here for nights with family and enjoyed it a great deal the rooms are very nice and modern newly renovated clean the washrooms are very clean and newly renovated as well the location is a bit away from the city centre in a mostly residential area but only about a minute walk to the centre or a cab ride of euros or so if i had to come up with a complaint it would be the long walks from the elevators to the rooms aside from that everything was great i would certainly stay here again upon returning to dublin,1.0
very well located hotel which offers great value for money considering the prime location close to ballsbridge and the aviva stadium the hotel was originally a conversion of three adjoining georgian houses which lends itself to the layout of accommodation being a bit unorthodox with corridors and stairways being rather random in their lay out that aside the hotel offers a fine guest experience at a very fair price which more than makes up for the unusual character of the property,1.0
our family of four adults stayed in barcelona from and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel accommodations we found the hotel staff very helpful with answering all of our questions about getting around where to exchange money where to find a lavanderia laundromat etc the hotel has good security since the front desk staff will let you in and out if they need to step away they will return quickly we had a family room with four single beds the room had tv with a few american channels the bathroom was very large and the air conditioning fantastic we could not have been more pleased with the location and the fact the street was quiet at least for us since we had an interior room my thanks again to the hotel staff for their help especially upon arrival after an all night flight they offered to store the luggage though we opted to use their lockers and pay euro per locker for the day we will stay there again if we return,1.0

this is a very nice hotel on a reasonable price the location is good in terms of interesting sights and metro stops although the hotel is located on the top of a hill which might be an issue for people with difficulty walking there is a flat walk to a metro station about min away i would recommend this hotel of a nice quiet stay,1.0
showers are elevated which often results in water leaking onto concrete floors so it a high skip hazard my wife slipped and almost sprained a knee they could be sued for that if we were room designs are poor the shower basin was in middle of room so everyone in room watches younger ready never seen that before was location central to tourist spots fine for a day or two overpriced for what you get and better value at euro is fine but cheaper cafes al bother eating too close to hotel as it surrounded by really dodgy tourist trash cafes seems the so called cafes exist to sell dope and not really sell food except to stoned tourists who do know any better recommended that you get away from hotel area to eat tripadvisor has many recommendations on good places use that i am unlikely to stay here again given the safety issues and pricing and tourist trash food in the area,0.0
the only reason to stay at this hotel is its proximity to the conference center next door the hallway outside our hallway smelled of a dead rat housekeeping never came unless called and requested the swimming pool is a joke for a family it is more like a hip hangout with people smoking shisha and behaving poorly we were concerned an escort service was being run out of the pool area just avoid this hotel there are so many other hotels which are much nicer,0.0
stayed here with my partner for nights hotel room was nice good size and very clean the room was equip with everything we needed and it was cleaned every day the breakfast was nice with plenty to choose from location is very good as it is close to the city center less than minute walk and also it is far enough out that it is quiet for a city at night time staff were all very nice and very negative to add about this hotel we had a great stay and will be returning in the future,1.0
the room was way beyond our expectation for the price we paid the double room was comfortable and spacious and very clean same goes with the bathroom we really appreciated the staff who are so friendly especially one guy who helped us with the safe in our room who was still happy even after going up and down times for us to help us out and also speak perfect english the facilities are great and functional there a tram stop right outside free wifi complimentary coffee and tea in the rooms great cleaning service a couple of computers and a printer if you need it a small gym and a games room you will definitely be taken care of if you stay here thumbs up to the staff who made our stay very comfortable,1.0

lovely hotel very nice staff and comfortable well appointed rooms in a great location but dublin you to get a grip on the prices this is no reflection on the hotel it lovely and well appointed but the price was just too much,1.0
nice comfortable hotel and really helpful and awesome staff only two issues the hotel tends to get very busy with cruise lines so if you are expecting upgrades based on your hhonors elite status then good luck i stayed here nights and every night the front desk staff asked me to check tomorrow for upgrade availability none was found it is a little far from airport so taxi is your best transportation option to and from airport metro is only minutes walk away but will need to change twice to get airport other than the above it is a great hotel next to the beach and a shopping mall and really helpful staff which makes a big difference,1.0
my husband and i chose to take an express shuttle from the airport to the hotel because we arrived at about am we found the express shuttle paid for the tickets at a kiosk stepped right onto the shuttle amazing luck stood for the minute ride and got off across the street from the hotel the longest part was not wanting to jay walk as our first act in another country so we walked up across and down to the hotel entrance when we arrived our rooms were ready amazing luck we showered and took a nap for an hour or two then hit the town running while we were there we saw a historical recreation ship moored very close to the hotel and the river walk had a festival the hotel had flowers in the lobby so you could take on and brighten your room and free wifi they also had a fake sheep reading a newspaper full of his one review said it not in the city center we had a great time and it a few blocks from the green line bus tour we had dinner at a restaurant that we could see from our hotel room i would stay there again,1.0

this hotel is conveniently located to all the central dublin sights it is also located amid some nightclubs and has one itself that said it is not a perfectly quiet place for lodging but soundproofing is actually very good and we had no problems staying on the first floor the room was tiny but so fun with a twin over queen bunk the shower was awesome after a long day of walking beautiful dublin rooftop is lovely and lobby bar is active all day overall we would recommend the dean and happily stay there again,1.0

i was excited on arrival by the look and feel of this hotel but by the time i left the following day i was utterly disgusted by their utter disregard for their guests comfort and satisfaction i thin the following response to my agent complaint letter will tell you all you need to know about why you should choose any other hotel in dublin so disappointed goodness only knows just how appalling it might of been had i been a leisure traveller management response i sorry your client had a noise affected stay with us thanks for taking the time to flag this with us we do have big issues with noise on harcourt street we have some rooms that are but nothing we consider silent by a long stretch harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in for nightlife in general we completely surrounded by night venues although there is little we can do to control this we try to assign the rooms to corporate guests longer stays etc to minimize the impact on our guests i sorry if this was communicated on arrival i will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position as recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours we working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort in relation to the lights coffee machine and basin we,0.0
my sister and i had a really nice time staying here the concierges were all fantastic at helping us figure out our stay we were amazed at how easy it was to get help arranging a taxi for pick up the next day they even arranged for us to be able to get an early breakfast at no extra cost even though we had to check out an hour before the breakfast opened the daily breakfast selection was very nice food was delicious room was a good size and we had a nice time staying there we were able to walk to many major tourist sites without issue also this hotel is located right by the bus stop from the airport was very happy with our stay there,1.0
i would highly recommend this hotel it was clean had a very comfortable bed was only a short distance to the acropolis had a spacious balcony with fantastic views especially at night and the customer service was outstanding the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and i am only sorry that i did get the name of the man on reception who did everything to ensure i found some taramasalata so that i could thank him by name at such a great price there are no bad words to say about this hotel and we will be returning,1.0
have been staying at the hp for years or more it is the best hotel i have stayed in dublin service quality of food never changes first class all the time would have no hesitation in recommending the herbert park for a stay in dublin,1.0
the volkshotel is one of the most unique hotels i ever stayed in it in a quieter area outside of central amsterdam just a quick metro ride away or stops we had people in our group so we reserved the room it is a lofted style room with one big bed on the ground and two suspended bunk beds up top my husband and i slept in the suspended beds climb ladders up which were actually very comfortable and gave us a little hiding area where we could eat snacks while watching the tv down hotel is equipped with everything you need there a fancy restaurant called canvas on the floor with great views and a bar with drinks snacks in the main lobby our last night in the hotel we enjoyed the rooftop hot tubs and sauna enjoyed a small plate and cocktails at canvas then headed down to the bar for snacks drinks and a round of scrabble the music played through out the hotel is great and the vibe is young and would gladly stay at the volkshotel again if i am back in the region and would recommend staying here,1.0
the hotel actual is unusual for this fashionable area for being a reasonably priced establishment as such it is a perfectly satisfactory place to stay if you do not mind eschewing extravagant and bathrooms are fine as is the hotel has no garage but there are many car parks nearby just be wary of the bars in the area often close quite early during the week at if you want a drink later catch a taxi to the passeig del born otherwise the location is excellent,1.0
this is a lovely hotel steps from two of gaudi casas and within walking distance of the sagrada familia very modern decor and facilities reception staff was young friendly and very professional comfortable lounge area and excellent breakfast taxi stand out front restaurants all about we were here one night post cruise arrived early and left bags they were in our room when we returned at two we highly recommend this hotel,1.0
we are here for nights on our honeymoon could have picked a better hotel we did really want to stay in the hustle and bustle part of athens and this hotel worked out perfect for us we booked a couple tours from the front desk the staff upfront was so professional and helpful we spent one day going to the city to see all the historical things just enough no need to go back to the city the beach in front is very nice umbrellas and lounge chairs available nice sandy beach not to many waves also very nice to have a roof top pool available again great staff drinks were made professionally inexpensive and tasty we took advantage of the room service quiet a bit food was always fresh very inexpensive balcony off our room facing the sea was a nice retreat for us like everyone says it is on a busy road but it did really bother us part of having a centerally located hotel with good transportation options we took the bus from the airport pretty easy to figure out euros each we also spent a few days traveling from island to island piraeus port is a short taxi and from there you can take speed to various islands for very little money we went to poros egina hydra and mykonos all from this port great way to see the greek islands on your own time overall an amazing stay we kept saying what a great choice,1.0

the location is the only thing lacking at this hotel the building rooms food pool and roof are all very nice you can take a walk to the beach and there is quite a bit of interesting street art nearby but all the tourist spots require a walk to the metro and longer metro ride,1.0
stayed here for three nights while we were in dublin greeted on arrival by the nicest man who told us about dublin and walked us personally to our room we were in one of the rooms in the back which was very convenient because we could come in and out by the back gate rooms were very clean and pleasant parking was included as well as breakfast breakfast was especially the homemade brown toast would definitely stay here again on another trip,1.0
we needed a convenient hotel to stay in with airport shuttle for our early morning flight out of dublin this place is located in a sort of wasteland we pulled up the cab driver did even know this place was here seemed afraid to just leave us here there was a group of loud guys from the pub next door outside our room was typical travelodge but the view outside was a crappy apartment complex with loud people we were hungry but i did want to walk around the sketchy neighborhood no way would i ever go here again,0.0
we enjoyed our three night stay here a great location and room was very comfortable and well appointed little extras like dome nibbles and in room decanters of liquor nice the free bar and fruit and lollies in the comfort of the reception area was great we did have any of the afternoon cheese etc they put on but a great idea breakfast was pleasant enough nice to have freshly made omelettes etc is ridiculous that a ramp had not been installed at entrance you have to lug your luggage up the steps and no one helps even just stood at top looking at us a few times our interactions with the staff were not great little things like not listening to our queries correctly questioning us on what taxi service we called when they called it for us some small things that demonstrated they were prepared to go the extra mile something advertised as a feature of the hotel,1.0
we spent two nights at hotel fita before a cruise of the baltic there was four of us between two rooms my brother and i had a corner room on the first european not american first floor and my parents were directly above us our room did not include an air conditioner but we had plenty of openable windows and doors out onto a small shared balcony it on a nice side street just a block over from the van gogh museum and another next to it and very close to the rijks and the canals there is a tram stop just around the block for the tram from the arrived in the morning and got to the hotel before noon they had my parents room ready and let us check in and go up the room my brother and i shared was ready within half an hour it was comfortable clean and the bathroom was in excellent shape my only concern was the staircase the building is an older one and is narrow and curved it very stable and has good banisters but if you at all scared of heights it may be unnerving they do have a little elevator so you do have to haul your luggage up and down the stairs at all do note that there is a school and daycare nearby so there will be children playing during the daytime i did not find however that there was problems with the noise when i was,1.0
just finished a week long stay at the fashion hotel and i was most impressed the room was spotless on arrival and kept that way by housekeeping all week the reception staff were excellent polite and perfect spoken english very welcoming and full of information which help us on out trip the hotel facilities were also excellent the gym and swimming pool were well maintained and very clean and again kept that way by the cleaning staff access to the center of town was simple using the trams which stopped minutes walf from the hotel hop a number or which take you straight to central station mins ride make sure you get an i amsterdam card as this makes travel and visiting attractions really simple and cheap look it up the only negatives were the cost of the breakfast which was euros if booked and on the day nice but a bit steep really for what it was english buffet and the cost of drinks in the skybar whick looked great but we avoided due to the costs also avoid getting a room near an ice machine it makes a lot of noise when filling the metal ice bucket up at midnight who needs ice at midnight room could also do with fridge and not a vending machine like they have just a way of making more money im afraid despite the negatives they did not spoil our stay at the fashion hotel and i would be more than happy,1.0

this hotel was terrible i requested a quiet room but i was given a room opposite where a music concert was playing until about so i got no sleep on my first night the windows are useless so you can hear everything outside i moved to another room after a lot of discussion for my second night in this room the aircon did work as the window was broken i had to push a chair up against the window to keep it closed so the aircon would work in this room you could hear chairs dragging across the floor in other rooms one of the worst hotel experiences i had,0.0
myself and friends stayed at the hotel for nights on arrival the hotel looked to be very lovely clean cool water and glasses in reception for use of guests a lovely looking little bar and comfy seating staff were polite and welcoming and check in was very speedy on going to our rooms we were very disappointed with the standard as they were nowhere near the standard shown on the website i would say avoid room as it is in the basement with a very small window facing onto the street it was next to the lift shaft toilets and offices not pleasant at all and my friends did sleep at all in there the first night as it was very stuffy and very noisy staff changed their room the next day to a much nicer room still not really like the ones in the pictures but pleasant enough staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome we had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning and it was good value euros there were hot drinks juice water cereals full english pastries and more very nice having cool water available in reception at all times was a very nice touch location was perfect we purchased a day travel card which was useful but we walked so much as lots to see we would definitely stay here again but would not accept room,1.0

i ca compare the wyndham with any other athens hotels because this is the only one we stayed at but this is a great hotel modern clean great breakfast buffet and very nice although quite small for the size of hotel swimming area on the roof great view of the acropolis from the rooftop bar our room was spacious and location is great as far as restaurants tavernas and bars are concerned there is one right outside called alexander the great which we did get round to trying but there is a metro station metaxourghio right across the street from which you can easily and cheaply reach anywhere in the city including the airport if and when in athens again i would probably stay here now we familiar with it tip i traveled back to the airport separately from my wife and son they were told by reception that a there would be plenty of taxis available in the street and b the flat fare back to the airport is compared with the fare in of she could find a cab and was charged the i made the same journey the next day found a row of cabs in front of the nearby metro station and only paid the fare is clearly stated on the cab dashboard as for airport to center and reverse journey do be reticent to point that out to the driver if he tries to overcharge,1.0
myself and other ladies went to the skylon hotel for lunch which would be a regular occurrence as we enjoy the hotel and food when we drove into the car park we were greeted by a very rude man who looked into the car and said it was resident parking only i explained we went there a lot and would only be about hours and he refused to let us stay we noted about or empty parking spaces but still had to leave,0.0
we booked this hotel for a short break to celebrate silver wedding anniversary staff were very attentive and polite giving us a free upgrade to newly renovated junior suite on arrival along with complimentary drinks the room was nicely decorated immaculate with a super king bed seating area satalite tv bathroom was spacious with separate wc and separate walk in shower unfortunately we did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to see as much of barcelona as we could in the day visit hotel was situated in the residential area which suited us as the city centre was very busy and noisy close to clot metro station approx min walk and minute walk to sangradia familial basilica which is a must see lovely street of cafe bars near the basilica used the tour bus for day which made it easier to see the city only wished we had booked a day pass as there was so much to see would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully will return soon to complete the tour of this lovely but very busy city the reception staff were outstanding and helpful and always asking us by name how we were and is there anything they could help with,1.0

we stayed at the intercontinental dublin for two nights the room was comfortable spacious and luxurious service was impeccable our room was ready i think they just needed to put the rollaway bed in for my daughter it was maybe a minute wait at most so we were given a drink on the house in the lounge little touches like this really make the difference loved the pool and spa on a side note the train station is a minute walk and you can take the train into the city centre short walk from station and other locations we chose to take the train to the lovely fishing village of howth which offered great hiking with amazing views,1.0

very stylish and modern hotel perfectly located next to the central station comfortable if not slightly smallish rooms but very nicely furnished with an apple mac tv the lobby bar was good for a cold beer good selection or snack the skylounge was superb with great views over the city especially as the sun sets,1.0
my wife and i found the staff to be pleasant friendly and helpful but perhaps that because she spanish and i fluent so we could chat and joke and we developed rapport the elevator was small and slow but hey we on vacation one really nice side of our stay was sitting on our very nice floor balcony listening to the church bells watching the clouds drift overhead watching the neighbors on their balconies and enjoying the evening breezes as dusk turned to night the beds were comfy and when our tv went out the staff had someone up to fix it batteries in the remote apparently nice bathroom small rooms but since we used to japanese hotels no big deal best of all of course as others have noted the location is fantastic the staff told us where they eat and every suggestion was a home run most were within a couple of blocks despite the location our rooms were very quiet,1.0

the hotel is well situated if you are travelling into amsterdam arriving at central station it is literally entrance area is very smart but the checking in process and also the checking out was very slow patience is reception area lounge is actually quite a nice place to chill with free teas and other drinks rooms are also nice and clean we had the deluxe room with king size bed the bed was very comfy with a choice of pillows the room has a kettle nespresso machine and water which are all complimentary they also have very good umbrellas for the inevitable dam downpour the aircon works well although for some strange reason if you turn it off the aircon unit makes a lot of noise so you have to leave the aircon on all the were also well designed with large cosy bath towels and more than enough can tell the hotel has recently been refurbished as it all feels quite are also very pleasant and happy to do anything for you just ask,1.0

pricey by us standards but i loved the location of this hotel my room was typical but clean there was free wifi and the breakfast was included we had dinner on the plaza diagonally from the hotel entrance and the food was very good it had the added ambiance of a street performer singing opera note the taxis were on strike the day we arrived apparently they do this once a month as a protest against uber we had arranged for a transfer from the airport to our hotel in advance but our friends that we were meeting had not they spent hours dealing with this and the hotel was not equipped to offer any assistance,1.0

was so looking forward to staying here room was dingy and small no outlook as in the middle looking out to other windows coffee machine was faulty reception staff were unhelpful and very snotty in their attitude breakfast was included we were told and then charged for it also a city tax which we were unaware of and no explanation as to what that was i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,0.0

we arrived early to the hotel after a long flight from the to be warmly greeted by the staff because we arrived so early our room was not available yet and we were told it would be ready by the hotel kindly kept our luggage for us while we toured the city although when we returned at our room was still not ready yet unfortunately our room was not ready until because the previous occupants had smoked in the room and they had to prepare a different room for us the hotel staff was gracious and pleasant throughout the process understanding that we were very tired from our long room itself was a good size by european standards we were in a family room which included a large bed and a small single bed which was fine for my teenage daughter i appreciate the small details like plenty of electrical outlets a variety of english speaking channels on the and extra pillows the air conditioning worked adequately and is controlled directly in the room our room faced the front of the hotel and therefore we heard some early morning vehicle noise but because the hotel is somewhat isolated it was overall very quiet noise from inside the hotel or from adjoining rooms was the beds and pillows were more on the firm side for those of us from america but standard for what i have experienced in hotel is located along the water with scenic views from several locations in,1.0

we stayed at the hotel claris for the last night of a day trip the location is killer shops restaurants attractions staff informative and helpful and amenities terrific we sat on the roof top for a couple drinks to end the and it did disappoint,1.0
i stayed here for a work trip great location mins on train from the airport and mins walk from the station i stayed here solo not sure i would bring my other half here though it very compact perfect for just frosted glass between the bed and the toilet and clear glass on the shower everything in the room is controlled by and ipad very cool and there is a great selection of free movies on the tv breakfast was ok continental would return but only if alone,1.0
as per other reviewers this is a wonderful small hotel with character and charm incredibly close to the acropolis and easy walking distance to many other historic sites given its location it is excellent value for money far better than you get for the same type of location in other european capital cities easy to reach from the directions on the hotel one change at syntagma rooms clean light and a kettle for brits missing their yorkshire tea small fridge efficient aircon nice bathrooms friendly helpful on the terrace is expensive but worth tretaing would stay again without hesitation,1.0
while visiting my friend from ireland we wanted to stay at a hotel close to all amenities this hotel did not disappoint it is a stunning hotel with amazing staff and service it is central to everywhere you can go i would highly recommend this hotel and i hope to return in the future,1.0
this was my second time staying at the paramount hotel you can not fault the location on a quiet street just off temple bar you are in the centre of it all the rooms are spacious and come with plenty of storage and we had a very good sized bathroom too we were bed and breakfast breakfast was lovely nice choice of cereals and continental but we opted for the full irish breakfast and we could not fault it for the price you pay i do think a bad word can be said about this hotel staff were also very kind it always great when you can leave your luggage at the hotel i am planning another trip to dublin in october and will be picking this hotel again,1.0
beautiful hotel amazing staff friendly helpful the inclusive bar the location right by the flower market and spacious very clean and good but would say the only let down of the whole place is the breakfast room itself very small badly laid out and decor well past its hotel is expensive but worth every penny treat yourself you wont regret got a cab to and from the airport but its really not needed the train station centraal is walkable so much better to do this,1.0
i booked the westcord fashion for my partner birthday and we were disappointed when we first pulled up to the hotel i was a little concerned about the location being right by a main road and seemingly in the middle of no where but it was absolutely hotel is tasteful and spotlessly clean the staff all friendly and helpful but not intrusive at all the terrace area is absolutely lovely as is the skyy bar at the top of the hotel i have seen some reviews saying that it a half an hour walk to anything but this is the case at all the tram stop is about a walk away and as soon as you get to that there cafes and restaurants around you tram into the centre take depending on where you want to go which was absolutely fine for us because it a nice way to see the city vondelpark is also an easy walk are only three relatively minor bad things we could think of firstly the bathroom door for the shower room is glass this was a problem for us at all since we a couple however i can imagine if you are travelling with friends or family it might be a little awkward the cleaning staff also come into your room before you have answered which also could prove a little awkward the final thing was that we found a dirty pair of socks in our room on the second day which we are,1.0
we arrived and needed a quick check in as we were running late for a wedding the person behind the check in desk was the most efficient i ever seen had us checked in and a taxi outside for us in about minutes breakfast buffet was very nice on departure there was a taxi called for us and was outside in less than a in all an excellent stay and one that will be repeated,1.0

i travel the world staying in many hotels but this one takes the cake first arrived room smelt mouldy one tiny bar of soap size of a tea bag for myself and wife had to ask for more coffee set up had only one cup when there was meant to be two so we shared a cup called for room service they said they were short staff so come pick up yourself hotel must be next to a night club as constant dj music all day and nite it a saturday or cabin cleaner came this morning i told him do clean my room just give us extra towels seems simple so i gave him my room service tray from night before that was all he had too do was take it away and did have to clean my room so what does he do places by my door and just leaves there it now pm and it still there no sense of hospitality at all will never stay here again and i do recommend it to any one a shocker,0.0
spent two nights at the ink firstly the negatives i had had an email to say of we checked in online in advance the key to the room would be ready we arrived mid morning to be told it would be ready until i queried it and the girl on reception said there was an extra quite high charge for early access i was not told that so pointless checking in in advance as i had expected to be able to freshen up and change my clothes before going out i then had to spend the afternoon in boiling hot weather in unsuitable clothes not a good other thing i had done in advance was to ask if they had a private bathroom as i did not like the look of the clear glass in the pictures on the website i think they had tried to accommodate this as the glass in our bathroom was opaque but you could still see through it and i was not comfortable with the room we had was very dark and we had to have the lights on constantly as it looked out onto a solid wall the service in the restaurant was not slow considering there was only one other couple in there also they could do with more staff and a bigger check in desk as there were always long on the positive the staff were lovely and friendly the room although dark was very clean and modern and quirky with the,1.0
the hotel arts was meant to be one of the best hotels in barcelona but it does not live up to this hype at those reading this you will probably see all the other star reviews and think this guy is talking nonsense but the truth is that this hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre with no soul or atmosphere if you are a family do go here stay at the there was a queue for the lifts and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a paying customers should get priority i think the swimming pool was as small as a fish tank the water was as cold as the atmosphere for a hotel with floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area furthermore there were no changing rooms on the pool level disappointing for a five star hotel on the contrary when we visited the w hotel which was cheaper saw it had multiple panoramic pools large and spacious enough for a luxury food was another problem our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of euros for a family of the pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed euros at max to make but was sold at over euros just because this is,0.0
in terms of hilton standards this is not one of the best the service was slow and sloppy the hotel amenities were very basic and even though use of the pool is free the sun beds are charged the hotel is clean and the breakfast is ok but the rest were below my expectations,1.0
the hotel was very basic with only few amenities being provided they did keep any bottle of water and no dental kits were provided since plug points are different as compared to india we had asked for an adaptor to which the reception asked to come down and collect ourselves there was no hospitality in this hotel since we only needed to sleep for one night we adjusted through not at all recommending this hotel to anyone instead there are very good budget hotels in the main city which should be explored the area in which the hotel is situated is also not convenient,0.0
we visit this hotel for nights in july we book room for people beds the room was big and very clean breakfast was rich and the transportation to the city center is very easy out side of the hotel there is tram station witch take you to city centerwe arrive very late at night minutes by taxi from the air port cost about in was fast and easy altheas it was very late at night amalthough its locate out side of city center its very good value for mony,1.0
fantastic hotel friendly welcoming staff great spacious clean modern rooms great location i really enjoyed the sun terrace as well very clean great bar and eating area overall a lovely hotel that i would stay at in the future,1.0
an otherwise pleasant experience was overshadowed by the fact that the room was like an indian hotbox we requested and received an extra fan but to no avail its not uncommon in ireland to not have air conditioners in the rooms however there should at least be a window that opens all the way the staff was pleasant enough though the bar did close a bit too early its too bad this is a great location in the heart of dublin,0.0
the location was fantastic with cute little cafes nearby and shopping right at your door step the rooms were very well appointed and it was easily recognisable that there was a high level of sophistication and attention to detail i absolutely loved the decor and velvet that flooded the hotel it was amazing how the windows in your room opened up like a balcony the bed was super large and comfy the bathroom was all dark and glitzy with an excellent rainfall staff were incredible also i will definitely be returning xx,1.0
this hotel really gets service and perfectly looked after me and my family in athens they could not have done more to ensure a difficult situation was handled with real care understanding and empathy could ask for more and would never stay anywhere else in athens,1.0

we stayed at the w amsterdam exchange hotel there is another section of the hotel next door called the bank formerly a bank the gym is in the bank and had all the equipment you will need for a solid workout bench free weights bikes treadmill and weight machines you can eat breakfast at either the exchange or the bank the breakfast had a buffet but also about items that you can order as part of the breakfast omlets scrambled eggs etc our room was a standard size but hip and was well laid out and we had a view of the busy amsterdam streets the location was in walking distance to everything one of my favorite parts of the hotel was they offered a whatsapp number for their whatever whenever customer service if we had a question or needed something it was as easy as texting them via whatsapp and they were very prompt in replies as well as fulfilling our requests,1.0
first i like to thank becky simone from beach bum vacations for arranging this hotel for us the location was great it was an short walk to the museum district the tram the street market the heineken experience and many restaurants although the rooms are smaller than i am used to it was clean and comfortable and quiet we arrived before our room was ready so they stored our luggage and gave us directions and maps so we could get around we returned at the time they suggested and the room was just about ready so they offered us some wine while we waited the last few minutes there is a restaurant in the lobby area that was always busy but we chose to eat in the area of the city which we were visiting for the day the little on the corner across the street was excellent too i gladly stay here when return to amsterdam,1.0
great hotel lovely staff and very helpfull peter at front had very large room with a lovely close to central station and city of some of local shops close to hotel as they charge twice the price of normal stores,1.0
this hotel was perfectly located and very comfortable do yourself a favor and use indoor pool and spa next door at the britagne it is amazing and do be disappointed that you ca use the outdoor pool there the indoor pool and spa is wonderful my daughter was upset that she could not use the outdoor pool until we visited the spa it was one of the highlights of the stay the service over all was great the beds are great pillows are great we were very happy,1.0
we wanted to stay in a hotel in dublin but knew we be tired at the end of our two week trip and possibly out of travel funds so we opted for this hotel with its good price and convenient location the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being so busy the room was clean and quiet we faced inside but the location is definitely the best part of staying here it so close to all of the restaurants stores and sites we loved being in the heart of the action the front desk arranged for an excellent cab driver to take us to the airport extremely early in the morning as we drove out of the neighborhood we could believe how many people were still out partying and walking the streets which reveals our age our stay at the drury was a great way to end our trip,1.0
nice hotel appears for business travellers but a lot of quiet couples and a few families stay here metro and centres walk away about on the metro to barcelona central and the metro runs till or a taxi is around euros back from the city breakfast was excellent the staff very friendly the pool was never very busy even though we stayed in july and the room was nice spacious and clean pay for the breakfast when you get there as its only euros per day not euros as advertised online i did like that it was directly near any restaurants or the metro although they were only a walk away so ca really complain and that we did have a room allocated to us when we arrived they offered us their last three rooms one of which would cost an extra euros we ended up staying in a smoking room although you never would noticed i had also emailed the hotel via and email prior to our stay and they never responded,1.0
prior to my stay i knew i would love this hotel due to the attention and detail the concierge team provided me they arranged from airport pick up to acropolis private city tour as i arrived to the hotel the location was amazing across from parliament house and walking distance to most of the key sites you would want to see in the lobby is a grand decor marble lobby yet with a cool modern twist the david bowie portrait as you walk in put a smile to my face the staff is top notch from the doorman housekeeping and front desk i booked the grande suite category facing with a view of the acropolis the decor is traditional and had all the amenities you need when staying in a luxury hotel i loved the deep soaking marble tub a must after walking all day in the heat of athens the sister property next door is wonderful and we had signing privilege i used the barber shop and ate dinner at the roof top of the gb hotel king george hotel you will always be my home away from home when in athens the general manager name is tim ananiadis and i must commend him for a fantastic team,1.0
try to always book in great location beautiful roof top restaurant with views of the parthenon i was told that a percentage of the profits go to a local orphanage which was a request of the owner when he passed away hope that still happens unfortunately it does have a pool but it a to monastiraki which has lots of restaurants great shopping,1.0

this is a quirky little hotel on the north side of the river liffey something to understand especially if it your first time in dublin is that the south side of the river is considered a little more up market than the north side that being said the hotel was good for what you paid and not run down just be aware there is a stigma attached to the north side we were on the floor and the elevator only goes to the so we had to go the last floor on a small creaky set of stairs the room we were in had a double and single bed with an en suite bathroom and over looked a courtyard so it was relatively quiet the staff was super friendly and check in went smoothly in addition the staff was attentive as we were coming and going there are a lot of restaurants coffees shops and shopping within a few minute walk also there is a major bus stop right outside the hotel for easy access to public transportation and is about a minute walk to the airlink to the airport the only negative is that the wifi would come and go in our room overall i would stay here again and it a perfect hotel for travelers,1.0
a very nice hotel with very helpful and accommodating staff close to the tube only stops away from the city centre and central station good bartender who served good cocktails the breakfast was fine but not spectacular i only tried the restaurant once and the burger i had was well cooked and tasted good the best thing for me however was the always smiling and nice people in the reception who did everything they could to make you feel welcome that also extends to the staff in the bar and in the restaurant a very special hello to dirk who i shared some drinks with on more than one occasion greetings from your shoe and foodobsessed guest,1.0
after a very bad experience at a travelodge years ago i usually avoid them like the plague so i was looking to forward to staying here when my sister in law booked us in for a night on a trip to dublin the hotel completely changed my hotel itself was very bright and fresh and spacious the rooms were clean and very comfortable everything was well maintained and had everything you could really made it stand out was the excellent service we arrived at midnight after a delayed flight and the night staff could not have been more helpful unfortunately i did get their names but both guys could not do enough to help us and other guests who arrived at the same time the next morning the reception and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful travelodge this hotel and particularly the staff are a great advertisement for youvisit july,1.0
very conveniently located close to all cool restaurants subway and cool hotel staff is simply the the cool part of the hotel is there is actual key not a key the rooms are very upscale and breakfast is always the i am not able to think of anything negative about this highly recommend this place for traveler on business or,1.0
casa camper barcelona really is the perfect place to stay when visiting barcelona not only is it in a great location but the staff is friendly efficient and knowledgeable the rooms are modern comfortable spacious and clean the breakfast is plentiful and delicious snacks and drinks are available all day and the price is reasonable there is also a roof deck a gym your own personal lounge including a hammock free reliable wifi and an outdoor wall garden if we make it back to barcelona this is where we will stay and i would recommend this property to anyone that will be traveling there,1.0
this hotel is located on the extension of la rambla so is very close to the main tourist location but far enough away to be safe and quiet there are dozens of tapas bars and restaurants along the street and lots of goods shopping very close we were able to walk to both cathedrals and the water front from the hotel,1.0
we stayed here are a couple in november the location is not the best but the tramstop right outside the hotel makes it very easy to get in and out of the city we stayed in a double room but did not have a double bed instead it was singles pushed together the facilities in the room were very good bathroom was excellent overall very good hotel,1.0
this hotel is just so good right on the river front near the halfpenny bridge staff are lovely nothing to much trouble always polite and helpful they are a credit to the hotel breakfast is to die for at it a bargain rooms clean and tidy made up everyday the show in the bottom of the hotel is fantastic and not to be missed included is a three course meal and it great food the irish band and dancers are brilliant the atmosphere was great too thoroughly recommend this hotel and the staff and the show we will be returning next year,1.0
we stayed two different times for a night each time we stayed with hilton points overall i liked the hotel as the rooms were larger than normal for europe and while not exactly close to the gothic area or exiample area it is convenient to the train station we used twice and airport and very close to the green line subway that takes you to the gothic quarter the building is a cool modern kind of european feel and our experiences with staff were good also the breakfast and breakfast area for hilton honors was good my only real complaint was the shower that was not real clear how to work we came back a second time and it was still tough other than that all good,1.0
this is a very nice hotel the staff is very friendly check in and out was very efficient the location is right near the temple bar area super close walk but without any street noise in fact that was the reason we chose it everything was nice i really ca complain about anything the only down side to the hotel is that it is very modern and so it does have any of the quintessential irish charm also the hotel is quite expensive so i would also say it is the best value for the money,1.0
the main point of my review is yes you should think about staying here if you thinking about it there not a better location in barcelona for gay or that out of the way i going to say some negatives and positives about the booked online months in advance with a prepay rate when confirmation came through it said we had no right to cancel without losing the full amount i went back and pretended to book again up to the final moment this was disclosed i immediately wrote to the office and said please give me a higher rate with some cancellation option they refused this is pretty bad customer service and a misleading website from my point of view either way it was a big trip we were getting travel insurance we probably wanted to stay there so i went forward with i like a lot of space and so we booked one of the suites it was lots of space but not mostly functional space my hunch is all the suites are kind of custom laid out i would book one again without getting the layout of the room first our room had an exceptionally tiny sitting area you never invite someone in to sit down unless you escorted them right to the outside balcony the hallway and closet area were unusually narrow we both thin and we could even pass each other in these areas also the whole room had a lack of horizontal surfaces for,1.0
love staying here when i visit dublin great staff comfortable hotel rooms and great location i did notice that toiletries were very sparce this time shampoo and soap but call to reception if you need shower caps surely cut backs should result in lower prices not so i afraid breakfast has improved i think fresh bread and hot food even for latecomers what really disappointed me this time was the bar food we were in a hurry and just asked for sandwich and some chicken wings the sandwich was smothered with mustard and arrived in a box with no garnish whatsoever the chicken wings were inedible i afraid no taste at all so pale i wondered if they were cooked right through the batter they used had no seasoning and tasted of taste on chicken either blue cheese dip was not pleasant very expensive too not a very good impression for our tourists really ought to step up and offer a bit more great hotel otherwise,1.0
wonderful hotel in a quiet neighborhood yet within walking distance of most attractions great food friendly servers and very accommodating hosts would definitely stay there again has rooms plus lifts,1.0

stayed at the mercer just after new year the location is perfect for exploring the barrio gotic ramblas and foodies we wanted to visit some nice restaurants so we emailed a few weeks before our stay the concierge were really helpful in organizing reservations at to reserve restaurants in barcelona after our arrival juan at the concierge helped us every day with directions maps reservations advice on restaurants and sightseeing he is one of the best concierges i had the pleasure of staying with the rooms are large with high ceilings well fitted out with very comfortable beds if we go back to barcelona perhaps at a warmer time of year we will stay at the mercer again,1.0
i stayed at the acropolis hill hotel from june and it did not disappoint the rooms are modern and a nice size the hotel staff were very hospitable and helped get you where you needed to go the included breakfast was excellent and had many delicious options the hotel is conveniently located in athens just a minute walk to the acropolis and a minute walk to the plaka and the metro there a rooftop garden with a beautiful view of the acropolis at night it a nice spot to bring a bottle of wine and enjoy the fireworks i would definitely stay at the acropolis again,1.0
good location with easy access to metro all staff were very friendly and helpful from start to there was only flat pillow per bed we stayed four nights and old towels and rubbish was taken out or toilet roll renewed for the whole time we stayed i had to go downstairs to reception twice to ask the receptionist to get us towels and toilet very basic things in my seemed annoyed when i went down the first day that it had been done by accommodation staff yet it happened again the following day again nice clean basic rooms great power in the work nearby acted as alarm clocks at most mornings and people coming in an out of other rooms on the corridor could be heard,0.0
you made me feel very welcome and surprised me for my birthday the rooftop pool was amazing even though it was sunny all the time javier the bartender was very kind and made great cocktails hasta luego see you soon,1.0
went on a four day city break with my partner to barcelona i booked hotel niu barcelona last minute i was dubious as what i would turn up to but when we arrived i was amazed as the hotel was absolutely spotless so modern we arrived late at night so the next morning we woke up to find a lovely rooftop pool and loungers a lovely bar in the reception and also a club downstairs with various artists on we was literally a minute walk from las rambles which is the main part of barcelona i would definitely recommend this hotel look forward to returning for another city break,1.0
we stayed at the hotel in april the room was spacious and the kids had a bunk bed in an ante room type space they had a small but well kept green space which was perfect for some running around for the kids and drinks for the is conveniently located when it comes to metro access not many eateries around though there is a big supermarket in a block close by they do have order in facility in conjunction with a local place and must say their pastas and pizzas were good,1.0
we got the airport bus into dublin which was really easy it stops just down from hotel we did realise we actually booked premier rooms so we had access to the premier lounge on the top floor this included free bottles of water tea coffee and biscuits all day and a light breakie in the morning cereal yogurt fruit croissants etc all we needed which was perfect room was fab big comfy bed lots of space bathroom was nice but my only gripe would be that it not very well lit in there it like it missing a spotlight dressing gown and slippers in the wardrobe coffee machine lots of storage space reception staff really helpful they book taxis for you shops and city centre maybe a min walk and temple bar maybe min we got taxis during the evening if going out it was too far to walk in heels great stay id definitely stay again thank you x,1.0

lovely clean room we upgraded as arrived early paid an extra euro which included breakfast which was mainly continental with bit of bacon and chicken sausage not worth paying for in my view but was nice and the restaurant was lovely and waitresses were too in my view almost for two nights was great value but my partner picked and all in all was nice stay anyone going amsterdam seriously watch out for bikes keep your wits about you,1.0
highly recommend staying at this property everything is first rate the rooms on premise dinning facilities and the staff are first class the property is in an excellent location close to the beach and major attractions would stay here again on my next visit,1.0
god is in the details this hotel has a great location and very nice amentities best top floor bar for no charge viewing check in was in need of help with customer service get fixed quote for trip airport taxi about one way for trip on railroad is cheap but step lively and be prepare for long walks and lots of time to clear airport huge otherwise a good value,1.0
a boutique hotel which was pricey for the location minute walk from train station minutes from anne frank house room was clean and comfortable nothing exceptional had a family room with single beds which were comfortable and plenty big even for my frame bathroom was strange as shower drain not inside shower door so whole floor gets wet if someone showers free coffee and espresso was a nice touch nothing wrong and nice but again location was a bit far from center and pricey for a family room,1.0
this hotel is a family oriented hotel close to public transportation and places to eat however it is not a five minute walking to the beach like they advertise the breakfast was ok the pool was beautiful but the water was beyond cold it felt like you were in a freezer,1.0
the grand bretagne has a beautiful feel the service was first rate from check in we arrived in the morning from the airport and our room was ready in an hour to room service and everything in between we had a lovely room on the floor the beds are comfortable and the rooms clean there is a area and concierge on the floor which is a butler floor that makes it easy to get keys make reservations etc the room had a courtyard view but was well appointed and quiet the ac was quiet as well which is nice breakfast is included and the buffet is vast and really good with lots of pastries spinach pie custards delicious breads cheeses eggs sausage and bacon the cappuccino are good and they come quickly the floor restaurant and bar has a spectacular sprawling view of the acropolis parthenon and the whole city for dinner the food is pricy and good not spectacular but very good more in a separate review overall we would definitely come back the hotel is quite large and in a convenient central location,1.0
coral hotel is a nice hotel with a great location this is not a resort hotel but a friendly local establishment that we would stay at again we stayed at the hotel because of a recommendation of one of our sailing coaches who lives in the area it walking distance to all the marinas in paleo faliro and there are a lot of restaurants both inland of the hotel and on the beach the rooms are a little small we had the family suite as we traveled with a friend of ours it comprised of two double rooms with bathrooms and a living room both rooms had balconies and the noise from the busy street in front was almost completely negated by the two layers of patio doors the only down point was one of the rooms had an older ac unit and it barely kept up with the heat in july maid service was good and overall the rooms were comfortable views were very good but only enjoyable after due to the heat the highlight of the hotel are their restaurants the breakfast room is on the floor and does a very nice job with full service its extra for the latte but go ahead and order one they were inexpensive and good breakfast is usually included but ask anyway when you reserve the breakfast manager was very helpful unfortunately we did get his name but he ran a tight ship and no need to go to starbucks blocks,1.0
i am writing this review to thank the staff for their outstanding service from the moment we arrived until we left the service was prompt thorough and the complimentary champagne to assisting in sorting out our trips around barcelona to the arrangements for a quick exit and taxi on the morning of our departure i would like to make special mention of marianne who did a brilliant job for my wife and i during our stay she and b hotel get a b for brilliant thank you dave and manuela dennis,1.0
went here for nights on my hen do great location and great breakfast but unfortunately that where the positives end two of the group had money stolen from their rooms and the staff at reception could have cared less rooms regularly smelt of smoke and weed which appeared to be coming through the air con huge stag do took over the pool and bar and staff made no attempt to keep them quiet during the day or night when they returned home screaming at around staff were loud and in the inner rooms where the window looked down on to what can only be described as a dumping ground heard quite a few people complain on checking out and not once were we asked if we enjoyed our stay total disappointment would go again and would recommend this place to anyone,0.0
like any travelodge it very convenient to what you want to stay in it was a good location to all the bars and restaurants but not to close where it was on your door step everyone at reception was very helpful would definitely stay again,1.0
efficient check in staff at reception extremely helpful and obliging beautiful rooms being clean spacious and with all working amenities breakfast extensive tram to city metres from hotel with easy minute ride to city centre would recommend this hotel,1.0
reasonably priced hotel in a great location just off ermou near sintagmamany options on the nice breakfast buffet but they do start until am which is a problem when you have early flightsstaff are all pleasantmany options for dining within a short walkthe rooms here are small and could do with some modernisation and revamped bathroomsin house caffe has reasonable meals at good prices tooin room mini bar and safe were handywalls are very thin and neighbours were making a porno with a goat i think overall would i stay here again yeswould i recommend to my parents and friends yesnot quite the star i used to but it served the purpose,1.0
stopped in this hotel for a drink it was about pm on a monday night and quite a few people already in and enjoying themselves live music meals the atmosphere was really good its was just a pity my wife and i were just in dublin for a couple of nights as we would have liked to have seen the irish show and have a we drank up and left to visit other certainly recommend,1.0
stayed there for nights while touring in athens am an ihg member and always stay at ihg properties across all my travelling but have to say that this one was different from other intercon across europe specifically the first nights we had a superior room which was great then we upgraded to a junior sweet with acropolis views on the night and this was magnificent did have breakfast there but couple times with room service which was so perfect and ofcourse the rooftop premier bar and restaurant made the stay even better it is minutes to syntagma square and plaka district the hop in hop off bus station is minutes walking at the corner of the house and taxis are there so you do have to worry about transportation staff are very helpful and this property has really a touch of luxury couple things they need to look at internet access which is different from otherr ihg chain hotel and their late night menu options which i found little bit limited other of that it was perfect yes drinks and food there is quiet expensive so you might need to watch your budget,1.0
great hotel rooms are tight but very nice and classic place friendly and very helpful staff free buffet including free beer etc very good location been there before and will go again thank you,1.0
stayed here for five nights on vacation with a friend the room was simple without frills but was clean and comfortable the staff was very helpful with assisting in directions and advice there was always delicious cold lemon and mint water in the lobby which we enjoyed on every trip into the hotel after days out touring the town the location is awesome across from the vondelpark makes it easy to find with a beautiful park to enjoy a five minute or less walk from the major art museums makes the location ideal close to the sights but far enough away to be out of the extreme touristy zones the hotel is also close to several tram and bus lines including a bus for direct to the airport there are several places to eat and drink very walkable as well we did have breakfast included with our room rate and did take advantage because we did want to spend on breakfast but when i inquired i saw they were making eggs to order and had a variety of offerings,1.0
fab little boutique hotel lots of cute pluses but a mixture of rather tired and old and more modern staff so friendly and helpful breakfast adequate not wonderful great location for temple bar and their own bar is brilliant great live music,1.0

stayed here for two nights after booking a triple room when we were arrived we found out we had been upgraded to room number the suite it was fabulous lots of room and very comfy beds the breakfast was very nice the only downside was the noise at night from the nightclubs opposite we were kept awake til both nights which spoilt the weekend for us as we were very very tired,1.0
lovely clean rooms with excellent and very quiet air conditioning unit greatly appreciated as temp this july was around degrees hot the staff are friendly and helpful with good humour breakfast gave good choices of both continental meats cheese and pastries along with some cooked items too we are three women and although the hotel is not ultra modern it is characterful with a lovely ambience we very much enjoyed our stay in this hotel located in the heart of la rambla one slight possible negative as across from the hotel is a nightclub that kicks out at if you a night bird this would be an issue,1.0

we spent three amazing nights at the one barcelona from the that was absolutely flawless to the food and the rooftop pool and bar we could not have asked for more the bellmen are absolutely great with a genuine hospitality oriented attitude and extraordinary professionalism the room was comfortable and classy beyond words the bathroom is gigantic with great amenities the bed is incredibly comfortable and they add a special touch by bringing you the number of bottles of water that you need which is always appreciated with a degree temperature the spa and the pool are great while the gym albeit small is well equipped the only minor dislike i had was with the restaurant staff as i felt they were not at par with the rest of the hotel the hotel is walking distance to la pedrera and casa batlò my friend and i like to walk and we had no problem walking from the hotel to the port or la sagrada familia there are plenty of restaurants around and it a very safe neighborhood i would highly recommend to stay at this magnificent property you will not regret it as it is worth every penny,1.0

this was a smashing hotel where we spent an enjoyable night break in march ok we were upgraded but i am sure the luxury level would have been the same there is nothing to say that is negative though we chose to take breakfast away from the hotel there is plenty of choice nearby staff were extremely professional yet friendly and helpful thoroughly recommended,1.0
we have travelled to many cities around the world and stayed in many hotels but this has the most comfortable beds and pillows ever the staff were were so helpful especially the blonde lady in the cocktail bar my wife and l thought her customer service was second to none a brillent stay ian tina,1.0

this hotel was just what we needed for our long weekend in barcelona rooms are fine with air con and safe although i did miss making facilities minute walk to the beach just be aware it near the nudest beach nice buffet style breakfast was welcome in the morning wifi was fine in our room on floor minute walk from the metro reception staff very helpful great base for lots of walking and exploring the city and the beach,1.0
an overnight stay whilst in dublin in this very clean and welcoming hotel the rooms comfortable and clean and although basic that is reflected in the very reasonable price the hotel is situated just outside the city but within easy access with good transport in also not too far from the ferry terminal and has a small car park to the rear of the hotel,1.0
great location courteous and knowledgeable staff room well appointed and all utilities worked well the hotel dining and public areas were also enjoyable and provided a comfortable and soothing santuary from the crowded city streets,1.0
we stayed for nights in a room facing the canal room was quite small but typical for hotel rooms in major european cities it was also a bit too warm however there was aircon we were unwell so chose not to turn it on service was friendly and efficient loved the room space where one could access and free bar in the evening breakfast was great with eggs prepared to order this is a well hotel and one we would definitely consider for our next trip to amsterdam,1.0
this was a perfect choice for a quiet stay in barcelona away from the crowds it was perfectly located near the beach a minute walk the service at this hotel was excellent the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay the rooftop pool and bar were and the view was breathtaking the distance from the hotel to las ramblas was about minutes by car we would definitely go back,1.0
the mercer is so wonderful that i want to keep it my little secret we had such a pleasant experience the rooms are well kept the hotel is stunning the breakfast was perfect every day the staff was friendly and extremely helpful looking forward to returning to this hotel again,1.0
wonderful welcoming hotel in a beautiful and vibrant city the hotel staff was amazing the location of the hotel was perfect for us the neighborhood was fairly quiet at night which we love and everything in the city was easy to walk to and if we could walk the metro and taxis were a half block to get anywhere in the city,1.0
nice pleasant hotel staff very warm and welcoming prices v competitive clean tidy and in a nice part of the cityhighly recommend this is nice and good selection of hotel staff very helpful will definitely stay here again,1.0
we absolutely loved our stay at the nh collection the hotel was beautiful super clean and in an incredible location it was so easy to get anywhere in amsterdam quickly each night the hotel did turn down and left a little chocolate on our pillow i know they can not guarantee this but my husband and i arrived super early from an overnight flight from the us and they were able to get us a room as soon as we arrived which was such a great perk they were so accommodating and professional highly highly recommend this hotel,1.0
the mate aitana hotel is right in the entrance of amsterdam super close to the train station and to the centrum of the city we walked there everyday and getting an uber to go to the attractions a bit farther like the heineken experience was super easy rooms are clean modern with a great view and staff is super nice the big plus is if you are driving to amsterdam you do need to go thru the chaotic city channels and parking is available right under the hotel for a euro daily fee could have been for free or at a lower rate for hotel guests but all things considered it was great would definitely stay again,1.0
had never been to dublin before was delighted with hotel great for st transport pubs museums shops etc bus transfer from airport stopped right at hotel hop on off bus tour just round the corner lovely hotel nice room nice service nice staff only thing wrong was the poor view from our room but everything else was excellent will be back for sure,1.0
we stayed in the rooms which was quite luxurious the beds were very comfortable lovely decor and lots of room for our three teenagers the location is excellent and was the reason we chose it as we only had one day to explore dublin the reasons for only stars the exercise room was closed and this was very disappointing we paid well over for one night and this was the price so not having really any other amenities was a bit of an annoyance the hotel has a partnership with trinity college to use their pool however this is an extra cost the breakfast the price for hotel guests is per person in this family budget dublin is a very expensive city we get that but at least have the gym available or offer a room discount if it not in use or how about a free pool pass when the gym is down tip for breakfast we went to sparta right around the corner and had fresh pasties yogurt and a stack of bananas for just over,1.0
most of the staff we encountered during our tour were absolutely brilliant and this place was no exception the staff were genuinely just plain nice they were also very good at their jobs so when you get to the tired and frustrated stage after a busy and tiring day touring then this place was just plain worth was also had taps that were easy to use they had a hot tap and a cold tap that mixed in the pipes and you did get scalded trying to use we had a very comfortable although i do have one bone to pick with the staff and that is the the staff took our baggage out the front door but refused to assist our drive with loading the bus this was the only aspect that i really could fault and did make me a little angry considering the amount of money they get paid by our tour did affect the rest of the service,1.0
my husband and i spent three nights at this hotel in july of everything about this hotel was wonderful we arrived early from the united states around and we were given a large corner room with a king size bed two large picture windows a huge bathroom with a shower and bathtub and there was a small table with two chairs in our room the bed was comfortable the room was cleaned every day there was a coffee maker in the room the front desk staff was very helpful showing me on a map how to get to certain locations and what bus to use to get to specific locations this hotel has an indoor pool and gym which are both great there are restaurants in the hotel one of the restaurants overlooks a canal and it was enjoyable to have dinner there and watch all the boats on the canal this hotel is within walking distance of the museum distance and some nearby parks we had an early airplane flight and the front desk staff arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport when in amsterdam again my husband and i would stay again at this hotel,1.0
hotel was very nice and has a great bar but in the morning housekeeping knocked twice and just walked into my room this was at even thought check out is until noon everything else was fine great location near stephens green and the luas,1.0
we had an amazing but tiring time in amsterdam and we were glad to have the sir adam to come back to the room was perfect the bed and pillows were among the most comfortable i ever slept in cosy with a faux fur blanket that was beyond soft it had all the extras you need cold drinks and climate control the black out blinds meant i got a great nights sleep the air con is a tad noisy but we quickly got used to view from the room was beautiful and we could watch the cruise liners come in and out it was just a sort walk and a free ferry ride to amsterdam centraal there are a number of nice bars nearby the sir adams own restaurant the butcher provides tasty burgers and a nice outdoor seating area to eat them in whilst watching the world go by we would definitely go again,1.0
we stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon and thoroughly recommend volkshotel for any first time visitors to get on the train from the airport it costs euros each and brings you right into amsterdam centraal from centraal station you need to get on the metro that the underground one not the trams above ground for four stops you can buy a ticket from the machine outside or inside the station i would advise getting a ticket that covers the amount of time you are in dam for very good value conveniently the hotel is located before the lines all split off so it does matter which you get on you get off at wilbautstraat this means the metro is running every couple of minutes to the hotel rather than having to wait for a specific train handy when coming into centraal station from the hotel you need to cross the road and ensure you get on a train heading to centraal station again because there are five lines all running that way you never wait very long when we checked into the hotel we had a party bag waiting for us as a gift to the newlyweds which was a nice touch a party hat a couple of party horns and a pack of bubbles made us smile the check in was swift and simple and the staff were friendly we chucked our bags in the room and had a look round the hotel there is,1.0
a very clean and tidy hotel within easy walking distance of the tram and bus and city centre the receptionist was polite welcoming and helpful absolutely spotless room large and airy very good free wifi,1.0
although we were exhausted from the long flight from the moment we entered this historic family owned hotel we were welcomed and cared for rick gave us a handwritten map of the important sights and we took a canal tour to further our orientation of this beautiful city the hotel is in a lovely residential area within five minute walk to vondelpark van gough and other beautiful museums center the delicious breakfast is included and served in a beautiful room by warm welcoming staff highly recommend,1.0
we stayed here for nights and could have asked for a better time upon arrival staff were eager to help and even asked us what our goals for our trip were so they could point things out on the map for us breakfast was great with different hot choices every day literally everything is within walking distance from this hotel the furthest tourist attraction being a minute walk and the central station was only less than a minute walk away the rooms are quite small but nothing out of the ordinary for europe i would highly recommend staying here and would certainly stay myself again,1.0
i have sent three nights at this hotel in fact it is lots of georgian houses turned into a hotel this was very well done and is well complimented by the furniture and decor in the various common rooms downstairs the hotel is well served by lifts reception was extremely helpful and even cared without being asked to to book us the tour we would have liked to go which had to be done on line as it was too late in the room was very clean and spacious though not large was equipped with tv safe and facilities breakfast was reasonable not a grand choice but enough service in the restaurant was location is just off a main street and though not too central is very conveniently located both for shopping and to visit the main tourist sites around minutes walking distance was a very pleasant stay in a very pleasant hotel i would not hesitate to recommend the hotel,1.0
this place is fantastic we booked a junior sweet as a little treat and we not disappointed from the exceptional welcome from two young ladies on reception one in training to the fantastic views you not beat this hotel it central location is fantastic just far enough out of all the city noise but five minutes walk and you in the thick of all the action top tip book the breakfast we did it on arrival and was worth every penny a massive selection from cooked breakfast to fruit and everything in between do miss the pancakes amsterdam has so much to offer and this hotel is the perfect base to explore,1.0
the first thing you notice when you enter this hotel is that they really trying to make a warm and welcoming yet modern and different atmosphere i didnt book a room but i went to the lounge to get some coctails first thing i noticed was a very handsome bartender and since i was going by myself i decided to sit there i didnt know what i wanted so instead i gave him three questions that he would answer with his drink the bartender was charming and took the challenge making me one of the best drinks i have ever drank i highly recommend tiago whiskey sour both of the bartendes were very charming and took the time to talk to me when there were any customers friendliest bartender i have ever met stars,1.0
key points the hotel is one block from evangelismos subway we were able to easily take the subway and walk to all the major sites and museums from this hotel we enjoyed the outstanding breakfast buffet each morning we did not use but were impressed by the quality of the hotel fitness facilities and indoor and outdoor pools we encountered a problem with our first room and were offered another room immediately both first and second rooms were clean and rooftop bar overlooking the acropolis was a lovely capstone to an evening of touring front desk and business centre staff were all very helpful lastly we also very much appreciated how quiet our room was the windows are very well insulated like what we experienced in places with hurricane glass between that and being on an upper flooor we were not conscious of traffic noise at all there was minor noise transfer from the adjacent room through the wall hallways were thickly carpeted and sound was quite muted,1.0
walking distance to the agora hadrian library ermou street monastikari and the clean subway bringing you in less than minutes to the entrance of the acropolis some of the streets immediately around the hotel are less attractive but as it goes with all large cities athens appearance can change in a metres walk very friendly reception well throughout the building rather expensive and when we visited busy rooftop bar with a small but refreshing pool and a nice view of the acropolis breakfast was top very good beds all very clean recommended,1.0
after a river cruise we had days to explore amsterdam the concierge at the marriott took charge providing a wealth of information and booking a private walking tour for us were extremely helpful also helpful were his local restaurant recommendations purimas and trattoria toto were minutes away and lived up to expectations the executive lounge off the lobby was another plus for our well stocked with efficient friendly service,1.0
we were a family of adults kids and stayed here from this was a rare amsterdam hotel that had a room for people and was within our price range we had a two bedroom suite with a bathroom my sister and i were in the bigger front room and the kids stayed in the adjoining back bedroom front desk staff was perfect very helpful our rooms were clean and housekeeping maintained a high level of cleanliness throughout our stay the bus to the city center was a minute walk from the hotel the neighborhood was very quiet and near the bus stop were restaurants supermarket pharmacies and little shops would gladly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam,1.0
staff could not have been more helpful or more knowledgeable the entire hotel was clean and quiet the bathroom was fantastic and quite spacious by european standards would definitely stay there again,1.0
the hotel was beautiful and the service was superb we were particularly impressed and touched by the personal service provided by guest relations officer derek burke who upon hearing that we wanted some authentic irish scones made it his personal mission to surprise us with them when we were leaving his personal service and attention to our needs were typical of this wonderful hotel we look forward to visiting ireland again soon and we definitely plan to stay at the clayton thank you derek,1.0
this is a beautiful hotel with elegant rooms excellent breakfast lovely pool and spectacular views the staff was friendly and helpful we would stay there again and recommend without hesitation,1.0
a good location with excellent room was small and had no view but was spotless clean and staff was got the room for early checkin at am on arrival a very nice room was always cleaned while i had area on the roof is not that big but had around sunbeds a small pool and a jacuzzi very location of the hotel is really good just a short walk down to las ramblas and the area around the hotel is filled with local restaurants and two brewey pubs,1.0
good location but that about it we enjoyed walking around the el born neighborhood and barri gothic word of bring earplugs the walls were so thin we could hear everything happening on the street below it a pretty busy street to begin with plus ongoing nearby construction made it even worse no one likes to wake up to the sound of a hammer drill on vacation to make things worse we could hear all the commotion in the room next door to us also terribly designed bathroom there nowhere to put anything and the toilet is so close to the sink you have to do an awkward shuffle to sit and stand probably the most uncomfortable bed of our entire week spain trip do yourself a favor and stay in a quieter part of town,0.0
we checked into room which would have to be the smallest hotel room i have ever seen one side of the bed is flat against a wall therefore you can only access the bed on one side the bathroom is unbelievably small the basin is so tiny you ca even wash your face without water going all over the mirror yourself and the floor as you sit on the toilet you are squashed between the door and the shower positives of the hotel include air conditioning nice balcony however always too hot to use staff where friendly the location of the hotel is perfect and very central and good water pressure from shower negatives include very small room when asked to change and even pay extra we were told nothing was available the smell of the hotel which is strongest in the room is horrible it smells like some strong chemical when we checked into the room the sheets where stained and we asked them to be changed to which they where changed within the hour and breakfast has a poor variety and is would not recommend for families or couples probably best for one person who will spend minimal time in the hotel,0.0
the hotel as a great location at the water at min from the city center the hotel is very busy manly visited tourists that is also the drawback no real focus service for business travelers the roof top bar offers a great view over amsterdam the rooms are special is the nice apple tv system although it would have been comfortable if the screen would have been bigger the pasta ordered from the room service was not very tasteful and nearly cold when served the restaurant with view over the water offers a mediocre quality of food the staff is not very friendly,0.0
we had a one night stay in a very comfortable and clean room at back so not a good view the hotel is well decorated and style befits its history staff very helpful and friendly we enjoyed a lovely full breakfast from a wide range of choices hotel could not be better located ten yards from street and a tram stop just feet away from door of hotel the dining room is lovely and bar has a good feel and serves good food one negative there is no lounge to to sit around in other than the bar which can be busy overall a great hotel if a little expensive,1.0
i am delighted i booked the monegal it is right on the plaza catalyuna only steps away from the ramblas this is the area you want to be in the hotel is basic no frills small rooms butperfect ofr me for a day stay it is clean and quiet at a good price there is a very generous breakfast offered as well i would certainly stay here again as i hope to visit this glorious city again,1.0
we are heading out from a night stay here at margo house we ca believe the attention to detail and the service provided we are staying in room and loved the modern sparse decor there was ample space for my husband and me the hotel staff has been exceptionally attentive we ca recommend this place enough some hints breakfast is amazing let yourself fill up on some amazing jambon cheese and pastries and then have a nice pastry before you take a siesta use the loaner bikes to tour around town they are easy and enjoyable and barcelona is set up for cyclists take the route bus right out side our door up to parc guell each and you get to see parts of the city you might not otherwise the parc guell itself is stunning and home to the gaudi parc travel just a little north west of the hotel for some more local but still stylish food options do get stuck in the tourist trap restaurants,1.0
my partner and i had wonderful nights here room the service from the get go was outstanding could not fault it at all the room was spacious and clean and very generous with bathroom amenities the room we were in had a small balcony which was lovely the hotel has a gorgeous rooftop bar with stunning views over barcelona and lovely cocktails mojito we also indulged in room service one night which again was delicious and could fault breakfast also had a wide selection and goes til i ca fault the hotel or the staff it was a wonderful spot and very close to a few scenic spots highly recommend staying here,1.0
antonias is the man to look out for he will help you with absolutely anything you need and be dead cheeky about it breakfast is huge delicious and free try the tomatoes air conditioner works like a charm when you can figure out how to turn it on it just a wonderful place to stay at a wonderful price and honestly if you really afraid of the neighborhood as some reviews have suggested do go to athens neighborhood is fine and close to nightlife without it being a noisy distraction,1.0
hotel location is ideal for exploring barcelona it is close to many places very good quality breakfast staff is very polite and the receptionists are always willing to help you and give you the best advices and tips about the town,1.0
the hotel lobby is beautiful you have several areas to sit and relax there is a little area for coffee and doughnuts bagels etc the staff is very nice friendly and helpful the room size was not bad for europe there is a fitness center however it is only open from i was gone before and did not return until after so i was disappointed because i love to workout daily the rooftop restaurant was awesome the views are breathtaking you can see the acropolis and at night it lights up the sunset views are amazing also there is a buffet restaurant the food is good but a lot of the same foods daily within walking distance to shopping district of plaka,1.0
we were looking for a highly rated hotel in the centre of dublin and many people recommended westin at the price of over per night this is what we got drunk obnoxious neighbours who were falling in and out of their room slamming the doors all day and all night hotel staff that offered to move us even though we were sleeping rather than moving the drink neighbours we checked another room which was even worse than the room we had before it was facing inside the hotel in the bar area so windows could not be opened so hotel idea of helping is downgrading the room elevator that smelt like two days old alcohol and made us want to throw up going into it after getting no sleep i had to get used at for work so if you are looking for somewhere nice to stay that is professionally ran and has knowledge of hospitality do not stay at this hotel,0.0
like many of the reviews below i can not believe this hotel has only review a star rating it quite simple to get to from the airport take the train a couple of stops from the metro it around a ten minute walk the hotel itself is around a minute walk from the main shopping district in barcelona it far enough out that you do get traffic of transport or people but it has plenty of great bars surrounding is a lovely restaurant attached to the hotel it a tapas restaurant which is fairly priced but great if you in a rush or having a late staff were lovely and friendly and swiftly checked us in when we arrived we were provided with a map and the member of staff highlighted key places of interest and explained how far away they room itself was great we were on the second floor and even had a small balcony there was a safe provided hangers a hairdryer and a mini bar the shower was great and the room was very clean the only fault i could find with the room was that the walls were a little thin luckily we did hear conversations but we could hear people in the corridor and in the rooms next to us slamming their doors the room was cleaned every day which was great and we were provided with new towels when we needed them there is also a fantastic rooftop bar the first night we,1.0
we stayed in this hotel from thursday to sunday prior to setting off on a cruise it is very convenient to the museums and is within easy walking distance of the rijksmuseum and the van gogh the tram stop and which takes you towards the centre and central station is about minutes walk away we had breakfast included which was tasty fruit cereal cold meats eggs and bacon as well as bread pancakes and other things available on request the hotel is small and the bar and lobby area also small but comfortable dinner on the first evening was made by thomas both he iris and andre were all very friendly and helpful we ate at restaurants on the other nights beds very comfortable a good choice,1.0
with my son and a friend we were in barcelona to attend a football match at camp nou we spent one night at el jardi this little hotel is ideally located in barri gotic area its charming facade is overlooking typical plaça sant josep a drink at the tiny bar del pi we came into the historic building we were kindly welcomed and proposed a cozy functional simple bedroom view from the balcony on the famous catalan gothic church santa maria del pi was really a short but quiet night we came down to eat something and have coffee as the breakfast room was a bit gloomy we went outside and took our café and buñuelos at a nearby terrace looking at the city coming to life around the pine planted in the middle of plaça del pi all in all we had a pleasant stay at el jardi,1.0
this hotel has a great view of the acropolis with a five star restaurant the rooms were quaint and very modern the beds were very soft and the bathrooms were roomy the athens attractions are in walking distance if you are coming to athens this hotel is an amazing choice,1.0
the hotel was lovely could have asked for anything else located close to central station so we were able to just get off train from airport and walk to hotel easily which was great because it allowed us to get checked in drop off our bags and start exploring though there are trams stopping just outside because we had nice weather we decided to walk everywhere so i advise to bring a good pair of walking shoes it was probably the best way to explore and see the city,1.0
the location is fantastic we stayed in a two room apartment at botany bay it is basic but fine there were no cooking pots although there was a cooker but maureen the cleaning lady was extremely nice and helpful and she found us some pots main issue is the price we paid euros for six nights plus for a camp bed for three of nights this was the best part of euros for student rooms for less than a the door cards stopped working several times and we had to go back to the accommodation office repeatedly to have them restaurant in the campus closes at which is very friday night the students upstairs were extremely extremely rowdy and disruptive and were shouting and jumping around like a herd of animals,0.0

a very nice place to stay more than content very well decorated a very comfortable bed a lovely bathroom although it located a little out of the city it next to a train station so you may reach the center very easy it pretty close to the olympic stadium and me as a greek was really impressed that all the surrounding streets had ancient greek names a quite area though there were enough sites to enjoy cafe or dinner a simple but interesting breakfast lovely stuff nice and international mainly young guests i d certainly come back on my next visit to amsterdam,1.0
the room was excellent and the view floor city side was spectacular not too bad a walk to and from the train station although i did take a nasty fall in one place where there was a surprising step down in the middle of the sidewalk and look out for the bicyclists who act as if they own the road the hotel provides free shuttle service to and from the train station as well but on a limited schedule that requires reserving in advance staff were very helpful and gracious,1.0
the location was key we only stayed one night and wish it could have been longer it was a bit loud at night however we were so tired from flying in from canada we both slept through the noise they do provide ear plugs which i never seen before in a hotel downtown the breakfast was delicious the staff were great security guard named martin was great to talk to would stay again for sure,1.0

stayed here for three nights last weekend in order to see at the amsterdam arena thousands of fans in the city had pushed the price of hotels up but i d booked this trip back in january so had managed to get a decent hotel provide a shuttle service from the airport you just come out of the arrival hall and find shuttle bus stop the service runs every mins and takes about mins to the in was quick and staff efficient and friendly had brought the wrong plug adaptor with me but the souvenir shop sells them so was able to buy one is in the restaurant on the floor fantastic views and superb choice of food we were offered a discounted rate of euro per person at but didn t think we be eating there so didn t take it up as it was we ended up eating breakfast there on two mornings and enjoyed it full price was euro a couple of taxis on the first night to get into the centre and back they were around euros each time it makes much more sense to buy a travel card again from the souvenir shop and use the trams which run every mins past the end of the road the hotel is on for euro each we got days free travel on trams buses and metro around amsterdam the woman in the shop explained exactly how to use the tickets gave us maps and we had hassle,1.0

we loved this hotel the location is perfect there are trams every few minutes we never waited more than and you in the centre within about minutes so easy to use tickets are very cheap and you can use them all around amsterdam we got much more than our moneys worth the hotel itself is stunning the rooms are basic we stayed star but clean and comfortable the bed was wonderful so big and comfy and the duvet was the best i ever had in a hotel we slept like babies it is like a little museum so quirky the restaurant was really nice very decorative but a little pricey for our kind of stay we mainly ate out the coffee was lovely i can not fault the place at all we will definitely stay here any time we are in amsterdam,1.0

if i could give it more stars i would as everything was wonderful from the moment we checked in and out our room was spotless on arrival they had even taken the time to leave a complimentary pudding with happy birthday written on it for my boyfriend as we were celebrating his birthday while stayed here for and cant grumble about anything every day the room was cleaned bins emptied towels and toiletries replaced i think the housekeepers do a wonderful job and i found it refreshing that they take the time to talk we ate in the hotel bar on a couple of occasions and found each meal to be made from good quality produce i liked the fact that all the sauces were is separate dishes instead of on the plates as not everyone likes to have their food plastered in sauce all the were friendly and took the time to tell us the best bars to go to in town for live was busy but the staff handled it brilliantly i do think i would have been that calm such a wide range of foods were on offer they even had plenty of gluten free the front desk staff from my observations they get the brunt of visitors complaints as check in does seem to be a bit of a nightmare at times due to this some guests were extremely rude to them granted there did seem to be enough staff on reception but that does give,1.0

cozy small hotel in a nice quiet part of athens rooms with new furniture and a nice comfortable bed there is staff service numbers if needed contact them immediately it is not in the historical center of the city but in the beach area minutes walk to the clean beach since the area is not a tourist all shops pharmacies cafes and restaurants are focused on local residents but there is no need for communication difficulties accordingly taverns cafes with good food not to sell high prices because the area thriving not far from the fashionable beaches of athens the historic center is about half a hour by public transport tram bus same number to go to the airport bus stops of public transport and bus eksperes to the airport five minutes on foot,1.0
i booked cubik in october for my partners birthday as a surprise present even before arriving when i sent emails asking various questions the replies were prompt and very helpful and friendly so this automatically got the hotel off to a good start when we arrived we were greeted with friendly staff on the door and at the reception desk and also with a glass of champagne as our room was not quite ready which we were absolutely fine with we were given vouchers to get two free cocktails at the roof terrace bar which is amazing and has views all around barcelona cocktails were lovely as was the tapas they serve when we actually came to get our room number the hotel offered another two vouchers to get another drink at the bar at any time we wished we could believe all the complimentary things we were offered what really topped off our stay was the bottle of cava and two chocolate cakes we received in the evening of our first nights stay as a congratulations gift from the hotel to celebrate my partner that melted our hearts and was so thoughtful onto the general hotel are kept scrupulously clean and are a decent size some may find them on the small size we had an internal room however we thought the room was more than comfortable as we spent the majority of the time sight seeing and eating out and were only in the room to sleep the,1.0
the hilton is a nice hotel it is one of the taller buildings around the area and i had a direct view of the acropolis from the balcony there are many restaurants around the area and it under miles to the acropolis and less to mount if you walk to lycabettus watch out for a road about blocks just before getting to the tram station it has numerous restaurants which i recommend you was efficient and courteous room was clean there was a nice concierge lounge with great views no negatives that i can think of other than it could be a little closer to the tourist attractions but do think its fair to ding hilton too much for that and anyone should be able to walk miles as a did not try the hotel restaurants as i wanted to try the local cuisine for transportation uber works great but do think they have spread out beyond athens yet there are yellow cab taxi but i prefer uber because they speak english fares overall nicer cars and more i come back yes for business and with family,1.0
i only stayed for two nights the hotel is not in a nice neighborhood with a few deserted surrounding buildings but inside it is nice and clean with great roof terrace the rooms are clean only remark is that like unfortunately in most hotels when you leave the room the air cooling device switches off and when you come back the room is hot the breakfast is excellent walking distance possible to the center and acropolis,1.0

first impressions are good really nice lobby friendly reception staff but no doorman as a hilton gold member i was upgraded to a room on the higher floors the room was a reasonable size immaculate and tastefully decorated with a feel the property next door is undergoing building works but did hear any noise during my stay the bar is also nicely decorated and has a good selection of service was variable initially attentive but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it was busy and staff lacked knowledge on the menu having requested a swedish whisky which i was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu the staff member had to go and check with another on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an arran a scottish island whisky off the back bar and suggested it hardly the same the hotel has a couple of restaurants alfie and coberg the first has pub food including a number of veggie options the second which is also where breakfast is served has very limited veggie options pasta and salad with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish i did dine in either given so many options nearby in town breakfast was a disappointment no orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte such as toast vs self service on being seated and it not being particularly busy it took minutes from ordering to get a cup of,0.0

this hotel is in a great location with views over athens we stayed on the executive floor which in hindsight was a bad idea the room was next to the lounge and it was very noisy all day long i guess people ca keep away from free cookies room was very comfortable nice balcony check out was tedious tip to hotel at around noon it probably a good idea to have more than one person working at reception it took mins to check out,1.0
this hotel is really close to the museums as well as the paradiso venue canal cruises are also right behind the corner we stayed only one night in june but even though the room was not so big it was modern and comfortable and clean the shower was nice however be careful so the water does run down to the room we arrived earlier in the day and it was a relief that we could do early to leave our luggage in the room and refresh before going out can recommend this hotel for its convenient location modern and compact rooms and very good breakfast,1.0
this hotel is a major dump some of the staff not all there was one young man who was so helpful in finding us a taxi after telling us that uber does have enough cars there were so rude and disinterested they should really find another job the room had lights that were broken some hanging out of the ceiling one of the night tables had a handle pulled off so they simply drilling another hole to the right and put another in the shower was built for people tall and the floor of the bathtub was so slippery that my year old niece fell and thought she broke her leg it is a terrible hotel pay a little more and stay somewhere else,0.0

the hotel is near in plaza catalunya las ramblas and the shopping areas there a metro station near the hotel universitat station which makes it easier to take the public transport basically the hotel is not that big but we got junior suite room which is for me pretty big for persons the hotel is clean and their breakfast has variety of food you can choose from the dining area is a little bit small especially when the area is full of guests but all in all i will say that this is the place to stay if you want to be in the center of barcelona,1.0
good hotel nice room located right in the center the restaurant and bar on the top floor have great food and a stunning view on a terrace is the smallest swimming pool i have ever seen with a view over the royal if you go to amsterdam and money is not to tight to mention for you this is the place to go,1.0

we did not get the room we pay for it was clean but very small that is about all bad we have to say nice staf little pool and not enaugh space to go into pool since we close to beach it was no problem with that so we go there to bus and metro but dont eat at the restaurant they need to improve a lot go to restaurant close to hotel instead many many to chose from at the beach and like around there with tapas and other no stars but ok if you want to fill your little belly any way i would go there again the weather is fantastic and walk at the beach nighttime warm is worth the trip and place itself,1.0
despite the ongoing renovation work the staff we encountered were all courteous friendly and very helpful we had a beautiful room in the college wing and we slept so well bed was very comfortable and room was warm hotel is in the heart of the city and we walked to wherever we had to go dublin castle temple bar and iveagh gardens to name a few we did eat in the hotel but only because we were out so much car parking facilities are great if a little bit of a hassle trying to get parked outside the hotel to check in first before you can access the car park you need your room key for the lift loved our stay,1.0
i often stayed at this hotel and always found it exemplary on this occasion we merely called in for a drink which is not really a reason for a review however the service and cordiality was wonderful and thus warrants this review in the past we have been extremely well attended to by siva but his absence was more than made up for by dharam and brian again well done herbert park great service as usual,1.0

this hotel was typical for europe where the rooms are rather small the room was comfortable the staff was absolutely great and the hotel is very near public transportation and the restaurant district we spend very little time in the hotel while we are traveling so our main concerns are comfortable sleep cleanliness and location this hotel supplied all of that very well,1.0
the location is perfect the room are clean and very well organized the swimming pool is amazing and it stay open till late night and the galaxy bar and restaurant are one of the best in the world not only breakfast is full of variety so every one can enjoy and the servies you get in all the hotel amenities is just flawless,1.0

the doormen are always the best part of the w hotel experience at the amsterdam w the doormen offered a friendly welcome on the street and quickly got us checked in and comfortably to our room they also man the concierge desk at street level and were great in assisting with suggestions on ideas of where to go in the city the biggest issue we found at this hotel was the lack of housekeeping and maintenance attention the blinds did not work in our room and two of the ceiling lights were burned out we were told on that it would be resolved immediately when we returned to the hotel four hours later at pm they had not we were moved to a different room with similar maintenance problems in the bathroom the toilet brush was tangled with toilet paper from a previous guest stay and the holder was full of soiled water we asked repeatedly at the desk to have it cleaned and in our three day stay it never was dirty glasses with the last sips of left over drinks that we brought up from the bar were left by housekeeping sitting on the desk and not removed in the daily room cleaning you would expect more from a hotel of this caliber i would revisit this hotel for the restaurants and rooftop bar but would be reluctant to rebook a room here,1.0

very cordial reception very good shuttle service to the central railway station however the restaurant could use more servers dinner took way too long but person adjusted bill located within walking distance of cruise ships and across from tracks,1.0
great team very professional but at least this weekend with fun personalities and a quirky sense of humour location is perfect very central convenient for trams and buses but quiet charming and an easy to walk to key sights restaurants and bars rooms are nice modern and not bad size beds are comfy the only negative was the wash basin outside the bathroom breakfast was fairly common for european hotels and not bad value after discounts the honour bar and vibe in the small but cosy reception area is a nice plus,1.0
the hotel is quite good spacious and clean little bit far from the city center but has two shopping center right next to it and lots of get a good value for the price you pay,1.0
very conveniently located bars and cafes around easy walk to plaza catalunya where the hop on hop off bus is airport bus shuttles are also within walking distance rooms are clean though old design hotel staff are friendly would recommend superb value for money,1.0
in what world is this star first impression in the lobby very good but that where it ends the rooms are maybe star at best bathroom a star max serious my grandmas bathroom is more luxurious and that has been updated in my lifetime appliances in the room are terrible the hairdryer looks like something george lucas casted when making the empire strikes back no coffee machine and the kettles barely big enough to make one coffee at a time it get some sort of device that make a decent coffee and not that freeze dried cheap stuff for the prices you charge this is asking for much also where do you get of charging an for the desk phoning a taxi absolute scandalous if i knew this at the time i would have phoned it myself would have cost less even with the overseas charges on my own phone but i was told this and was unable to dispute it because you already taken it out of my holding deposit which you take on arrival in case of any damage done durning the stay there no need for this unless you see things in the room as some sort of antiques which could be the case as it does look like they have been updated since overall cheap dated and deceiving sums this hotel up,0.0

we spent nights here pool area is nice but too small for the number of guests staff are very polite friendly and helpful and out was dreadful very long queues we had to wait for mins just to get to the desk i travel every week on business around europe worst i ever encountered the room was quite dated and the maintenance and cleanliness left a lot to be desired certainly not commensurate with see photos security was a bit worrying too door lock on room was faulty and did always work correctly and there was no requirement in the lifts to use your room key in this day and age very unusual for a hotel of this grade reception was busy and anyone could have walked in and gone up to accommodation floors or pool area one guy in reception area who i never saw stopping and checking anyone hotels in barcelona are notoriously expensive but this was not worth almost euros a night,0.0
hotel is nice location is great breakfast buffet is nice and diverse sri yes as the iphone lady is super nice and helpful she works at the restaurant staff is generally nice and cooperative and friendly but the single room is really small narrow and rectangular the bathroom is really small and in a corner so if u open its door it blocks the tv this is how the room is narrow also has a shallow bath tub so the room does match the rest of the has good security measures the elevator does work unless u have your room card,1.0
my husband and i stayed at this amazing hotel for just two nights but we were made to feel so welcome it was our wedding anniversary and chose this hotel for the central location and rooftop pool area nothing disappointed and everything exceeded our expectations friendly staff throughout the hotel we were greeted with a glass of cava a room upgrade and champagne on ice sent to our room the pool area is breathtaking and we enjoyed our evening set meal too i would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting barcelona that are hoping for a central location with a sophisticated touch thank you grand hotel central you helped my husband and i make some wonderful memories on our anniversary,1.0

the location is great for exploring dublin the bus stops are close and it possible to walk to many tourist attractions from this hotel the staff are a huge plus they friendly and helpful often going out of their way to provide directions or answer questions the hotel truly is a little gem in the heart of dublin the optional breakfast however while convenient was not a good value for the price,1.0
do be fooled by the look the rooms are very nice and clean with great amenities despite having the bathroom in a separate room is a bit strange it is also very clean and i do consider it as a drawback we have not tried the breakfast the location is great you have direct connections to the central station and city center in minutes walking distance as the prices for accommodation in amsterdam are quite high this hotel provides a great ratio,1.0
the hotel is brand new but it looks like it was adapted from a business building and they missed some details the staff was very friendly but i believe they need more experience the was free and good but a bit annoying to setup every time you return to the room i found the location just a few minutes walk to some busy areas with restaurants and bars and near business and metro stations,1.0

our family of stayed in four rooms for a couple days before a sailing trip through the greek islands the hotel is ideally located with breath taking views of the acropolis and an easy stroll to old town i have been there before on business but had to return with my family because dinner on their roof with the views of the acropolis ca be overstated their food and their greek salad were among the best we experienced during our days in greece the staff is unusually attentive as an example my youngest son arrived separately from the airport as he entered the hotel one of the staff casually asked how much he paid for his taxi the staff member said he was overcharged and ran out to the driver and made the driver refund my son the overage where else have you ever heard of a hotel staff being so proactive there are lots of other examples of how helpful the staff was as well i would stay there again without question or hesitation,1.0
nothing is too much trouble to the staff in this first class hotel we were attending a concert in the aviva stadium and the staff were happy to provide directions provide details of public transport or arrange a taxi for us the rooms are spacious spotlessly clean and very quiet there is a very friendly atmosphere within the hotel and as stated the staff are always available to assist in any way they can it is slightly expensive but it is an ideal hotel for that special occasion and worth every penny,1.0

this modern hotel has always been great pay extra for acropolis view its worth it spacious rooms but the kicker is the amazing rooftop bar much more refreshing than the great britannia pool great huge and clean with all day sun with plenty of loungers a short walk to parliament square and to some nice bars and restaurants the breakfast is amazing,1.0
lovely hotel with a dipping pool on the roof top where you have also a superb view the hotel is very clean and everything was well organized but the best is the location of the hotel super close to plaza catalunya and pg de grazia with metro connection stations to the beach a minutes walk to la rambla we would be def come back to avenida palace,1.0
my wife and i selected the swissotel amsterdam primarily for it location in the heart of the city overlooking dam square the hotel is only minutes walk from amsterdam centraal station and due to flight times we arrived before the hotel pm check in this was no problem to the hotel and reception staff in particular we had a coffee and our room was ready within an hour and what a room our room window overlooked dam square with the benefits that brings whilst travelling for work i have stayed in some wonderful hotels in numerous countries but could only describe our room facilities as tremendous extra spacious room with flat screen tv excellent simple wifi connection comfortable modern furnishings with ample storage facilities wonderfully comfortable extra king size bed spacious luxurious bathroom with separate shower and bath ample luxurious towels and complimentary toiletries i must praise the reception staff rob in particular who could not have been more helpful on numerous occasions his assistance and knowledge were a great help we made a great choice and had an excellent weekend break,1.0

my partner and i enjoyed an excellent night stay at this hotel it is well located in close proximity to the metro and gothic quarter and a minute walk to place de catalunya which is a central hub of activity in room was not ready upon arrival however hugo was most helpful in letting us drop our bags in to go exploring the room was lovely and spacious with a bathroom and separate dressing room there were complimentary chocolates on arrival to the room and each late afternoon at approx our room was left with more chocolates and neatened up separate from the main clean during the day the hotel is clean and has a lovely terrace bar with a swimming pool with ample space to sunbathe eat and only downside was that their were noisy roadworks going on opposite which started early morning however this was no fault of the,1.0
the best thing about the hotel is the location right next to the acropolis museum highly recommended and a short walk from the acropolis and all the attractions the room was clean and basic too few electric outlets but the balcony was a plus especially in the evening breakfast was adequate the airport transfer suggested by the hotel welcome pickups was very useful,1.0

booked this place on hostelworld so i was expecting it too be more like a hostel than a hotel there was so social area to get to meet people and half the time my room was empty the shower was really temperamental temperature wise and the water ended up flooding the bathroom floor the light is so dim you practically have to shower in the dark two bunks crammed into the tiniest room and the wifi did work at the very top floor which was where i was also did feel safe walking through the square and outside the hotel there were so many men just lurking around cat calling me i felt very uncomfortable,0.0

fabulous safe location minutes walk to the metro with easy access to plaka the acropolis etc staff were very helpful and friendly the rooms were comfortable and spacious extra dining area and separate kitchen is ideal for anyone who might be eating in the apartment the was a great benefit especially in the of in the immediate area with a small kiosk outside the hotel for improvement breakfast larger breakfast area and more food selection internet was hit and miss at times gone completely on occasions lift was out on service on a few days which makes it difficult when you on the floor have mobility issues,1.0
this hotel was in the middle of town walking distance or a quick train ride to most of the attractions our room was exactly what you expect from a hilton property knowledgeable and friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms the restaurant however is a hard pass for dinner breakfast was the usual mediocre but dinner was over priced and disappointing there is a tapas place right next door,1.0
i booked through a wowcher for a flight and hotel deal to the senator it was a surprise trip my friend who turned i had some issues with the travel agent and was also disappointed that as we arrived late on the saturday night we only had the free use of the spa facilities on the sunday as it is shut on a monday and we were returning home early morning on the tuesday however we very much enjoyed the spa the staff were friendly and helpful i had emailed in advance that it was my friend birthday and they supplied us with a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a lovely touch the roof top pool was a nice touch but a bar up there and cushions on the sun loungers the are solid hard wood would have improved it the breakfast was wonderful with an abundance of choice the room was nice and we traveled into barcelona on the bus which was cheap air conditioned and took about mins both my friend and i agreed that we will most definitely come back and stay at the senator again,1.0
when you are in a city for a weekend you want to be in the hub of things this comfortable hotel with friendly staff is a hop across the bridge from temple bar and it amazing selection of pubs and a stroll from all the shops in the opposite direction the added bonus is the lively bar downstairs highly recommend this hotel for weekend breaks with friends in the city,1.0
according to travel blogs and statements metaxourgio not that safe and you have to be careful at night well if you consider couple of balkanian travel agencies few abandoned buildings and some closed down stores than yes but metaxourgio my experience of days and has proven that it is an ok area and actually quiet and cosmos is located few hundred meters from the metro station in a tree lined quiet street across the street is the beautiful but abandoned building of hotel is a star hotel and provides you exactly what star deserves hotel is from the including the furniture lighting and fixtures but clean so are the are no frills everything basic and functional it is a very cheap hotel and you are metro stop away from the centre or minutes at the reception helpful there are bars coffe shops and restaurants an excellent price what else do you need karaca b from constantinople,1.0
only stayed in the hotel for one night the room was a big enough room for city centre hotel comfortable furnishings the windows were onto a busy road but we completely sound proof the bathroom was a little dated but more wear and tear than anything else it had a bath shower so not for those with mobility issues but fine for us the shower had great power did get breakfast so ca comment overall it good value for what you get for a city centre hotel,1.0
hotel is average with decent sushi restaurant but reception has no manners when i was checking in the reception worker was chatting with someone not working in the hotel and mentioned my nationality to the friend in dutch i do know what else they were talking about but i felt they were mocking me for some reason,0.0
lovely hotel in central athens with really friendly helpful staff the breakfast is great but we did eat in the restaurant for lunch or dinner the rooms and bathrooms are big and most have a balcony i think although if you looking for a view of the acropolis you need to request it our room was out the back of the hotel and looked onto an old disused building did bother us but might some people i guess there a stop for the sightseeing bus tour in the square right opposite the hotel and it a walk monastiraki station where you find a good little flea market and only another to plaka from there lots of lovely cafes and restaurants no pool and the gym is tiny but overall pretty good value for money and a really handy location,1.0
have been there on business trips many times at least i would say around this time i came back with my wife for a night on our way to the islands always a great choice ca let you down positioned very conveniently can reach sintagma square in minutes thanks to the free shuttle bus service which runs like every mins i think very grand elegand luxurious they always leave a nice gift in the room which i ended up collecting strongly recommended,1.0

we chose this hotel because it had stars and what we thought to be a great location a minute walk from central station this was our first visit to amsterdam and in hindsight we would have been much better off selecting a hotel away from the crowds milling around the red light district it like new orleans during mardi gras on acid i agree with other reviews the front of the house staff is top notch friendly polite and professional we were escorted to our connecting rooms and which are in the basement with views of the parking area and the amenities were fully explained on the positive side the free breakfast was terrific and you ca complain about a free mini the downside i feel this hotel deserves stars at best our rooms were not up to the same standard of other star hotels we stayed in during our week trip the entire hotel had an old run down feel and the housekeeping was in my opinion substandard windows were dirty crevices in the shower were not clean had room and the nespresso machine did not work the tv had been reprogramed so i was unable to access english stations and the shower door was quite simply defective the shower door in room slid in three sections creating an opening of around inches the shower door on room had an oversized glass panel which only allowed the door to open inches i am small and squeezed in sideways when,0.0

during our euro trip we stayed in different countries and hotels thankfully this was our final stop as it could not have been beaten we were greeted by roberta who was extremely professional and helpful she gave us a tour and took us to the rooftop terrace for a welcome drink excellent touch she then took us to our rooms where our bags were waiting for us the room was beautiful and clean it was a little small but we could have paid more for a bigger room in our booking the highlight of the hotel is the rooftop terrace and food in general we ate at the restaurant twice because the food was sublime expensive but fabulous if anything there could be more cocktail options on the drink menu but that if i being really picky the view is amazing and many of the locals came to eat there to take it in loved the breakfast menu and the fact you could order the day before this is a breakfast not a style breakfast the service was good and the food was fantastic great start to the day if anything the air conditioning unit could be situated in a better place in the room in order for it to work properly it was located under the desk and did get the air throughout the room fully but we were able to sleep overall the whole experience was fantastic if we visit again we will definitely book here and would,1.0

we had booked the hotel rialto for our one week holiday in barcelona we stayed in the hotel for nights and then decided to book another hotel even though we did nit get any refund for the missed nights and this sums up our stay in the hotel very arrived late at night to room that smelled like mold we were able to change our room after our first night we had a room facing the street but the street noises did not bother us at our floor aircondition did not work properly it was way too cold in the room during nights somebody came to our room without knocking the rooms were dirty do look under the bed and not dated the bed was very uncomfortable it was very hard no proper location was very good that is a definite bonus if you are thinking about booking a budget hotel think twice before coming to rialto there are better options available in barcelona for this price range,0.0

rooms were huge lovely soft bed with big pillows soft sheets bathroom also more than big enough for two with nice amenities soft big towels the area around was maybe not the prettiest but a min walk from the beach close to marina metro and from roomservice was good will try capri by fraser again if they have it at my next destination,1.0
stayed here in and staying here again will not return from management to front desk staff it been a poor experience it not the same they keep apologizing and sending stuff up to the room i need more action less gifts not letting my mother into her room after i specifically asked the front desk intern to add her name to the room at was and is unacceptable especially on a hot summer day management or leads do not help the situations i would list them by name but i will not several situations have occurred since i am not happy please also note most staff are interns but i honestly think it management issue best to all of you who decide to stay it really unfortunate,0.0
lovely hotel fantastic view over the wonderful park lovely atmosphere and very polite and friendly staff the room was modern and stylish free wifi the restaurant serves exquisite food the scallops are to recommend the tram stops just outside close to restaurants and food stores and street markets the train station is within walking distance the breakfast at the hotel is fantastic we lived our stay definitely coming back,1.0
i stayed at this hotel several times over the years it a fun hotel with a perfect location for tourists close to the action but without being directly in the madness that is central if you want that only walk a few blocks the streets area where it located is quiet but has many shops and dining opportunities and the location on a canal is i return to this hotel because of all this the friendly staff and frankly it a bargain compared to the high prices in amsterdam thanks for another nice stay,1.0
we stayed one night in the hotel balmoral and found it very satisfactory the room was comfortable and spacious and reasonably priced for a four star hotel the staff were efficient and helpful the only quibble i have is that we were not allowed access our room when we arrived about an hour and a half before the official time unless we paid an early fee although the room was clearly ready this is the first time i come across this policy and it was the welcome i expected,1.0
back yesterday from a night stay at the marina my teenage daughter and i had a basic twin room on the floor i asked for a quiet room away from the bar and rooftop pool and away from the lift which i was given as in any hotel earplugs were useful the cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm the pool is on the floor it superb after sightseeing it was a quiet sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill it got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available even if there were any loungers left my only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool the itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful pillows comfy bed was clean so all good the staff were all lovely and helpful particularly the staff on the ground floor it a min walk to the beaches which again were superb la rambla and casa bastilo would be a bit too much to walk i think so we hopped in a taxi are taxis to the left of the and then walked back ish alternatively you could catch a rickshaw bike along the beach front part of the way and then walk the rest to the bottom of la rambla la sagrada familia is walkable about mins up a straight road with,1.0

staff was friendly fasting and check out specially the accommodation they did for us as my wife and i were celebrating our anniversary hotel was clean and location was near attractions and transportation the only bad thing that the room service is not hours,1.0
was the only place other than a hostel that we could get booked when attending a robbie williams concert in the aviva stadium and it was expensive but soooo worth it the hotel is within spitting distance of the stadium you can walk to it in about mins unfortunately when we arrived most of the carpark was taken up by a radio tourbus and we had to park nearly half a mile away and walk back with our cases in degree heat but we entered a large luxury air conditioned lobby the male receptionist dealt with us very efficiently and we were on our way to the room in minutes added security of having to use your room key to access the hallway to the elevators and rooms so no random people wandering about the rooms were large and airy very clean the bathroom was big too we didnt get time to try dinner or the bar as it was so busy breakfast the next morning was great wide selection and piping hot buffet the best coffee ive had in a hotel in a long time staff were all lovely so yes its expensive but a great hotel id like to go back when its not jam packed with robbie fans,1.0
this hotel is just a couple of minutes away from casa mila and casa battlo which is terrific the staff is very friendly the price however is higher than we have paid in other neighborhoods so i doubt we would stay here again if we were just visiting to start a cruise the breakfast buffet is very nice,1.0
we stayed in a private room with separate bathroom the room was clean and cozy the rooms came equipped with a refrigerator and coffee maker the cabinets where crockery and cutlery are supposed to go were empty though the staff at the hotel were very helpful and gave us ideas on sights to visit nearby the hotel itself is less than a minute walk from sloterdijk station which in turn is another minute by train from amsterdam central trains runs every couple of minutes if you do plan on buying the daily travel pass to get around the city and prefer to sight see on foot or on bikes the travel to and from amsterdam central is euros per person,1.0
my son and i stayed for a weeks holiday and i can not understand why this is not a star hotel everything was perfect from the rooms to the very friendly staff who go out of their way to disabled i usually come across some problems but not here my accessible room really was just that i would stay here again a big thanks to everyone,1.0
this hotel has been around for about years art deco design elements bedroom deco reminiscent of that era too but still comfortable clean friendly helpful staff right on a tram link to the main station near a bus link to the airport near the museum quarter and next to a canal with hop on hop off boats hotel recommended excellent local restaurants and we very helpful about public transport options it a big hotel so could feel a little large and impersonal for some,1.0

visited barcelona and was looking for a hotel which looked nice as well as not being too expensive when we arrived was pleasantly surprised by the decor as well as the friendliness of the staff when we got into our room we were scared to touch anything in case we were charged but enjoyed every night that we were there we also received hour in the spa which as a group we all enjoyed apart from having to purchase a swimming cap at there were many different facilities making it both friendly for adults and children the breakfast every morning was amazing with a variety of different foods to satisfy every need with many going back for more food the only disappointing factor was the location as it did smell the nicest as well as being minutes from the beach and very far from the city centre but close to the metro meaning it made it easier to get around,1.0
not aceptable very dirty and a lot of dust very old and it smells smokey in each room the breakfast was ok but it does matter with such bad rooms we cancelled and booked another hotel this hotel does have stars in my eyes,0.0

i loved the location and the cleanliness but our room was tired and very small and dark and the double bed was sagging completely at the only side not against a wall the toilet was very dark on a plus most of the staff were very friendly and helpful bar maybe one who could only be described as quite rude,1.0
i bought this trip through travel republic as a surprise for my husbands birthday i emailed ahead and asked for a nice room with a view as it was a surprise i had booked transfers arrived and there was no one waiting for us we waited for half an hour but nothing we walked minutes through the terminals and we came across the transfer office they did not apologise just made a phone call and said minutes minutes later still nothing so i went back to the desk and they made another call and said minutes we were completely fed up by this arrived at the hotel and the lady on reception told us to check in at and took our bags and gave some information about catching buses etc she was the only helpful person i came across we collected our luggage and went to the room yes we had a sea view and the window opened wide which was nice and that is the only good thing i can say about this hotel the room is in dire need of updating walls are badly marked and when u pull back the curtain there was mould the bed was hard and the only plug socket you could use was if you unplugged the lamp or fridge trying to get ready was a big issue as a woman the hairdryer was in the bathroom but getting ready in there was impossible no air con in bathroom gets too hot to,0.0
this is a very cosy place indeed my favourite when it comes to business trips quiet and discrete with high service and lots of privacy good beds and nights are silent a nice fireplace where you can have business meetings my first priority when it comes to stays in dublin been visiting multiple times highly recommended hope to be back soon,1.0
this hotel has two extremes excellent being the staff who were always attentive the drinks and service at the bar the food provided at the lounge the location terrible being the design of the rooms ours was a queen suite with so much wasted space and terrible sharp the executive lounge which was like a cheap pub on a friday night too many people no supervision shocking food handling practices we moved completely from the lounge for drinks into the bar where they provided good service great drink variety and just shook there heads at the poor behavior in the lounge administration need to fix this problem,1.0
stayed in this hotel for nights over the weekend for a star in barcelona this was great value for money a lot of the other ones were coming up a lot more i have stayed in numerous hotels in barcelona and this was one of the nicest on site parking which was great as barcelona can be a nightmare to find parking pool on roof was one of the smallest i have ever seen resembled a bath the pool bar was also very over priced for a vodka crazy room was nice could really fault that except wires to the open and shut blinds hanging around i hear a lot of people moaning about the location but barcelona is so huge to do the sights your not going to be near some and closer to others the tubes are the easiest to use in the world so easy to read and just pop on and off in minutes tube station is next door to hotel,1.0
i booked this hotel mostly based on price and location we were in dublin for the concert and visiting the city for the first time so i wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis the hotel was great there are four of us two tall teen boys in tow and i wanted to be sure we were stacked on top of each other i read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations it did and then some upon arrival we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready fine since it was well before scheduled check in i pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the us that flights arrive in the morning but the hotels are always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation americans have of being arrogant travelers we saw this again upon arrival at this hotel americans angry that no room is available at am checkin is clearly noted as pm if your flight arrives at am and you want to be in your hotel at am you need to book it for the night prior if you can not do that then do,1.0

very classy quirky venue that has so much to recommend it wonderful rooms stylish and comfortable a shower to die for extremely helpful and friendly staff we would recommend it without hesitation,1.0
we decided to stay here because it was in the heart of la ramblas and close to the boqueria we loved it here close to the metro buses restaurants beach etc we had a room in the front overlooking the la ramblas and it was in june we had the airconditioning on at all times so we had no need to open the doors yes opening the doors noise but keep the airconditioning on and we slept all night with zero issues the breakfast was average i would buy it especially being next door to the boqueria you can eat there everyday it was clean convenient and close to it all i would go there again,1.0
stayed here for one night from work very friendly staff and welcoming and helpful which is what you need on arrival rooms are lovely specious and beds are comfy breakfast with the most amazing variety of food and quick service too also smiling faces all around even tho breakfast starts at that was very helpful as if you need to catch an early train like me you can still have full breakfast perfect,1.0
no complaints staff and hotel were wonderful construction prevented entering through the main door but not an issue the staff was both helpful and knowledgeable many attractions are minutes away,1.0
when we arrived our to our first room there was a musty odor we waited and thought that it might air out eventually after showering before a cocktail party we were attending the bathroom flooded the flood was not from a leak but rather poor during a shower water accumulates on the lip of the tub and because of poor design the water travels around the tub and onto the floor no way to prevent short of not using the shower when we called guest services which was difficult since none of the buttons worked and there was no instructions regarding hotel services and explained the situation a maintenance person was dispatched and quickly informed us of what we already knew the problem was not anything he could fix because it was a construction problem we were then moved to another arrival to our second room we found an extremely cold environment degrees celsius we promptly set the thermostat to degrees and left for our cocktail party for which we were already late after the cocktail party and dinner we returned to our room to find the temperature still degrees despite the degree setting we promptly called guest services again easier this time since the phone buttons worked and were told to turn off the and open the windows to warm it up that worked until it became too hot and humid at about am turned the back on only to have it cool to instead of the degrees it,0.0
hotels that provide free water still and sparkling in this case coffee nespresso and internet get my high vote plus friendly service attentive and comforting plus delicious breakfast plus free paper in the morning many pluses definitely a great place to stay,1.0
i but away from the city center which is actually very good depending on your interests but close enough by a bus or taxi ride it a castle but also a pretty modern hotel with very good service will definitely be back assuming i would go back to dublin,1.0
the merrion hotel is the best hotel in dublin and it deserves this title i look forward to staying there anytime i am in ireland the staff go beyond what is expected for them and they are very genuine in their wishes for you to be completely happy in the hotel i love the food it is beautifully cooked and of top quality the breakfasts are amazing the selection from the buffet if enormous and wonderful as are the cooked items rooms beds and bathrooms are sparkling clean i particularly like the room that looks out to the amazing garden if you are in dublin and appreciate a hotel that is one of the best you can experience then you must stay at the merrion it is one of the leading hotels of the world,1.0
we stayed at the marker as our first stop in ireland as part of a day trip we were greeted warmly and promptly checked into our room upon arrival the front desk valet and bell service were very efficient we were in our room with our bags and the car valet parked within minutes of pulling up to the hotel we booked a suite which had nice views of the adjacent bord gais energy theatre the room was nicely appointed and a good size toiletries were of a high caliber i blanking on the brand temple bar dublin castle trinity college and other sites are minutes by foot but we took a cab for under used the hotel as a base to visit northern ireland on a day trip to belfast the giant causeway and rope excellent accommodations and service,1.0
a recent one night stay was our first since the hotel was rebranded as to see the hotel has reclaimed many of the characteristics which made the old burlington such a great dublin were greeted by friendly professional reception staff and although we arrived in advance of official check in time we were allocated a room without room was well equipped spacious comfortable and which goes on until is excellent with a wide choice of fresh fruits cereals and hot area is quite large but the staff have no difficulty in providing an efficient location is excellent just a short bus hop into city centre but there are a number of very good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity if you want to give the city a look forward t staying here again,1.0
the staff were very nice from top to bottom the pub was nice and the breakfast was good the room was dirty and in great need of maintenance do look under the bed the lamp shades were barely hanging on the hot water faucet was loose the shower was leaking and the safe was in operable and broke either they plan on selling the property soon or plan to rent out each room until it ca be rented again the one i was in was very close to this point but on the positive side the location was great they can arrange parking for you about a block away underground and the staff is very nice bring earplugs and an open mind do pay too much and the place will be fine,0.0

we stayed at this hotel for one night before heading to the greek islands this hotel was a good price and very well located for seeing everything we needed to see for one day in athens such as the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka neighbourhood the entrance area is nicely decorated and our room was a reasonable size and air conditioned there was free wifi however there is no lift so you must carry your bags up a spiral staircase a great stay,1.0
this review is to cover both the two hotel and axel in barcelona i spent the weekend june july at the two hotel the urban spa on sundaythis the third time i have stayed there this year and the team make you completely welcome as a single traveller it can be difficult to feel at home in particular when you in such a beautiful romantic city the two hotel team make you feel completely at home and provide answers to any questions that you may have with a friendly the sunday i treated myself to a massage at the axel urban spa the treatment can only be described as outstanding as the two masseurs ricardo y martin not only provided a perfect treatment but worked as one seamless team in terms of rhythm pressure and completely professional complements to a great duo and also to the entire team for a fantastic weekend and i will be back soon,1.0

we spent a couple of days at this lovely hotel in a beautiful area of amsterdam the area is just outside the busiest part the centre of amsterdam which is full of wonderful restaurants and bars it only a few minutes walk from the main areas and was very quiet during the night which was great for being so close to all the nightlife staff were very pleasant and friendly,1.0

i stayed two nights in kimpton de witt and it was just perfect clean comfortable helpful staff conveniently located in the centre one of the best hotels i have been to it could not have been better thanks to the management and staff,1.0
excellent location walk from the room was small and bathroom tiny but clean enough a little noisy at nights because of the traffic and pubs in the at reception was ok you just have to ask if you need anything because they wo ask you first esther in care of breakfast is lovely and wifi in the hotel apart from the lobby,1.0
spent one night at the maldron hotel with my wife having previously stayed there on a lads rugby is very good the rooms are nice and come with trouser press making facilities i used the hotel car park that was cheap compared with other parking available nearby although very limited and tight reception was prompt and helpful the lifts require a room key when going up from reception this is added security overall a very pleasant stay that is in a good location to access central dublin,1.0
the hotel is centrally located a short walk from plaka monasteraki the national gardens etc right between the acropolis and the temple of zeus because these huge monuments are located on either side of the hotel many rooms have fabulous views so does the rooftop restaurant and bar where the complimentary breakfast buffet is served the greek yogurt and fruit was excellent the staff is also very helpful and courteous and rooms are the only downside to this hotel would be the size of the rooms which are quite small my husband and i each had a large checked bag and backpack and in a standard room there was no way to even set both of our bags down without having to jump over luggage to get to one side of the bed after our first night we moved to a superior room and it was larger but still small given that athens is a major metropolis and the location and quality of the hotel i do think the room size is a major problem but just be aware overall a very nice stay and we would return,1.0
see title no complaints whatsoever temple bar is in walking distance and just around the corner are bus stops for those who prefer them to walking only downside can be quite loud at night due to being at a busy street,1.0
dreadful hotel they tried to take before we arrived first i knew about it was when the fraud dept from my bank contacted me then we had to leave early due to my father being rushed into hospital on life support in unlike klm who refunded all our flights including airport taxes refused any refund disgusting at such an awful time for all the family especially after they tried to take a considerable amount of money before we even arrived the floor was not clean in the room also you can not open the windows as you are practically sitting on the train track and tram line and there is no aircon in the rooms do not stay at this hotel,0.0
stayed here for nights before embarking on a river cruise and can highly recommend the hotel check in was smooth room was great free crisps and nuts but beware the fridge and do move any of the bottles or you will be charged they did leave a tiny space for your own goodies though thought the peekaboo lights in the bathroom were cute but would probably have appreciated them more odd years ago right now we would have preferred a night light if there was one in our room it was working we had a quiet room with a small window and a view over the sperm art installation this was perfect we had jet lag we slept breakfast was superb lots of choice and serves not too big though you could still eat as much as you wanted of course no issues with any of the staff they all performed as you would expect my only complaint very expensive,1.0
our room was upstairs but there is an elevator if needed staff is always available to help out if you need anything maps advice anything we needed was give to us the deck outside our room was wonderful breakfast could have been better the greek yogurt was amazing and there was always plenty to eat location was also perfect so central to everything we wanted to see,1.0
me and my partner stayed here last week i can still feel my head pumping from the noise of the disco throughout the night i did realise on a thursday night i would have been kept awake on the third floor by the disco smallest hotel room i ever stepped foot in only plus for this hotel is reception staff were lovely and more than helpful,1.0
nice city hotel with a very good location in the middle of the rooms are spacious and the gym is well lady who checked us in laura was very welcoming and friendly and gave us a lot of would return,1.0
we loved our stay at this hotel the property was amazing the food was fantastic the staff was beyond helpful housekeeping accidentally removed my wife personal pillow they went above and beyond to return it clean and pressed the only issue was our bed there was a huge hump in the middle of our king sized mattress so my wife and i could not sleep next to each other i asked the front desk and housekeeping to look into the matter on separate days and they both promised to look into it but it never was resolved and no followed up regarding it other than that issue we had a fantastic stay,1.0
the air conditioning was not working very well it is hot in barcelona in july someone had been smoking in the room and the air unit was just circulating the smoke we both woke up feeling ill the sheets had holes in them and we were sleeping on box springs not a mattress we were each allowed one were very disappointed and tried to book another hotel but there was noneavailability the hotel was clean and the sangria was very good but notgood enough for us to be able to sleep through the night we were exhausted,0.0
the loaction of this hotel is perfect really close to everything tge rooms however are pretty basic if not slightly below average it not fancy no fridge no toiletries no ac but they do have a coffee tray also my room view was facing a wall but i sure there are better ones if you ask worked perfectly in the staff were amazing very friendly helpful and nice also their bar legend bar is perfect great service and staff,1.0

beautiful hotel well equipped rooms very clean the hotel is in a great location close to activities but the room itself was very peaceful we would definitely stay here again wifi service was poor to mediocre,1.0
we ordered sofrito and something else which it was made from pork meat the sofrito is a very special dish from the good time of the venetian era in corfu what they brought you could call medallion caprice du chef it was well cooked but was not at all sofrito well you can say what you want to an unsuspected tourist we are not the case the other dish which that was suggested as something like pancetta was tasteless indifferent poorly presented and vegetable contradicting the unsalted main elementand without imagination my critique is based on what one expects from a restaurant desert with chocolat the same poor taste no odor fortunately the calvados was very good,1.0
there was a mixup between our booking and the room being upgraded that required the manager to get us a second room to accommodate our family this took about minutes but there was no extra charge to us for the rooms were in the address which is the newer part of the hotel they were very nice and modern really cool technology for lighting ac controls yes ac room attendance etc no sheet just a comforter duvet which annoys me but it s the same in most of northern europe there is a nice roof top café for those in the address i do think it is accessible by those in the older section of the hotel i also not sure how rooms get booked in the older newer section or if it just luck to get the new one there was nothing differentiating the two on the mobile breakfast buffet was well stocked but the room got quite busy likely due to peak tourist location is great it is right across the street from connolly rail station it about a block from the bus station the airport busses drop off on talbot street coming from the airport and pick up at the bus station it a short walk to o connel street within a minute walk to most of the city center attractions about minute walk to guiness teeling or restaurant bar was nice with friendly staff and good food they were accommodating for our young kids and had,1.0
this place is gorgeous and has everything you would expect from a star hotel we checked in and our rooms were not yet ready they had some free refreshments in the lobby cookies and tea while waiting for our rooms we headed up to the pool bar for lunch which was amazing gyros souvlaki great greek food for our first day in greece we had connecting rooms for our family we had the kids in one and we stayed in the other our room was upgraded to a grand suite and we were greeted in the room with a fruit basket aperitif lots of free water and pastries this may have been due to my husbands platinum status the staff was falling all over themselves to be of service making sure we had everything we needed the hotel had all the amenities you would expect hair dryer toiletries etc there is also an unbelievable spa area with a gym indoor pool sauna types of steam rooms foot massage baths hair salon the rooftop pool is great with a nice view of the city bar service is available at the pool the chairs are limited but i had no problem getting one at the location can not be beat steps from the metro station and walking distance from all the athens attractions and shopping areas the breakfast is in the floor rooftop restaurant with an amazing view of the acropolis it was included for us due to status but its pricey,1.0
we had been looking forward to a short stay in barcelona and picked this hotel due to the modernist architecture which did not disappoint however it was missing the touches you would expect in a good three star hotel and decent four star service was slow from waiting to be seated at breakfast to replacing faulty swipe cards and failure to replace pool towels for afternoon arrivals the worst evidence of the complete lack of focus on the customer was that despite reporting a faulty lock which allowed us to have interconnecting rooms with our children this was not fixed and we spent an uncomfortable night listening out to ensure they were ok this could be a great hotel but sadly just scrapes into the mediocre category we stayed in far better barcelona hotels it a miss and spend your euros elsewhere,0.0
exarchia is a area and a bit rough in central athens the hotel is situated close to exarchia square where you can some fast food joints restaurants and bars rooms a simple but clean in total it a rally good budget alternative,1.0
this hotel is incredible it luxurious and clean with easy access to the centre however i found the local area better staying here again in july and can not wait staff and rooms amazing definitely recommend,1.0
we had a fabulous stay so glad we chose this hotel perfect location not too touristy but close enough to all the main attractions rooms are exceptionally clean and quite large for a city centre hotel pool area is small but very nicely done and a great place to cool down with a drink after a day of sightseeing most importantly it is the staff that make the hotel special all very welcoming and could have been any more helpful with booking trips restaurants etc,1.0

when i go to a hotel i want a clean comfortable room at hotel fita i got that and so much by a father and son the son the owner hotel fita is located a few blocks from the van gogh museum and the rijksmuseum plus restaurants and public transportation they provide nice clean and comfortable rooms with excellent sunlight and they provide a complimentary breakfast with pastries eggs bacon and wonderful wonderful it the people that make the fita so good to stay at the father greeted us checked us in and carried our bags up the elevator to our rooms he and the son serve the breakfast the staff are all friendly the only things i did like were that elevator i a claustrophile and it made me claustrophobic and the only alternative the stairs which are narrow twisty and potentially worth the price they charge,1.0
i stayed at this hotel for two nights there were no complaints however the room was incredibly small there was a lovely rooftop restaurant with outstanding views and good service except for one dinner where it was extremely crowded and we ended up staying an hour longer because of the service a pretty good hotel overall,1.0
this hotel came just perfectly suitable for me the room was very comfortable and quiet the internet is fast and easily accessible no password and not limited by number of hotel is adjoining a huge public park that we enjoyed walking in the morning and late staff are genuinely friendly and helpful from front desk to the house keeping team the hotel is on direct route to most of the places and it wouldn t need more than one change to go to any other place in and restaurants coffee shops and groceries are within stone throw away from the hotel nespresso coffee machine in the room with varieties of coffee or tea much better than the kettle and optimally located,1.0
a few times earlier we have stayed at the melia hotel in barcelona and wanted to try melia in athens i think athens gives better value than melia in barca i must praise the welcome from alexandros what a wonderful man he made us feel special wonderfully welcome the rest of the reception staff are great thanks at the same time the service is lousy from the cool guys in the sky bar unfortunately the rating needs to be a little bit down sorry alexandros you were amazing the hotel is a bit tired but the rooms work well with all the amenities i have a feeling you get decent value for money with breakfast included but the internet is so bad that it surprise me in but the food in sky bar you have to steer away sad quality but the drinks are incredibly good even though they cost euros same price as in norway so for us this is natural but the view of the acropolis from the sky bar is worth the entire stay if you get a good price i would recommend this hotel although bad internet lousy food in the sky bar poor service from the bar because the vibe is quite ok and the location is perfect i wonder of how little it is for this hotel to be really good thanks anyway,1.0
it was our visit in athens and also in adrian hotel it was renovated since our previous visit in and all the facilities in the room were modern and clean we admire breakfasts on the terrase with acropolis view the best location close to the city centre we never use transport visiting different sites quiet place even the window is on the adrianou street a lot of restaurants and shops nearby we will stay again in adrian hotel next time,1.0

innathens was a great little centrally located hotel in athens the rooms were large well appointed and contained everything for a comfortable stay most importantly air conditioning for those hot days in athens a traditional european breakfast was also available and could be eaten in a wonderful little courtyard what made our stay however were the staff at the hotel we were greeted warmly upon arrival despite the fact that we were several hours early they were able to have a room made up so we could check in and start exploring the city the staff went out of their way to be helpful and to ensure that you were comfortable they provided directions to a wonderful traditional greek restaurant arranged for a taxi for our early morning departure and even provided a takeaway breakfast,1.0
this is the first place we stayed the beginning of a month journey in ireland the we booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early we wanted to be sure we had the room apparently there was a miscue the hotel thought we were a no show well this amazing staff jumped right on it had us in a room in no time they were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way it went uphill from there they recognized us when we were in the lobby asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable we were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our night stay we booked the room through virtuoso we use them or amex platinum program which lists a room upgrade if available upon check in the hotel did have the upgrade the first night but called a day later moved us into a junior suite really lovely each every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel make every effort to make guests feel special joseph is the guest relations manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome rory is the front office manager who we are still talking about wow does he love his job we watched him interacting with guests spending more time with us than he really needed to an affable manager who wants,1.0

we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite upon our arrival at reception we were offered two double rooms instead which was a very welcome surprise this amazing service continued throughout our stay we were just minutes walking distance away from the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka if you get a chance book a rooftop table at their sister hotel herodion just around the corner for a spectacular sunset dinner with view of the acropolis,1.0
our room was lovely comfortable and clean we could walk almost everywhere breakfast had many options and was delicious there is food and drink complimentary available a good portion of the day and the desk was knowledgeable and friendly very consumer friendly and well worth the few extra euros for all the convenience and comfort,1.0
we stayed in the sandymount for the sunday night of the longitude festival first impression really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything there was a really relaxed feel in the hotel people were just sitting around chilling in various locations there are chairs and sofas around every corner so nice the people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to beatrice she went above and beyond about mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share saving us both money i thought it was a lovely touch she was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before silly maybe but we both agreed that beatrice kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend the beer garden is really lovely while we did get to eat at the hotel other than late night pizza but i think you could honestly go to the sandymount and not leave the grounds at one point i thought we would just forget longitude and stay in the garden we were driving so with regards to public transport i am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is with the aviva stadium i assume they are but not least a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception,1.0
this renovated hotel seems a little far from the center of dublin but the dart dublin area rapid transit is a short walk away and the city center is easily reached as are the coastal towns to the south the rooms were very nice and they serve a good breakfast there is an elevator that goes to the ground floor for luggage and easier access,1.0

we had a great stay for nights at the hotel the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable we stayed there during the concert at they tailored special services for guests attending the show a special shout out to carlos fernando and roman for their great service,1.0
for a very competitively priced hotel right off street i can see why someone would be skeptical about the accommodations seeing is actually believing though as someone who stayed in even the base accommodations with my wife yes they were a little smaller than we were used to but we were very comfortable things were clean we had our room attended to properly the bed was the most comfortable and luxurious mattress we ever slept on but it was offensive and more than adequate aside from this and the slightly smaller room size it the only reason why i would rate the comfort level slightly less than stars otherwise if you have any reservations leave them at the door you will be out and about in dublin and will come back to a room that will serve your needs more than adequately in bustling dublin city,1.0
fantastic service amazing friendly and helpful staff fabulous rooms pool and spa will definitely go back we have expend very good time uin barcelona everything very clean close and well connected with all atractions in the city,1.0

room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,0.0
my husband and i spent our last four nights in barcelona at this excellent hotel we could not have been any happier with our beautiful room and the service provided by mayre and the rest of the hotel do staff we stayed at hotels all over the world and the level of service provided by the hotel do plaća reial exceeds almost all if one is a light sleeper or prefers peace and quiet it is imperative to have ear plugs and perhaps even headphones the first night i went to bed without using these and i was awake at scouting around the room to equip myself so that i could go back to sleep people party on the plaça reial all night long it is kind of strange that such a refined hotel would be on a plaza that is so much like the latin quarter in paris but there you have it so go equipped and you be okay once i used both ear plugs and my bose headphones and took a melatonin i was fine but it truly required all three of these things to be able to get said the hotel provides so many lovely touches such as complimentary tapas and wine really dinner the first night fresh fruit every afternoon delicious breakfast every morning nespresso in the room complimentary drinks in the refrigerator these really do compensate for the crazy plaća reial and the location could not be more convenient for getting around barcelona in,1.0
very well located hotel in athens the hotel is quite old and it shows rooms would definitely need a renovation the restaurant is great with wondeful acropolis views breakfast is great staff is very good the outdoor pool is very small so if you want to swim a bit you need to use the indoor pool overall good experience,1.0
the hotel riuis a beautiful hotel located very strategically to the heart of dublin we could walk anywhere we needed to go wonderful staff and good food our only issue although minor was they never repaired the towel warmer after numerous request,1.0
visited here based on reviews and very happy we not crash bang in the centre of the tourist hotspots but certainly very conveniently located to get anywhere really by metro a mere few stops and you at amsterdam centraal and the metro stop is literally a min walk from the front door thumbs up comfort room perfectly comfortable decorated in a minimalist brutalist kind of style unusual shower which you could look into from the bedroom fine for us as we are a couple but maybe take heed if you not atmosphere hip and friendly always greeted by friendly receptionists who would go to great lengths to help you out orienteering you around city printing tickets etc also appreciated being fast tracked through to front of queue for lift was a busy night in night club on roof and there was a queue for that food only tried the brekky at around if i recall correctly it was good value expansive selection of quality hot and cold items interestingly had one of the most tasty salads of recent memory from the breakfast bar value it was cheap as such but i think it was because we visited when there was a big music festival on so it must have been a busy time nonetheless think good value for money i would definitely return,1.0
if you are staying in dublin this is the hotel to select it is very clean the staff is friendly the location is central to most anything and in the evening when you go to sleep it is quiet this is truly a five star hotel,1.0

we just came back from barcelona where we stayed at el palace hotel i just want to say that it was one of the best hotels i ever stayed everything was amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous with a prime location our room was beautiful and always clean the housekeeping was doing a great job every day the stuff at the front desk and the guys at the door were just amazing always friendly and always helpful the guy who spoke russian was the one that we talked the most i regret so much that i forgot his name he was always caring and attentive and always went beyond his way to help us i would like to point out a special lady by name julie who made our stay unforgettable my husband was in touch with her before our arrival since it was our year anniversary we were given an upgrade to a better room and received a bottle of champaign with chocolates including a hand written note from her she took time to meet us in person later during our stay and it was a real pleasure there is absolutely nothing negative i can say about el palace if i am back to barcelona i would only stay there,1.0

stayed for nights for a mixed business and weekend break the hotel has a great feel and on first impressions at the front desk are very professional the rooms are of excellent quality you have everything you need my problem with the hotel is it falls down with very sloppy service we ordered room service on two occasions and it did arrive when you called to question the line was constantly busy breakfast was dysfunctional it took forever for the staff to take your order and when they did on two days running the wrong order was eventually delivered upon check out i was presented with a bill for euros very expensive i was asked if everything was ok i clearly said no and was promised a call back from the manager a week later i still waiting i posted a review on the ihg website where the hotel has an excellent score of out of my review was blocked do stay unless you want an expensive hotel with sloppy service,0.0

the location of the hotel is perfect las ramblas is about minutes away gothic quarter is about minutes away there are markets and restaurants right around the corner the staff is very friendly when we arrived they were outside waiting for us and helped us with our luggage check in was smooth and the front desk receptionist even came up with us to show us the room and how to work the ac the room is kind of small but good enough to satisfy our needs our room view is great we facing one of the side streets our room has a mini fridge but it does not have a microwave or a coffee maker there is a safe but it old school and it does not come with a key the front desk said they would hold our stuff if need be the room does not come with an iron but if you ask for one at the front desk they will provide you with one there is no ironing board i guess my only complaint is that the hotel is missing some of the amenities most star hotels include this hotel is nice but it should be advertised as a star hotel rather than a star,1.0
this hotel is in a great location to get to the main attractions around amsterdam the rooms are sufficient for your stay and the breakfast and terraced area are stairs are steep but the staff are more then happy to help you with your bags the staff were very friendly and always asking what they could do to thoroughly enjoyed our night stay and would return here again without hesitation,1.0
clean and spacious rooms friendly staff they put attention to little details and make you feel comfortable on your stay we even had questions regarding our flight tickets and irene assisted us and took time to made online research to help us and if you do not mind to walk a few minutes you can find main streets near to the hotel,1.0
amsterdam is a relatively expensive city for hotel accommodation especially during peak season when we visited recently volkshotel is certainly an unprepossessing building from the outside its monolithic concrete and glass exterior resembling something from the communist era but the contrast with the interior could be more stark this is a very cool colourful and characterful hotel offering very good quality accommodation for a reasonable price we chose the petite room but were pleasantly surprised by its size it was considerably more spacious than many hotel rooms in which we have stayed in similar cities in fact the hotel as a whole feels spacious and benefits from high ceilings and generous proportions the room was spotlessly clean the shower was perfect the bed comfortable and the view from the room was better than expected thanks to the very large window and pleasant aspect facing attractive period housing across the street but also with views to the adjacent busy main street we did try breakfast but the floor nightclub offers great views as does the top floor roof terrace next time i remember to bring my swimwear the only drawback is the fact that the hotel is not really centrally located but it a minute walk to many key sights and just four stops on the metro to the central station or about minutes walk the immediate area seems safe and perfectly fine and there are local eateries as an alternative to the city centre volkshotel is highly recommended for tourists,1.0
modern hotel near dublin airport very nice rooms and great breakfast with espresso coffee i had left my ipod behind and called to find that they had found it and secured it three days later when i returned to the airport to fly out they had their shuttle driver bring it to me at the drop up spot they were very helpful and went out of their way to help me with this,1.0
floor hotel with lifts our room was on the floor and huge very nice and comfortable the room was surrounded with windows on two sides with blackout curtains tv was inch samsung with satellite tv with english language channels including bbc sadly no itv or channel but plenty of music channels room had air conditioning which was very easy to had a large shower sink and toilet very nice towels but no complimentary toiletries here visited our room daily and made the bed cleaned up kettle and a few teabags coffee and creamer and sugar provided replenished the whole a hotel worthy of its stars although we had to dine in the restaurant of the sister hotel holiday inn for our evening meal reasonably priced dine for euros and we had steak ha ha were provided in the breakfast room on the floor alongside reception on initial entry to the building via the erratic revolving doors you will be in the main hotel with the reception for holiday inn only in front of you the reception for holiday inn express can be found by going through the doors to the immediate left of the foyer and taking one of the lifts to the floor where you wil find holiday inn express,1.0
the wonderful treatment started before we even arrived with welcoming emails from the arrival the staff could have helped us more with explainations of the area where to go and where to avoid also recommended restaurants was modern and really well had a really nice view from the window of the was on the smaller side but we had no complaints it was cramped just would stay here again in a heartbeat,1.0

i absolutely loved it it not a luxury place but atmosphere was just amazing normally i go for more fancy hotels but non of them had such a lovely stuff reception was super helpful kind and friendly they even did charge me for extra water i was ordering great location everything around the corner supermarket beauty salon tram beach very good night clubs also i would very recommend restaurant the president beds was are super comfy pillows i wish to take them home yes bathrooms needs to be fixed but still i did expect perfection for much better place you pay double money,1.0
my family had a lengthy stay at this hotel july it was my third time to stay here and the rest of my family second time the staff from front desk to housekeeping is extremely friendly and helpful the breakfast is great and open from to and if they know you be a little later they leave offerings out for you the rooms are clean and tidy and have most of what you need we missed having a box of kleenex tissue available in the room perhaps that a western thing and the bathrooms although clean and functional could use larger shower areas there a small refrigerator and a safe in the room and staff leaves a large bottle of water in it for you as needed it is a hotel but on our last there it was obvious someone was smoking on the floor i brought it to the attention of the front desk lots of shops and restaurants a stone throw away a large park churches art galleries and train to take you into athens overall good experience and would certainly use hotel des roses again,1.0
herodion is in a great location right below the acropolis the acropolis museum and the plaka it has a great view of the acropolis from some of the hotel rooms as well as the restaurant they have a great breakfast buffet that included in the hotel price but what made it great is the cleanliness and the great staff they really make you feel welcome we stayed here multiple times between july and august and definitely will return in the future,1.0

i really do understand the greediness of hotels trying to get as much money as they can from people why do they change prices daily and why are they allowed for price segmentation to different customers that supposed to be ilegal so this receptionist gives me a way higher price than internet and changes it radically every single day i wanted to book he took a loooong time very inefficient to deal with just one couple of customers and then to find a room for me and tell me his price craziness prices are way high for the horrible dirty place where this hotel is and what it offers specially the quality of human being that works there they do not care about people just about their cards and image pretending they are something better than the crap they offer specially in service and experience,0.0
we had a wonderful four nights at hotel estherea and i would highly recommend this hotel the cleaning staff kept the rooms wonderfully clean the concierge staff were all super helpful and could do enough to make sure the stay was excellent the coffee and afternoon snacks is a wonderful treat the morning breakfast was of great quality and enjoyable each day the rooms and common areas are all beautifully decorated a truly wonderful hotel,1.0
clean secure and central in dublin expensive for what it was a tiny room with single bed and shared bathroom worked out at on hostelworld for a midweek night should be cheaper as comparable prices around dublin can get you lots more for an extra or,0.0
this hotel cost us euros per night i would rather sleep on the street i do know where to staff friendly enough but they would have to be at rates like this the rest is dreadful room was foot above a very loud noisy night club youths congregated right below our room shouting smoking swearing and very loud music i had one hours sleep that all the room was hot so you had to open the window to cool down this let bugs into the room where i was bitten all hotel furniture is basically hand made rubbish gloss tv it must be years old inches square and foot off the ground with no remote so basically only one you are young and a very expensive place to rest your go to the more famous hotels there are plenty off them,0.0
casa camper barcelona is a lovely hotel it is centrally located the rooms are very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and ca do enough for you the breakfast is varied and you can help yourself to soft drinks and snacks at any time during the day on the roof terrace they have an honesty bar which works very well we only stayed three nights but would happily have stayed only criticism is that there are only two of these hotels the other being in berlin and there is definitely room for many more of them,1.0
my husband and i stayed here for our first nights on our honeymoon neither of us had ever been to europe before so we looked for something close to all the sights when we booked this negatives small tvloud at night due to multiple pubs right beside or across the streetthe positives great locationhelpful staff that made our first europe experience so easygreat pub attached to hotel cleandecently comfortable bedit was anything super fancy but it was exactly what we needed we would definitely recommend staying here and if we ever came back we would stay here again,1.0
one gets the feeling this hotel has existed on the same basis for quite some time the service is very good and the place generally traditional with traditional facilities for a five star hotel rooms and in particular the bathrooms are in need of a face lift and for the price paid one would expect better the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring central athens which can be done on foot the roof top restaurant has spectacular views of the acropolis and it was a pleasure to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant every morning breakfast was the only meal we had at the hotel and it was good albeit extremely crowded and therefore not remotely peaceful there is also a small rooftop pool which is lovely to visit after a day sightseeing if you are lucky enough to secure a sun lounger everyone has the same idea about a dip sundowners at this location are good and service exceptional the only additional factor to consider about this hotel is that it seems to have an arrangement with cruise ships for us tourists and we had a huge influx from one of these ships,1.0
my parents stayed there this may and it was wonderful the breakfast was excellent with fresh fruits smoothies and a variety of bread and cereals it is located near the trinity college and in the middle of temple bar district all in all a perfect stay for a city trip special thanks to orla meagher who helped with the booking and did a brilliant job,1.0
we loved this hotel we chose it partly because of the secure garage as we needed somewhere to park our van full of bikes which was great but it was perfect in every way very friendly and helpful staff with lots of suggestions for amsterdam newbies spacious and comfortable rooms a lovely breakfast and enough quirkiness and cool factor to satisfy our teenagers a great location too easy tram ride to the centre or rent bikes and ride through the lovely vondel park ca wait to go back,1.0
just like the title says this hotel is incredible i had one of the best and most painless holidays i ever had stepped off the plane and got straight on the train to the station closest to the hotel amsterdam zuid whole journey was about minutes to get to the station and minutes to walk to the hotel as soon as we arrived we checked in on their touch screen system in minutes and made our way up to the room whole process was so easy and so simple we found the room with little trouble and my god what a room it really felt like a modern hotel when the lights in the ceiling are controlled by an ipad and can even change colour my girlfriend and i definitely had fun with the ipad you can watch tons of free movies brand new releases too as well as watch tv from the news to comedy central the ipad lets you play music from different radio stations or airplay from your would fall asleep to a movie and the ipad had a feature that powered down the tv after a certain amount of time so we were disturbing our sleep the alarm was a gentle wake up the blinds opening slowly and the lights coming up really tied it all together ready to start the day we navigated to the closest tram stop minutes away and got the number tram straight to the centre cost us for a single tram,1.0

great well run hotel in a good location the hotel and rooms were very clean and comfortable the hotel was near the water and close to the tram station which takes you directly to syntagma square in central athens for just over euro it is a short walk to the glyfada shops and walking distance to some great beach clubs like the balux house project,1.0
this was the biggest mistake i have made on my trip to ireland please learn from my mistake this place must make money on the bar only it did not look like they put any money into the hotel itself the sour smell in the room was horrible the twin beds leaned to one side had to use a pillow to stop from rolling off the bed cramped small the bathroom was so small you had to turn sideways to get into the shower that did not have hot water the music and young kids started lining up at for a night of fun do worry but they were leaving but then again the staff would start putting the empty kegs on the street at sooo enjoy the hours of sleep food was not hot or tasty the dining room was a makeshift coat check at night made sure it still had a wonderful aroma in the morning for breakfast please note pay the extra few dollars and find a better only plus side walking distance to down town,0.0

after arriving from a stressful airport expierience we arrived at the hotel situated within a minutes walk from the rail station greeted by friendly helpful and competent staff who looked after our luggage until our room was ready we found our room s to be clean quirky and well organised with exceptionally comfortable beds and hardly any noise there was ample storage including a useful safe for valuables ac with a thermostat and free and fast wifi in the bathroom there was a large array of toiletries ranging from soaps shampoos gels and lotions which were replenished as required and a good sized shower which unfortunately became steamy after use an extractor fan would have been the many quirks of the hotel the jars of water in reception proved useful especially after a day out in the sun then at our rooms we enjoyed receiving the little notes from cleaning staff perched next to some jelly breakfast there was a wide ranging selection of hot and cold food and drinks with attentive floor we found the plunge pool and sunbathing beds which we enjoyed relaxing on after a hot we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at room mate anna and in barcelona and would highly recommend this hotel for its staff and quality of rooms,1.0
i had booked this hotel a few months before the visit once i arrived they told me there were no rooms for me as they accidentally overbooked now this is annoying but i know all hotels do it so i ca fault them for this they did give us free drinks and taxi us to another hotel relatively close by they had told me to get a receipt from the other hotel for breakfast so that they can refund me too this was all sounding great even gave me a card with a number to call in the morning so they could arrange a taxi to take our bags back over and put them in the room for morning comes around i get my receipt call the number on the card and i met with this number has not yet been assigned to an agent the staff at the illunion hotel were fantastic and helped get in touch with the sansi hotel only to find out that they had no record of me needing a room or for them to pick up my stuff after a bit of back and forth and the sansi staff calling a manager they realised they were supposed to give me a room and pick us up we dropped our bags off and headed out for the day the sansi hotel is in a great location minute walk to the docks upon returning to the hotel we checked in and i asked about the refund,0.0

disgusting smelly old rooms and floors and rude staff not worth the money at all you have to pay euros for wifi in the room for only hours a huge rip off no mini bar no extra locks on doors and when we asked the cleaning lady to clean our room she huffed and puffed and told us she did want to i think she might have hit her head and forgot that cleaning hotel rooms is her,0.0
just got back from a four day stay at marina i enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere found the staff to be friendly and helpful the room was very clean but a little small no tea or coffee facilities were available in the room as advertised with the breakfast was amazing so much variety the area is not very touristy more residential i travelled with my ten year old son and felt very safe and the locals where friendly lots of cafes and bars close by the roof top pool was very welcoming after a hot day sight seeing and the sky bar was lovely lit up of a niggtthe beach is a minute walk but it euro to hire a parasol and two loungers which is a rip off overall i would recommend this hotel it has a good vibe and was child friendly,1.0
this is a modern well run hotel the room was modern air conditioned and clean with a comfortable bed the wifi wrks well and the hotel is only a short walk from the harbour and las rambla the only downside is that it does not have a bar but i would certainly stay again,1.0
i booked this hotel not knowing anything about it we arrived to a warm welcome and received the same warmth throughout our stay the room was lovely and comfortable with everything you is easy to get to as the hotel is quite central but far enough away to be peaceful at are a lot of good quality around,1.0
we stayed here for nights and enjoyed the fact that it was walking distance from great shopping and eating and a short commute away by bus from sights like sagrada familia we avoided the ramblas as being too touristy and used casa camper to explore the bohemian raval area the fact that we could help ourselves to a healthy choice of drinks and snacks at any hour of the day was an added plus the room combination we had of a living room across the hall the bedrooms are thoughtfully placed at the quieter side of the street was really unique especially with the hammock however note that the shower area does not have a door neither do the wardrobes so you have to be fine with a very open concept,1.0

my family had several rooms here recently and for a night on our way to killarney the rooms we had included a double bed and a twin that worked well for my husband and i and our son the room was clean and the beds were comfortable as is the case in my places in ireland there is no ac so you need to keep your window open if it is a warmer evening when the windows are open you get a nice breeze we were on the floor and it is a quiet area so there was no problem with doing so next to the hotel is a large market with food fresh pastries drinks and other assorted good across the cobblestone way is jo burgers as well as a great breakfast place called sparks and the cobblestone a traditional irish pub is right across the street it was a perfect place to stay for the evening the one drawback is keeping the windows open on the lower floor where another family member stayed tends to be more difficult as there is some noise on the street also to put your car in the garage it is an additional euros a day and you have to pay every time you take the car out and return this is the reduced rate when you stay at the hotel the staff was so helpful and accommodating especially those working at the front desk and for the evening we stayed there it,1.0
the hotel is located right in the middle of temple bar but our room at least quiet the flip side is that our room was depressingly dark with a small window giving on a very small inner court more like a shaft staff was friendly but the whole hotel is very unpersonal,0.0
i was hesitant of this hotels location but was happily pleased only a minute free ferrry ride to the center of amsterdam and beautiful view of the canal made this a perfect location rooms are clean and comfortable staff was excellent and helpful many places to eat within a few minutes of walking and restaurant in hotel was good also breakfast was fantastic would stay here again,1.0

my friend and i just stayed at the roxford lodge hotel and enjoyed our stay but sadly there were a few issues that let it was from and we arrived after that but our room was not ready not a huge thing and we were offered a lovely cup of tea and choccy biscuits so that made up for room was lovely and the bed really comfy and we both had a good night sleep although though it a little strange to have a sauna in the room however the next morning was a bit of a let night before we were told that breakfast was until but in the morning we were then told it finished at it was am when we were told this there was a bit of a panic but it turned out it was after all so panic when we went in to breakfast the tables had not been cleared and there were no clean glasses for juice it just looked seemed as if there was only one lady covering the breakfast for everything so she was trying to clear the tables take the orders bring the orders and at times she did i afraid get a bit should have had some help selection was very good but the french toast was a bit bland so whilst the hotel is a lovely place to stay with pleasant happy staff there really do need to be more of them to justify the label of luxury accommodation,1.0
myself and my partner stayed for nights for my birthday on arrival the hotel looked amazing and the staff at the check in were so helpful showing us a map of the area and the best places to go we even got a room upgrade with it being my birthday which was a nice bonus the area is so beautiful and more authentic than the centre las ramblas min walk from the beach and about min walk from the harbour where you have all the bars clubs and restaurants you also have a street full of restaurants min walk from the hotel plenty of tapas and pool area is clean and modern when we were there they hosted a party around the pool with a resident dj which was brilliant we also used the spa facilities which has a jacuzzi steam room and sauna overall brilliant stay and would recommend,1.0

lovely hotel placed just off the merrion square on min walk from temple street there are few good pubs just nearby also airlink express stops are just around the is newly refurbished actually the work was still ongoing in the common areas during my stay lobby restaurant etc rooms look great with lots of art in it and pretty cool lightning super comfy bed bathroom looks great tho there are some things to improve no soap bowl no good place close to shower to hang the towel while showering but that can be fixed quite of food for breakfast was somewhat limited might be due to the fact that the kitchen was undergoing renovation as was welcoming and professional check went smoothly and quickly,1.0

we last stayed at buswell in december of and were curious to see if a change of season and level of tourism would make a difference it did the stay was a good as the first we like the kind of quirky charm of the building and rooms but this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel it is a period place that is modernized but not modern for people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms a picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation you can see that tbuswell is made up of several old buildings joined together and the rooms do line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay not every room is accessible at buswell the location really is ideal the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along kildare street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at stephen green everything in the city center is a few minute walk room was ready when we arrived at about pm and the manager very graciously bought,1.0

loved our stay in this hotel has a very star feel to it everything is clean and modern and there a doorman who welcomes you in and always hands you an umbrella if it raining as you leaving for the day we asked for a modern room as we knew the hotel was being renovated which we got the rooms are spacious with clean and large bathrooms the bed is probably the biggest and comfiest bed i ever slept it we traveled as a young couple but did feel out of place even though it was mostly business men who we bumped into during our stay breakfast was lovely and til so no worry to get out of bed early,1.0
the only downside to this wonderful hotel was location the surrounding buildings were full of spray paint graffiti but once you step inside that was easily forgotten and at no time did we feel unsafe despite the appearance of the area no vagrants parking is also at a minimum but a nearby parking garage is available with a discount public transportation was near view of the parthenon from the was beautiful,1.0
room was cozy and clean difficult to get to our room with the set up of this hotel had to take the elevator to the floor then go down a flight of stairs walk a hallway then climb up a flight of stairs positives were that the shower had great water pressure nice location and nice outside space the staff were very helpful they brought us a fan as the hotel does have air conditioning and helped book a tour,1.0

what a hotel excellent location being at the heart of temple bar next door to the hard rock cafe and a min walk from grafton street the manager was more than friendly and helpful in fact he could have been a better manager greeted with two complimentary cocktails which were amazing food was lovely rooms were perfect with everything you would need the hotel also has an amazingly cosy smoking area which seemed to be where a lot of people chilled out as it has heated sofas and it just lovely the hotel is super busy on a friday and saturday night as it is a popular place for drinks so the vibe is great also very close to many and food places i really ca fault this hotel could have asked for a better stay,1.0
my experience in this hotel is terrible my first night was above a noisy machine room and could sleep for most of the night i requested a quieter room the next morning and found out that i was put into a room next to another machine room i would not come back to this hotel again if i have choices based on the high chance that the room will be noisy,0.0
i stayed here for nights with my partner for his start with the positives there is actually only one location the hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of grafton st temple lane st etc price poor value for money our room was small for the price we paid and the bathroom is in need of maintenance our shower had been cracked and glued back together shower power was also lacking what was particularly frustrating though was that on both nights we stayed the hotel was hosting private functions a retirement party and a wedding which restricted the guests use of certain parts of the hotel courtyard etc no reduction in price was offered despite this the noise from the hotel is significant also we had a room facing onto the courtyard rude and inattentive we had a problem with our room key card it would open our door when asking reception for help rather than just fix the problem we were told very clearly it was our fault as we must have had the key card next to a bank card or mobile phone which then affected the magnetic strip the lack of courtesy of staff continued at breakfast despite the extortionate room rate breakfast was not included however at check in reception had authorised euros on our card to make it easy for us to pay for any costs we had while staying in the hotel service upon arriving at the breakfast we were told,0.0
if you want to stay in the heart of barcelona this is a perfect location close to sightseeing points and the city centre highly recommended for a short stay the bakery downstairs is busy but charming,1.0
i had a wonderful stay at the gibson hotel recently the room was superb and the staff were ever so helpful in particular i would like to mention clare who went out of her way to make sure i was happy with everything it will stand out in my memory as a great break the hotel is edgy and quirky and has that extra factor,1.0

i stayed at eliza lodge with two friends over a long weekend in june fabulous room with a view to the river we all had separate beds which was great temple bar is a busy party area which was great for us but perhaps less so if you have small children because of the noise which did not bother us take earplugs though you can walk everywhere there no breakfast included but that is fine because there are loads of cafés just next door rooms are basic but comfortable just what we needed,1.0
this really is a very comfortable small hotel beautifully clean with helpful and charming staff the location could be better for visiting the stunning acropolis museum for central athens it is an oasis of calm and surprisingly quiet considering it location the rooms are small but perfect and i loved having a very much recommend this hotel,1.0
hotel suizo was a lovely little hotel we stayed in a double room which was lovely and clean as was the bathroom too the space is fairly small as expected in a city hotel but the design and layout of the rooms does the best with the space we even had a balcony facing out onto one of the side streets which was lovely to watch the hustle and bustle below also the lovely smells that floated up from the patisserie and restaurants below was also very pleasant we did opt for breakfast with the room as we were wanted to try local places for breakfast the patisserie on the corner to the left as you exit the main entrance of the hotel is lovely for a quick coffee and croissant the croissant con crema is lovely but they are big and very filling the bathroom is small but the design and use of the space is again good the shower has two heads and is powerful the staff were pleasant and helpful also the metro is located just outside so you can jump on the underground with ease you right in the heart of the gothic quarter too the cathedral is just up one of the side streets there are loads of restaurants nearby too we did find the hotel to be noisy considering it location it a perfect hotel for people who are going to be out the majority of the time exploring but want somewhere comfortable and,1.0

i stayed at the room mate aitana for nights in july this year and it was perfect with the is located at the beautiful ij dock it in the heart of amsterdam but it gives you the solace and peace you need to wind down after a night about a minute walk to the centraal station and a max minute walk to everything else if you do feel like walking there is a bike rental across the street amsterdam is one of the most bike friendly places in the are nice places for breakfast if you wish to skip the hotel breakfast a couple of other cafes and a fresh food store as well just across the on to the property the rooms are airy and spacious a large window with plenty of sunlight coming in which is a huge plus point for me bathroom is well equipped and well must mention that the cleanliness is top notch now last but not the least the staff they were excellent from the reception desk to the housekeeping they were so warm and friendly they have a whatsapp number that you can text them on while you are out for any suggestions or directions i thought that was nice personal touch they added to the hotel a perfect hotel i would definitely stay here if i visit amsterdam again,1.0
after a rough wait for everything else went smoothly the room was nice and worked fine it is in a good location easy to walk to la rambla and a metro station the room was clean and inviting the breakfast is a bit expensive but wonderful,1.0
almost faultless chilled hotel right in the centre of the city which is perfect if you are looking for a long weekend break in the sun roof top terrace is excellent albeit needs more shade options and to stop the timers which retracts the awnings and is a lovely place to while away the day breakfast was also a little slow when you order from the menu and there are spots in the dining room which seem to be passed by by the staff on the whole though it a great hotel and we had a lovely stay,1.0
february stay for nights when we got to the hotel they charged us more for the room than what we had booked more which seemed quite a lot spoke to the manager and he blamed and said there was nothing they could do about it he said it happens all the time if this is happening all the time they really should have sorted this by now or at least expect customers to be annoyed when they charge you a lot more for your room when you booked a budget hotel could have paid the same money and stayed in temple bar hotel was or so minute walk from temple bar so good location rooms quite despite other reviews our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as i told them the rooms were nice their room was horrible only just enough room for a small double bed disgusting again when they complained they were told tough there no more rooms i rant up from the uk and spoke to reception about booking another room for the dates they were staying and was told there was lots available etc and what would i like to book told them the situation and the tone of the conversation immediately changed back to the hotel being really busy and no rooms available after they had just told me the hotel was dead would not stay here again as there are far better hotel in the,0.0
we had a wonderful night stay in this hotel the staff was amazing and friendly the grounds room and hotel were absolutely beautiful and comfortable they were so accommodating as we were a large party who needed assistance with a private dinner golf clubs and the like i heard the shower turn on in the middle of the night during my stay it was much louder and longer than a slow drip i sleep through everything so it was very out of the ordinary i researched to find other guests who had similar experiences for anyone looking to experience an encounter we stayed in,1.0

we stayed nights in the upper floor suite it is a very spacious apartment with a seating area facing lykabettus hill bedroom is comfortable very bright and has glass on both sides there are also a large terrace and even additional balcony from bedroom which we did not use due to some chilly weather in april but we enjoyed our inside seating area with a view while having afternoon tea with sweets from local bakeries long corridor leads to a spacious bathroom honestly i think that the design is too unnecessary fancy and i did not figure out how to use it except as a shower it was slightly uncomfortable for me to get it and out because of very high bath tub and narrow glass door access nevertheless shower head was wonderful and water pressure was excellent needless to say all was very personal is young friendly and helpful breakfast buffet was good wifi worked well we were not disturbed by street noise to notice it or to comment about it we found hotel location as totally safe walk to metro station was easy and short and one time we walked down to monastiraki without transportation archaeological museum is really close to the hotel and it turned a bonus for us as we went to this museum twice during our short stay archaeological museum collection is so marvelous and rich and grand that one visit is not enough,1.0
we stayed at the renaissance as part of our post trip extension to a viking cruise the staff was very courteous and extremely helpful the rooms were very nice and however our room was at the front of the hotel on the second floor and we could hear everything happening in the street below us all night long horns blowing people talking etc the location is very convenient for but ask for a room in the back of the hotel the scenery outside your window might not be the best but at least you will get some sleep at night,1.0

my mum and i visited amsterdam late june and this hotel was perfect for us the hotel is in an old amsterdam style canal house tall and narrow we were on the top floor and we were warned about the steep stairs so we did mind it but if you do have health problems i would recommend a room above the ground floor the view from our room was lovely we could see out over the canal the bed was comfy shower lovely and the décor was fabulously odd and quirky the location was great a short walk from everything it seemed i did overly like the breakfast but then i am not a fan of continental breakfasts personally my mum enjoyed it the staff were very nice as well,1.0
had a great stay at the sofitel the grand in amsterdam it well located a stone throw from dam square that is the heart of the city not far away from the central train station amsterdam central but if you carrying a mid size piece of luggage it advisable to take the tram or bus the service is impeccable and the breakfast is the best i ever had this hotel is highly recommended,1.0

fully weeks before our visit we made a one letter typo on our nights rooms reservation necessitating cancellation of our reservation what did banks mansion do about this tiny error charged our credit card the full up front anyway as opposed to reasonable cancellation policy we offered not until after we left the city did they even inform us that they were able to finally resell nights of the on a busy summer weekend yet did even refund us fully for those they so if you like nights for a hotel you ca use enjoy and like management that does little to remedy any issue you may have then this is your place for terrible customer treatment be wary,0.0
we only had hours in barcelona and the aparthotel silver provided an inexpensive and excellent property in a very nice part of town the room was small but comfy the bathroom and especially the shower was very very small the premises were neat and clean the staff were very friendly the parking was bright and secure the aparthotel is down a little street that easy to miss in the gracia area,1.0
we stayed here backfire nights in may and after reading all the reviews we knew what to expect and the hotel did deliver the combination of hotel staff and location make this luxury hotel the best choice dining here was also great ca wait to go back in october,1.0
this hotel is in a category that is hard to find these days you are greeted by white gloved and top hatted bellmen and reception at check in makes sure they accompany you personally to your room the hotel is understated on the outside and this adds to its charm and it is exceptionally classy on the inside blending contemporary and antique decor and furnishings however the art collection is a site to see in itself as there is a special self guided tour you can take with the brochure they have explaining each piece of art while we had a standard room the bed was exceptionally comfortable one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in and the marble bathroom toiletries were top notch the highlight of our stay here was the gourmet dinner at the hotel world famous patrick guillard restaurant,1.0
overall we were pleased with our stay the room was comfortable and taxis line up at the street corner making it very convenient to get anywhere in the city we paid for our room with points but were also charged the full rate upon checkout despite showing my points receipt however we were refunded after making a phone call and some emails with hilton honors,1.0

blooms hotel excellent location possibly is the main reason i rate the hotel as good coz it within minutes walk to airport bus stops sightseeing tour bus stop visitor centre temple bar area minutes walk to bridge and shopping street within mins walk to christ church cathedral st patrick cathedral within mins walk to guinness jameson and other shopping area totally no hassle for the location staffs were friendly helpful and fast every time we needed to call taxi welcome free guinness at vat pub was nice and we even ordered oyster mussels chicken wings which were expensive at all room is a bit old dusty and could be a bit noisy from the street at night sometimes but consider hotels are generally expensive in dublin blooms hotel would be the one which does smash your credit card and still offers excellent location decent pub restaurant with okay room,1.0
just came back from a days stay at this hotel with my husband and year old it was everything we were looking for and subway was less then min walk la rambla also rooms were clean and the daily service was excellent everyone at the front desk especially marc were not only very nice but very helpful with any questions we had only thing missing was a mini fridge but beside that we would definitely go back again,1.0
arrived at the hotel only to find out i had lost my passport on the way the receptionist was very good to me and gave me directions to the local police station to get a statement so that i would be able to fly back home at the end of my stay the room was lovely and clean and the bathroom was amazingly big room on my last day i arrived at the airport and they would not accept the police report so missed my flight was very distressed and decided to go back to the hotel they were very kind to me and managed to book me in to another room gave me the address for the british consulate and was very helpful i would like to say thank you to all the staff and i hoping to come back in september but will hold on tight to my passport next time,1.0
i was with family but it perfect for couples and safe free and fast perfect great atmosphere extremely helpful good buffet breakfast for extra charge cons no ventilation in the the rooms was very dark lighting would solve almost zero noise insulation between rooms seems like part of the room wall is made of a very thin material a bit noisy during the night,1.0
we stayed four nights at fresh hotel and loved the location which was close enough to everything but out of the heart of the tourist zone which we loved we felt totally safe on the streets even late at night because everything happens after in athens the breakfast was excellent with a huge selection including fresh squeezed orange juice we enjoyed the rooftop deck and ate at the restaurant for sunset one night and had cocktails and snacks several times in the lounge area where the food and drinks were fine but not memorable service was slow our room was very simple leaning towards basic rather than starck minimalist thank you to the reception staff who contacted me several days after we had left to let me know that we may have left something in the room i was able to claim it and pick it up before we left greece and had even realized that i had lost it we would definitely stay here again,1.0
i have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was managed by a different company and enjoyed many happy and successful stays over the years i had been to dublin for a couple of years so had some reservations about what i might find on my return now that intercontinental have taken it over what i found was it still a great property with some of the original staff still working there some aesthetic changes decor and updates like improved wifi and still relatively generously proportioned room sizes the location works really well for me as it close to the city centre but still far enough away to enjoy the beautiful scenery in that neighborhood there are some small issues to work on and improve but the staff that i worked with were very friendly pleasant and efficient and they took my feedback and acted on it so i and my group left as very happy customers who are likely to return there a great running circuit that takes you along the beach of dublin bay and through the local neighborhood with its diverse and impressive properties so if you enjoy a run this is a great hotel for you there are nice shops bars and restaurants nearby so i really like staying here i did eat in the restaurant but i heard good reports from my colleagues and the staff always went the extra mile so i have no hesitation in recommending this hotel great work team,1.0
the room was clean very functional the service was excellent the staff wad vey accommodating the location was very good close to all the services sightseeing we wanted to see during our days trip,1.0
i was looking for a hotel close to the plaza espanya and pestana did not dissapoint we were a group of and our rooms were very clean modern with minibar safe deposit box comfy beds and pillows the front desk attendants were very nice and professional with suggestions and tips the breakfast buffet is very good and complete with juices fruits cheeses cold cuts breads eggs plus we had dinner one night at the restaurant and it was very good too the location is blocks to plaza espanya arenas shopping center metro and train station we liked the hotel so much that i be looking to book pestana in our next trip to barcelona o any other city they have a hotel,1.0
great hotel its located in the middle of the high end shopping distriict which is not my thing however there are some advantages you away from the hustle and bustle of things but yet a short walk from some gaudi building and nightlife staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel is well built highlight is rooftop which can get crowded quickly due to small size as well as an off the chain breakfast buffet would highly recommend,1.0
this is the worst hotel i stayed at and i stay in many hotels throughout the year the sirens of ambulances all night long were one night a drunken man screamed below our window and the sound of loud traffic was not a pleasant sound to listen to while trying to sleep the room was claustrophobic and nothing like a room as seen on their breakfast offered at the hotel was pretty meager for a stayed in a hotel that was a lot better than this never understood why i was charged for the breakfast and for the rental bike i rented in all hotels i stay at they always render one bill at the end of the hotel staff was friendly,0.0
the hotel is extremely professionally run and modern staff are very attentive and we loved the fact it not a chain or a huge hotel the pool is on the rooftop and quite large in comparison to other barcelona hotels we thoroughly enjoyed our time here the only down side would be it a tiny bit further out this may not be ideal for those who like to be central,1.0
we stayed here for days in july staff was friendly room was clean this hotel is near to city attraction this is easily accessible from metro as well as airport aero bus we really enjoyed our stay,1.0
first time staying in a wyndham have a generally good stay as expected from its reputation and was particularly impressed by the breakfast choices however had trouble with the front desk almost every time i tried to just get a quick information never got greeted nor the staff initiated or asked just kept doing their own thing although i did get the info when asked after waiting for what seemed to be a long while the location is good some very good or restaurants in the walking distance and subway station right across the roundabout on the other side,1.0

arrived to find that executive rooms which were booked were unavailable but were offered two double rooms at a discount and included breakfast in the deal one of rooms was unavailable for at least half an hour but this did not prove to be a problem an hour in the bar with the amount of time spent in the rooms it was a win win deal would highly recommend this hotel,1.0
excellent hotel and would thoroughly recommend clean spacious room with lovely bathroom and separate and drink very good although we ate out more in the city very few restaurants close to the sky bar which we used every evening on our spa area and swimming pool,1.0
as a very seasoned global traveler i would highly recommend the ac hotel barcelona forum marriott hotel because of the excellent service attentive staff perfect location and comfortable traveled to barcelona for business and found an absolute jewel in the ac hotel barcelona forum the location was exceptionally convenient we had a professional conference at the convention center which is next to the ac hotel barcelona easy walking distance to the metro the metro underground subway is very easy to navigate very clean air conditioned and staff are available to assist if you need help passengers are also a great source for help the people of barcelona are so helpful buy a multiday pass at the barcelona airport or at the metro rooms are clean clean clean the hotel staff are friendly and incredibly efficient we appreciate the staff for their pride in keeping the rooms at the end of a long or hot day take a quick dip in the pool there are poolside loungers tables and more tables inside the restaurant the hotel can provide pool towels and the staff are very attentive enjoy a drink poolside the view is absolutely beautiful across the street is the diagonal mall lots of shopping food choices and good restaurants asian italian spanish we enjoyed an evening of tapas and paella which were very tasty and reasonably priced a grocery story is located inside the diagonal mall get some bread wine cheese a bit of prosciutto and fruit for your hotel,1.0
well located hotel close to the museums area and numerous restaurants bars and shops are just a short walk away friendly helpful staff and the rooms were comfortable and clean you probably need to take some form of transport to get there if arriving by train but the tram stops are nearby,1.0

we stayed at the sir adam during our trip to amsterdam the staff there is so friendly and helpful everyone treated us like they really cared about us having a great experience as a previous reviewer mentioned our cab driver also could not find the hotel and in retrospect we would have just taken the train from the airport and then the ferry right across the river to the hotel i highly recommend this hotel for the fun and funky atmosphere and the excellent staff the rooms are small but the views are excellent,1.0

not only did the hotel wow us with their amenities and comfortable accommodations but they really saved me i tell you how they went above and beyond what any hotel would do anywhere in the world i left my including my license work badge and debit card in a restaurant on our last night in amsterdam we were leaving the next morning before the restaurant opened at in the morning niels packaged up instructions for the morning staff to call the restaurant retrieve my belongings and then ship it back to our home they did all of it within hours or so and i safely received my package days later i will always stay at hotel estherea when i am in amsterdam customer for life,1.0

this is a fantastic hotel it has an incomparable view of athens please see our pictures from the breakfast buffet the facility is top notch the rooms are spacious the facility is modern the pool breathtaking and the staff is first class my only complaint is that is sits on the largest hill in athens and it is a long way from most of the tourist sites it was not that big a deal to us but if you decide to walk to any major attraction i recommend taking a cab back to the hotel it is a long walk,1.0
my flight had an layover in dublin so i searched for an inexpensive place to stay near the airport i arrived at the airport around and had to take a cab to the hotel that cost nearly remember that detail upon arrival the check in process was smooth and the staff was somewhat friendly i asked about the airport shuttle they advertised and was shown the timetable for the shuttle that limited its use to a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the early evening on the way up to my room i noticed the place was either new or recently renovated either way it was nice the room was hot due to unseasonably warm weather in the area the entire exterior wall was made up of windows and a glass balcony door but only one window opened a few inches and the door was locked there was no other source of ventilation so i accepted the mildly uncomfortable room on the balcony was a large seagull sitting very still the bird was so still that i assumed she was sitting on an egg or a hatchling it was until i noticed a couple of flies that i realized it was in fact dead the bathroom was very nice with a huge bathtub and very modern fixtures the television was slightly larger than a postage stamp but there were quite a few channels to watch thinking that this part of ireland was still part of the,1.0
we stayed here during part of two week trip through ireland london and scotland first of all the location was terrible even though the tram is right outside the hotel you are as far away from the attractions as you can get also the entire area is under construction and felt very unsafe the room was also a let down it was small outdated and the curtains were not even attached to the rod so we were not able to close them we were put in a room with two twin beds and our daughter had to sleep on a bed all were extremely uncomfortable not that we were sleeping anyway but it was extremely loud on our second night the hotel hosted some sort of party that kept us and several other guests up until after when we called to complain we were told they would shut the doors but that never basically stayed out exploring as long as possible to not have to return to our room although we did not like our hotel we did love the people of dublin,0.0
my wife and i stayed here as part of a group tour with gate travel this property is located near the plaka district and very convenient to the parliament building and other areas of downtown the rooms were very nice and somewhat large there is a roof top restaurant where your included breakfast is served with views of the acropolis and the temple of zeus which were amazing the breakfast was extensive and very good they also serve dinner and drinks in the is a very nice pool area and bar where you can get lunch or snacks the staff were very personable and accommodating i would recommend staying at this hotel to family and friends,1.0

location great proximity to the station as advertised we used the shuttle multiple times to commute to the hotel and to the city it was easy but about a minute ride just as others said staff very nice upon check in we received an upgrade to business class bar staff exceeded our expectations room our room was spacious and the ac worked nicely especially compared to other european hotels we received one free water in our room upon check in iron blow drier and mini bar i have two complaints with the room though there were hairs that were not mine on both the coffee mugs which made me question the cleanliness of our room the bathroom seemed clean though also the pillows and bed were not to my liking i guess you have that from time to time so i did dock them for that hotel nice property with updated decor hotel is surrounded by some businesses but not too much else around gym the gym was amazing in my opinion one of the best gyms that i have seen when traveling they have just about anything you could want there spin bikes punching bag yoga classes etc they also have a sauna which was nice and appeared to be clean other items you can rent bikes on site if you want to go into the city after check in i recommend asking for another shuttle voucher take the shuttle back to the train station and then take the,1.0

in parts the hotel looks tired but i have to say we quite like it and it is clean as a base in the museum district it is ideal and you do need to use public transport as just about anywhere in town is a walk some longer than others room which is a standard twin on the third floor with a rear view is i suppose bijou the two beds probably cover of the floor space other furniture includes a wardrobe two bedroom cabinets and a desk with chair with shelf beds themselves are extremly comfortable and the only issue we have is the squeeze to get into the one nearest the window however you are not doing it all the time so why corner bathroom contains one of those modern round basins that is difficult to wash your face in but the shower is has to date been lovely and clean and the towels feel nice and is good with a nice variety of rolls with all the usual continental breakfast for the staff well they are probably the highlight of the hotel they could not be nicer and it has been a pleasure to interact with them from getting cups of ice from behind the bar to getting extra pillows to just getting good responses to the random questions we have asked them we have yet to encounter a can really recommend the hotel if you want a decent stay in amsterdam,1.0
visited for my birthday requested early had to wait kids running about jumping in the pool charged me room tax twice staff are useless breakfast is awful went back to room day there was a man in our room most of the gym equipment did work,0.0
days before we reached the hotel we were emailed by them to let them know about things that we might specially need in our room we stayed nights the rooms are updated but tiny we walked into the hotel and were pleasantly happy to see a hotel look and feel they have a bustling restaurant izikaya on the ground floor we were taken to the study where we were checked in by maureen an extremely professional and friendly person we were started off on some prosecco the room felt fresh and well serviced during those four days i also had my birthday the hotel left a beautiful card and balloons on the bed for me i was rather hot in the duvet on requesting them for an alternative they did have any thinner duvets but they did leave some sheets for us responsive hotel happy staff and charming environ the red light area shares the same block i had a walk towards that side too walkable to all city center attractions i think i was all in all happy we were driving but did park the car with them it was mostly on the street the hotel breakfast buffet is popular but we could really try it may be another time i hope the next time around they have winter and summer bed linen it is quite difficult sleeping in a inch thick duvet in summers thank you guys,1.0
i been visiting amsterdam regularly for over years and have always stayed along the nz voorburgwal in various hotels after a disastrous experience at my last place i was searching for a new hotel for this summer and was intrigued by the design amenities and location of ink what a perfect choice the room was spacious and pleasant with high ceilings stained glass windows and great city art on the walls staff accommodating and welcoming the hotel pressroom was a great place to have a glass of wine and a nibble before heading out for the evening the little disappointing quirks no iron or hair dryer in the room poorly maintained fitness equipment in the tiny gym were more than outweighed by the overall experience i think i found my forever hotel and look forward to staying there again next summer i will even request the same room,1.0
the marker is truly a great place to stay in dublin i will definitely be back next year the location is fabulous and the staff was even better i did not have a chance to visit the rooftop bar but i will make it a priority next time i would like to see the roof top bar open later on sundays,1.0

i recently stayed at barcelonaa fira travelodge i found the staff to be friendly helpful professional and caring the hotel room was spotlessly clean great showers and good location and value for money in particular i would like thank frank daniel for making my stay welcoming pleasant and friendly highly recommended,1.0
let start with the positives friendly helpful staff great welcome cloud pool good food lovely place to chill out in the evening and barman chris was fabulous pool good toolocation mins from alimos marina so handy if you hiring a yachtthe tv worksso the negatives we booked a family room and got two rooms not interconnecting ok for us as we have teens but not great for younger rooms were functional at best decor dated patched up in places and they reeked of cigarette smoke shower woefully inadequate fell out of its holder several times bulbs missing it on a very noisy main road despite double glazed doors and seemingly some rooms have thick blackout curtains and others not breakfast basic meat cheese bread yoghurt etc all ok but overcooked cooked breakfast fried eggs like booked through ba and the reviews were ok but seriously this is a very basic hotel we were here less than hours and that was hours too many,0.0
my visit to hotel alma was very enjoyable everything thing was just perfect the decoration the servis the location my waitress sonia was very helpful frendly and the servis was excellent i definitely recommend this hotel see you soon,1.0
decent sized room very clean comfortable large bed had a room on the side of the hotel which was quiet had to wait a while to check in with no acknowledgement that we were waiting classy bar with outside seating area ate in enoteca interesting menu plus pizzas unfortunately they had run out of pizza dough one night waiting staff are lovely drinks are pricey but no more than other large hotels nice to sit on the front terrace and watch the world go by right near the tram stop so great access to all the sites you can buy tram tickets at the hotel we stayed in hotels recently with frosted glass doors into the bathroom that have gap round them bad idea turn the bathroom light on at night and is very bright into the bedroom poor trend that hotels should stop otherwise good bathroom decent free internet,1.0
unless you like the hustle and bustle of the canal quarter and the impossibly small rooms near the red light district areas i stayed in my early twenties in amsterdam as a novice traveler then you stay close near central station and tolerate the of the potheads and party revelers all night long fast forward years on a seasoned and more discerning traveler in my thirties has preferred to be away from the smoke so to speak literally and it was such a delight to discover this quiet hotel just off the main drag trams and from central have stops on both sides of the hotel and literally up the road are bars and restaurants the hotel itself has small if adequate en suite rooms but you do see a canal when you peer out of your window i was placed in a canal room which i did book but eventually got thankful for so i had no reason to complain though the lifts were apparently not working various points of my stay luckily they were working every time i was in and did experience the inconvenience of climbing up those narrow steep stairs to the floor carrying luggages if i did staff were obliging enough to do it for you according to the other guests breakfast selection in this hotel is superb and the courtyard dining was just divine especially with the presence of least house cats which gave you that homely feel and sense of tranquility to balance,1.0
just spent nights here and staff very friendly and very helpful check in smooth quick and bags held securely until room was ready and also for the full day on departure clean room and bathroom and clean towels both days perfect location for exploring all dublin after reading some reviews was worried the location was not in a great area but to be honest found all parts of dublin city very run down and hotel location no worse than main tourist a lot of investment in parts of the city road improvements and building work but sad for the city along both sides of the liffey as every other property run down shabby and lots of buildings closed and warmth friendliness and craic of dubliners makes up for everything fabulous people the green hop on and hop of bus tour is absolutely brilliant and true dubliners driving and telling the history and and present about the city well worth doing the city for shopping and amazing recommend a meal at across from the brazen head oldest pub in the city,1.0
shared a family room with my wife and beds were fine plenty of outlets and decent sized bathroom room was warm but the entire hotel was due to the weather being warm was able to get a fan which helped,1.0
hotel staff were welcoming and enthusiastic room was as expected albeit roasting which would not have been a problem had we noticed the aircon unit slung on the wall but no we had better things to think about no problems anything here good location quiet but only a few minutes from the action on foot would be more than happy to stay here again,1.0
after much thought my daughter and i decided to meet in athens greece for our first european vacation my daughter lives in south korea and i live in new jersey we thought it would be the perfect vacation we planned it for months and decided after much investigation to stay in the melia in athens greece our flight transfers and all of our plans went perfectly except for our choice of hotel there were many issues with this hotel the internet did not work well the room was not very clean the shower was moldy the blow dryer did work and when it was replaced we could use it in the bathroom we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it but that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced an electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet that what the management at the hotel said this worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open he said he had to check something n the basement this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by for more than five minutes i happened to return to the room to find that situation when i went to the management at the hotel they tried to tell me that the room was unattended when clearly it was the man who left,0.0
myself and my husband stayed here lastnight and it was honestly the worst hotel we ever stayed in and we have stayed in many hotels over the time i never usually do reviews but feel the need to save someone else their money it mentions there is a nightclub but they do not give away the extent of the noise disturbances caused our room was literally vibrating it felt like we trying to sleep on the dancefloor i complained to the guy on reception and he could have cared less i got the impression from the staff that they are just there to do the transaction no attentiveness or presence about them at all i all for casual hotels but when they lose sight of customer satisfaction then it just leaves you angry that you spent your money there instead of a nicer hotel that actually cares about your experience for us it was a night away from our baby and crappy nights sleeps at home but instead we got an even crappier nights sleep they should at least offer cheaper rates for the lower floor levels that are most affected anyway to cut a long story short go somewhere else,0.0
recommend this hotel if you are using the rail system as it is right opposite the station the rooms and hotel are wonderful and the staff are very obliging drinks in the lounge area were reasonable and all in all a great stay,1.0
the best feature of this hotel is the location i booked a room for one night using air miles the description on the aeroplan website promised spacious rooms decorated in characteristic irish decor i arrived at and had to wait for a room i was promised one in an hour or minutes but no one called and three hours later i returned at that time i was given a tiny room that faced a busy street and a building covered in pipes i complained and was shown another room that had a view of trinity college much better but also was tiny the decor was more la designer than irish with an upholstered black faux leather headboard with metal studs not what i was expecting the curtains were thin and did not entirely cover the sides of the windows which meant that the room was not dark the street noise was not bad but there was sound transfer from other guest rooms i did not sleep well in this hotel compared with the other hotel i stayed at on staff were friendly enough but when i arrived no one was at the door and i had to pull my luggage up a ramp myself i noticed that the main entrance was often unattended and when i returned to my room in the evening four young men followed me into the elevator when i asked them what floor they were going to they just laughed none of them had room keys,0.0
so many reviewers extolled the location of the arlington hotel in dublin that i be remiss to go on except wow it really was so easy to walk and grab the streetcar a block away that said the room was not the most luxurious i ever seen and i was glad for that it was clean quiet and comfortable maid service was good bathroom was quite spacious and nice and the front desk folks were courteous if it a busy place but if value and location are tops and you do want squick i would think twice about recommending this hotel and the irish facility was fun do check out govinda vegan restaurant a block away,1.0
very clean and staff polite our room was a good size and equipped little gym and lovely pool and surrounding of all great location which is very important for us whilst visiting amsterdam one down side useless iron and ironing board the rest of the hotel gets a thumbs up would recommend and would return,1.0
this hotel is great from selecting your own room to the check out breakfast was amazing with great service rooms were clean and beds where comfortable very easy to get any where from this location especially the train station,1.0
the hotel is big efficient and good family room was big location is ok but it only a short taxi from the centre and there is a shuttle bus back and forth but why in this day and age would you not give free wifi it feels a little churlish for a star hotel to try and make a few euros on this the best hotels do,1.0
when we arrived at this impressive hotel we were thrilled when given an upgrade to a suite sadly the aircon did perform very well so our room was constantly very hot we notified staff and although they initially came to check obviously there was a fault breakfast which we had included was magic served in the winter garden room we loved our start to the day and enjoyed the luxury our suite was massive so enjoyed the space great location as the downside we were evacuated late one night with warnings to leave immediately and do not use the lifts already in bed threw some clothes over the top and only took long enough to grab passports many guests some quite panicky raced down the fire escape to the street where you would expect to see a staff member to direct us no no one was there we all gathered waiting for instructions eventually we decided to go to the front of the hotel to seek help the hotel seemed to be fine with other guests inside unaware obviously the wing we were staying in was the only area i queried staff as to when they were going to let us know we were safe to return to our rooms they informed us it was no big deal and all was not good hotels should have an obligation to their guests and their safety,1.0
the extra touches like the cookies and wine were enjoyed by all early check in was much appreciated after an overnight flight from canada location was superb and the ability to have in a room was great would recommend your hotel and would stay there again if we are in barcelona,1.0
amazing world class hotel excellent location and great service great attention to detail immaculately clean with well appointed and well designed suites wish i could stay longer the staff are very helpful one of the best hotels i have stayed in you have to come here to see it,1.0
hotel sebastian is a very clean comfortable hotel in the heart of the canal district we were able to walk to all our destinations very easily from the hotel and even just wandering up and down the canal streets was a delightful way to spend time the staff in both reception and the were friendly and extremely helpful we felt very valued and comfortable the bed was comfortable bathroom very beautiful and modern and the room size though we got a small room was spacious by european standards we had a canal view and our companions did not their room was much quieter at night when they slept with the window canal view also means view we did mind the sounds of the people walking and if you are senstitive to noise do choose a canal view room or do choose one but do plan to sleep with the window open they have if you prefer,1.0
we have visiting barcelona with two small kids in august and stayed at vila olimpica in the overall hotel is nice spacious lobby small but cosy pool area modern and large rooms kitchen in the rooms comes with extra charge and you are not able to have it if you stay under hotel is built in but it is already needs some small fixing very friendly and helpful stuff as it is normal in spain prepare to wait a bit for everything not much variety in food at breakfast not really worth the price the restaurant is a bit overpriced for just an ordinary food location is not the best one but ok the best area around the hotel is not so nice metro station is close trip ticket costs and there is a long street with lots of restaurants and some shops just in minutes walk the beach is also in accessible distance by walking taxis are quite cheap so if you are not able to walk it is easy to get around by taxi trip to sagrada familia to park guell to the airport spa was for those who is travelling with kids be aware that you are able to use spa only in the would definitely recommend this hotel to others,1.0
i was here for nights and i paid nearly euros a night at first i was given a room which was on opposite side of the street it was very small and it had no window so i asked them to change it then i got a room that has a balcony to the street but the ac was not working fine and it was hot i asked them to have a look at it the second day and they fixed it i was happy with the service it was a best western class so i was not expecting something extra i heard the street was a place for prostitutes before and the polis cleaned it up however locals told me to be sharp when i was going back to the hotel at night i could see weird and junky people when i walked to a museum close to this hotel but nothing bad happened,1.0
the rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building i had to change rooms and i had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total the price is just too high for what you actually get considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc is limited and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block the trains that pass connolly station shake the whole building every ten minutes the walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by as well as what your neighbours are up to go figure the carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh the most positive thing i can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented when i told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue but for the price paid i would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast,0.0
speedy and helpful check iin underground parking facility ease of getting into the centre of amsterdam by tram i was woken up several times by other room doors sized room and bathroom,1.0
i have been staying at the fairmont hotel in barcelona for quite a long time now as i work close by quite often the hotel has been going through some well needed refurbishment and is now a excellent place to stay the beds in the refurbished section are super comfortable and the rooms are very tasteful breakfast choice is first class and most importantly the service is top rate as a frequent traveller sometimes you may have the occasional challenge special need or need to visit a doctor and the team at fairmont led by cesar alcobendas always go out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of to this day cesar and the team watch out for when your arriving and do a super job in making us feel welcome it is my first choice to stay at the fairmont when visiting the wonderful catalan city of barcelona thanks cesar p,1.0
possibly one of my favourite hotels to date i could compare this to a boutique hotel only for the staff and knowledge of the concierge are second to none breakfast although for some was inadequate was for us perfect not over love the al a carte aspect of this and could not yes it but what you get for your money is justified in the area if you are willing to pay for a star hotel then expect nothing less than the service and facilities you receive for relatively new hotel the experience is seamless and well worth its star the rooms are beautiful the linen immaculate and cleanliness superb if you like the finer things in life please stay here location is fantastic and staff are helpful to say the least,1.0
the hotel s located right on the cathedral plaza and the plaza teems with activity so if your room faces the plaza and you a light sleeper you may want to consider earplugs seriously but that a minor annoyance and likely a for most people the liveliness and activity are fabulous besides the proximity to the cathedral you within a short walk to placa catalunya the picasso museum la rambla santa catarina market etc the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff is very nice and thanks to david it a ca miss,1.0
room quite small but a number of perks complimentary decanters of whisky vodka and brandy in the room breakfast freshly cooked with a good selection of hot and cold a nice treat after complimentary drinks and nibbles staff very welcoming,1.0
very beautiful hotel n a great location to all the major sites and metro station rooms were updated staff was very friendly with great restaurant recommendations and breakfast area was beautiful with a great selection including ready to make omelets would definitely recommend,1.0
this was a really great location it is only a block away from the airlink dropoff and pick up point and perfect for taking the public transportation we had the top floor quad room and were really surprised that we got free bottled waters sparkling and non and a whole bunch of flavored walker shortbread cookies i did not know that they even came in other flavors kitkats and some killer hot chocolate sean at the front desk was super nice and showed me where the sites are on the map and was patient with me when i realized i did need the breakfast on all of the days of our stay the breakfast was really good though i was able to sleep very well as we were far enough away from the madness of temple bar the bells of christchurch were really awesome too my only gripe is no ac so we opened the windows,1.0
hotel in a good position close to omonia station room very clean and staff kind and friendly ready to solve any your problem only things to improve is the breakfast i like to find more sweet staff and not just olives ham and egg i italian,1.0
we stayed here during a short visit to athens it provided a nice central location to what we wanted to see rooms are adequate however no in room safe if you want to store valuables you need to use a personal safe through the front desk a bit antiquated but it worked out just fine the absolute best part is the breakfast view stunning view of the acropolis actually also went up in the evening to watch the lights come on surrounding the acropolis while we did find someone to serve drinks we were the only ones up there so feel that the hotel is overlooking a great opportunity in the evening to capitalize on their maybe having a bar set up and light bar snacks offered,1.0
if you request a standard deluxe room newly updated you will love the balcony hotel pere iv has no bellman to assist with luggage and taxi it is very hard catching a taxi at this location especially with no staff assistance yes of course free wifi but the connection is extremely front desk staff is nice but they are not trained correctly especially planning reservations for brunch dinner etc with the wifi hardly working the front desk staff wifi works just as slow beware,0.0
i found the hotel just days before arrival after arriving we checked in by a young men named xadir who was friendly and smart he tried to speak german a lot since we come from lobby has modern intereor just as the rooms have we had a room the bed room and the bathroom are very clean since they got tidied and cleaned every day the view is great as well because a canal lays right behind the terrace of the hotel the next station is pretty near the hotel as well as the next highway and the airport the rooms and the whole hotel is very quiet though so you wo wake up in the middle of the night because of noise from the enjoyed my stay a lot and i really want to return to amsterdam and to that hotel in my next vacation,1.0
we have stayed at the grand polis twice the first visit was nights we were in a tiny room with a tiny shower it was a little difficult to even get through the front door we enjoyed our stay as the bed was comfortable and the room was well ventilated but it did not really seem like a star experience the breakfast was great we enjoyed the buffet and would highly recommend our second stay we were some how given a much larger room on the top floor we were much more comfortable the staff was friendly on both visits and we enjoyed the views from the rooftop bar and even had lunch at the cafe downstairs we visited during the heat wave which made the location seem much further from local attractions than it actually is,1.0
i could not fault one thing about this hotel the service and detail was second to none and the concierge was exceptional recommending the best restaurants and making reservations for you the room was spotless and decorated beautifully the location is perfect would definitely return if i came back to barcelona,1.0
my husband and i were on our honeymoon and the staff at arc la rambla made it an incredible experience they upgraded us to a suite as soon as we checked in they truly made it an unforgettable experience any time we had a question or needed advice on site seeing tour or even as simple as restaurant recommendation they were so friendly and always happy to help we would definitely stay there again when we return to barcelona,1.0
i had a stay here in july room the room itself was very nice and had a lovely view over the beach the bed was comfortable and the shower was ok though it seemed to veer between freezing and scalding with no discernible state in between whatever i did to the temperature dial breakfast was good and the pool area is very pleasant albeit crowded there was a well equipped gym the only quibble being that the tvs on the did not work and were still not working on the day i left despite my reporting the problem on the first day the staff in the hotel were the biggest asset as they seemed unusually capable and friendly bear in mind that the location of the hotel is just by the sea so ideal if you want to use the public beach or look out over the sea but most restaurants and sights will be a taxi ride away not a problem but just to bear in mind depending on your preferences there is a club area with food and drink though if you want this then maybe best to book a room with it built in as to purchase access is a hefty a day and there is even a waiting list for this wifi is chargeable unless you have a marriot rewards number or similar,1.0
fantastic hotel in a great location comfortable room very friendly and helpful staff plus a fantastic rooftop bar and pool we spent three nights there in july and would go back in an instant ca recommend it enough,1.0

this hotel was perfectly located and very comfortable do yourself a favor and use indoor pool and spa next door at the britagne it is amazing and do be disappointed that you ca use the outdoor pool there the indoor pool and spa is wonderful my daughter was upset that she could not use the outdoor pool until we visited the spa it was one of the highlights of the stay the service over all was great the beds are great pillows are great we were very happy,1.0

standard hilton fayre here truly nothing exceptional bar area could do with a makeover rooms are fine this hotel suits those who need overnight accommodation for early flights it not cheap either and they just started charging for the hotel airport shuttle,1.0
pictures can not fully capture the beauty of this hotel the rooms have the convenience of the most modern hotel with a level of elegance that makes one feel like this is a special treat the uniqueness to each room only adds to that staff was friendly and very helpful on top of everything without being too attentive or at all pretentious also the breakfast was fantastic the crepes in particular were the best i have ever far as i am concerned this is the only hotel i would consider on my next trip to amsterdam,1.0
everything was fine once we got there we did however appreciate the email or days before our arrival telling us that we were booked into a basement room in your hotel fortunately our travel agent fixed that problem for us,1.0
i have been staying in the hotel for over and a half years between and nights per week and it is highly recommended for its location welcoming and overall comfort the staff are very pleasant and in particular the reception team on bar staff are also very good and the quality and value of the food is very acceptable the girls n reservations are also excellent and whilst i communicate with them a lot by mail i rarely see them andrea and imelda come to mind,1.0

we enjoyed our days stay at ilunion barcelona in the heart of poblenou the streets around the hotel have a quiet provincial atmosphere as the whole area its location is very convenient a minutes walk took us to the popular playa del bogatell on one side and to the lively rambla del poblenou on the other and it only blocks to llacuna metro station where we could easily reach the city centre we also found a taxi stand just opposite of the hotel to go to the is modern clean relatively recent with a design decor lobby is spacious and stylish amenities and services were suitable staff was efficient we used the business center but neither the gym nor the pool we ran away from the breakfast hall looking like a shopping mall cafeteria our room was large bright functional silent with comfy beds including the extra much it costs has varied from day to day one night was quite expensive,1.0
stayed here for nights for my wife birthday the location could not be better for the airport for amsterdam centre staff were super friendly polite the room was very clean each day was amazing such a variety of hot cold food ranging from self made waffles to cereal to train station is literally on the doorstep yet you do hear any noise from it it to the airport to amsterdam can not fault this hotel at all we will be staying there again thank you,1.0

i often stay in amsterdam for one night during layovers between long flights it is a beautiful city and so easy to go from the airport to downtown by train to walk by the canals eat great food and take in some culture for hours it has been hard to find a hotel very near the train station that is stylish has the amenities a traveler on layover needs quiet room gym great room service proximity to lots of restaurants etc but this has it all and the style of the rooms is somehow hip but warm dutch but universal and so well thought out gym was terrific room service was prompt and food was great i can say enough good things about the hotel and staff i definitely be back,1.0
stayed in a regular hotel room that was fine nothing fancy but a good deal for the money the room and bathroom were very clean the beds comfortable our room came with the full breakfast each morning which i liked very much our walk to trinity college or to the temple bar district took about minutes this was our second stay at the north star and we would stay there again the hotel is right across the street from connolly rail station,1.0

sometimes when you get to a gay hotel or a you expect that rude attitude towards people gay people tend to mix professionalism with drama and sometimes that mixture goes wrong in the case of two barcelona things kept professional with points to improve the breakfast is fine the fruit selection is faulty and the maid cleaned my room after despite that everything went fine expect those clones of all age showing off their bodies and sometimes sad grindry hornety faces that is gay life in the century where people act much and mean very little,1.0
recently stayed with my family of in the hotel overall good hotel but nothing special check in was great and they even allocated us rooms next to eachother so there was a connecting door between us which was great the rooms were excellent they looked great had space was clean large beds the shower was great we faced no issues with the rooms perhaps the triple room could slightly have more space wifi was offered but very slow and poor one night completely disconnected breakfast was overrated not many vegetarian options and there were no teabags which is required but would have been nice otherwise it was staff overall were very nice special thanks to paula who helped us navigate around showing us metro and generally being extremely welcoming and kind we did ask a man at reception at night time for any maps or leaflets and he seemed disinterested in telling us any even though the next day paula had was okay only metro stops from catalunya the tourist central area but it could have been closer if you are looking to be directly in the centre centre on las rambla however i just thought it was extremely overrated at out of all the hotels in barcelona there was nothing particularly special about it it was a good hotel but not amazing,1.0
the staff in this hotel were amazing every single one went out of their way to help you with anything you needed especially the concierges everyone at the concierge desk were so so helpful gave us advice on attractions to go to how to get there what transport to use etc they saw us constantly getting bike taxis and came up to us to notify us about other cheaper transport we could get which we did not know about to get to places the staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect and that you are satisfied could not fault them at all me and my partner stayed in the junior suite and it was a perfect room extremely clean so spacious and the bed was so comfortable and the view was incredible only problem with the room was there were no plug sockets near the full length mirror which was quite annoying when getting ready and maybe another mirror could have been added in the room as well however these are the only faults i could pick from the whole stay at the hotel location wise the hotel is not bang in the centre however is just a five minute walk towards it which is nice as there is no loud noise coming from the centre when in the hotel overall the staff really made mine and my partners stay at the movenpick hotel in the executive lounge they made sure we were waited on,1.0
nice very clean room nice sceenery good food in the bar good value for money take bus to the center and to the airport nice area with small pubs or bars very kind service we will come if ever in dublin,1.0
my wife and i decided to walk into the selbourne prior to going to stephen green we were very glad that we did because the interior is super nice and historical looking they have a small museum on the first floor with pictures memorabilia and old guest books dating back to the early lots of easter rising stuff too and the constitution room is here the constitution room is where michael collins and others signed the irish constitution and the condition they been able to keep it in is really nice we were lucky enough to have a hotel employee show us the room after we asked him some general questions about it but i would bet you could see it if you just meander up to the floor and head right it a couple doors down on your left,1.0
great easy to walk to most really helpful staff on reception with suggestions stylish on roof great bonus for end of busy day sightseeing good breakfast,1.0
stayed at hera after a long flight from ny great location walking distance to plaka acropolis and museums room was small but very clean and neat we ate in the roof top restaurant the waiter was very attentive and the food was excellent,1.0
beautiful hotel great value great location central to sites and centraal station in amsterdam the ice cream was a wonderful way to end each day we loved the area too and the breakfast was a great value will definitely visit this hotel again,1.0
location is excellent getting a premium room however is not worth it front desk and security staff are very helpful concierge unpredictable some better than others breakfast buffet so so for the price but great view of acropolis day and night restaurant staff very good housekeeping staff leaves much to be desired good hotel not exceptional,1.0
firstly the building is beautiful and quirky and kept spotlessly clean the staff are friendly and obliging the food is delicious the beds are comfortable the bar provides a lyrical and lively irish welcome what more can i say come to dublin and stay here even when it rains and it does you wo regret it,1.0
it was for us a great experience my kids was so glad to make their fist kids the pool is small but there is not to much people the localization is near the beach and the olympic port i recommand this hotel,1.0
disaster wifi is very very weak there is an arctic duvet on the bed few employees speak english there are no soap dishes anywhere and they use powdered eggs at breakfast i mentioned the heavy duvet after check in asking for only sheets with a light blanket and four days later it has not been changed we have three people and two facecloths there is also no retractable clothesline to hang damp clothes with such a good location the right manager could turn this into a jewel if you open the windows to get air you get loud pub noise at night and squalking birds from am so you wake up drenched in sweat from the north pole duvet it is july front desk is unresponsive,0.0
we ended up staying at the new hotel for one night unexpectedly some other plans had fallen through and we actually been to the hotel the night before for a drink on their fabulous rooftop bar it was one of the best decisions we made on our trip we loved the funky vibe of the place the staff were so attentive and the room was very well appointed we have stayed at many large and small luxury hotels over the years and we really enjoyed the slightly hipster feel of this one very much it made up feel young and trendy but in a nice up market setting which is central to all the key attractions in athens if you are looking for a somewhat different experience to your traditional big chain hotel setting then we would have no hesitation recommending this to you finally you simply have to have a cocktail on the rooftop bar views of the on one side and lycabatus hill on the others breathtaking stuff,1.0
top class hotel great facilities for events and meetings very central to all requirements fabulous breakfast for busy schedule excellent gym rooms are spacious with great beds and space to work or just relax a little bathrooms are equipped the shower with ledge to sit is great otherwise soak it up in the bath in summer this must be the place for couples with everything on the beach and nearby if you a foodie book in advance to enoteca paco pérez summer months they do lunch and dinner and will accommodate kids to an extent cooler months can be easier to get in this is in the hotel but leased out great wine list for the anorak to the help me peeps tough decision not to stay in hotel again on my return a few months later but needed easier access to another part of town bar hoppers best you head out but it ok for a night cap or drink while you wait meeting spot,1.0
we loved staying at this radisson blu and would do so our room was not ready when we arrived hours completely understandable our luggage was safely stored and we took the time to walk to the jordaan district where we paused at a pub for a coffee and a bite to eat apple pie was awesome wandered back through the nine streets admiring the local we returned to the hotel about hours our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a fabulous business class the next few days we found it quite convenient to walk from the hotel to all major attractions including major museums the train station canal tour boats the list goes on and staff was friendly helpful and professional the restaurant and bar were good the breakfast buffet is excellent our advice skip pancakes go for the local smoked did not use the fitness facilities because we did not want to pay the small extra fee,1.0
we could have asked for anything better from his hotel it was a short walk no longer than from las ramblas it was very mature and relaxed hotel and the staff were phenomenal very helpful and cheerful we were upgraded for free to club havana which meant in the morning we were able to get free croissants just for our level which was a bonus considering the breakfast was euros the roof top bar was nice and overlooked a few over hotel the bar sold lovely cocktails which we had every night when we was in barcelona city we used the metro to get around very simple to use we got a i believe which was journeys for to conclude we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel as we was sure on how great it would be but we had an amazing stay at this modern hotel and me and my partner would definitely recommend to anyone especially couples,1.0
the hotel is set in a quiet neighborhood in barcelona it is well communicated with metro the room was cozy with comfortable bed and a nice terrace the best was the service the breakfast was also worth thanks we will come back,1.0

we checked in on july and checked out on august this hotel was central to everything we planned and did and our view of the cathedral and the surrounding plaza an upgrade was breathtaking the hotel is in an old building which is spectacularly maintained the staff was very attentive and efficient however on close inspection upon check in the bathroom was not cleaned to perfection as we found some unappetizing body hair on the floor and in the bathtub which was gone the next day also the tv was on the fritz on our first day but the maintenance staff addressed this issue quickly after we reported it to the front desk the also an was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive i would stay here again but hope the housekeeping staff will devote more attention to detail,1.0
this hotel is situated opposite the gothic cathedral and between the gothic and born areas of the city the room we had was quite small but finished to a high standard the minibar is complimentary free the staff could not have been more helpful and most spoke fluent english the sky bar on the roof with adjoining pool was a great place to relax and cool down breakfast was excellent with a wide variety available but quite pricey euro per head and there are masses of places nearby to buy breakfast gaudy buildings sagrada familia are a euro taxi ride away we were on a lower floor and the metro could be heard but was not obtrusive,1.0
perfect hotell in the center of barcelona clean and freshly breakfast and free buffet from every day salads fruits cakes sandwiches and wraps free coffie and soda we even got free bottles of water every morning to bring during our tours in hotel staff gave great service and were very helpfull in any gave tips and hints of what to do lots of smile and always a hello we felt welcome stayed in juniorsuites with a terrace no view at all and near by the pool some flowers or plants would done it nicer and it could be better to close a gap against nabours terrase but really not a big deal the good thing was it quiteness no disturbing sounds not even from the pooljuniorsuites with pool are located higher up and towards placa cathalyonia with better view then you have the streets outside so i guess it depends on what you aware the shower and toilet are seperated and it cant bee locked they are also behind frosted glass quite nice and modern free locker in the room and they made our beds before night free nespresso in got a bottle of cava and fruits upon arrivel most of towels and beautiful will recomend this for couples and even families,1.0
stayed in the gresham for one night before leaving the country paid euro for a room without breakfast for this price would have expected much better service arrived about knowing this was too early for check in but needing to drop luggage and enquire about possibility of room availability traveling on my own with lots of luggage and a very tired young child no room available fair enough but was told i would get a phone call as soon as possible when room available never got that call i left my luggage went to bar to order food found my own menu nobody served me despite waiting several minutes and i left to find something on hours later i rang hotel and was told no room still available child now asleep on top of me and i pleaded with receptionist who then found one i arrived back to hotel to lots of people checking in i queued with child asleep in my arms and looked around to see if chair in reception but none there nobody came to my assistance during that process despite me struggling to hold my little boy i eventually grew tired of receptionist chatting to a customer at concierge not checking in just chatting and i asked for my room key she then kept asking me for my luggage tag despite the fact my hands were completely full i told her my priority was child and room and i could worry about luggage later she finally,0.0
good hotel very central location barcelona is dirty very dirty the smell of sewerage hangs in the air constantly beggars and people defecating in the streets are fairly common hotel leonardo was a good heaven to return to after walking the streets of the city the standard rooms are very small concider an upgrade if you are staying longer than a day or room has aircon bit noisy but it works making facility in room bathroom very good breakfast excellent and worth booking when you make your reservation unless you want to eat in the stinky streets worth visiting el callejo excellent service and very good food pintor extremely good food little more pricey but worth it,1.0
we enjoyed our stay the room was very large by european standards typical size about a mile from the city center it if you up for it or you can take a bus or a taxi very busy on game weekends but it did hinder our agenda,1.0
though not very near to the hotspots of amsterdam situated in quite surroundings on a bank of a canal actually whole of amsterdam is hilton on apollolaan is a charming hotel with a very friendly and courteous staff made famous by john lennon and yoko ono bed in seventies this hotel is true to its name,1.0
spent three very comfortable and enjoyable nights here room was very well appointed with good air conditioning breakfast was good with really attentive staff reception staff were excellent helpful and friendly only a few minutes walk to the metro which takes you to the centre of amsterdam,1.0
room was clean and big however we stayed on the floor and the wifi was ridiculous after sight seeing and travelling we wanted to contact our families but could not get anything to load at all for the two nights we stayed if you are going to run such a big hotel and we are paying a lot of money to stay there there should be boosters on every floor so this is a problem and everyone can have access to fast loading internet also for the price we are paying for accomodation breakfast should be included the first night we got in after delayed flights we slept in the next morning deciding to head down to breakfast at we payed for full breakfast and once asked if we could get a few things refilled were told that breakfast is nearly over so no we are still paying the same amount of price so things that are requested should be refilled or breakfast should be discounted when checking in we had to fix up our bill which was fine however we were charged an extra aus dollars for the accomodation as they accidentally converted the money exchange after we asked them not to very frustrating stay,0.0
this hotel was lovely has a lovely snack bar downstairs with croissants and sandwiches the cocktails at the bar are lovely and the rooms are peaceful airy and comfortable food was also nice minute walk to the nearest tram stop which takes roughly minutes to get to the main area great for a city break,1.0
my husband and i took a weekend trip and enjoyed our accommodations very much the room overlooked the hustle and bustle of the street we were able to enjoy the city noise and some fresh air walking distance to all of the attractions min walk to the train station,1.0
a disappointment we have stayed in many best western hotels after flying to europe usually you know that there will be a certain standard of excellence not this time it is true that the hotel was spotless but our room was small and pokey but it was quiet there were lots of places to eat in the neighbourhood and the food was good this was in contrast to the breakfast offered at the hotel meagre choice i am sure you could find a better hotel for the night between flights,1.0
it my second time at citizenm always enjoyable place really relaxing place good position going out on the left you find tram number that bring you in center on the right you find railway station and in minutes you reach the one thing that i noticed immediately in this visit is that shower not so clean as before not shower walls but down where the doors are sliding really dirty so nice place that i really have some difficulty talking bad but cleaning is need to improved,1.0
central to everywhere easy to catch taxis which is our preferred choice to get from a to b but also close to the underground metro and buses lots of cafes around and close to good restaurants walking down la rambla is a block or so away excellent shopping as well as wonderful architecture everywhere to see and enjoy casa battlo a few streets away the sightseeing bus a good way to orient yourself with the city my tip visiting barcelona is to book all the sightseeing places in advance as they can get booked up sigrid familia the picasso museum and also the park guell,1.0
stayed for nights and as per previous review writer i would probably rather sleep on the street if given the choice of returning the staff were friendly enough however the rooms were the most run down that i have ever seen in my employment i have seen very poor homeless accommodation that is like the ritz compared to the river house the street noise was unbelievable even with the windows shut avoid here if you are a remotely light sleeper the location is handy for central dublin but have your wallet ready to be ripped off throughout dublin the shower was powerful but the bathroom was very outdated and tiles were loose on the floor and roof the hotel recommended a parking block and with the hotel stamp we got a couple of euros off the parking bill beware do not park on this street outside this hotel as you are sure to be clamped we seen this frequently during our two day stay i did expect to stay at a top notch hotel but this is grim all visitors to the hotels looked disgruntled and miffed,0.0
this welcoming boutique hotel is located in a quiet side street just off dam square combining tranquility with a truly central location the hotel team was friendly and efficient and the food in the lobby restaurant truly delicious,1.0
the staff was excellent robby was extremely kind polite and helpful i would stay at this citizenm again just because of him the location is also excellent it is away from the city center and all the tourists but next to a tram stop which can get you anywhere in the city,1.0
when i saw the photos of the hotel i did know what to expect in real life it not as over the top as you might superior room was spacious with a balcony and comfortable the staff were friendly and hotel is located in a nice area with a short walk to shops and would stay here again,1.0
this is a great hotel for many reasons its five minutes from the acropolis and museum its right beside the best street dining in athens the pool is very special if you get the right room you will face ancient greece from your window and except for one totally rude head wine waiter the roof top bar and restaurant is extraordinary,1.0
this hotel is supposed to be a star hotel but i would give it more than stars it owned by spg but it worse than any spg hotel i have ever stayed at the location is close to the acropolis and its centrally located but the area is filled with homeless drunk people and you would feel safe walking at night couple of the staff were nice and friendly but some were not the rooms were really small and there was no space for suitcases we made a mistake of booking this hotel before going to the islands and after coming back i would go back to athens again but if i were to go back i would stay at this hotel again,0.0
we stayed at new hotel for just a night in athens on the tail end of our greece trip the rooms are awesome each one has its own charm and is unique the art decor layout and style of each room is different which is what makes this hotel so great it contemporary but still feels comfortable and very upscale the rooms are spacious and you can get a great view if you ask for a room overlooking the city,1.0

friendly staff rooftop and outfit pool was the best value good with family room although more expensive then the breakfast is recommended to add a complaint was dealt with in an excellent manner we will return,1.0
came here for night during a business trip and had a decent stay had bad luck to be overlooking the construction next door which detracted from the view but i did really spend much time in the room so it did matter the room itself was clean and decent and i opted to have breakfast in the dining room which was convenient plus good note this is a separate charge so you have to request it upon great thing about this hotel is that the luas is right outside the front door i hopped on and within minutes i was near temple bar shame about the rain but dublin is a great little city and i really enjoyed walking around note that although it called gibson and plays up the musical angle think gibson guitars most of the official logos feature a fender guitar headstock just sayin,1.0
we always stay at the plaka hotel as it has the ideal location for discovering athens everything within walking distance the breakfast was great and the staff very friendly and helpful would have liked to see some drinks in the minibar but that neither here nor there the view from the rooftop bar was spectacular,1.0
ambassade is located in the city center and short walking distances to many excellent restaurants the hotel concierge was very helpful in recommending and making reservations for us and very knowledgable and easy to communicate in english the facilities are a row of very old beautiful houses that are now all connected internally i was in three different rooms of relatives and they each differed slightly although all were very nice,1.0
we booked this hotel thinking it be cool to stay in a castle during our night day trip to dublin hotel was beautiful and it was fun exploring the building but after the first day novelty wore off and we wished we stayed closer to the city center the surrounding town is small with not much to see you would have to spend min or spend for a taxi to get to the city we took the bus the first morning to the city but needing exact change was a pain so we took taxi next two mornings hotel has a taxi on standby so that was nice later learned the red hop on and off bus comes near the hotel which would have been a great option but not knowing we purchase green hop on and off bus when we first arrived in dublin overall it was a pleasant stay and hot buffet breakfast was nice start in the morning but it was same menu every day,1.0
the staff on reception were very friendly and helpful especially when my husband had his phone stolen on the metro the breakfast was very good value for money and differed each day we loved the view of the acropolis from restaurant balcony would recommend we travelled to athens for a family baptism and the hotel was very well sited for using public transport,1.0
staff is top professional and helpful the room is very clean nice bathroom we the beds comfortable most of all great breakfast we manage to walk around the acropolis in a sense that our hotel is very close to points of interest our stay was comfortable,1.0
stayed here while visiting dublin and surrounding areas the hotel location can not be beat we were able to walk to most sites restaurants and shopping our balcony room on the floor was spacious and comfortable breakfasts were very tasty with many choices would definitely recommend,1.0
we stayed here twice in july before and after a trip to the greek islands this is an ideally located hotel if you are a tourist visiting athens you can literally see the acropolis from your balcony assuming an upper floor on the street side and you lean out a little be aware it an old style hotel with a very feel sort of place where the shower is over the bathtub and at least our room was a bit tired mattress a bit worn etc and we were upgraded on our second stay to what they call an executive room which is a step up from the standard room so on the star rating system it a more like to star than star but having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again the charming staff and great location more than compensate finally the breakfast included in our booking was a great range of greek and western style food hence the rating of which i have rounded to a,1.0
perfect location few steps from trinity college and across the street from temple bar beautiful facilities and very comfortable rooms the restaurant was fantastic and service exceptional all expectations met as a westin property,1.0
where else on earth could you book a hotel room in which a functioning vinyl record player is installed and connected to a surround sound system perhaps nowhere else but volkshotel if you could tell i stayed in the johnny jukebox room i highly suggest everyone to check out the special rooms if you have done so already they considerably more expensive than the standard rooms but could change your whole time in werkplaats dining badplaats hot tubs and almost the entire johnny jukebox room were excellent the canvas breakfast buffet was good although it was by the buffet at my zandvoort hotel service was excellent too the only major issue i had was a little trivial but the bed in the johnny jukebox room is surrounded by a sloped wooden frame structure meaning you pretty much need to step on the sloped portion and then step onto the flat floor in order to get out of bed someone with a bad sense of balance might not handle that well,1.0
band new hotel in the best location in athens the rooms are very clean and newthe staff are amazing and the view from the roof top garden was great only issue where small lifts this is one of the best hotels in athens,1.0
i stayed with a group of teenagers with a travel company and i was surprised how calm the atmosphere was in the hotel the reception wanted us to fill out paperwork to figure out the tourist tax when we were trying to get our group settled and organized in their rooms but they let us come back later and figure out the bill the rooms were always cleaned well and the reception put in a call for me and called a taxi for me when i needed to go to the thought that there would be more craziness since it close to la rambla but it was quite the opposite i ca say that i felt unsafe at any point but there were some weird people outside i feel like that is almost everywhere near the city center but i think it important to note if you stay there i never felt unsafe but the people were strange also please note that the download and upload speeds are very slow if you need to upload download or transfer files on business then you might want to consider another hotel i had to try uploading pictures through dropbox and it would take an hour instead of which is the typical time for the amount of files i was working with at the time,1.0
we are so happy with our stay at everything was great friendly and service minded staff everyone i passed on my way smiled and said hello the spa was amazing a relaxing get away in the hectic city i would also recommend to book a spa appointment they were really good the breakfast is a bit pricy but it was definitely worth it i dream about coming back for another stay thank you for making us feel so welcome,1.0
stayed for nights room has a strange layout in a l shape and very little storage space numerous stains and dirty marks on the floor had a stunning view of the hotel roof fencing and walls quite noisy bed was small and creaky paid nearly euros for nights i paid half that in other chain hotels and had nicer room bed and service bar in the hotel is very expensive and the service is poor pub next door is brilliant disappointed with this hotel brilliant location just very poor value and standards would love to return to dublin but i would not stay here again for what it cost,0.0
these premises are used by apt for travellers river cruises outside road works were being undertaken and this did help when approaching the property but inside the premises were modern and well maintained staff were friendly and helpful rooms were ample and housekeeping were on their game we did get to use a lot of the amenities within the hotel but they were in keeping with the rest of the property is close to including the bus and canal boats trams are close and run straight down to the old light district and if you up for it you can walk to most biggest let down was the breakfast provided in the cost of our room while being ample staff seemed to be stunned by the headlights with the large numbers and continual turnover of patrons while we coped with the frustrations it appeared that numerous patrons were able to there was a lack or maybe just interest it was for this reason we were prepared to try the said that if we were coming back we stay here,1.0
no shower amenities not good service the hotel in general was definitely not a star the only good thing is the location which is very central the room had a balcony that overlooks the street overpriced,0.0
hotel is under renovation but did interfere with stay rooms are clean but on small side no but they did provide a fan as it was warm there is a shuttle from the airport but they charge euros for a round trip which was fine but it was advertised that there was a charge was first hard to find where shuttle picks you up and it is a short walk from the airport staff are friendly and very helpful and accommodating restaurant in the hotel is good the breakfast is an additional charge from the room there are no other restaurants or stores near the hotel as it is more of a residential area overall stay was comfortable and convenient for our purposes,1.0
well located near vondelpark the hotel is designed to the max so will appeal to hip aesthetic appreciative it also delivers as a good clean but basic hotel the twin we had was small with no real view the beds comfortable and the bathroom spotless no drinks facilities in room which is was on screens but there were a couple of friendly staff to assist we had extra parking needs as our van would fit the car elevator so they arranged for us to park in the sister hotel next was excellent a quirky organic and apparently locally sourced continental spread cafe service was weaker with forgotten drinks the hotel could use more staff in the mornings for checkout and breakfast past would be was a nice place but did feel like great value for money especially with extra payment for parking and breakfast,1.0
my boyfriend and i had a comfortable and enjoyable stay here certain aspects were really impressive and felt namely the huge and beautiful lobby and the breakfast both the view and the food say it was let down by small touches such as the fact that they do provide free bottled water in the rooms and that the hallways were very run down such a contrast to other public areas the pool area was also far too small for the amount of guests but i suppose there is much they can do about that now i would definitely stay here again though they area was good and it was good value for money plus the rooms were pretty large and always clean,1.0
very well located hotel room was comfortable with nice flat screen tv that was very good a bit of noise from the street because hotel is downtown the windows in room open and fresh air was a bonus the beds were very comfortable two restaurants that were fine the bleeding horse pub is adjacent to hotel and many other restaurant in walking distance grafton street shopping area and stephens green as well as the dublin museum of natural history were close walking distance we would stay at the hotel again when back in dublin,1.0
i only review very good or very bad experiences and room mate anna falls into the amazing experience category the very best part was the staff we had a little glitch with our reservations but they handled it very professionally and courteously they were going to make sure we were taken care of everyone at the desk was knowledgeable and so friendly and down to earth it by far the best experience i ever had in terms of customer service at a that the hotel was immaculate and stylish it had all the modern amenities one could ask for plenty of outlets good air conditioning powerful hair dryer great water pressure hot water comfortable bed it was quiet at night breakfast was very nice and the kids loved the plunge pool after a day of site seeing the only negatives would be that some rooms are super tiny and do have natural light also in our kids room if bathroom door was kept closed there was smell in the bathroom however all of the positives far outweigh the few you room mate anna for an awesome stay in barcelona,1.0
nice hotel quiet and peaceful with good location breakfast was that good but for the coffee you have starbucks next to the hotel wifi worked nicely and you could rely on that during working hours,1.0
this hotel is perfect for a quick city break we stayed for three nights the location is perfect so central the hotel is very clean and staff friendly the room was quite small and looked onto a wall which was a bit of shame if i returned i would definitely pay more and ask for a balcony room breakfast was nice with fresh bread and pastries the only thing i would say is that there is a lack of any savoury options apart from some ham and in all a great hotel for a short city break and we would return,1.0
i searched in for a reasonable price hotel in barcelona and one of those oprions was hotel barbara i booked it as a hotel but when i entered to my room i felt i decieved it was not a hotel but was just a hostel and a very dirty noisy smelly one i never had a quite time there and the smell of cigrattes was in my room all the never recomend it because if i wanted a hostel i could choose too many better options in the town,0.0
as my maiden name before getting married was claris i was intrigued to stay here from the number of pillows you get to choose for your perfect nights sleep to the the complimentary wine and expansive upstairs lounge area along with a perfect location one could not possibly be disappointed breakfast was ample and served by attentive staff on arriving at the hotel you are greeted and treated like royalty definitely for us,1.0

what an absolutley brilliant hotel i stayed in this nights from the to july was a simple trip from right outside the airport to the hotel by bus buses do not accept cash so buy a travel card i had to pay on card but when i got to the hotel there was a tobacco shop that sold day travel tickets for euros the hotel is in a lovley little town called osdorplein it a good minute tram ride from dam centre but i much preferred being away as the town was lovley your right in the middle of a shopping centre lake and transport links to one side and shops everywhere you look the hotel has water fountains outside which everyone seems to go in what a friendly bunch of people too there loads of places to eat near the hotel and a supermarket called hema which is extremely cheap and sells brilliant things the hotel it sell is modern and clean we arrived early and they got the room ready for us and let us check in which was nice of them we had a room for people which was big beds are super comfy the maids are always about cleaning rooms and restocking supplies breakfast was included in our room which was continental style and really yummy i plan to come back here every year it truly is one of the best breaks i ever had everyday i was there i went to amsterdam centre it a,1.0
ok so this was part of our family trip right after our wedding in cyprus and then a beautiful stay in crete we were to spend nights in athens prior to flying back home my parents and sister were accompanying us therefore i have booked rooms about months in advance informed the hotel that this was a special occasion from my profile they knew that i was top tier spire elite royal ambassador within their chain of hotels here are my comments although they claim that there is special for elite members on the club floor we had to wait exhausted at the reception in the before they could speak with us not the right level of they told me that my personal room got upgraded to the club floor which is a given benefit of this tier anyway however my parents room got a level upgrade but no club floor and no club lounge i have called the guest relations and the duty manager and have asked nicely whether they can at least give club lounge access for my parents seeing that this was a special trip lots of talking from them but bottom line was a no and even the gm the best he has done was to offer a discount for the club lounge this was a first for me in many years with ihg thumbs down to you yes the view from the balcony at the club lounge was amazing we could see acropolis however we,0.0
our room was an excellent size with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom wifi worked well the whole also had the breakfast package which was worth it they provide excellent selections from to selections you can have made to order eggs or waffles as well definitely have to fresh squeezed orange juice to top it off the gym was clean and provided enough equipment the location was an easy walk to some main neighborhoods and attractions for example the rembrandt house if you need to park be sure to reserve a spot ahead of time,1.0

we were very happy with our experience the arrangements were easy to make the location was excellent the rooms were very comfortable and the staff was friendly and very helpful i would also recommend the free walking tours of the gothic quarter as suggested by the hotel staff,1.0
this is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at from entering the lobby the first thing that hots you is the horrific smell the entire hotel smells like sewage and mold if you have the fortune to be in a room with an ocean view you will not be able to sleep because of the noise from the street below we had to by earplugs to be able to get at least a bit of sleep it is very dirty in the rooms the last day the cleaning lady did bother to enter out room in order to take a shower you have to enter the bathroom without inhaling thought the nose the toilet seat was the price of a night we did want you go into the hotel if there were any free rooms anywhere else we would have changed the hotel but unfortunately in july everything in athens is booked,0.0
positive experience a little pricy recommend a rental car taxi or bicycle to get around a really really long walk to the beach for wimps we eventually moved to a less expensive hotel closer to the water and rented bikes near the water everywhere the food was great bring water wine cheese baguette in your small backpack lots of people watch your wallet and valuables really nice hotel pay for a great breakfast,1.0
second time visiting this hotel and it will certainly not be our last we will continue to stay in this hotel when we visit amsterdam it truly is remarkable the staff the food the rooms five star great location also highly recommend,1.0
a lovely highly professional staff a pretty room and refined public spaces located centrally to major tourist attractions but thankfully not in the middle of the staff are consummate professionals without exception their service is gracious and warm and we found their advice most helpful the room was tranquil and spacious with a comfortable king bed not two twins pushed together and ample sitting area we appreciated the period decor and attention to hotel is comprised of several adjoining houses on the herengracht and singel canals as such there are stairs to link various levels we stayed in room overlooking the herengracht canal on the fourth floor while there is a lift once you reach the fourth floor one climbs four stairs walks along a short hallway descends four stairs once you enter room climb more than a dozen stairs on a spiral staircase to gain access to the room it was not problematic for us but if you have mobility issues we recommend letting the hotel know when you book we would definitely return,1.0
our stay at ohla eixample was an absolute delight spacious rooms and bathrooms with all essential amenities great service as well with an extremely helpful concierge that helped us with reservations tapas recommendations ticket bookings et all the hotel is brilliantly located with plenty of nearby shopping and eating options highly recommended and will definitely stay here again,1.0
this is a really beautiful hotel the staff really do everything they can to make your stay pleasant and we were told that our superior room had been given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room which was beautiful a frequently restocked complimentary minibar and lovely molton brown cosmetics we were also given some complimentary patisseries when returning to our room after our first night location is really perfect for sightseeing and is situated very close to the gothic cathedral and the born district with its great is a small pool situated on the gorgeous rooftop terrace and the mercer breakfast is not to be missed my fiancée and i had a really wonderful trip and i recommend anyone who wants a plush experience,1.0
the primary reason for my booking this hotel was its location it was right at dam square the other reason was that this was the only hotel offering a double bed for single occupancy as well the room was small like the kind of rooms you would find in manhattan but what else would one expect at the city center being a restaurant the only staff available was at the reception so do expect any room support if you need something you need to go and collect it from the reception yourself breakfast was nothing to boast of but it was decent the receptionist who also set up breakfast served hot coffee and hot milk on request which was a delight the receptionists were very helpful with any directions or queries we had they also arranged a cab for airport drop if you are looking for a clean room and only bed and breakfast this is one of the best to go to the shopping area the trams the rld the central station everything was just a few minutes walk from the hotel the only thing to be cognizant of is that it is on a pedestrian only street you will have to drag your luggage a bit to get to the hotel,1.0
the staff was friendly helpful and professional the bar made the best drinks the way they are supposed to be done the food was great prices were very reasonable and the castle was beautiful and well kept,1.0
we chose this hotel for its location which is perfect for sightseeing and in an historic location however above and beyond its location is the overall package excellent rooms excellent service and the friendliest hotel staff in amsterdam highly recommended,1.0
stayed at the hotel ohla for nights july and would definitely stay here again check in was nice and easy they also gave us some cava and a refill while checking in room was spacious and clean we were on the second floor right over the wine bar the street via laietana was right outside our window and we were not bothered by any street noise nice touch having a free bottle of water for both of us every night breakfast was nice pastries scrambled eggs delicious cured meats and little sandwiches you can ask for fried or poached eggs and cave is top bar and pool is beautiful great place to grab a cocktail and take in the views of the city the pool closes at so no late night favorite place to grab a drink in barcelona was at the hotels bar vistro there were three couples in our group and every night we would meet at the bar before heading out and then end the night there with a nightcap our bartender was amazing she is studying mixology so we had fun trying her different location was perfect for our stay easy to walk to the cathedral las ramblas placa de catalunya and many restaurants or just ask the concierge and they will call you a advantage of the concierge they pointed us to some of our favorite meals in the will recommend this hotel and next time in barcelona will book again,1.0
i called blooms this morning and spoke to grainne in reservations who was very plesant and professional my request was for a single room and grainne bet all the famous websites on price this i was surprised at bit she did it great work grainne,1.0
we stayed here for nights and although the hotel was modern quaint and clean we had a really bad experience with the customer service first we could even communicate with the concierge at the desk as they could barely understand english we were told a certain price for some of the services but then another price was charged to us eventually while we were not even aware of this we ended up being scammed into paying way too much euro for laundry services also because of the language barrier we ended running into problems with hotel booking sites and this put a major damper on our trip as we could not get the information we needed and were stuck confused and misinformed hotel customer service was unwilling to help us out not willing to make sure we had the best experience possible the hotel cleaning services were great as our room was cleaned every day,0.0
one of the best hotels i ever stay exellent location just to minutes walk to any key point super friendly stuff spacious modern well decorated and very clean room with fast site parking lot for very attractive gives me experience that i was expecting from overbooked summer sure will come break administration must place additional information regarding location of parking lot on hotels web site its really difficult to find it,1.0

the hotel is a typical ibis with no surprises the staff are extremely helpful and friendly facing rooms are exceptionally quiet an absolute safe in the room seems to be a standard ibis failing come guys get it right in addition no tea or coffee in room or available after breakfast times except at a fee this is not good in th e hotel of wifi is good strong and return as it is so convenient,1.0
if you are looking for a clean safe modern charming and hotel in athens this is it i come for business and vacation and have stayed here over times the breakfast is excellent the staff of amazing and the location is highly recommend it,1.0
my wife and i loved our five days at this lovely hotel all of the staff seemed happy to work there and happy to help their guests the breakfast was great this location is relatively quiet which suited us well we were in easy walking distance from the major art museums and the vogelpark and there were plenty of good restaurants nearby once we caught on to how to use the trams we could get anywhere in the city with ease,1.0
arrived after hours traveling first impression was ok room small bathroom clean regular hotel room slept for a few hours only to be woken up by bulldozers and moving cranes at finally i called reception and the lady was apologetic and said we could swap rooms in the afternoon we are here for nights so my son and i packed up our suitcases and spent the day in the city we came back only to change rooms as we did want to leave it too late the girl at the reception explained that unfortunately they was any rooms left and although she could see on the computer i had called in the morning she told us that she too thinks the construction site starts too early but there was nothing she could do this should have been explained when booking if i had known i would definitely not have booked it so unfair i paid a lot of money for a star hotel right now a hostel would be heaven i suggest if you thinking about this hotel ask before booking if you will be in the construction zone if so avoid it at all costs,0.0
we stayed in a junior suite definitely worth the extra money one of our favourite hotels very much our type of hotel modern perfectly clean and stylish hard to believe it is an accor hotel as it is so distinctive staff were friendly and the restaurant downstairs was very good for dinner also the deal of a latte and a croissant for a few euros for a light breakfast was perfect for us we would hesitate in recommending this hotel and will be back next time we are in amsterdam,1.0
big hotel i know but you ca beat the location cleanliness or the swimming pool when it degrees plus bonus is the roof top bar and restaurant views amazing good value for money and made our athens stay a treat,1.0
i stayed here for two nights with my fiancé for a break in barcelona i could fault it one bit the hotel is in the heart of barcelona just off la ramblas down an alleyway the hotel staff were very friendly and welcomed us on our arrival our room was very clean and modern clean towels were also available the room was very comfortable outside the hotel was slightly noisy as there appears to be a outside the hotel which could be a problem for some is a restaurant service meals and snacks we attended the restaurant for our breakfast and had two cooked breakfasts and coffee costing approx each we both enjoyed the breakfast the hotel is situated in the heart of barcelona and we used the nearby underground station just a couple of minutes from the hotel on las ramblas and we got around quite a bit of barcelona and saw some very famous landmarks an all day ticket costs around the underground service is fantastic on the day of departure we still had a full day left in barcelona hotel staff were very accommodating and kept our luggage at the hotel for us in a safe place we came back and forth that day and they allowed to access our luggage at anytime without any problems all in all we were very happy with our stay at may ramblas hotel and we will definitely be coming back here to stay thank you very much to all the,1.0
this was a wonder place to stay for our first visit in ireland the hotel is outside the main city limits but it is a quick taxi ride from the airport about miles away the grounds are beautiful the hotel is beautiful the knights bar is fun great drinks especially the noble knight rooms are lovely front desk is very helpful and i have to say the breakfast in the morning is out of this world was a real treat you can also take a bus to downtown nice walk to the bus stop,1.0
this hotel looks almost out of place in an upscale newer neighborhood of amsterdam it makes a good visual impression with a nice lobby the location is okay if you enjoy walking a fair distance to get to any of the usual tourist attractions nor is it very near to public transport the room i had was a good size and definitely clean but the electric lighting was poor and one outlet in the bathroom the only one with a us style socket did not work water temperature was hard to control the hotel provided instant coffee and tea in the room which you need to use because a coffee at the lobby cafe was euros the breakfast buffet was very good and they would also get other items upon request,1.0
we have spent sature au night of july in this hotel and are very disappointed we have been warned that there was a party going on just under our room when we booked the room this should have been a minimum to warn music was very loud and even the floor was vibrating we had a flight at on sunday so woke up à without being able to sleep before am when i asked info on that party to the night receptionist and if we could change room or a have a reduced price due to the circumstances all he could say was that it normal in dublin saturday is in the town center and that if we want calm we have to choose a b b i sorry but i worked for months in the clarence hotel in temple bar and i can tell that it was very quiet last time we went in dublin last year we slept in another hotel closest to the city center and it was very quiet too additionnal to this the flush was very slow really comfortable when you are in a room the beds are ridiculously small i and my feet were out of the bed and we paid for this i sent a mail to the hotel manager a week ago and no answer sure we wo come back,0.0
my husband and i stayed here for nights and we loved it it a little outside of the busy center which was perfect for us it was quiet and we were able to get good nights rest the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and is in a great park setting we had a large room with a king size bed and a soaker tub the staff is super friendly and made our stay very comfortable we will definitely be back,1.0
even though the room was really small it was so conveniently situated that it compensated for the shortcoming there was not enough room to open the luggage so there was a lot of logistics to get clothes ready for next helped a lot that the stop for the bus route was just a block from the hotel we had a pass then it was really easy to go to all tourist spots the staff was really nice and very accommodating we arrived at and they let us do an early instead of making us wait till the afternoon the rooftop restaurant is awesome make dinner reservations for a sunset dinner it is so worth it in this trip we stayed in hotels in greece and the herodion was the only one that had good ac we totally recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heart beat,1.0
great location right in the heart of the city zoo is a min walk so is the picasso museum the room was modern the was good free wifi room service they have a rooftop pool area although it could be better as it would be great to have a bar up gym is a bit of a let down one treadmill and one bike small room no water as it was always empty and the bike did operate nice touch is they do free cheese and wine at every day for guests however you get a very small glass of wine and no seconds and they do put out a huge amount of cheese which means by all the other guests have had it and they dont refill the plates and as i got abruptly told when its finished its finished overall a great little hotel right in the heart of the city would definitely stay again,1.0
since we have been to barcelona a few times in the past we decided to have just a stay prior to our cruise departure the hilton diagonal is a great hotel for such an occasion aside from the standard amenities their staff were very friendly helpful and accommodating and the breakfast food is a filler seriously if you came to barcelona go out and eat the pool area is very miami beach chic and run by an outside company of hilton so watch out for hidden fees on food and added bonus was having the diagonal galleria mall just across the street for those forgotten items that were missed in your luggage or anxious teenagers that needed some freedom the city itself was just a minute cab ride into town pending traffic or the subway system is located on the other side of the galleria mall again a good location as a,1.0
for any negative comment i could find about this hotel there is a much bigger positive to overshadow it i am in a unique position for this review as i stayed in the basic double room and the master room spacious clean and floods with natural sunlight the blackout and privacy blinds are fantastic allowing you at have a good sleep in a comfy bed the free minibar is limited but it is free after all the shower is fantastic great water pressure and has therapeutic jets for a refreshing feel we did have a flooding issue but within of reporting it it had been fixated cleaned and they had brought us champagne and chocolates as an apology fantastic customer suite we decided as we were having such a good stay and it was our anniversary we would upgrade to the master suite for one night it was a bit odd that the first time i asked about this i was told it would be when i went to book it was actually the suite is lovely loads of space and a confy sofa to relax on the views are phenomenal both during the days and in the evening you can see over the the hotel showed their customer service by bringing us complementary champagne and strawberries for our anniversary the hot tub is also a great addition to your private terrace and sun loungers the only gripe is that whilst we were in the hot tub approximately two cleaners,1.0
the location is perfect in the heart of dublin which means walking distance to all the main staff was super friendly the room was great and very clean excellent breakfast super recommended,1.0
having stayed at buswells on more than one occasion i would highly recommend for its city centre location lovely staff great food on this occasion my only issue was the heat in the room eventhough we had a fan in the room it was very difficult to sleep this is something that is difficult to rectify unless you have air con still had a lovely time eventhough we might be coming home less rested than we had hoped,1.0
location it is not convenient if you are interested in visiting the city center though there are taxis available just outside the hotel the cost of each trip to go to the city is between euros and euros to the airport it is close enough to a beach but the beach is very crowded and kind of dumpy its proximity to the beach should not be the reason to choose this it is close to a mall which has the advantage of a supermarket and some shops if thats your purpose staff variable service the breakfast staff was wonderful the front desk staff were not all great lilliana was pleasant but not empathetic cold and condescending she did not seem to care that much regarding the issues at hand and made no extra effort to accomodate us as guests not a people person and not someone who should be at the front desk in my opinion i came back after lilliana left maybe our issues were because it was the end of her shift and she didnt care i spoke with ettore what an absolute star he went way out of his way to accomodate us in a very full hotel trying to reorganize things to help get us into a better room though we ultimately stayed in our original room his efforts were much appreciated other staff were also extremely kind and apologized for our situation overall i generally only book with hilton for as i am a gold,0.0

our family stayed here for two nights at the tail end of a trip around ireland it was exactly as described rooms are clean and modern the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the location ca be beat directly across from christchurch cathedral walking distance to temple bar trinity college and many tourist areas the room was small but comfortable we did not eat in the restaurant or bar except for the included breakfast which was fresh and convenient we would stay here again,1.0

this hotel lives up to its brand name the service is always pleasant the breakfast is great and the rooftop bar has a fabulous view all this is to be expected from a star establishment however if you do get a refurbished room the decoration is passable the pool is too small the drinks are expensive in the bar a mojito nice little shop straight on and on corner right for cheap local food go to vassilis right and follow signs,1.0
we booked this hotel as we were looking for a place to stay in athens with a swimming pool to beat the summer heat we were not disappointed it was really great the view is breathtaking on the city and the acropolis particularly for hotel is really perfect the rooftop pool is very small but refreshing all the staff is really nice although really slow on the rooftop bar the only downside is the scary neighborhood you ca really walk at night even at day always take a taxi to get there or leave but price quality is a really good value,1.0
we stayed at melia athens for night before flying out the next morning right from check in we were made to feel comfortable and welcomed the hotel was immaculate and very luxurious we were upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi the beds were extremely comfortable the curtains were completely its the small things the shower head had great water pressure and the shower base did leak even in the slightest the rooftop pool and bar were very cool and to top it all off breakfast was amazing,1.0
i seen many mixed reviews on this hotel but i have to say i quite enjoyed my stay i leave tomorrow and i honestly do want booked this back in january as a surprise for my fiancé due to it being his birthday this weekend the staff wished him a happy birthday upon giving us our room keys and even left a note in our room along with some wine and balloons picture below which was a brilliant touch the staff are friendly and are happy to help whenever and if needed our room is spacious and the bathroom doors are frosted so if you stay in this hotel and share a room i hope you comfortable with that person we were pleasantly surprised to be able to watch english channels on the tv while getting ready to go out and the are sooo comfortable too we definitely stay at this hotel again we throughly enjoyed our stay for the past nights,1.0

first off i booked this hotel on the recommendation of a tour guide on the basis it ticked all the boxes for a stag party the lads are nothing to raucous or salacious but certainly enjoy ourselves and love music the hotel in itself is clean and basic its also prepared for noise as each bed comes with earplugs but i cant fault it there it fit the my goodness the booking was a nightmare i had a deposit paid two months before our stay only to be hung up on when attempting to pay the rest of the bill in advance finally on sorting this out by having to go into the hotel a week prior to check in thankfully i work close by on check in when the other lads arrived again they were asked for more money i went to the reception and informed them that it had been paid in full using my credit card this was accepted but i was told they would have to look into it yet again leaving everything in the balance until checkout i have never stayed in such an unprofessional place that continually asks guests for money i realize they said it was a mistake fine but there was no recompense or real apology for this pretty large approx mistake but i does help the fact that they had my credit card details i could relax here tbh even if i were to be organizing another stag in dublin id,0.0
had a fantastic stay this time first came years ago we brought two of our children who now have this as one of their favourite hotels you would expect from a hotel hidden just minutes from la rambla,1.0
the hotel is a decent size building very clean and well presented the staff are unbelievably helpful nothing was any trouble all the staff went above and beyond but vassilis was a standout for us there were of us in total my family from america were unlucky enough to have a suitcase go missing from the airport but the hotel staff were non stop in trying to locate it for hotel is very well placed for the acropolis and syntagma square etc and most attractions were within walking distance the rooftop has a real wow factor when you first walk in there at night but the service seemed a bit slow for drinks as has been mentioned in previous reviews the breakfast is really good lots of variety to cater for all tastes from fruit various breads drinks etc it was a very nice experience the bedrooms were a little small but about right for a city hotel why only stars the lifts were very small hot and slow and there were only two in operation the kids were happy to use the stairs but it was a little frustrating sometimes waiting for the lifts all in all a very easy going and positive experience which i would recommend to anyone next time we are in athens i will certainly you for looking after us,1.0
we stayed here for a week following time in lisbon and porto portugal in september we were in barcelona during la merce just by chance we were unaware of this festival at the time we booked our trip a year earlier the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very nice we thoroughly enjoyed ending our day with a nightcap at the rooftop lounge view were spectacular and we loved the vibe we did eat here one evening and the food was tasty as well the one and only downfall was the hotel is over the underground train and it definitely shakes the hotel we did have to change our room after the first day or two and it was much better i have to say despite this we would definitely stay here again,1.0

if my room at this hotel was larger i would give it five stars service was highly professional yet friendly and warm breakfast was plentiful with warm and cold did not find the location to be a disadvantage it is walking distance from the exarheia neighborhood known for its artists bohemians and great restaurants at affordable is about ten minutes walk from the stations and near a beautiful museum on my last visit to athens i stayed at the posh and expensive hotel grande bretagne as it was a business trip payed by my employer sure this was better but it was not any better in terms of access to the acropolis and other tourist destinations the best western museum hotel offers very good value for money,1.0
loved my room and the fact that they read my comments on expedia so that i did have to deal with any stairs except the entrance that said the entrance is not friendly for those who struggle to walk especially with is a tram stop close by actually at either end of the block museums and great walks to enjoy,1.0

hotel is very modern and in two different buildings across the street from each other our suite was in the old bank tower the building where the duchess restaurant gym and spa are located suite was large modern and provides a nespresso coffee machine and large mini bar not mini shower was kind of modern oval capsule with great water pressure bed comfortable wonderful light lots of windows there are black out curtains porter was my favorite restaurant had breakfast there everyday and dinner twice great food and service duchess had good food service not as good as at porters roof top soaking pool fun and nice of hotel is central convenient to all tourist attractions some longer walks away than others this hotel is not too far from the train station but we took a taxi into town from schiphol airport,1.0
this hotel is a great starting point to discover all different options amsterdam offers be it culture exotic food boots trip or a tour through the famous red light reception area is typically busy and sounds like a main station personal can be nice if they want to rooms big enough breakfast is right place if you do not want to relax but experience amsterdam,1.0

aberdeen lodge is found in the sandymount district on the southern side of dublin it is on a beautiful residential street and fits right in with its impressive brick exterior but it what inside that makes this a great place to stay when visiting ireland capital visit was just for two nights upon arrival we parked our car in the parking area at the front of the lodge and did use it again until it was time to go to the airport which by the way is only about minutes away via an easy direct route we were greeted by a lovely young employee who took the time to show us maps that gave us an idea of where we were and how we could easily get into central dublin by using public transportation she was great cogent and to our room no required a hike up a few flights of stairs it was large and quite comfortable it featured a bed that was truly enormous at night we communicated by semaphore windows looked out on the backyard and beyond that you could hear bat striking ball and shouts coming from the pembroke cricket club ground and the occasional rumble of a dart train heading to or from downtown the bathroom was adequate with an average sized tub the shower was great breakfasts at aberdeen lodge were truly terrific everything was fresh including orange juice a wide variety of fruits and cereals were offered along with the option for variations,1.0

the hotel creates a fantastic atmosphere right after the entrance very good and attentive staff we enjoyed our stay immensely the room had everything needed and the bathroom was modern good and quiet ac the only disadvantage is that the room was not so quite street noise,1.0
the location of this hotel is perfect specially if you have an early morning flight and still want to live close to centre public transport is mins walk away and dam square is about minutes walk the rooms are small but that not unusual with ibis we were given interconnected rooms so we kept getting startled by voices of our neighbours the water in the vending machines is super expensive it was like euros for small bottle,1.0
i been known to winge that hotel service tends to the indifferent these days this could be less true of the spencer which has incredibly helpful competent and positive staff i do know how they manage it but we had a really wonderful stay with fantastic service from reception the bar and restaurant and the spa it really made our break and we were left feeling as if we had a luxury experience highly recommended despite the minute walk into the city centre though as a result at least you got a respite from dublin more chaotic side,1.0
where do i begin this is the most glorious location we were lucky to be there for a wedding party and stay the night in the most magical grand room i think we have ever seen which happens to be their print room wow the staff are the most helpful that we have encountered at any hotel stay the house itself is so well kept and the interior design is just glorious the atmosphere is exclusive yet personal and as a guest you are made to feel as though you are the owner of the house a true gem in the countryside of ireland we had special food requirements being vegans which the kitchen catered to perfectly and with pleasure i recommend this wholeheartedly and hope to be back soon,1.0
my first booking at this hotell great location by the end of la ramblas and the gothic quarter swift even though i arraived very early in the morning got a good clean room with a good bed,1.0
i stay in this hotel again because of the great location there was nothing really great nor nothing really bad it was just meh the room was adequate fairy clean and spacious we had problems with keeping the room cool enough but to be fair it was over degrees when we visited we had a breakfast included type of reservation and the breakfast food and presentation was very nice however the service during the breakfast which was minimally needed since it was a buffet was lacking the servers seemed overwhelmed and stressed and did not go out of their way to greet us or ask if we needed anything on one occasion i asked if they had a take away cup for my coffee what is it with europe it so weird that they do not have take away coffee and got a huffy eye roll stomp off attitude i mean a simple no i sorry we do would have been much better but that little incident aside our over all experience was pleasant sufficient to meet all our needs and we would consider staying here again just because of the convenient location,1.0
we booked our stay well before there were any reviews or pictures from guests on tripadvisor and felt we went out on short our stay was fantastic the room was cozy and equipped with anything one could hope for the breakfast buffet was very high quality and constantly kept fresh and was friendly and attentive a very special thanks to hector who upon our arrival took som extra time to mark locations of restaurants and landmarks on a map for gladly visit again some other time,1.0

loved this quaint hotel at the very top of la rambla only two minutes from playa catalunya so getting aetobus to there from the airport was so handy hotel is in an older type building but that does deter from its warmth charm and friendliness staff always kind and helpful theyd left us a bottle of cava in room on arrival and given us a decent room overlooking the patio at the back as they had promised in emails our room was a good size had a lovely bathroom a free safe and air con plus s little fridge and micro were an added bonus free buffet was a lovely touch wine beer sift drinks tea and coffee breads yoghurt fruit and a small selection of hot foods at all times was very enjoyable good breakfast for a city hotel too would definitely go back great little hotel lovely staff in excellent location,1.0
the exact hotel we expected to be staying in the king george was a beautiful old hotel it had stunning views of the acropolis from the dining room we were up graded up to a suite and it was amazing the suite was almost three rooms we could have wanted anymore space when we were there the weather was a bit on the hot side so all the windows were closed and taking pictures was somewhat inhibited also the air conditioning was not working all that well as we would have liked because of the heat they gave us a fan and everything was fine it was a fabulous hotel i would recommend it,1.0

nh really needs to change the names of their hotels in amsterdam we started at this one the nh amsterdam centre but after seeing how beat up the rooms were we moved to the nh amsterdam city centre do not make the same mistake we did there is no comparison of the hotels as the centre is a really old hotel that needs a good deal of renovation,0.0
hotel staff was very friendly we had room confusing at first to find the elevator that goes to the floor great big room with a balcony with outdoor table and chairs it was too noisy at night since we were on the floor great location,1.0

everything about our stay was top notch we arrived early morning off of a flight and the front desk recognizing that my elderly companion needed rest offered us a temporary room until our room was ready additionally the hotel lent us a wheelchair to help get around the city apparently this could be reserved with the hotel so we got lucky it was available was great as it is right across street from the park and a few blocks from grafton street also super close to the national gallery which was great,1.0
i have stayed at the grand canal a number of nights over the past year and have been pleased each time the rooms are clean staff is very helpful and attentive and the breakfast buffet or made to order is excellent the rooms are of average size and there is a comfortable chair and a desk chair in the room there is no air conditioning but they did provide a fan when we requested the hotel is a bit off the beaten path down by the grand canal but is less than a min walk to st stevens sr or even less to merrion sq i like the location as it gives me a chance to walk and see dublin vs coming out your door to a crowded scene like at some of the other more city center or temple bar locations there is an attached bar which serves good pub fare and you can get a pint of guinness or a local craft beer the prices in the pub are reasonable and their is plenty of room for a group i will continue to return to the grand canal when in dublin and look forward to my next stay,1.0

yes the hotel is a little outside central or gothic quarters but all we use it for is sleep and security it is also a cheap option to be close to the beach about a minute are limited food options around because they close the kitchens early it minibar is included which was nice however if you book the hotel via expedia or orbitz be careful to see if breakfast is included for us it was not which was a little also loan mifi out for the day at euros nice little extra if you are going to be out all day the hop on hop off bus stops at the hotel and the metro is a block out very coinvenieant,1.0
been all over the world and this is a beautiful hotel to make your base whilst in amsterdam great rooms very helpful staff amazing ambience near to all the canals min walk from the attractions and rembrandt square is walk away where all the bars and restaurants are enjoyed so much we are going back asap,1.0
we picked this hotel for its proximity to sloterdijk station to attend a festival beware it does look much from the outside but give it a chance and on the inside it got a cool relaxed admittedly very studenty vibe the decor is much like if urban outfitters decided to make a hotel there a table at your disposal and everyone gets greeted with a glass of prosecco and a smile from very efficient staff and of course one of the great things about going to a hotel used to young adults and students is that amenities are presented to you with a smile at any hint that you might need help tickets are available to buy from the desk maps info and vouchers are laid out for you the only reasons i gave this stars was because putting the room style shower on made the entire bathroom into a swimming pool which became mildly annoying and because the options for having breakfast in the morning were pretty poor tiny muffins the odd piece of fruit or a yoghurt if you came very early the rooms themselves are purely the double beds are huge and comfortable and there everything you could possibly need presented in a clean and pleasant environment however if you are people who like a luxurious hotel experience as part of your holiday this is for you thanks chaps x,1.0
this is the best hotel i ever been in the service is great reception staff especially are very welcoming friendly and knowledgeable our room was ideal well laid out well serviced and comfortable and very location suited us very well being close to heuston railway station phoenix park museum of modern art national museum kilmainham gaol guinness brewery transport to other areas is easy an excellent taxi service and luas tram service on the doorstep breakfast is an experience in itself the menu covers items,1.0
i booked a double room with a sofa bed to accomodate my family of three persons when i checked in i was told i have to make up the sofa bed myself because they were having a busy day as their reservation system was down they assured me an extra set of towels were placed in the closet when i went to my room i made up the bed as told but i found no quilt and no extra set of towels i called the reception and was shortly given a very hard tired looking blue blanket they said the blanket was a standard for the sofa bed i insisted to have a proper quilt and got it five minutes later and of course i needed to ask for towels this was the service i received from this four star room s carpet was tired the wall mounted light was flashing there was a bad smell when first entering the room these were the facilities provided by this four star hotel by the way wifi is only free for,0.0
friendly courteous professional staff more than willing to aid a weary traveler excellent rooms with great views of the river and port recommend this for anyone who want a great stay and easy access to amsterdam central trams and board cruise ships,1.0
we were recommended the hotel by an extremely fussy member of my family she was right to persuade us to room we had one of the upgraded rooms was large clean and comfortable a bonus was being able to open the and slide the external the staff from reception breakfast waiter bar staff and cleaners were all polite and was excellent not a wide range of cooked food but everything was extremely fresh loads of fruit hams and cheeses as well as cakes and other items i more used to seeing on a dessert for the roof top pool amazing well situated for buses and metro shopping centre with restaurants next to hotel make sure you walk up to the national museum of art and walk around the olympic park and criticism was the lighting system in the rooms which you almost need a degree to operate nothing wrong with a simple light switch especially in the place to stay great value,1.0
stayed nights as a couple and had a lovely stay we were originally given a room that had singles pushed together when we first arrived but a quick trip back to reception and this was quickly sorted had a great room with a massive bed good size bathroom with shower only as stated when we booked so no problem making facilities only earl grey tea though a great addition is the mini fridge in the room there are a couple of small think tesco local stores about minutes walk away so we got drinks snacks and stocked the fridge the climate control was a bit poor and i think in really hot weather it would not be very good we had it on full and had to open the window in the night as it was very stuffy staff very friendly helpful take the number tram from central station very easy to get to hotel and travel around turn right out of the hotel for some lovely restaurants,1.0
i arrived in amz after driving for days from spain with my cat in the car originally booked into another hotel only to arrive and be told that they are not pet friendly booked into the ibis round the corner and they were fabulous from the offset they could do enough to help me and they could see how tired and stressed i was from driving with the cat in the car i was there for nights and they really were so helpful and friendly i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone i ca thank them enough,1.0
stayed here for nights once we walked into reception we had a great feeling about this hotel we were too early to check in so on a recommendation of staff we went around the corner for lunch which was amazing the room was large with high ceilings massive bed and could be faulted i would definitely stay here again and will be recommending it to anyone that is thinking of staying in the location too,1.0

if you want to want to be in the city but just slightly off the beaten track then this hotel is well located airport bus to and from front dart is mins regular bus service into city centre on the door stepour family room was on the ground floor we had an issue with the shower thermostat was very sensitive and made water too hot when we raised at breakfast the issue was swiftly escalated and resolved before we had finished along with assistance to move room when we had were friendly and attentive breakfast was more than adequate and very only personal gripe was the residents bar was shut abruptly there was an exciting golf match on the tv and for what i would think as a significant hotel they were trying too quick to shut everything around those that were resident and watching and enjoying a drink the hotel has hour service and i would have expected some discretion up to at an emigrant from the city it is well located for a trip to dublin and enjoy all it has to offer,1.0
super hotel super stay location was very central mins to the beautiful vondelpark and easy walking distance from most of the main room with balcony great breakfast and very large comfy were friendly and bicycle hire for one day was a great touch and enabled us to explore the city like then paid to keep the bikes for the rest of our we return to amsterdam we definitely stay here is a small boutique hotel so it does have a lobby or a bar area this was a problem for us as there are loads of bars and restaurants close by but it could be an issue for some,1.0

my wife and i managed a birthday weekend without the kids which is a rare event so a lot was expected of this hotel making it a special time it did not disappoint the hotel had the grand touches to its decor that we wanted as a break from the ultra modern norm that we normally opt for the room was immaculate and finished to a nice standard the staff were incredibly polite and attentive the highlight for us was the location with views of parliament and the parthenon when dining on the balcony during day and by night with the parthenon illuminated as our backdrop it was quite something the food and wine was first rate also just one drawback i was surprised at was that wifi was charged for and not included in this day in age and given the price of the room that just criminal our stay was march,1.0
a small family run hotel rooms overlooking the singel canal at the front was the base for two nights in amsterdam for my daughter and self we chose a canal view room quite a good size beautifully decorated each room is i understand a different colour scheme nothing bland or neutral here the foyer lounge and library yes are just gorgeous with constant access to coffee hot chocolate and treats as well as options with water all self serve the best thing about hotel estherea is their attention to detail and willingness to accommodate their visitors needs nothing was too much trouble even though we arrived hours before time we were invited to enjoy coffee and treats while our room was made ready,1.0
i chose this hotel for its central location and it paid off it was really easy to get around the city from this spot the hotel was modern and clean and my room was well appointed and functional and we had two bags of welcome snacks the only downside was the lack of air conditioning which meant i had to sleep with the window open surprisingly the street noise was not disruptive the best part was the staff from our greeting at including free ice cream through our the temple bar team were pleasant and super helpful i definitely stay here again,1.0

we stayed here with a tour after a cruise so we did not pick the hotel the location was good short walk to plaka acropolis and transport it overlooks the park and the temple of zeus ruins which is striking the view from the on the roof partially covered is quite stunning especially at night the buffet breakfast is served there and is very good as is the service the pool area is posh and the rooms are lovely as well we had a small balcony overlooking the pool i think most do the lobby sitting areas are large and including a very inviting cozy library area a few steps up overlooking the park and front entrance if there were so much to see and do in athens i would have enjoyed sitting there reading a book or guidebook for a few hours there or at the pool the front desk staff was also pleasant and courteous although they did not let us know of a transit strike the day we left if you want to be close to the plaka and acropolis but want a more upscale hotel then this is a good choice,1.0
very pleased with our stay at the catalonia rigoletto hotel the staff were very helpful and took care of us throughout our stay the room was very nice and clean the breakfast had a good variation and everything was fresh located in a very safe area with the maria cristina metro being only a few hundred metres surely recommend should you be visiting barcelona,1.0

after a month of hotels eight in all hermes might be the very best in part the staff eva oana push my rating over the limit of stars this will be my first choice for my next trip to athens the location is perfect it is just outside the crazy plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets it takes minutes to walk to the acropolis ancient agora or the fabulous national archeological museum the rooms are solid and silent i never heard any noise from other rooms or the street the finishing is beautiful if you like polished marble bathrooms floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet breakfast food selection is great everything from the basic toasts different breads with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats there are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections the finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time for example eva knew after the first day that we had daughters she readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and i look for a table in none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four lastly someone on tripadvisor said the walk to the national museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea oana told us,1.0
the holiday in was a good night sleep the breakfast was good if simple the beds were soft and comfortable and they even gave you choices of a hard and soft was nice and clean there was even an ironing board in the only real negative of the hotel was the shuttle make sure you look at the schedule as it only comes once every half hours though the printout of our booking said it was a hour shuttle we actually had to phone at midnight for it to come at am as we sat at the airport waiting for our holiday crown plaza shuttles came three times for the carlton and another local hotel in fairness when at the hotel the schedule is posted at the front desk,1.0

floor room beds adults kids view was of other side of hotel but did not matter to us since we just used it for a place to sleep and have breakfast for the price of this hotel i was a little disappointed to find out that we had to pay upwards of per day for wifi access i sure this was listed on the website somewhere but my husband booked the room so i did not catch this before the booking either way for a night wifi should be included at no additional charge as for our overall stay we were very pleased with the staff breakfast and special attention paid to my younger son birthday a plate of chocolates were left in the room for him on his birthday,1.0

we stayed for eight nights in july the hotel is very and is beautifully designed and furnished service was also attentive friendly and helpful the bed was extremely comfortable there are a few though we often did not have hot water in our room or it took minutes of running the water before it started heating up fortunately this was in the middle of summer but it can still be uncomfortable there is not enough hooks for hanging things in the bathroom and there is no coffee or tea station in the room also housekeeping was extremely erratic and on a number of days the housekeeping only arrived late afternoon to do a combined cleaning and breakfast is very good but also very expensive the free minibar went a long way to put a smile on our faces though all in all a good experience,1.0

after a couple of great experiences at the clayton dublin airport hotel we decided to stay here in ballsbridge for a couple of nights our room was not quite as spacious as the ones we have had in dublin airport but almost everything else was spot on we enjoyed an excellent vegetarian meal in the bar the gym is very well set up and i enjoyed the virtual reality running machines the beds are super to other hotels the buffet breakfast is expensive especially if you are vegetarian but the hotel is located close to some excellent cafes where we went for a morning meal unfortunately none of these were open on the sunday morning and we circled back to the hotel where we found we could order off the menu i do know if many peolpe do this as there was a lot of confusion from our waiter the food was typical hotel breakfast food nothing bad nothing amazing other than that our experience was great and the staff in general are fantastic,1.0

stayed here for nights with my mum for my birthday honestly this place has hardly any faults we were greeted by a friendly security guard by the doors and a helpful polite multi language speaking lady who checked us in with a whole hotel smells lovely probably as a result of the spa in the room had a inch tv in it although we only had english speaking channel room service was excellent and our room was tidied up every day electric beds and air con with black out honestly me and mum felt like we were posh enough to be there the rooftop pool and decking made us feel relaxed and secluded towards the end of the holiday it did become noisy and rife with what seemed like a school trip but ca fault the hotel on that did notice no life guard or staff on the roof though which may have been spa is mainly a water experience with all kinds of different pools this was peaceful and free for guests in the mornings which was a great way for us both to start each day the buffet restaurant always seemed to be closed however we may have just missed opening hours as we were exploring the city every major fault is location me and mum love a good time and it was a while away from most lovely bars very close to the football stadium definitely visit to all staff who were extremely helpful especially our friendly,1.0
i had a three night stay in july at the tire station i took a train from the airport to lelylann via a sprinter train and then from there a tram number to surinameplein tram stop it was short walk from there to the was quick and easy via the tablet system assisted by the hotel staff i was on the third floor and was happy with my quiet double room the bed was comfortable and in the bathroom i liked the walk in shower and the shower gel provided i would have liked thicker pillows on the bed but that is a tiny issue i did miss the lack of tea and coffee making facilities as i was out all day and it was warm so i was glad of the air conditioning when i was in the kept reading about the great coffee in amsterdam before my trip which unfortunately i can not drink however i was pleased to find a variety of herbal teas on offer either in tea bags or loose leaf tea at breakfast or in sticky fingers café or in the museum cafes i liked the area the hotel is in quiet and near to the vondelpark i had intended to walk everywhere but found i did need to use the tram to save my feet a little i had an i amsterdam card so i made use of the public transport card on that which was very helpful the hotel is near two,1.0

right on the river in a bit quieter part of town there is a airlink bus stop right at hotel so makes getting in from airport a breeze also very convenient to train station if you are arriving or departing via train as we did ok the are doing some remodeling and upgrading to the hotel that i believe will be finished in dec of so just be aware if you are traveling between now and then that there might be a bit of construction but they were respectful of guests and did not begin work at first light there is a great bar with a great bar menu they even fixed us a pizza that was not listed for my picky eaters good coffee and breakfast bar and full restaurant situated right on the river and a quick walk to most activities trinity college temple bar folks dublin is a major city there is noise around at night cars but was the same you would find any big city here is why this hotel ranks high in our opinion the staff and management top notch friendly helpful stored our bags for us twice gave great advice and directions answered questions and tried to help the confused americans figure out the power converters i actually blew a fuse on the floor once they were right up to fix it when the construction ends this year this will be a top notch dublin hotel would stay there again in an second,1.0

we stayed here for one night we were very disappointed in the hotel and staff at arrival with the car we saw a lot of alcoholics around the hotel not the thing you like to see with a small child the lady at the reception was so ignorant i could believe it i asked when i booked the room for a cot but there was no cot in the room when my husband went down to reception to ask for one it was such a big deal to get one for us we had a room to the back of the hotel and it was so loud from all the people outside and also music and also the smell from cigarette smoke from the outside of the pup was unreal all i say i will never again stay in this hotel,0.0
after just completing our first trip to dublin we ca say enough wonderful things about not only the fitzwilliam hotel but it staff prior to arrival concierge was extremely accommodating with planning airport transportation providing restaurant recommendations etc upon arrival they were friendly and warm and continued this way for the entire week we were visiting they provided amazing restaurant recommendations ex fade street social hatch sons great irish pubs ex macs and must sees in dublin many off of the beaten path and avoiding the tourist traps ex temple bar they also recommended and arranged for a great round of golf at royal dublin and suggested checking out malahide castle and getting lunch in howth all on the coast and wonderful we ca say enough great things about this hotel or it staff especially dane and vicktor we ca wait to return,1.0
where do i start there is so much to say about this hotel right in the heart of barcelona at placa de catalunya it could not be more central for many metro and bus links to other parts of the city the hotel is so tastefully furnished and decorated very unusual and unique the double rooms are small but fantastically equipped with an espresso machine and a kettle in the cupboard for tea drinkers like me safe iron and board made use of the fridge in the room but like many people bought our own wine etc to enjoy in the evening on the balcony our room was to the front with a small balcony that had a great view over placa de catalunya not noisy at all when doors closed welcoming complimentary bottle of red wine delivered on our night was greatly appreciated along with chocs then truffles each night for the rest of our stay were delivered to our room such a lovely treat spacious shower with an additional hand held one which was a fantastically useful gorgeous complimentary toiletries with everything you could possibly need in the event you forget anything hairdryer robes and slippers too towels and beds changed daily room was immaculate did watch much tv but radio had an ipod docking station that was handy to listen to our own playlists now to the breakfasts wow what a choice and so beautifully presented too eggs cooked to your choice with plenty of hot sides,1.0
i am a silver member so the day before online to make sure i get a room away from the tram if you get the wrong room here it is incredibly noisy my room was very quiet and the bed comfortable the lighting in the room is not bad for a business hotel the breakfast is comprehensive and very tasty with good bakery selection staff are pleasant and helpful,1.0
i stayed nights in the hotel with my sister everything was clean and we were sent to the room right away without waiting the hotel staff was very nice and very helpful all the time the noise can travel through walls so if you have noisy neighbors it will be a slight inconvenience the location of the hotel was not ideal a little too far from anything to walk the closest metro station was a min walk and if you take the bus from the station right in front of the hotel you will have to change the bus line at a few stops before getting to any major than that the hotel was fine,1.0
very good location at an area with a long beach strip of km the beach is a wide sandy type and close to the hotel there are plenty of restaurants the rooms are clean with modern equipment wooden floor and a good bed the airco is a little noisy and the tv doesn t have any english news channels on my room was overlooking the and behind that the beach other than that the room was pleasant they have a huge garden with a reasonable pool and area to relax and get drinks you can go to the beach by exiting the garden the breakfast is of a good level mostly self service beware of the wooden structure above part of the buffet i am tall and banged my head on it the service in the afternoon was rather slow there isn t a lot of staff and they weren t very alert it took me half an hour to get a beer,1.0

did want to pay the ridiculously high rates for accommodation in amsterdam central so looked volkshotel which was reasonably priced and a train ride away there are trains headed to central so literally a train arrives every few minutes it was so close to main points of interest that you could easy ride there as first glance there did seem to be too much else in the area but you be able to find several places to eat as well as the occasional coffee shop all a short walk or an even shorter bike ride away when i was there they just opened a supermarket almost next rooms are massive but comfortable enough for people modern styled and very clean in a way though it a hotel of sorts so do expect the bells and whistles like a fridge branded amenities or even an in room telephone there is a tv with plenty of channels as well as a safe the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful they made the stay there that much overall vibe of the hotel is very young hip and happening with guests mainly on the younger would recommend this place to a friend and i would definitely stay there again if i was in amsterdam if you are a couple looking to explore amsterdam and are looking for a cost effective base to see the sights volkshotel is ideal,1.0

stayed for three nights in july before heading down to benicassim festival and could fault the location right outside the metro station and casa battló if you after some gaudi sightseeing room was plenty spacious although they did mention that some could be quite small and the bed was large and really comfortable the shower was a particular highlight as much as a shower can be we did try the breakfast you in a lovely neighbourhood of barcelona and there are plenty of places nearby to get a cheaper meal free water and sangria in the mini bar was a nice touch wholly recommended and we definitely stay again,1.0
after doing on line check in on arrival on a hot day i had a room with no air con not feeling very well i asked the front desk if they could change room the lady apologised and moved me room the room was very clean and ideal the building work did impact as it is during day time location for work is great this is much better hotel than the sister doubletree hotel by miles and in a better location breakfast i was surprised as normally breakfasts in garden inns are not great this was very good,0.0

the hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants it also quite close to the zoo a bit further than the nearest metro station there is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the aquarium nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty large room for the rest of town we had to use the metro which means x to walk the line close by is not really well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere the view well if you see the sea it ok the sunrise was quite orange some of the buldings nearby look however depressing,1.0
a wonderful grand dame of a hotel centrally locate perfect for a quick overnight in athens so you will see everything even if you only look out your window the rooftop bar and restaurant is fantastic the downstairs bar and lounge is comfortable and reminiscent of new york plaza hotel everything is pricey for greek standards but on par or cheaper than other major capitals definitely worth a stay at least once,1.0

stayed here for just midweek evening thankfully we booked rooms and were given neighbouring rooms on the floor overlooking the check in my key card refused to work for my room i went back down for them to reactivate it and climbed back up the stairs this happened three times before i could get in to the room it looked pleasant enough upon entering but there was a lot of noise from the busy road out front so i went to shut the window only it was open that genuinely just the noise you have to put up with through the paper thin window hopefully you are not a light sleeper like i from there it all went down hill my bedside lamp did work the socket by the bed had something snapped inside there was something under the radiator which i hoped was just an old malteser that had been missed when the room was supposedly cleaned the bathroom was also very tired looking the soap tray under the shower was only just hanging on to the the plus side the bed was comfortable and linen and towels were clean the bar downstairs has a superb interior and great it a great location but at the end of the day i expect a good night sleep from any hotel the other mishaps only added to my annoyance from lack of sleep and given the price of these rooms i not even the slightest bit tempted to review at more,0.0
good location about minute walk to the main area lots of good bars and places to eat around here also peaceful the hotel staff were all friendly the room was kept spotless the whole time we were there week the breakfast was good and lots of it also served to which was great after a late night but as a few people have said some days its was stone cold unfortunately our last morning was one of them the minibar wasnt replenished every day but just spoke with reception and they had water sent up within minutes the noise from other rooms was a bit of an issue though constantly heard people walking above us maybe giving out soft slippers and requesting guests not to wear shoes until going out door would be a good idea big bonus though was that the air con and safe were free all in all though a good clean hotel with a fantastic roof terrace to laze out on after loads of walking around a amazing city,1.0
not being an expert in athens this hotel is located in the richest area of athens with loads of restaurants nearby and in a peaceful area the rooms are fresh the beds are super comfortable and there are housekeeping ladies around everywhere resulting in the cleanest hotel ever nice touch is the free drinks and bites section which has wide choice and is completely free nice lounging area on the ground floor everything seems to be brand new and extremely well maintained,1.0
we went to eat at plasshola the food was terrific then we had a drink at the rooftop bar the view from there is spectacular and the ambiance and service is great we found that luis the former head bartender of the delano in miami now lives in barcelona and works at this beautiful place i strongly recommended to anyone that comes to barcelona,1.0
nice clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff my sister arrived early and they checked her in before the official time which allowed her to explore for a few extra hours the hotel is close to attractions and walking distance to the beach,1.0
we stopped for nights days and the hotel was fantastic either a walk down the river or an easy stop tram ride to the centre the room was clean and spacious with a bed the staff were all really friend and the reception very helpful and always smiling but to top all this was the breakfast one of the best breakfast menus i have seen even down to a pancake making our trip thank you and see you again soon,1.0

i spent one at the gallery hotel before getting on a cruise i found the hotel to be quite comfortable and staff to be friendly and helpful when i went down to late in the day to catch the cruise line rep to ask about the next day transfer the guy at the desk had all the answers i needed room economy roomthings i loved comfy free breakfast great toiletry kit though i would have loved the addition of a lots of outlet decently priced room service free slippers free welcome bottle of for putting your own drinkswhat could have been better a box of tissues was not in the the room i was in had no hotel info so i did know what was available to me ie restaurants spa services etc the location is ok not the best but not bad either main tourist sites are not as close as the brochure says though you can still walk to more than a few including sagrada no view at all at least not for my room in fact when i looked out my window i could see directly into other people rooms which of course means they could see into mine,1.0
i stayed here with my family since there were children i asked for connecting rooms the hotel provided the rooms exactly as i location was also very good all major attractions were within min walking conceirge provided me plenty of information to go around my children also loved the way it general my family would come back to this hotel next time,1.0
the hotel mainly conference geared but as a family we did not fell that large lobby is welcoming and the staff were all great rooms a little dated but very clean and spacious food and snacks are pricy by comparison to almost anywhere in athens pool was the real clincher as it offered a rest from the plus degrees temperatures of the city euros gets you the acropolis in about as many minutes,1.0
good location and very friendly staff they have a restaurant and a bar the lobby was inviting and nice to sit in the price was good and the room was very nice we were able to store our luggage since we arrived very early from a cruise the room was ready when promised,1.0
the hotel location is absolutely perfect only a stone throw from local pubs restaurants and the larger tourist spots being that the hotel is on the main street there is a bit of noise but with the windows closed we did hear anyone else they also provide ear plugs in each room if you a light sleeper the hotel staff was very helpful getting us a cab at an unpopular hour to catch our flight and they gave us great recommendations and suggestions during our short stay the facilities and rooms were immaculate and provided ample room for our belongings i absolutely stay here again,1.0

my husband and i had been doing some traveling prior to our stay at this hotel once we got to our room we felt like we were returning to the comforts of home the bed had a full mattress with no splits the decor was modern and super clean the bathroom had a tub and lovely tile the air conditioning worked well highly recommend,1.0
this ranks as one of the biggest travel disappointments of my travel experiences i travel extensively and know what grand elegant service is like may have been a destination hotel in the nineteenth century but now it is tired stuffy dark dreary and flat from the poor food on the outdoor terrace to the roaches in our bathroom nothing about this is experience has a silver lining the woman at the bar acted like this was the last place she wanted to be even the housekeeping staff dropped the ball as towels were not refreshed and soaps not replenished when you add on top of this nose bleed prices it is time to retire this property the heineken family should know there is no fizz left in the bottle run do walk away for amsterdam has much better alternatives,0.0
before dublin prices rocketed i used to stay in the shelbourne but the room price now well out of reach so looked around and found stauntons it like a mini shelbourne quaint but spotlessly clean location just as good no long walks or lifts necessary and room is a minute from the front desk ca fault it completely recommend for business or pleasure trips,1.0
in the perfect spot to access all aspects of barcelona we could walk bike and tour and then return to the rooftop pool for a dip in the afternoon the staff was gracious and welcoming of both me as well as my daughter wonderful visit,1.0
the hotel is in a beautiful spot in barcelona next to the arena mall there are cafe and restaurants in the area but i totally recommend the hotel breakfast which is fantastic and varied the room i would advise you to stay in is you will thank me later the swimming pool is on the floor and it magnificent the hotel staff is wonderful and helpful especially alex we are here for nights but we will be back,1.0
my husband and daughter and i loved our three nights here in july when importantly the air conditioning functioned perfectly rooms are small but that is not important to us beds are very comfortable and rooms are quiet and immaculate bakery is terrific breakfast good staff personable and efficient and we loved the international atmosphere several different languages spoken at breakfast and many young people with backpacks as well as older people like us great location too and be sure to pick up some turrón at the shop in the casa pedrera a couple of blocks away the hotel will reserve a van to the airport for you if you like but it would also be easy to hail a taxi on the passeig de gracia a couple of blocks away on a more individual note i must again express my appreciation for the hotel kindness in allowing us a credit for the nonrefundable stay we had booked for march and were unable to use because of illness we would stay again at the hotel praktik bakery and would recommend it to anyone in a minute,1.0
from the entrance the doorman the front desk warm welcome from danielle she gave us a beautiful room we love it clean and quiet and comfortable bed the amazing staff when we have our buffet breakfast rosanna marilen aida hazel jocelyn and maureen always made sure we are taken care of we stayed for three nights and always the same fabulous experience,1.0

although amsterdam is easy to navigate by foot this location was terrific it is close to the train station and tram lines the rooms are unique at least in the part where we stayed it appears that they have bought and renovated old houses and they have done a terrific job there are lots of restaurants very close the staff were also terrific and helped us with directions restaurant suggestions and tickets to museums,1.0
i stayed for only one night upon landing in europe on my way to utrecht had the smallest bedroom which was indeed small but was excellent for one and would have worked for two i do travel with heavy luggage so walked from the train station checked out canals on the way breakfast was excellent so was staff very kind and helpful,1.0
after weeks of intense we decided to splurge a little on some comfort and we were not disappointed golden age hotel had all the necessary amenities they had great food available through room service the greek salad and chicken fillets were oily but tasty the hotel was above and beyond but it was very well equipped and staffed and what was needed for rest and comfort there were some instances that we had issues with the wifi but the front desk was quick to assist however possible successfully the hotel is about a minute walk from all the major attractions such as the acropolis museum etc or a minute uber ride away during the time we were there we found uber to be much more affordable than the local taxis using an uber to travel to the airport or just outside uber should be driving directly into the airport will save you some addition the hotel staff member olympia who came to clean our room was incredibly friendly she had the most vibrant personality and was always happy to help teach us greek and make us feel welcomed kostas at the front desk was also incredibly kind overall a very positive experience,1.0
we were supposed to stay at the hotel but they were having problems with their plumbing systems so we were upgraded and directed to their sister hotel the barcelona universal which was approx metres from the this hotel was on the main road and quite impressive the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and we had help with our suitcases to our room the room was very large and airy and quiet the bathroom a decent size and the beds were extremely restaurant was more like a bistro the menu was not very large but the food was very tasty and i would recommend the steaks the best i have had in a long time the service was quick and the staff very would most certainly recommend this hotel and if i go to barcelona i would book at this hotel again,1.0
location location and location ca be better rooms are nice and clean staff the greatest best ambience with rooftop always busy spa and gym are also a plus both excelent with good staff i worked out every day and used a personal trainer who was very competent and professional too excellent massages at the spa,1.0
the renaissance amsterdam does what it says it gon na do the hotel is super design is very nice modern efficient the rooms are clean but low water pressure in the shower and the sink extremely slow was above average nice of the staff very friendly especially the a bit generic but that exactly what we a warning it is heavily used by american tour groups so it can get quite chaotic in the lobby and at breakfast,1.0
i love this place just as well i had not paid for breakfast as i was generally sleeping to late in the morning this was the comfiest quietist and darkest room i have ever had the pleasure to sleep in i loved the vintage feel and would argue that it should never be updated our suite was the perfect size and offered us a comfy environment for a week of relaxation i am already planning another week at the davenport,1.0
ibis amsterdam centre is just beside amsterdam centraal station and the perfect place to start exploring this amazing city city sight seeing bus and canal cruise is just in front of the hotel hotel is in a walking distance to explore red light area famous dam square the hotel is in a lively place with tourist coming from centraal station every moment hotel room is very tiny however it has all the modern amenities this hotel is pretty big breakfast is served in the floor of the hotel with lots of delicious items check in and check out was pretty quick and the behaviour of the staffs are excellent truly professional and helpful staff stayed here for nights in july,1.0
ava hotel was recommended to us by our friend and trade partner photis and it lived up to every expectation boutique fresh trendy new rooms great breakfast that bread was just yum close to all the major sightseeing and the old city acropolis shopping everything was either within walking distance or a short hop,1.0
i stayed with a friend for two nights at i had to leave a deposit on my credit card and was promised this would be returned upon checkout this has happened and the security deposit is still showing on my account some seven days later i have tried calling the hotel without success and to be honest i should be having to call them at my expense in the first place the other issue was the cleanliness was poor the carpet was dirty as was the bathroom the last issue was the fact on our last day one of the clean towels left in the bathroom had a brown this hotel is not recommended unless there is nowhere else to stay,0.0
electra metropolis is an elegant and beautifully decorated hotel in the centre of athens the rooftop view of athens is spectacular and the glass pool is impressive the high point of our stay was our delicious dinner that was served at the restaurant overlooking the acropolis truly breathtaking we will definitely return,1.0
we booked this as a top secret hotel on it was supposed to be a hotel we thought we pay a bit extra to treat ourselves and were really looking forward to our holiday in barcelona the hotel staff was quite friendly however the room was a tiny dingy cupboard there was no ceiling lighting in the room as there was only one free power point we had to unplug one of the bedside lamps if we needed to charge more than one thing which plunged the room into near darkness the wardrobe was also so small that only one of us could unpack the luggage for our week long trip when we arrived the safe was working because the batteries were run down we asked to have them replaced but they used such cheap batteries that it continued with low battery warning very very disappointed this is definitely not a hotel,0.0
dirty hotel our never the room got cleaned the hotel is under constrution and they just push everybody in an ugly next door block that is in a small alley is all improvised the rooms have nothing to do with the pictures they show in the web page or,0.0

the hotel was very cheap as dublin goes the service left a lot to be desired i stayed twice in june i felt both times with different receptionists that my arrival was an interruption the room was comfortable and clean the bathroom ont eh second occasion needed work,1.0
overall very good experience they keep the public areas spotless however there are some things you need to know the restaurant is quite expensive i elected to not have any meals there at all there are so many options close to the hotel another thing you need to know is that they block the elevator from going to where the is located until it is not a pool but a large jacuzzi that is kept very clean and it is refreshing but it is shallow in addition there were several times that they had not opened it until i called them myself to remind them to unlock it for guests to use why is that this was at plus there is an additional code on a keypad you have to enter which is fine but they changed the code during my stay and i was not aware of that because they had not informed me and they said they would have the maintenance look at it well the staff person did even know that the code had changed themselves that wasted a day for me not fun the in my room was not good either bummer the finally was fixed after days of complaining about it my key malfunctioned times over days and they finally issued me a new one but not until i really pressed them ok so why would i return because of the staff like victor who was excellent and raquel who is concierge she personally got,1.0
ideal location close to parks excellent restaurants and a minute walk to grafton real find superb rooms professional staff my only gripe that because of the bh is was a little pricey,1.0
stayed here before our cruise very easy to travel here from airport we took the metro from the airport to a syntagma swuare and it was less than a block walk to the hotel which is across from the national gardens excellent and varied breakfast buffet the room was nicely appointed although we were out most of the day go up on the roof at night for an excellent view of the acropolis and a parliament building this would make a great restaurant area not sure why it has to been developed it appears to be used for nothing,1.0

i stayed here in july while in amsterdam the location of the hotel is great it is within walking distance to almost everything the staff was helpful and attentive the room was clean in my opinion the finishes in the room were a little below what i would expect from a star hotel or a renaissance hotel in the us but it was too big of a deal and the made up for executive lounge was well maintained and served a good variety of food throughout the in all a good stay,1.0
the hotel offers really good value for money clean and modern with an amazing rooftop with acropolis view our dinner was i felt the breakfast room felt like a cafeteria at a hospital the breakfast was ok but not great the location is ok its in a bit of a dodgy area but walking distance to major sights,1.0

my wife and i spent the first of our european trip at the morgan our cab driver brought us to the morgan straight from the airport we were tired when we arrived and were happy to learn from the front desk person that our room was available for early we brought our pieces of luggage with us onto the lift and went to our room to freshen up the room was very tiny basically enough room for our double bed there was no ac but luckily a fan which would come in handy later the bath was even smaller with a shower so small i almost needed to stand at attention while inside the room did have a closet area and nightstand and a wall mounted tv one other quirk was the power in the room my phone needed charging desperately and i plugged it in mid day and again overnight it only charged from to i thought perhaps something was wrong with my phone but when we picked up a car during our second day and plugged the phone in it charged normally not sure if it was just the room or the whole hotel but that was definitely strange i have seen pictures of other rooms in this hotel that look great so i think we just happened to get stuck with one of their the good news the hotel is located right in bustling temple bar a fun place to be for dinner and nightlife in dublin,0.0

we booked into the hotel estherea in amsterdam at the start of a long european adventure it was pricey but so worth it first of all on checking in we were informed we were being upgraded to a superior room which turned out to be a room what a pleasure to open the curtains in the morning to look out on the singel canal with its canal boats tied up below one abiding memory of this hotel is the decor completely over the top but it works our room was like a tropical pleasure garden all yellow green and orange the bathroom was tiny but functional the staff were pleasant and best thing was the hotel proximity to the entertainment shopping and restaurant area as well as easy access to the main attractions and the railway heartily recommend hotel estherea for an enjoyable stay in amsterdam,1.0

even in good hotels i usually find some little niggly detail that was quite right but i can honestly say this hotel was faultless we flew into dublin early and taxied to the hotel arriving expecting to bag check but we were able to check in immediately and access our room the hotel must be very new it was spotless and everything felt new and fresh the outlook was good the facilities were good we did have breakfast there so ca comment on that but there was a great café yards away it is a little bit further out of the city centre but we walked in about minutes or a cab would take no time the staff were helpful and friendly room spacious bathroom really gorgeous with big shower and a bath facilities and a fridge good storage space just all perfect,1.0

had a tour around trinity college campus by one of the students who had only done one tour but she was excellent very enthusiastic and knowledgeable was very interesting to look around and the personable experiences bought i to life of living on campus and the history behind the different buildings however the queue for bok of kells was quite long and was rather disappointing in the end,1.0
nice comfortable hotel we had rooms facing the street but it was still quiet note that some rooms do not have exterior windows but are located within the building the bar is the best part of the hotel great drinks and service good breakfast selection easy walking distance to shops etc,1.0

the team have a serious communication the service at the restaurant it terrible night a random person enter our room at it was another guest that mistook the door the explanation of the hotel was that an error in the system allowed for a few minutes any card access to any door other day when i closed the room door a piece of roof ventilation whole felt down thanks good i closed door from inside otherwise it would break my head when you have any issue that you want to report to the manager it really dificultades to reach him not serious for a star hotel,0.0
stayed here for nights july upon arrival check in was busy and slight trouble finding our booking think this was due to a name change we was given any information about the area or a map after checking into our room which was very nice we went out after asking at reception for a map they still failed to give any information or mark on the map where the hotel was which would have been very helpful we found the bus stop right outside and found that the bus number takes you to the shopping area and to the las ramblas last bus stop to get off at and it costs each it also easy to get a taxi and the metro stop is across the road from the hotel upon returning to the hotel in the evening we enjoyed a drink in the nice bar area then went to our room the guests staying opposite to our room were unfortunately very noisey slamming doors and screaming other guests were coming out to them and the hotel staff did tell them but this did continue for some time no consideration for the other guests staying in the hotel totally unacceptable behaviour the beds were comfortable the rooms were comfortable and clean there is free wifi housekeeping provided a good service the buffet breakfast provided a good choice on our last day we did have time to go out so we used the rooftop pool on the th floor there was,1.0
when the best thing you can say about the hotel is that you liked the front desk staff know it not great truly the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional we booked an eight day greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through italy for weeks through an aegean travel agency we had two nights in athens before heading to sifnos and serifos islands and then one night in athens again before ending our trip we were picked up at the airport and transferred to hotel economy by a great taxi driver i guess we should have known by the hotel name what kind of place it would be first of all it basically in the red light district as i would call it there are therese two minutes in any direction the hotel is very dated the beds are hard and the pillows are harder the bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind they could use plastic shower curtains you flood the bathroom when you shower thank goodness for drains in the floor you have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs actually sort of handy the refrigerator does work when you leave the room it connected to the key so there no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour it very noisy outside as well as above you the continental breakfast starts ta that late if you from the us it a pretty,1.0
we liked the hotel it not very big but cosy and comfortable the location is ce we could walk to the coast zoo aquivarium the cuisine is nice the personnel is polite the rooms have all necesessary things,1.0
stayed at adams hotel for nights early july were a family of adults and teenagers really know what to expect as it was a cheaper hotel but was disappointed the rooms though simple and basic were clean and perfectly adequate for our needs had a family room bedrooms actually on the first floor no views of the acropolis from our room but we did have a small balcony and the view of acropolis and surrounding area from the rooftop terrace was fantastic location was perfect right in the centre of plaka but off the main strip so was very quiet easy walking distance to everything all the sights and great cafes and restaurants almost at your doorstep would stay again and would recommend to anyone looking for a well located budget hotel,1.0
the hotel is very clean and the rooms are quiet without sound from other rooms the reception staff members are friendly and professional with excellent english the other staff are also pleasant and breakfast has a good variety of food and hot and cold drinks the hotel is in a central secure location the lockers for luggage storage are very useful,1.0
my wife and stayed here last weekend while in dublin this was an amazing hotel and we both have no reservations in giving it the full five stars prior to arriving we got a bit lost and adam was most helpful over the phone in redirecting us adam was also very helpful and polite upon checkout too during our conversation he informed us that he was a newer member of staff having only been there a few months this did show and he is a credit to the hotel once we arrived we were greeted by luke who was professional and welcoming he could have done enough to help us for example we were very early check in is from and we arrived at but he managed to get us an early and a great room which in essence he had no obligation to thanks for this luke the hotel is amazing plenty of parking spaces if you are driving as we did we hired a car from the airport and good facilities the outside face of the building looks original authentic and simply stunning while the decor inside the hotel is equally as impressive as you enter the hotel you are greeted by knights in shining armour medieval type decor and a beautiful fireplace where we later sat by to who a delicious and gratuitously afternoon tea the rooms are also beautiful the bed was extremely comfortable and we liked the facilities such as the smart television in the,1.0
a clean and comfortable hotel maybe a little bit out of the heart of athens but in the evening it took half an hour to arrive from the airport and all around there are some taverna and restaurants with some typical greek food with convenient pricedefinitely i would advise this hotel to people traveling for business,1.0
me my mum and my daughter stayed here for nights and really enjoyed our stay the hotel was a handy location by local transport sights and the staff were friendly and helpful our room was lovely spacious and clean there was always plenty of clean towels in the bathroom toiletries and a hairdryer was provided the breakfast was plentiful and yummy as was was the food we tasted from the restaurant and bar the upstairs roof top terrace with bar and pool was a lovely space and we ended up spending a lot more time there than originally planned although only a small pool a lovely extra for a city hotel on checking in and checking out the hotel staff allowed us to check our bags into their luggage room so we could enjoy every moment of our holiday had a lovely holiday and would definitely book into this hotel again if we barcelona,1.0
great place to base yourself for a city break in barcelona we had a lovely time there and enjoyed the friendly relaxed attitude of the staff i so want to steal the pillows they are even more comfortable than mine at home,1.0
the hotel belonged to several different chains over the last couple of years at the beginning of this year it has changed to starwood properties and is classified as design hotel i admit that i would have expected something different for a design hotel of course every hotel has a certain design but the denomination as well as the branding starwood uses for design makes guests consider this type of hotels is very modern and stylish the interior of the newly renovated rooms is nice and the rooms are comfortable especially the beds allow for a good night sleep however i would not have necessarily thought of design hotel when seeing the interior please don t be shocked when approaching the hotel the exterior looks not very accommodating but inside you have very nice areas you could read already from other reviews that the lobby area is currently undergoing some change so there is construction going on i have however not been disturbed by this in my room i had a very pleasant harbour view which i enjoyed very much the breakfast buffet is nice and the breakfast area is arranged nicely different from other hotels in a more winter garden from the other reviews staff has received differing ratings i was accommodated very nicely and very pleasantly by all staff members who passed my way i needed to buy flowers for a certain occasion one morning at a fairly early hour and i was helped tremendously by the staff,1.0

stayed here one night and was impressed with their service the kind of service marriott was always known for we been disappointed with other properties the last few years this one stood out for its employees and the very pleasant room clearly they train their employees well the location is very central an easy walk to much of what the city has to offer had a problem with the bill when we checked out but it seems to have been handled quite seamlessly,1.0
lovely relaxed stay in quiet strategic location and spotless fitness fanatics it is adjacent to the serene herbert park which is an added polite and friendly and will certainly continue to have it as our go to hotel in dublin,1.0
this hotel is one of our favourites when over visiting dublin business and pleasure staff are very courteous and go out of their way to make one feel welcome rooms are very comfortable clean and provide all the necessities for a welcoming overnight stay room service was efficient and food reasonably priced for dublin city centre,1.0
we are very picky travelers and prior to our arrival to athens we were very worry about staying at this hotel since it is not the peninsula or mandarin oriental or four seasons but we really wanted to go to athens and we booked the hotel late and did not have many choices we are so impressed by the outstanding service cleanness and comfort of this hotel great location i definitely will come back to athens and to this hotel,1.0

having booked this hotel following flattering reviews on tripadvisor six months before we found to our surprise that the hotel was being refurbished when we booked in we had to change rooms three times during our stay because there were certain aspects of the accommodation that were unsatisfactory however the manager alex taranilla and his team dealt with all aspects our complaints in a truly professional manner bearing in mind that this place is being refurbishedthis place has a lot of good things going for it it is located near all the famous sights within to minutes of walking distance the breakfast served by the hotel is truly remarkable in that it caters for all different types of dietary requirements one can also hire bikes for free to tour the cityone thing that is truly remarkable is the management and his team who are kind and considerate and very accommodating to our heartfelt thanks to alex and his teami will certainly stay at this hotel againkind regardstushar trivedi,1.0

so many reviewers extolled the location of the arlington hotel in dublin that i be remiss to go on except wow it really was so easy to walk and grab the streetcar a block away that said the room was not the most luxurious i ever seen and i was glad for that it was clean quiet and comfortable maid service was good bathroom was quite spacious and nice and the front desk folks were courteous if it a busy place but if value and location are tops and you do want squick i would think twice about recommending this hotel and the irish facility was fun do check out govinda vegan restaurant a block away,1.0
not normally something i do as i believe that people have off days but i just had to comment on my recent stay at w hotels as i found the following to be causes of checked into the hotel from another hotel in the city as we changed our flights and wanted something a bit more in keeping with what we re used to and decided to book at the hotel at and went directly to the floor for check in we were advised that the room would be ready shortly and that they could take our bags and would be returned to us upon to the room and that they would contact us directly by text to advise the room s availability it came to and we had still not been contacts so we went through to reception where they d my payment card even though i had already provided full for recommendations of lunch and was given a suggestion of the focaccia dip and the spicy tomatoes the tomatoes were lovely but the focaccia was burnt and then asked about the spa facilities in the hotel and were advised that they were indeed closed for the day due to unforeseen being a guest at hotel de lerope in amsterdam i decided to visit w as it was a more modern hotel and thought that it would have a younger and more feel to it but this did not live up to the calling reception times over the period,0.0
a modern and comfortable hotel within easy walking distance of the main city bed was the best hotel i had staff were very friendly and catalonian restaurant across the street good value and a good hotel,1.0
after weeks of intense we decided to splurge a little on some comfort and we were not disappointed golden age hotel had all the necessary amenities they had great food available through room service the greek salad and chicken fillets were oily but tasty the hotel was above and beyond but it was very well equipped and staffed and what was needed for rest and comfort there were some instances that we had issues with the wifi but the front desk was quick to assist however possible successfully the hotel is about a minute walk from all the major attractions such as the acropolis museum etc or a minute uber ride away during the time we were there we found uber to be much more affordable than the local taxis using an uber to travel to the airport or just outside uber should be driving directly into the airport will save you some addition the hotel staff member olympia who came to clean our room was incredibly friendly she had the most vibrant personality and was always happy to help teach us greek and make us feel welcomed kostas at the front desk was also incredibly kind overall a very positive experience,1.0
we had stayed at the sister hotel to this one but went here for dinner i ca say enough about how wonderful the food here was they had a wide selection go dinners which included vegetarian as well as fish and meats this will not be a cheap dinner but again the food was great the views of the acropolis exceeded even the food make sure to call for reservations,1.0
ashling hotel in dublin was a nice place to stay during the vacation the hotel is not located in the best possible place but you can relatively easily walk to the city center approx kilometres is very near the zoo and beautiful phoenix can warmly recommend the full irish breakfast buffet person family room was good for four persons and the room was well cleaned every personnel in the reception was very helpful while i needed to visit a physician and to get some advice the only thing that i was missing was the gym fitness could i visit this hotel again yes definitely with the good memories of tasty breakfast,1.0
i had a fabulous two night trip to the linden hotel amazing hotel fabulous staff and sweets on reception what more could you want seriously this is a great location nice and quiet but very close to the centre and stop with lovely room decoration and accessories,1.0
before booking i read all of the most recent reviews and knew what to expect noting the noise comments i emailed the manager in march months before our visit and requested rooms in the back of the hotel i included pictures of the emails in this review upon arrival with email in hand i was told by the manager that an email stating that rooms have been allocated does not mean they are guaranteed i was very disappointed in this misrepresentation of a management statement the accommodations were basic as expected we did not sleep well as a result of the street noise and the flat pillows i did use earplugs and i would suggest doing so it may save your sanity the room and bathroom was clean bring your own soap theirs is low quality we did enjoy the breakfast before heading out for the day it is a buffet and we found the price to be the same as surrounding restaurants serving a regular breakfast,1.0
larissa metro train station is metres away the room was clean the pool on the top deck is a bonus only negative is that breakfast is basic and the bread on both mornings was stale reasonable value so no real complaints,1.0
lovely clean hotel in a great location only a short can away from the hustle and bustle quiet in evening is a hotel for mostly gay couples but me and my friend were welcomed and felt very comfortable very good rooms,1.0
the moment you walk into this hotel you feel like you in a high end boutique hotel and the lady at the front desk was lovely and helpful with a quick check in the location is super convenient mins walk from where the aerobus stop in placa catalunya and tons of restaurants and bars are nearby our room was large and super comfortable and clean after a long overnight flight from toronto the shower with excellent water pressure and lots of hot water was a nice welcome after walking the streets of barcelona in the summer heat the powerful ac was always nice to come home to the lobby has a beautiful white staircase with some cool art that is instagram worthy overall a great stay,1.0
reasonably priced hotel in a great location just off ermou near sintagmamany options on the nice breakfast buffet but they do start until am which is a problem when you have early flightsstaff are all pleasantmany options for dining within a short walkthe rooms here are small and could do with some modernisation and revamped bathroomsin house caffe has reasonable meals at good prices tooin room mini bar and safe were handywalls are very thin and neighbours were making a porno with a goat i think overall would i stay here again yeswould i recommend to my parents and friends yesnot quite the star i used to but it served the purpose,1.0
the hotel is in a very convenient location close to rocafort metro station which provides great connections to the city and is directly next to a large and supermarket however make sure you check the opening times as we were surprised by what we considered quite an early close reception is open hours per day as the hotel does seem to be aimed more at business had one of the most basic rooms available and whilst it was comfortable the kitchenette was so small as to be impractical for cooking anything more than an omelette the room itself lacked natural light with only two small windows and there were enough hangers in the wardrobes to be realistically useful the bathroom was stylish with a surprisingly large shower everything was very clean and the room was with a tv and a nespresso machine,1.0
the hotel is located in the quiet residential part of barcelona which is a huge positive and within walking distance to the are several markets near for your basic purchases of water and snacks the room also has a mini fridge which worked out perfectly for us it was a pleasant stay with clean rooms and excellent housekeeping but it is a budget hotel so if you are looking for luxury this is the place for you,1.0

the hotel is of a high standard rooms are small but very comfortable and equipped to a very good standard excellent breakfast with high level service the internet works well in all parts of the hotel the hotel location is excellent and the surroundings are full of restaurants shops and all the needs of the spoiled tourist,1.0
the hotel was really easy to find i got there very early in the morning and was allowed to check in right away the first time i went to the city center it was a very easy and beautiful walk if i wanted to save time the metro stop was right there the rooms were good did spend too much time in it but to sleep but the hotel was a great place to hang out and meet others we got a few good recommendations for our stay from staff and guests alike,1.0

hotel situated only a few minutes from sants estacio with great transport links and very easy to find arrived at the hotel and was offered a welcome drink of fresh fruit juices or cava which was a lovely surprise we were also upgraded to a deluxe twin room which was excellent very spacious and the bathroom was clean both the room and the decor in the hotel were very modern too although the pool area is rather small in terms of number of beds we never found it a problem to get a bed no queuing at and the pool in general was quiet and we went mid july the breakfast every morning was great with selection of cereals cooked breakfast and pastries to name but a few the hotel itself was excellent but the staff make it what it is very friendly always smiling and nothing is ever too much trouble would definitely return to this hotel in the future,1.0
the hotel was clean and modern and room was very only complaint would be that there was no air con in our room and as it was facing the main road it was too noisy at night to keep the window staff were very helpful and the location was very good would stay again,1.0
the nh amsterdam was a great place to stay for our first time there within quick walking distance to the major attractions minutes or less on a quiet and beautiful corner of the city right next to the canal you ca go wrong the staff were friendly and helpful the rooms clean and comfortable all for a very reasonable price highly recommended,1.0
very comfortable hotel we had hilton honors as my family use the hotel brand frequently but even if you discount those perks free breakfast afternoon tea free water coffee machines etc the hotel is incredibly well positioned next to centraal station with a lovely view of the canal easy access to the city and a safe and short walk to trams or closer attractions,1.0
i stayed at gardiner lodge during my visit to dublin i know the hotel and must confess that i was a little bit worried about the few reviews bit it turned out to be a nice surprise it is a beautiful georgian location the location is good not very far from o connell street there are plenty of restaurants markets and shops around at night it seems is a stop of the airlink bus going to the airport in front of the building which is very we have the chance to take the breakfast every day because our day tours were very early but the staff would leave some basic products for us like coffee and only day we took breakfast it was good the staff serves you in your table and the food is the room is small but very clean the shower is good the internet works fine the bed was the staff was really nice helpful and friendly with us have no since the standard rooms are small if you have lots of baggage it might be difficult to walk inside the room since it have a lot of space but other than that i have no complaints,1.0
this was our second time staying at the harding hotel and it did disappoint the location is perfect the rooms are spacious and cozy and the staff warm welcoming and helpful the harding represents everything that makes ireland such a lovely country and the copper alley bistro breakfast is such a great way to start your day stay here you will not be sorry,1.0
us we stayed at the pulitzer to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it special for us we were blown away by the special touches which really helped make our visit memorable special mention to megan the duty manager who was hotel the location was perfect for us we were able to travel to and from the airport easily by public transport and could walk everywhere in the hotel is absolutely stunning and a great level of care has obviously gone into every detail it so big that they hand out maps at simply travelling between our room and the lobby was enough to make me stop and take photographs that how pretty it all is our room was perfect the bed was amazingly comfortable the bathroom large the towels soft we had a nice view out over the canal no complaints whatsoever except maybe a mirror that you do have to climb inside a wardrobe to access but now i just being picky i would highly recommend the canal tour on their boat the tourist it pricier than the alternatives but you definitely get to travel in style it a great way to see the city from a different angle and without worrying about getting hit by a bike the whinge the only slight criticism we would have is the service in the pause we stopped in on our last afternoon before heading off to the airport our waitress tried to take,1.0
barcelona what can i say a city that has everything we chose the olivia balmes after checking reviews on hotel is located on the outskirts of the bustling city streets but it was easy to get to everything either walk train or bus our rooms were clean and beds were big and comfortable shower was also large and powerful tea coffee making facilties room safe and hanging space for clothes could not fault the room all of the staff were friendly helpful and made you feel welcome pool on roof is small but adequate for cooling off after a busy day we did not book the breakfast so cant comment of food there are plenty of coffee shops within a min walk if you want coffee and light breakfasts we spent days in barcelona and didnt get to do everythjng so we are heading back at the end of september hopefully and will be staying at olivia balmes again i highly recommend this hotel ps weather was great too with a light breeze a cardigan or light jumper needed in the evening or for early morning walks,1.0

excellent location with great service reasonably priced rooms but on the small size our room was at the front of the hotel and had some road noise although this was not a problem for us i suspect it may be for some was the wine selection and cost excellent for a city centre hotel nice touch was a welcome glass of wine at check in anybody who drinks wine this is a great choice of hotel,1.0
we were in barcelona the first time for a family vacation and stayed the first part of our trip in a very nice airb b in the city and had always planned to stay in a hotel for a couple of days we also had planned to use our marriott reward points by the time we got around to booking at the last minute the available marriotts in the area we limited and the points required for the ac forum seem reasonable i called them directly and the staff was very friendly and accommodating in the phone and we book two references for rooms the booked them both on the seaside and because i a marriott gold rewards member i got upgraded to a junior executive suite both rooms were outstanding the view is spectacular right on the mediterranean the staff could not have been more helpful we spent time at a beach nearby and a subway stop is nearby so we were easily able to get to the center city and attractions we enjoyed it so much we stayed several days longer with a deal of paying half and redeeming half the points that would be required for a full point redemption stay i sure there are more highly appointed or centrally located marriott in barcelona but staying right on the beach coast with access to nice restaurants and close by train subway transport the spacious rooms and the helpful staff we will stay there if we ever are,1.0
fantastic location across from the parliament building with an awesome terrace with a view of acropolis and the entire city of athens hotel amalia is one of the nicest and customer friendly hotels i ever stayed at it is luxury but everything you need it there front desk is souper friendly and helpful restaurant is actually very good we were avoiding dining there because we did expect good and reasonably priced food the last day waiting for a taxi to bring us to the airport we dined there and were very happy also we ordered a bottle of amalia house wine tasty and cheap definitely recommended,1.0
this is a great hotel and the perfect location in amsterdam the best canal views and really close to the anne frank house they pay attention to the details someone emailed in advance of our stay asking about our daughter and finding out more about her i unfortunately arrived with no luggage the airlines lost it and they were so welcoming and gave me a little bag with toothbrushes toothpaste razor etc it was really nice and made me feel more comfortable excellent breakfast and and attentive staff all over the hotel i would totally stay here again,1.0
this hotel was wonderful it was very clean with modern amenities and a friendly staff it was reasonably priced and exceeded our expectations the location was central to all of the must see attractions of athens i would definitely stay here again,1.0
bang next to the ramblas the hotel looks nondescript from outside with virtually no lobby to speak about once you get in the rooms more than compensate very good beds excellent air conditioning which is a must in summer and sound proof rooms with a breakfast points for customer service none of them looked interested in helping or serving anyone staff at check in was rude and looked absolutely disinterested in being you do mind the impersonal attitude then this place is pretty worth it for the value,1.0
we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel is in a good location about a minute walk to city center found a couple of great restaurants and cafe in the immediate area and close to shopping as well hotel has a rooftop pool and bar that we did use but nice option to have rooms were very quiet we had a second floor room above the and barely heard the traffic,1.0
we looked at a dozen hotels before selecting the regencia colon located next to its upscale sister the colon for a fraction of the took a taxi from the airport for and were dropped off at the square steps away from the front of the hotel i was concerned about other hotels located on closed narrow hidden streets and was relieved to see the regencia so close and visible from the street and fact that is the beauty and genius of this hotel it is metres from the main square within seconds you are in the middle of everything that is barcelona we arrived and walked straight down to the beach mins but it felt even shorter as we wandered through the gothic quarter down past the pier and onto sandy rambla and lunch at the boqueria were mins away so is the open public square placa reial where we had dinner it was a longer walk to the sagrada the next day mins but time passed quickly as we strolled up passeig de gracia to view the architecture and visit the shops next time we take the metro back from the sagrada to placa de catalunya the location was key as we came back to the hotel for late afternoon siestas before heading out for this is a review of the hotel not a travel guide and so let me say that was made very easy and welcoming by anselmo we were in room right above the hotel regencia,1.0
my husband and i went to barcelona for the weekend arrived at our hotel at approx in smooth drinks in bar close to promenade and very well organised plenty of choice and service pool area clean and plenty of space pool a little cool even when it was degrees fine temperature after a of pillows on a pillow shower and separate bath double to bus stops to get you to centre take for sagrada familia easy to walk around helpful reception staff nothing was too much trouble late check out arranged coutesy room available for freshening up booked at time to suit us reception staff and porter staff stowed and recollected our luggage could not fault this hotel except for miserable chamber maids not saying hello,1.0
my family room was grand and accommodating spacious the staff were very helpful and warm the central location was a bonus and within reach my daughter enjoyed the pool whilst i enjoyed the full use of the gym the only downside is the construction next door to the hotel but then the windows shut off the noise,1.0
the best ever information about hotel as well as barcelona offer for a reservation of restaurants the black board at the entrance with recommendations for brunches dinners festivals etc we tried some and it was so good very helpful and friendly staff shared hangout area at the reception with a bookcase and free water loose tea and coffee nice modern desing and light furniture really big double bed with big double blanket pillows per person room cleaning every day the room had a window to the street so it was quite noisy even at night great location for us still in the city close to public transport but not in the crowded city center breakfasts available on daily base demand even if you book only a room good and stable wifi connection we had some payment issues caused by a hotel system but the staff was very willing to handle those situations and successfully solved them immediately,1.0
the hotel located in the quiet area very close to the acropolis metro station mins walking to the acropolis entrance and the busy plaka area the receptionists were friendly and efficient when checked in we told them that we needed to depart earlier than their restaurant breakfast opening of am they sent within an hour prepacked breakfast to our room when we returned from mateora we stayed in hera hotel again and enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the restaurant the breakfast had limited choice but still good quality and with plenty of vegetable standard rooms we stayed were well equipped but tight in space two of us slim in size with two pieces of medium size luggage found it uncomfortable to move around the rooms and bathrooms were tidy there were no clothes hooks in the tight bathrooms nowhere we could hanged the wet towel etc bedding was comfortable and towel smelled fresh soft clean the sound insulation with the neighboring room was weak one time we had a noisy neighbor and we could hear her talking whole night long,1.0
this hotel is just a star all the way at our arrival which was hours before ordinary check in they served us something free to drink in the bar meanwhile they fixed a room for us already and from there everything was just perfect large and very comfortable designed room the staff was so friendly the pool on the roof was so nice and clean the snack bar had everything from good tasting drinks to club sandwiches and so on for us it was the perfect place to stay for those nights a little bit from the classic tourist streets but we walked just a few minutes to get there love to come back thank you,1.0
this hotel was great the staff were all friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and the beds were really perfect after a tiring day exploring amsterdam they held on to our luggage when we arrived as we could not check in for a few hours thus allowing us to walk around without having to drag suitcases around with us the wifi was also brilliant and fast which was very mych appreciated we most definitley stay here again,1.0
the only thing positive about staying at this hotel is the location otherwise skip it no air conditioning in most of the rooms and the room was stuffy and cramped we asked if we could get an aurcondioned room and was told it would cost euro you can hear the noise from the honkey tonk environment in the street and the service was wildly inconsistent my friend was offered complementary coffee and the next day i was rudely told to buy a cup for us from a machine,0.0

great hotel clean rooms and in a great location in the heart of amsterdam the breakfast was great with plenty of choice furniture in rooms was slightly dated but our room was very big and clean well worth the money,1.0
this hotel is perfectly located just few steps from bus tram and train station grocery spaar is very close so we did need to pay for breakfast during our stay after our arrival we were a bit afraid that there will be the noise from the street but all we heard in the hotel was silence our apartment was beautiful clean and we fell in love with our king size bed we were unable to get up from there as it was really comfortable huge advantage is also big terrace on the roof of the hotel unfortunately we were there just once during the last day of our stay i recommend this hotel to everyone who does have full pockets of money but wants to have beautiful accommodation with great access to city center we ca wait to be back,1.0

stayed for nights in june with my partner and hotel granvia did not disappoint we got a free room upgrade and bottle of champagne as this trip was for my so this was a lovely surprise upon is simply amazing very central and right next to a metro station which we used to get to the was not huge however there was a built walk in wardrobe which was ideal for placing clothes and suitcase in order to avoid clutter in the was simple yet very classy and elegant again bathroom was not huge i have experienced bigger bathroom in barcelona but it was not an issue shower was provided in large bottles which is ideal if travelling for a short trip and only have small hand luggage allowance on plane we did not have breakfast included as was cheaper for us to go to a nearby cafe an amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around if i remember rightly and it was delicious sandwiches cakes etc and all homemade additionally there is a lovely terrace outside at the back of the property where you can sit and relax and make use of the bar menu the nachos and potatoes were not the best would definitely recommend and stay again,1.0
really the hoxton is like the person i want to marry thoughtful beautiful smart anticipating of my needs fun to be around we only have known each other for four nights but i think it could work out seriously it like someone interviewed me and designed a space around my preferences retro energetic and staffed with thoughtful staff i recommend the hoxton to any adult traveller seems less ideal for families valentina was an enthusiastic and informative front desk attendant a among of hip attentive staff the bar area has a bit of a buzz and and prepared cocktails it kind of reminded me of a trendy nyc boutique hotel without all the attitude that often comes with that in amsterdam over a four night stay the hoxton was located in an ideal location that felt intimate and was a close walk to all the large tourist areas the streets around it are like postcards for amsterdam recommended without reservation until i make my next one,1.0
the location of the hotel is probably the best one in athens as from the rooms you have a great overview over the entire citiy to the akropolis and behind to the harbour and the sea if weather is clear you can reach all museums and sights be feet have good restaurants in the near and an open air cinema with good films in the evening directly in front of the hotel in the morning you can swimm in the pool on the roof or walk up the hill to the very top to have a marvelous view,1.0

the hotel is very convenient for getting to and from the airport with airlink express stops from airport and to airport on cathal brugha street just opposite the hotel the staff at the reception were very helpful and and were quick we made use of the left luggage facility as our flights were arriving early and leaving late our standard room is small but adequate and clean it was quiet being on the floor the singles pushed together double bed was comfortable the bathroom has shower only but it is ok the breakfast was good with full irish cooked breakfast and the usual choices of juices fruits cereals yogurts cheeses and tea and coffee but there is only type of milk on offer being just off o connell street it is also convenient for shops tour buses pubs and restaurants most of the tourist sights are within walking distances but the dodublin transport pass which included the airlink express and the buses was very good value we would stay here again if we return again,1.0
stayed here for two nights close to attractions and buses easy to find and bus from airport just stops around the corner staff are friendly and helpful very clean and tidy beds are comfy also restaurant down stairs is pricey and would be my only complaint,1.0

for being a hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high forgot our orderlazy in the barservice remote did worktook the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without askinggave us the wrong billthe staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service not worth the visit,0.0

this is a very modern style of hotel with a somewhat confusing layout having two elevators and clear sides to the building this caused some confusion in our party the rooms are lovely and well apportioned and our terrace was fantastic we ate dinner in the restaurant which was amazing and i review elsewhere all in all a little eclectic but rather wonderful,1.0
truly this hotel was the hotel highlight of our trip the room was very comfortable and well appointed bathroom was great shower was great we had a room for with of us and it was very comfortable for our family the location is phenomenal the perfect place to stay in amsterdam the customer service was outstanding they took care of everything suggested and booked all restaurant reservations and they also had tram passes this hotel is a first class experience and well worth it also the location is quaint but the facility is fully updated and modern,1.0

gustavo at the reception gave me a very beautiful room with a nice view and he was so kind and helpful i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will recommend it to my friends as well this hotel is not located in the heart of the city but there are lots of public transportation systems near the property like metro and bus which you can use to reach every district you were some problems with the cold water in the bathroom but this issue did affect my good experience at this hotel,1.0

for some days in athens the hilton is a very nice place to be business oriented but with a great sense for a more than relaxing stay in athens this is a perfect area do not miss the view from the it breath taking enjoy your well deserved vacation,1.0
what a gorgeous hotel it is filled with history and art all the nooks and crannies are full of surprises the room was very comfortable and the bathroom and shower very nice the breakfast is a buffet and offers many choices including classic irish breakfast choices the service at check in and in general are impeccable everyone very friendly and accommodating truly an experience in itself,1.0
the services at this hotel were impeccable from housecleaning to concierge everyone was superbly helpful the room was conformable quiet and well arranged extra luxuries like robes slippers and every possible toiletry item was available water tea and coffee were free on the top tray in the room a separate closet area was a smart touch it kept the room from looking cluttered breakfast was abundant in its choices and superbly fresh there were meats cheeses eggs of every style sandwiches pancakes waffles custom juices and a variety of cereals yogurt and fruit i sure something is missing it was quite the cornucopia the hotel was centrally located which made it very easy to get to any point of interest by the garcia metro station or by cab by the way cabs are much cheaper in spain than in the usa do hesitate to treat yourself if you going to a tricky location,1.0
stayed here for three nights whilst exploring barcelona great location near the metro stop drassanes which is at the bottom of la ramblas we were able to check in a few hours sooner than the time specified which was great they stored our luggage on our last day too room was nice fridge was good to have air con was the easiest to work breakfast is awful we tried it one day do bother would have been nice to have kettle with tea and coffee options in room,1.0
we enjoyed our stay here was good location and very clean located min walk from sagrada church ehich is awesime church site breakfast was great too the staff was helpful and pleasant would not hesitate to recommend to others,1.0
we had a wonderful stay at this modern and clean hotel after disembarking after a two week med cruise this was a very nice quiet modern place staff were very accommodating and welcomed us from the start i would definitely recommend this hotel and will visit again front staff learned of our very early departure to the airport and went out of their way to prepare us both a breakfast box for the trip to the airport,1.0
if you need to catch a train or need access to the airport you ca beat this location it also has metro access to visit anywhere else in the city it has a space travel theme that is kind of fun and the rooms are modern and appointed very well with clever space saving concepts in mind the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel bar service was great with the bartender going over and above to look up a special drink my husband ordered the one and only downside was the noise between floors are wood which make them clean and look nice but it sounded like the people upstairs were moving furniture round all night and we could hear every door opening from the hallway outside as well,1.0
if there would not be this roof top pool with a nice view on the acropole i would only evaluate it as star the location itself is not very good quite unfriendly people on the street and at least from the metro station do walk back alone at night breakfast is also crowded with slow replenishment during peak time you sometimes need to wait to get rooms are to the novotel standard clean and staff very friendly,1.0
we stayed at the hampshire for nights last week of july the soundproof room was on the third floor spacious very clean and had a window with street view which i like the room was cleaned well daily and the bathroom had shampoo and hairdryer no the bed and pillows were very staff are very friendly and helpful the location is very convenient it is minute away from tram stop to and it is like away from the central station the hotel is locates near a coffeeshop and some nice restaurants a laundry a metro station a shopping street just min away from the hotel great value for the money it is highly recommended,1.0
our standard twin room was really very nice with lots of storage comfortable beds and a beautiful bathroom the decor is low key classic front desk staff could have been nicer wish we could have stayed longer,1.0
excellent location large clean rooms shuttle service to the train and friendly staff breakfast had a very wide selection of food which wasexcellent good snack lunch and pizza for dinner at the silk road bar,1.0
this hotel was adequate for a one night stop on a recent visit to dublin apart from a great location there are limited amenities throughout although my room was a bit small it was clean with a comfortable bed and free wifi,1.0
looks really modern from both the outside and the impressions on the rooms are clean brand new and a good use of the space iron hair drier and a decent sized telly plus hot drink leaked reported but easy to very good with a reasonable variety of great as its on the bus route from the airport and in the centre of the it and would go again,1.0
we unfortunately stayed here three nights as our first stop in ireland we shared a twin bedroom on the first floor for one of those nights which was miserable the hotel is very dated but the location was great so we muddled through our stay but left very sleep deprived our shared room was directly over the bar so we heard music most of the night i would be shocked if there was any insulation at all in between the floors on top of that the room was very hot there is no so if you want to be cool at night you need to leave your windows open which means you will hear everyone walking home from the bars at and you will be awakened by the sun at in the summer there was no sheet which i learned is typical in ireland only a thick covered duvet one woman at the front desk staff was grumpy every time we went up there however the woman who sat us for breakfast every morning made up for the bad experience she was delightful cheery and remembered our large party liked to sit together the breakfast was typical and pretty good i ca say the same for lunch mediocre we enjoyed the fact that there was a large breakfast and lunch room where we could sit and play cards during down time the elevator was weird in that you had to insert your card every time you used it and it,0.0
our first stop in spain began at this hotel it was a fantastic way to start our trip the hotel is gorgeous and the staff lovely it was one of our favorite hotel stays in europe which is saying a lot we have stayed in quite a few properties it is very classy and a great location,1.0
stayed hear for nights my wife and i and the lad and his girlfriend the hotel is the cheapest but worth the extra due to location which was to none rooms a little dated but nice the hour free snacks was a nice touch even though it was the same every night microwave in your room with fridge but the main thing which i never experienced was the free beer wine fantastic overall loved our stay will be back next year for sure,1.0
i am just back after a day stay and i must say i was very happy with our room which was roomy and clean with a very nice bathroom the front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful as were the staff at breakfast lounge breakfast was very nice with a large array of fresh fruit and juices not to mention an extensive warm buffet style english breakfast my gripe with the hotel is the puro beach pool area once you make your way to the pool area you are greeted by a sales pitch to the various packages available for your stay with varied from euros for a lounger to euros per person for the puro package which i still do not have a clue what it entailed having decided to take up the euro sun lounger for the family euros lighter i was soon wishing i had gone to the beach which we did for the rest of our stay as we were constantly being asked if we wanted cocktail above the thumping music from the loudspeakers dotted around the whole pool area i decided to go for a dip in the very small busy pool to be greeted by a layer of sun lotion scum in the water clearly too small a pool to accommodate so many people and my other observation was that the toilets were located a floor down i will leave the rest for your imagination needless to say i did not dip my,0.0
just spent nights with my extended family at the gallery location is fantastic perfect for walking everywhere the staff could not have been more helpful from our arrival to chasing down a stray taxi on departure the breakfasts were outstanding and the were well designed and comfortable infact the beds are probably the most comfortable i have ever slept in would thoroughly,1.0
this hotel is close to everything a traveler needs but be careful if you follow the direction by foot provided by hotel web from central station the direction is designed for local people who is familiar with their surrounding but it s not easy to follow as a foreigner the service is very good the concierges are very helpful one block from the hotel is a tourist street full of small restaurant and souvenir shops and the price are less than in the major shopping area two blocks from the hotel full of stores for local such as flower shop super market my friend and i stay in this hotel for two nights and we do appreciate the convenience of the location,1.0
stayed for nights in july location was excellent for me as near to the office plenty of places to eat and drink nearby huge bed and excellent air con for the warm nights you often get in barcelona staff very friendly and most helpful highly recommended,1.0
the hotel is in a good area to stay within the canal ring the street is too busy compared to other areas of the canal ring but it still so close to everything the service was good and the rooms were clean but very small we enjoyed the breakfast it was a good selection but i would suggest that the waiters start writing down the orders we were there days for breakfast and on days the order was wrong and on day we had to order times for tea and coffee and waited about an hour i would recommend this hotel if you going to amsterdam it a really good choice,1.0
pros location is markable it near by everything restaurants bars and transportation front desk team are great super easy processes for checking in and out price valuecons main hotel doors are closed at late night you need to have short chat to come on bathroom was so small however it practical for me since,1.0
a very nice hotel located right in the middle of the canal district we got a room on the floor overlooking rembrandtplein and the surrounding area nice and clean rooms with comfortable beds the hotel staff was very polite and helpful,1.0
we stayed here for two nights i actually thought i was booking the olivia plaza hotel which is on the central area in barcelona but now i glad we ended up at this olivia hotel the staff are trained really well and they be nicer or more helpful which makes such a difference the hotel is impeccably clean we had a lovely room the shower was amazing they left a little plate of fruit and cake for us on the second day which is a nice touch there is a fab rooftop pool not a huge amount of sunloungers but really relaxing and it gets the sun right up until sunrise the staff like i said are wonderful across the board is it cheap no but you pay for what you get and it not overly expensive either lovely for a weekend break location wise you are in the eixample area and mins walk brings you down to the busier shopping la rambla area the queen bed was just lovely and comfortable we had breakfast there both mornings and it was fresh and just lovely overall would recommend,1.0
glad we picked this hotel it a little out of the way for those wanting to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle but it a lovely walk to the beach and the city centre about mins the room was spacious and clean and the front desk were happy to store our bags before check in and after check out the rooftop bar is worth a visit the barmaid remembered our drinks after our first visit the breakfast was really good lots of choice and every member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful,1.0
a very friendly staff and a very good breakfast with a lot of choice it also minutes from the airport and minutes walk from the trainstation and stop of the hop on and off bus so i can recommend this hotel,1.0
every aspect of this one night stay was flawless i would happily recommend the reception desk is efficency professional and friendly whilst not being stuff at all the room is well sized with all you would expect in the form of iron and safe in addition to usual coffee making facilities i also had a meal and was really tasty along with great friendly service,1.0
returned to this hotel again and it was even better than the last time brilliant location and facilities the hotel staff are very friendly and yet not intrusive room was lovely and spacious with great views of the port,1.0
realistic price for over night stay in dublin staff are great rooms are big and clean with everything you need hotels location is great for everything you want to do whilst in dublin bus stop pretty much outside temple bar just down the alley guinness storeroom within a minute walk,1.0
i am a gold elite with priority club no upgrade reception staff selected a room with a lousy view and a long walk from elevator the free wifi keeps disconnecting safety deposit box door needs a metal object like tip of the spoon they have in the room to be able to open the door as it does open itself or has a handle to use to open it no water bottles in the room very much like a dormitory reminded me of college days would stay there again,0.0
the location of the hotel is great it just a short walk to the metro and to tram stops we had a room overlooking the canal which was lovely the breakfast had a good selection which was a great start to the day the staff were all friendly and helpful we really enjoyed our stay,1.0
wow what a great you going to barcelona and would like to stay at what i would call centrally located hotel pick this hilton the staff was welcoming and helpful without coming across as being less than genuine special kudos to the server in the restaurant wish i could recall her name she was terrific she was the only dark hair female so she will be easy to service check staff also very good and host working the lounge also went out of her way to greet and make the hhdiamond members staying on the fourth floor feel taken care off the only minor problem occurred at the lounge when i tried to get a glass of cold water and all the cold drink holders were locked the lounge attendant called for the keys and a grumpy older gentleman came to unlock the fridges but not before complaining about how those fridges were locked at a certain time and then open much later he was quite loud about that to the point that the lounge hostess had to apologize for this persons lack of hiltons that i have stayed before usually have the fridges open for guests to get cold bottles of water or juice do see why this hilton locks the room was clean comfortable and the worked very well bottom line great place to stay,1.0
been to the westbury hotel few times before and this luxury hotel always appointed rooms with the most confy beds i have ever miss the opportunity to go for their afternoon tea which is an institution in town,1.0
i was lucky enough to book a couple of months before leaving on trip meaning i got a nice deal on the price of the room the hotel was in renovation but everything was still accessible and working correctly the room was super clean and huge plus you have a nespresso which is a great addition finally it right across the street to go to amsterdam centraal so location is i would book again,1.0
amazing service from bellman to check in to concierge to amazing breakfast crew and every other hilton employee at this property everyone is passionately engaged in providing above and beyond service my wife and i both agreed we would never consider staying anywhere else in amsterdam a real well run gem,1.0
a bit tricky if you arrive to the hotel by car the street outside is a busy road and there are only a very small space to park while you check in the location is excellent with views overlooking the park and the parlament and with walking distance to a lot of the sights in central rooms are elegant and normal in size the bathrooms are quite big and very nicely designed breakfast offers a large variation so no matter your diet find something on the buffét the only disappointment was the lobby bar food was not that good and expensive and when i ordered champagne i was told it cold so please put the champagne in the fridge and come back joke aside i would absolutely come back to this hotel again,1.0
aberdeen lodge has everything you may want from a bed and brakfast accomodation the house is lovely and charming placed in a quiet beautiful leafy residential area it near to a pleasant beach walk and perfectly connected to the city room was very nice and clean and fully functional the breakfast is rich with plenty of delicious choices last but not least you find smiles kindness and a real sense of hospitality definitely come back,1.0

the mercer barcelona is a stellar hotel with superb service and a kind and friendly staff our family of five ranging across three generations stayed for nights and had to pry ourselves away from this lovely property the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooftop terrace pool is an oasis to stretch and refresh in at the end of the day the breakfasts are elegant and delicious the room service team is up at your door in a snap even remembers your breakfast order from the day before the hotel is extremely quiet yet steps from almost everything you might want to see in thanks to the polished and professional front desk team the savvy concierge and kind tania and sparkling aleix in the restaurant and bar team we can not wait to return and will savor the memories from our dreamy stay with you,1.0
we spent one night here at the end of a cruise from venice good accommodation and bathroom although no view as overlooked the hotel inner courtyard rooftop swimming pool and bar good but noisy from machinery good breakfast with super views across athens from the restaurant bit away from the city centre but only a short taxi ride,1.0
this is a tale of two visits the girl on front desk on sunday lovely and kind free afternoon tea nice quiet room nothing like the bad reviews i had seen then the monday morning experience my quick breakfast was interrupted no less than times as the waiter wanted to make damn certain i had paid for it which i explained i had then at the end as i was leaving he was friendly then i went to check out and the guy on front desk asked for for my sushi i explained i already paid directly to the delivery guy and instead of believing me like a normal human being he took the cash with a promise of reinstating it i have mentioned the pre pay charge for a dog if you travel with a dog they charge up front in case the dog damages the room so potentially for a dog breakfast paid twice which i just and sushi paid twice it may look like a good price but an unaware tourist could be out of pocket for almost nightmare i go anywhere else with this guy in charge he only after your tourist money,0.0
stayed at this for nights in july i would highly recommend this hotel check in opened staff were friendly spoke fluent english check in was very quick and easy i do recommend asking some staff for directions two occasions we were sent the wrong way they do have maps though so i would read from the map great security in the hotel cant use the lifts without your room card room we had room for of us its perfect and for the cleanliness could not fault the room small kitchenette if you need it two tvs in the room the sofa converted into a double bed was the most comfortable but the main bed is i would ask for more pillows though the pillows are thin room cleaning was done daily and done really well no complaints from me lovely big bath and shower pool area the pool is small yes you can see that from the photos i can see that in winter it would be freezing as in summer it was still cold but it was hot so it was refreshing i think a few more sun loungers would be beneficial and the towels restocking would be ideal my children loved the pool location good location close to shops metro buy a pass which allows rides café across the road is great for breakfast pancakes are amazing as is the musli and yoghurt,1.0
was at the hotel for five days the front of house are all very polite and location is great i needed to be at the rai centre and for me it was perfect as was also near the centre the room was clean had everything i needed the room was a good size the cleaning team come each day and the hotel also offers breakfast the only bad point is there is currently a tram line being built outside and if you are looking for a lie its not possible with all the noise overall its a good value hotel in a great location with really great staff the next time i am here on business i would lool at booking again,1.0
my family and i arrived at hotel after completing a wonderful stay in athens and a day cruise we checked our bags in at and then had a very full day in barcelona hotel was clean and modern and staff very kind we were located one level about street and our room was next to a very busy area noise was insane people party in barcelona that what was not ok was that room people yelling screaming and laughing until am i went down to the desk at and asked for a different room for the following night they said yes and i took my migraine and sleep deprived self to breakfast very nice breakfast be warned if it a weekend ask for a room away from the noise they should have asked me before sticking us in that room worst hotel experience in my many years of travel,0.0
i was attending breakfast already had my food on my plate when a hotel memeber came up to me and told me i had to leave as i was not in the correct footwear i thought this was completely ridiculous as i was never informed there was a dress code and no signs where displayed to enforce this but rules are rules and made my way back to the room to change my shoes upon my arrival back at breakfast i noticed there was a lot of middle aged and up guests wearing flip flops also i then approached the same staff member to inform him that i had changed my foorwear but if he was going to make me change mine it should be enforced for all guests this staff member then started to abuse me at the top of his lunges in front of the whole restaurant saying its not only his job to check that everyone is wearing the correct footing and that i need to behave i responded to him simply stating that i felt personally attacked and victimised i then became so embarrassed and upset i had to leave breakfast in tears without eating my meal i pay for my stay like every other guest and i can not believe i was treated in such a way i really regret not getting this abusive mans name,0.0
beautiful hotel and very friendly staff every morning we were greeted by the staff as we went out for the day they offered us an umbrella when the weather looked like it would rain was helpful with dining and the breakfast was wonderful great location i would recommend this hotel will use again when we return to amsterdam they made you feel like you mattered and was very welcoming,1.0
stayed here for nights and would definitely recommend it the staff would really helpful and friendly spent a relaxing afternoon sunbathing by the rooftop pool while having drinks served to our sun loungers from the pool bar the room was spacious and came with bath robes and slippers felt quite luxurious my only negative comment is that breakfast was charged at per person which is crazily expensive and not worth it so we just booked a room without the breakfast included,1.0
great hotel quirky décor friendly helpful staff great place to stay for a concert at especially if you queuing all day starbucks next door for coffee can go back to your room for a snooze a snack or a loo trip perfect then after the show a quick stumble back to your room also the tram stop is literally at your door,1.0

this review written by a actually i lost my card homosexual while i generally not one for into gay locations for vacations i have understood the appeal of a hotel there have been a few instances in my life where traveling with a same sex companion raised eyebrows you just want one bed or bringing a gentleman back to a room for the night was an issue i stayed at the axel property in berlin and there was something nice if a bit quaint about just being around my queer bros there so that not a bad twohotel either by initial design or reorientation ahem is not that from the proliferation of reviews here saying we did know it was a gay themed hotel but liked it anyway my guess is the gay theme did pay off at first and they have marketed it around europe as a fashionable discount location which in fact it is and i must say the idea of a little sheen of as just a tourist atractiion not as a rule for entry is kind of appealing as we queers become more and more accepted and so this place seemed to be about gay dudes as far as i could tell and honestly i realized pretty quickly i could tell and it really did matter i stayed during a major event at fira a convention center just down the street and while other nearby hotels were charging and up two was still affordable its location,1.0
david in the bar makes a damn good coffee on top of that he was very engaging and friendly pleasant atmosphere in the bar area music not too loud so conversation over a coffee or beer is great seats are plentiful and comfortable,1.0
we stayed nights at the sir albert we found the service to be fantastic and the hotel quaint when we checked in the staff was excellent booking tickets for museums and reservations the hotel is small and the hallways dark our room was very small and dark but fit our needs just fine the location is a bit off the main areas but has a more residential feel which we enjoyed it was excellent walking to the museums if you are walking beware of all the bikers is a place for bikers for sure also be sure to have euros ready for many places do not take credit card,1.0
timings are everything when your on a routine fast check in to a great room unfortunate noisy building works next door from rattled the hotel randomly naps were impossible till we moved simple request with best result lovely pool and pleasant drinks selection we ate out as my favorite market is around the corner mercat de santa caterina as well as a booking at tickets if you a corporate coffee drinker starbucks is next door and if your body is a temple in the other direction is an supermarket no good for parking if you have a car dropping off is virtually a tuck and roll from your slow moving vehicle but honestly with all our stuff staff helped getting us in and away quickly great stay willbeback,1.0
had a few hiccups regarding reservations weeks before our stay here got to the hotel on and had absolutely no issues very nice clean and well presented hotel in walking distance to dam square amsterdam centraal train station and other shops and emenities my only issue was that it was extremely expensive costing us for nights for room only in the end it was worth it its a fabulous hotel will definitely be returning here thats if the prices of the rooms were to go down,1.0

elegantly decorated friendly service good bed good breakfast because of construction under my apartment i stayed a night in this hotel near my place i was pleasantly surprised how nice this hotel was also good value i booked direct with the hotel which saved a lot of money compared to the booking sites,1.0
very good location of the hotel is great trams and busses near by in case needed the breakfast was amazing and plenty museums and city center are close by everything you need is within reach thanks,1.0
this is good basic hotel in a convenient location just a short walk from the acropolis with plenty of restaurants and bars in easy reach the area looks pretty rough with all the graffiti some of it s worth a look though but we were two female travellers and had no problems at room was a decent size and clean and quiet another plus was sitting in the hotel bar in the evening with its fantastic view up to the parthenon only downside was the faint drain smell from the safe quiet and good value for money,1.0
everything was perfect we enjoyed the friendly reception of cake and welcoming drink all the staff were very friendly and helpful we will definitely be back we have no complaints keep up the good work,1.0
we had the usual issues of arriving early and not being able to get into room the young women welcoming and professional called housekeeping and relayed to me that room was vacant but had to be cleaned should be ready in an hour only concern is that they kept telling me to come back hour after hour for hours the front desk lady was apologetic and i told her it is her fault she was relaying the message that her housekeeping gave her but may be someone should tell housekeeping to do a better job of assessing how quickly their teams can clean a room rooms have high ceilings good size but probably need a refresh i would stay her again for reasons first the location is awesome easy to walk to everything in athens and if you want to go exploring other parts of the city the metro is across the street and second the gb restaurant on the floor we had dinner twice during our stay and the food the service warm and attentive but not hovering and the view were all spectacular,1.0
i booked and paid in advance for a superior room which was rather more expensive than the standard room however on check in we were given a standard room these rooms do not have windows and i was aware of this which is why i booked the more expensive room on alerting the reception staff we were given another room next the lift on another floor the hotel is not well sound proofed and we heard people coming and going in and out of the lift all night for nights the hotel had allowed a large group of british men to book a large number of rooms at the hotel they took over the pool and bar area and had no respect for other guests and some were staying on our floor and very loud this was the last stop for us after an week trip and we were looking forward to sitting by the pool which we were not comfortable in doing we were required to pay a euro bond on our debit card which we were told would be refunded on check out at checkout we were told this refund would take days we stayed in hotels throughout europe and this was the only hotel that took a security bond reception staff were condensing and not very approachable on the positive the breakfast was very good and the location very central,0.0
great hotel all round very ideal location around a minute walk to the harbour but with very easy access to the local metro stop within a minutes walking attentive and friendly staff who went out of their way to help the room was excellent decent size with smart furnishing but topped off with a great bathroom and an unbelievably comfortable bed the breakfast comes at an extra cost but is worth it to avoid any hassle trying to find other food locally the rooftop pool and bar is an added bonus which makes a great change from other city centre hotels i stayed in before its a great place to spend an hour or so in late afternoon to relax after a day of wandering around the city great choice of cocktails but underwhelmed by the overpriced grill menu of small bar snacks overall though a great hotel to stay would thoroughly recommend for whatever the occasion as ideally located for a comfortable stay in a great city,1.0
this hotel was a great place to stay it is centrally located close to trams buses and trains and within walking distance of some attractions the rooms are well appointed and the staff did all in their power to make our stay comfortable they were helpful friendly and attentive,1.0
we have just spent four nights at this hotel and throughly enjoyed our stay the hotel is perfectly located with easy tram access to central station from where most sights tours etc room was spacious very comfy bed and a hot shower crisp sheets and soft towels this is a family run business they are friendly efficient and very helpful with directions suggestions for restaurants etc there is a very relaxed garden area which is a nice place to sit while enjoying a drink or two highly recommend this hotel especially for international travellers like ourselves,1.0
the hotel is used by tour groups and we arrived a day early for our trafalgar tour we had a small room but it was clean and good enough for nights the breakfast was the best we saw in days in ireland the selection was wonderful if you could not find something to eat you have a problem the location is not near much do bother with the pizza place across the street it a min min walk to street and a grocery store or anything else to do it is right around the corner from the garden of remembrance it does have which is nice when dublin is would stay closer to downtown next time,1.0

stay of nights there as hhonors diamond you should be treated fairly unfortunately not at all no welcome for breakfast the hotel do a segregation of hhonors member on the underground with a limited food and untasteful moreover the staff is far to be professional and spend more time to chat and joke than take care of customer this hotel is not at all as hilton level and should be removed from hilton group,0.0
lovely modern hotel lobby area is beautifully decorated the rooms are great spacious clean and modern no complaints also the restaurant on the lobby is great we ate breakfast and lunch there not included in price min walk to the a bus station so transportation is easy although this hotel is away from the city center ride to central station by bus all and all would stay at the hotel again but may choose a different location closer to the city,1.0

arriving to hotel with requested early check in which hotels pretty much always provide for platinum members just to be told check in at on my polite hint that i requested early check in it still no suggesting that maybe saying will try to get you room as early as we can instead of which would be hours later did not make any impression on front office clerk upon talking to the manager all rooms booked pointing out that during this silly argument at least people checked out out of sudden a few clicks in computer and oh i think i have a room for you really first impression counts and it was a very bad impression it will be one night only affair never again holiday inn amsterdam,0.0

this beautiful hotel in which we stayed for nights is situated in the heart of kolonaki a fascinating neighborhood in central athens it is just a walk from evangelismos metro station but we walked always to syntagma approximately minutes it is such a nice walk and you can discover so many shops and nice restaurants doing so from arrival to departure everything was perfect the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and we miss the delicious breakfast already so much the greek caffe frappe was my personal highlight this hotel has such a lovely and relaxed atmosphere we chosen the superior room and it was perfect for us the room was always perfectly clean we would highly recommend this hotel and we are already thinking about to come back,1.0
stayed here with my wife as a treat with evening meal and afternoon tea highly recommend the room was excellent and the staff could have been more helpful will definitely be back it also in a great location for many of dublin attractions and we were able to get to the comedy festival at the iveagh gardens which was just a minute walk,1.0
i selected this hotel because of its close proximity to the train station it does look wonderful from the outside but do be fooled it well kept and comfortable and our room was very nice the price was quite reasonable we were able to check in a little early which was great and the process was efficient we walked to the center of dublin which took about minutes i stay here again for sure,1.0
we no why this lovely hotel only have stars we want to put at least stars to it good location minutes walk from rambla and pl cataloniavery good food in the restaurant we eat the duck good breakfast in the morning untill had a penthouse with a wonderful will book here next time in barca,1.0
this a really clean hotel ideally situated in the centre of the city it is in a quiet area but you can be in the buzz of the city in a few minutes all mayor attractions can be reached by walking or public transport is very efficient but be aware a deposit of per room per night is taken for incidentals this is returned to your account at are very clean and of a good size beds are comfortable and the air con works well without being too noisy the showers are powerful and the which charges typically exorbitant bar area is quirky and cosy there seems a lack of general seating areas so look out for the tables up the stairs above reception it a very pleasant area to watch the world go is very efficient with good download speeds as with all amsterdam buildings watch out for the step when entering different rooms overall we had a very pleasant stay at radisson blu it an ideal location for a short break and we would definitely visit again,1.0
the hotel is a minute walk to las ramblas and a minute walk from the metro station easy to get to using public transport room was a basic double but the bed was a king size nice and comfortable for me and my husband room was small but adequate you could draw the curtain across from the bathroom and the toilet was ina seperate little room very light and airy only wish you could leave air con on whilst out as it was so hot in august staff were very friendly and helpful and would give you tips of what metro station to use or which line all staff greeted you as you came and went rooftop bar and lounge area on floor was really nice to relax in overall a lovely stay,1.0
this hotel is amazing i was switched rooms with a better view and the staff was amazing i would stay here again for sure the breakfast was the best i have had in the time i was in ireland thank you,1.0
i stayed here for nights recently and found it to be very good for my purposes the location is very close to everything i wanted to see in the central area of dublin and it s very close to the temple bar area i wasn t particularly interested in seeing that aspect of dublin though it was certainly worth walking through it s only a couple of blocks from the liffey river which is also enjoyable to stroll next to the hotel is situated on a very busy street with lots of vehicle and pedestrian traffic this is probably one of the reasons there are very heavy drapes that can be pulled to cover the windows at night i was one floor above ground level so there was a noticeable amount of noise it is not particularly quiet in the early part of the evening when there is a band playing in the bar downstairs and lots of street traffic this seemed to end by each evening so one could get some sleep after condition of the hotel is acceptable though there is very obvious wear and tear as a solo traveler this wasn t really a problem though if she had been with me my girlfriend might not have felt quite as comfortable the room was quite large as was the bathroom which was an aspect i appreciated after having stayed in very small rooms in amsterdam london paris and rome there was a with one of those retractable,1.0
clearly awaiting its end when lease up room air con not working room smelt damp vent in bathroom not working so after shower couldnt see a thing woke at by work on building site next door not spain but an alleged star in dublin worst hotel i have stayed in for a long time still waiting for the fried eggs i ordered for breakfast at least if they rebadged it as star you could accept this esp if star prices and not the euro plus i paid never ever will i be in this place again,0.0

i needed two rooms for three days in dublin for a family vacation lucky i had some points to cover most of the cost and found this great place location was good hotel was clean and bright and the staff was outstanding,1.0
was a nice hotel the breakfast was yummy and our newly renovated room was good could use a shower screen because water goes everywhere air con was great and the staff were lovely even arranged breakfast for us at on the morning we were leaving if your coming to athens great place to stay only downfall is the neighbourhood is abit rough,1.0
spent nights on vacation arrived early at and got a room with upgrade at were lucky front desk was excellent at getting within minutes room was very clean reasonable size safe was too small for our laptop breakfast was great but had to wait most days for the chef to either show up or get started making egg based dishes we were shocked to see so much litter and graffiti on the streets of ams early sunday it was everywhere within half mile radius of the and probably all ams small groups of loud voiced apparent african immigrants were on some street corners we did not see very many muslim women in their tent like costumes however the litter had been all cleaned up by noon found a great breakfast place next to the flower market about a min walk from the hotel sunday at overall the area was great,1.0
this hotel is in the best location once we arrived from the airport by bus we could walk anywhere in a relatively short time plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from too the room was clean with nice view of a little garden staff was friendly and breakfast was terrific they even made me my breakfast in the kitchen since i have celiac disease and was concerned about cross contamination at the buffet,1.0
lovely room and leisure centre staff were very pleasant and we had a nice breakfast we had a very relaxed hotel is within walking distance to lots of sights it is located near bord gais theatre and epic museum,1.0
friendly helpful staff great central location with most dublin attractions in walking distance or taxis outside and bus stops close by including airport bus clean functional rooms value for money excellent breakfast would definitely recommend,1.0
this hotel was a sweep me off my feet kind of hotel mainly due to some wear and tear from people who generally abuse other people property but the service out of this world for this little hotel floors with maybe rooms per floor clean well staffed and the little restaurant which serves breakfast was great we generally stay in or star hotels however due to the concert and a late booking things were tough to reserve we found ourselves at the drury court which on paper is more rated as a star the staff at the hotel were super attentive and professional and what this hotel did have in the rating it certainly has in service we had a great stay and were very pleased with the overall experience we would return based solely on the service and attention which was paid to us as guests very minor tweaks would easily make this a thanks everyone,1.0
my family spent the night in a room for three and it worked out perfectly for us it was close enough to the railway station tram stop and also afforded us a lovely view of the harbor with the visiting ships arriving and departing,1.0
stayed here for nights days and we could fault any part of the hotel from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out every staff member was polite courteous and very friendly the receptionist sharzazz in particular was very good at her job and nothing was too much trouble for her she was very happy and friendly but also professional at the same time she clearly knows the hotel industry inside out the hotel itself was great room was clean and tidy and towels were changed every day breakfast is a buffet with all the usual cereals fried food continentals etc we did eat in the restaurant so canny comment on that the hotel bar was priced reasonably compared to the pubs and bars in the city centre a pint of guinness was from memory one thing i thought was a nice touch was vending machines on each floor perfect for those midnight snacks we definitely stay at this hotel if we ever visit dublin again,1.0
as others have said the group has done a wonderful job updating this hotel i stayed at the stephen green location earlier this year and it is a bit dated the alexander was an extremely pleasant surprise as i did not know it was under remodel they are still working on the restaurant lobby bar and the floor but i think this is going to be an amazing property when all is completed and the location is superb walkable to everything,1.0
this is a lovely hotel definitely the nicest one we stayed at during our tour de ireland the rooms are nice and updated and the bathrooms were very spacious i would say quality would be on par with a courtyard which is pretty good for a european hotel our room was on floor which is actually the second floor but it was very quiet even the night after a big match at croke one thing i did love was the location trade off it was a solid minute walk from downtown we timed it one night took to minutes to walk from christ church there not much around the hotel bleecker st cafe is a minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every min or so a can from temple bar costs to euros not a bad trade off for a quiet hotel,1.0
will go back friendly kind reception start to finish clean room service was very quite swimming pool was great my friend learned how to swim there his confident he can swim in the sea now,1.0
we visit inntel back in march when we visited amsterdam to celebrate our engagement having visited amsterdam a few times and always being less than impressed with our accommodation we thought we would give inntel a try we were blown away by the excellent level of customer service we received from all the staff checking in and out was painless and they could be more helpful when we had to leave our bags there for a short while the room is a very good size like i said i have visited a few different hotels and the rooms have been tiny but at inntel there is plenty of space around the bed and the desk and seating area is a nice touch i also love that they have baths after a day walking round amsterdam my legs are always in a sorry state so love having a relaxing bath we did not eat at the hotel but the food looked and smelt amazing we enjoyed our visit so much that we are returning next weekend for my birthday and have convinced my dad to take my mum away to amsterdam and stay with you in september i am looking forward to returning,1.0

we stayed for nights and had a wonderful stay serge at reception was very friendly and gave us useful information the room had a jacuzzi however the bubbles did work but it was still romantic we had the choice to get breakfast at the room or downstairs sharing a table with other guests we did both options we also had free wifi and to min walk to the station but the area felt quite safe at all times not suitable for kids i would say mainly as this is more suitable for couples on a romantic break we did hear any dodgy sounds from other rooms,1.0
excellent hotel with friendly staff and clean environment the facility was great and i will definitely recommend this place to others i will definitely book to stay at the herbert park hotel again in my next trip,1.0
they do understand the difference of freezer and refregerater when i was check in at midnight i asked the staff to freezed the icepack that i brout form my home because to make it cool to carry my sons eye medicine but after four days when i checked out and asked them to bring it back they give me a unfrozened icepack when i complained they just said sorry but now i really worry about the medicine if you are travelling with a child who need special care this hotel is not the right place the staff of this hotel are lack of professionalism,0.0
we stayed at the okura for the second time in july for our wedding anniversary this year we first visited three years ago and had such find memories that we thought we try it so pleased we did it such a beautiful and stylish hotel and in the best location the surrounding area has numerous bars restaurants and coffee shops and a tram line almost right outside so you do have to go right into the centre if you do want to we emailed the hotel to tell them it was our anniversary prior to going and they could have done more to make it special for us they upgraded our room to a suite which was absolutely very large with living room area and fabulous bathroom with tv huge shower and bath they also left a cake and fresh rose in our room which was a lovely welcome having an upgraded room allows you access to the lounge which is completely worth upgrading for lovely lounge room with great views complimentary alcohol soft drinks snacks tea coffee papers and internet very welcome after a long day or sightseeing the concierge were absolutely brilliant and recommended the perfect restaurants attractions and provided us with tram bad to say about the okura at all really lovely hotel brilliant location amazing staff and a very special place ca wait to go back,1.0

we wanted to stay at a hotel that was close to the temple bar area but not too close that it would be too loud at night this place was it easy walk to the jameson distillery and all the pubs we wanted to check out close to where the tour buses did their pick up for day tours plus it had air conditioning which was important to us the food at the downstairs restaurant was really good try their fish and chips and the manager really went out of her way to make sure that you have a comfortable stay the only down side was that they seem to be a popular place for wedding receptions and we could hear the guests when they were out at the area but we were exhausted from all the day activities that the noise did not keep us from sleeping i stay here again,1.0
beautiful comfortable and well appointed the rooms are generous in size the beds are comfortable and the linens soft the breakfast in the morning is fantastic i love the location right by a pedestrian bridge over the river liffey across from the temple bar area dublin is a great city and the morrison is a perfect place to stay,1.0

unlike the pictures on their website the room was very very tiny the two twin beds were actually pushed together and with a nightstand on both sides of the beds that was the extent of the width of the room the floor boards in the entire hotel creaked and moaned as you walked across the floor the window opened all of inches with no air conditioning and only a fan to cool down the room we felt like we were sleeping in a sauna it was horrible the shower had no cold water we called to get it checked out twice when they fixed it the second time the water went from scalding to hot and for some reason the cold water from the sink no longer was cold either try brushing your teeth with warm water yuk we tried to spend the entire day sight seeing because we dreaded spending any time in the teeny hot room,0.0
stayed here four nights very clean efficient and reasonably priced jerry and nancy were friendly and most helpful whenever i needed assistance will definitely stay here again when i am in dublin great value for the price,1.0

room was excellent cleaners were meticulous and reception staff spoke excellent english and had great local knowledge restaurant food was ok but rather bland however excellent and cheap local tapas bars just around the corner i am a nice bloke and normally give i am easily pleased so why halfway through our holiday we were attacked in our hotel room by a huge muscly naked man who was off his face on drugs we went and got security who manged to get him out of our room and back to his room when we went back in the room there was blood and water all over the floor we had to throw away our towels toothbrushes cosmetics and shower stuff as they were covered in his blood reception moved us to a different room for obvious reasons we had a great room overlooking the pool and with a view of the famous familia cathedral our new room was next to the main road looking at the hotel bins nice reception staff were nice and said sorry and that the following day management would speech to us and offer compensation nothing was ever said did they call the police we were just left in the dark i got the feeling this had happened before and the hotel wanted to hush it up was the naked man a manager we spent the rest of the holiday wondering if we would be sat next to him at breakfast not a nice feeling,0.0

my year old son and i stayed there last week and really enjoyed it the location is walking distance to almost everything you would want to see and do close by there are great restaurants and shopping there staff where very helpfully especially and doorman named john from montreal the rooftop restaurant had very good food and amazing views it is not inexpensive but great dollar value,1.0
stayed at the hotel for three nights and really have only positive things to saw what a great hip buzzing hotel a little loud perhaps but that is no secret if you read the reviews before coming they do give earplugs to sleep too which i found hilarious the service was fantastic great bar and restaurant which was also gluten free vegan friendly loved the room decor and features ca wait to go back with the mrs,1.0
the location is perfect close enough to the busy downtown far enough to have quite the hotel is clean the staff was very helpful and friendly breakfast not included unless you purchase it before hand a five minute walk to the buses tour bus airport bus perfect,1.0
service was excellent great location plenty to see and do people were very friendly and happy to help i would stay there again and recommend to friends and family traveling to dublin room was very clean,1.0
traveled to dublin for the liverpool fc game in the aviva at the start of august we arrived around and were surprised that our room was ready and we were able to go straight to it we were then surprised to find the rooms were massive then have plenty of free space enough to fit another double bed if they wanted rooms also include a big bathroom although the shower is not as powerful as i would like a refrigerator and tea coffee making facilities free wifi is also included in the room did not eat or use the leisure facilities so i can not comment on bord gais is directly across the road i found that there is not much around the hotel except bars and is a decent walk to street so a bit out of the way aviva stadium is also roughly a walk away location is the only let down i had but it really was a fantastic hotel i would stay here again not problem especially if there was something on in bord gais,1.0
the positives the location of this venue is absolutely perfect minute walk to the diagonal mar shopping centre and minute walk to the beach minutes walk front desk staff were awesome and always to assist checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no at staff in the restaurant in the evening were very and the food quality was very buffet was fine good choice of and the options for which type of breakfast were junior suite has a large bathroom and the bed was negatives sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to junior suites are on all floors the first suite and not ideally placed next to the housekeeping room so there is a lot of noise from the housekeeping door being and the room attendants and their associated room attendants failed badly on the night first night we opted just for change of towels but nights the room was not cleaned properly not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a job not once but twice after we complained to front desk things were fine but the staff on housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple second problem is that whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time if you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling,1.0
double and single bed in the room pleanty of space to move about tea coffee and kettle iron board bath hair dryer good breakfast very clean most of all good friendly staff all over the hotel,1.0
we stayed in a junior suite as our daughter was travelling with hotel is on the canal and central for all the main city interior is sophisticated and well light with exotic plants and is a small koi pond by the bar is inviting and well is a free coffee facility in reception and there is always cakes and treats on the coffee reception staff are very room was excellent with a small balcony overlooking the would definitely recommend the hotel for a city cheap but worth it,1.0
i stayed at the amrath from to july the architecture is amazing built in the early century and the interior still has original details i was making trips from the central rail station each day it is a very short walk from the hotel you must be careful of cycles and trams if you are not used to them in the basement is a swimming pool and spa especially good as the weather was very hot and a cool swim was a good way to end the free mini bar was also welcome as it had plenty of cold soft can get very crowded in july and august and for sightseeing i would recommend spring or autumn fall the dutch rail system is efficient and by far the best option to get to all the interesting places in the country,1.0
after an exhausting and disrupted trip from the usa my wife and i spent our first few nights in ireland at the clontarf castle hotel sans luggage for the first two nights the rebuilt castle part of the hotel was a grand and impressive welcoming venue and the staff were friendly and helpful our room was clean spacious and modern and was in a more recent addition to the rebuilt castle century reconstruction on an ancient site so one does not have the experience of sleeping in a castle room but the room was fine and as soon as you go to breakfast and dinner or have a drink in the bar you are back in the castle and have the enjoyment that comes from being amid a castle ambience based on two dinners at the hotel i would say the food was very good and the portions were ample the art and artifacts that adorned the castle and newer wing are impressive to say the least from a shining suit of armor of course to contemporary labelled artworks there is an impressive array that makes the clontarf castle hotel a most enjoyable venue and although it is not located downtown the hotel is a short cab ride from the heart of old dublin the cathedrals dublin castle and the site of the viking village it was a great place for us to begin our tour of central ireland and we would readily return and yes we were reunited with,1.0
this is a great hotel for both business and holiday makers though they claim that this is an airport hotel it is not really close to the airport and the shuttle service can take up to minutes each way to and from the airport the airport is well connected to the city center by train and the train ride into the city center is only mins so all in all it is possible to get to the center of the city from the hotel within rooms are very comfortable with all amenities that you will expect from a good hotel the gym is small but well equipped and while i was there there were hardly any gym users so it is was quiet and comfortable this hotel does not have a swimming pool and this was a downside for in the hotel are again a bit small but the food is reasonable priced and quite tasty so if you decide the stay in eating at the restaurant is a good highlight for me were the surroundings of this hotel which make for great walks each morning and evening be sure to swing left and you can reach the dyke in less than mins making for a great walk along the dyke with lots of birds in the water there is good restaurant bij quins which is housed in a old pumping station along the dyke the food is great but you will need to reserve seating for are no shops,1.0
if you only have one day in athens stay here can walk to everything the rooftop is great for evening drinks and breakfast i would recommend the were out of of fish entrees and the food was mediocre it is clean quiet and the best location,1.0
we recently stayed nights at this hotel we found everything was excellent from the staff to the rooms to the bar there was nothing not to like the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly we were able to walk to most attractions and took advantage of the hop on hop off buses to tour the area given we had limited time in barcelona,1.0
we stayed here for one night before our cruise traveled with a tween so needed a triple room and we were very happy with the size of the room and the amenities checkin in was easy and our room was ready early we had a corner with large windows and a street view with lots of natural light but good light blocking curtains for sleeping road noise was not really an issue for us separate bathroom and large foyer was very nice a problem with wifi in the room was fixed quickly upon request we enjoyed the pool area all afternoon and had a nice snack in the evening downstairs in the restaurant wait staff were very nice and accommodating we were thrilled with the pool and rooftop area the breakfast the next morning was fantastic tons of fresh fruits eggs breads charcuterie cheeses etc something for even mimosas we will definitely recommend to traveling,1.0
we had the misfortune in encountering a taxi strike the day we left barcelona and would probably have missed our flights had paula not alerted us to the problem and arranged a solution this hotel is close to the gracia neighbourhood which is a great place to eat and explore and is only away from the metro which takes you to place catalunya which is central stayed at this hotel for a week and was totally rested,1.0
hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated the breakfast buffet was the best i had of any hotel stay the location is close to everything in the city center so it was easy to walk around and enjoy the local shops and restaurants,1.0
good location seconds to grafton street very friendly front of house staff nice rooms although my room was on the small side and the room and bathroom could probably do with a refurbishment very nice lobby area and bar the letdown was the breakfast service with slow and very unfriendly service especially compared to other hotel staff on morning four i just got up and walked out after waiting min to try and order no hot buffet received an apology later and coffee in bar as compensation but then drink was charged on checkout,0.0
i have just returned from a two night stay at your wonderful hotel where nothing was a problem to resolve i must mention in particular anne kinsella who looked after us so well and marvin who very kindly walked us to the gaiety in case we got lost the restaurant staff were excellent and all our requests were met i look forward to returning and will be recommending it to all my friends in cork and elsewhere thanks again kay,1.0

we stayed for nights on mid july the room we booked was really spacious with a very nice balcony overviewing akropolis clean and a good service from the club upstairs the only issue for this hotel is that is not in center but you can still get the bus shuttle to sintagma every half be back soon,1.0
located next to the famous nou camp metro nearby many food shops around they are open until about easy to a catch a taxi but we used public transport barcelona center is really nice a must at night time not to mention other stuff i mean lot to see in barcelona anyway hotel was nice and would stay here again,1.0
my wife and i always prefer the smaller boutique hotels when we travel and this one did not let us down most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional though small they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure the staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat shop and when to do what i believe there are only rooms at this hotel we had a floor room with a small balcony overlooking la ramblas the room was probably entry level thus very small but we have been in smaller you can hear the metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms we heard it on the floor but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep maybe because we were so exhausted every evening the floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites the roof top bar is very quiet as it is primarily hotel guest the pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails nice place for a drink before you head out for the hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area you are in the center of la ramblas and in the heart of the gothic quarter so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the la boqueria market which is almost next door you are also a very short walk from the,1.0

we tried this restaurant during our walk downtown athens we were surprised by the variety of the menu for a light dinner the salad with prosciutto was amazing we also tried the greek cheeses dish and it was also good the chef with the eyeglasses was very helpful and he was explaining with politeness and professionnalisme all the details of the dishes best choice for a light dinner downtown,1.0
fabulous hotel not cheap but get what you pay for room was lovely and spacious privilege double and the bed was the most comfortable i ever slept in it was heaven booked direct with hotel and included breakfast in package and so glad we did as the breakfast was the best breakfast i ever had delicious fruits ham cheese cakes hot food cava it was endless the roof top pool was a welcome relief although jammed with guests in the afternoon and you are unlikely to get a bed or chair but does stop you dipping in the pool drinks on rooftop are expensive service at hotel excellent and the lobby areas are beautiful great location as well for all the sights and despite being on the busy las ramblas it was surprisingly quiet in the rooms at night i would definitely stay here again although next time i would bring my own coffee for the room as the nescafé cheap offering was pants,1.0

titania hotel is ideally situated in the heart of athens and is only a short walk away from syntagma square and the shopping centre my husband and i only stayed for two nights before and after our trip to syros but we ll definitely choose titania for a longer stay next time we visit rooms are spacious functional and beautifully decorated cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city we were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the parthenon as we had to catch the ferry to syros very early in the morning we greatly appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet consisting of a wide variety of jams bread rolls croissants cheeses delicatessen fruit cereals and sweets normal breakfast includes hot dishes as well such as eggs omelette bacon baked should not leave titania hotel without having a drink or dinner at olive graden situated on the floor and offering a superb view to the pathenon by night although the restaurant is a bit pricey it s well worth the experience the food is excellent and the service is impeccable all the staff are very polite and helpful for all these reasons i strongly recommend titania hotel for couples families or business,1.0

picked this hotel because i was going to be in dublin for one night after touring so glad i did the location is fantastic for the center of dublin close to bars restaurants and shopping the staff could be more helpful a pleasure to deal with the room was comfortable ample sized the only drawback is the fact that they are renovating so the smell of paint was in the hallway and there was scaffolding on the window but no noise,1.0

myself and my friends went to dublin for a stag do prices for hotels in dublin are generally pretty extornionate so you expect a decent place to stay this hotel was just that the bar and reception were well presented the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable the food menu is good for a day stay the breakfast buffet in particular was delicious location wise a short walk gets you into dublin although those not as keen on the distance can get a taxi booked at reception all in all a great hotel,1.0

on arrival at the hotel we felt we were inappropriately greeted at the front desk with an unwelcoming attitude in comparison to other guests checking in parallel to us who were provided with maps and received a friendly welcome on the first evening what should have been a relaxing bar experience after our journey was another disappointment the bar man focused his attention solely on mature american guests and ignored us when it was quite clear that we had empty glasses on our table and required service there was certainly no excuse for this as the bar was not busy in addition our bar dining experience was yet another disappointment having ordered and received our steaks they were both not done as requested in fact they were medium rare no service check was provided to enable us to easily rectify the situation one would expect this to be a natural part of the food service in a hotel of this standard worse was to come we attempted to order desert only to be told that the kitchen was closed again guests would expect to be warned of the impending kitchen closure whilst finishing ones meal so that any final orders could be fulfilled staff attitude and communication left a lot to be desired in this instance after receiving a lack of information at check in we approached a member of staff in the coffee area to enquire about hotel facilities however before he could ask him a question he stated,0.0

i paid approx for a room for one night breakfast not included as my partner and i were down to dublin to watch coldplay i will admit it was close to croke park upon arrival the guy on reception assumed my partner and i would want single beds being guys when i corrected him and said the double was fine he smirked and went ahead with checking us in the hotel must of been grand and luxurious at one stage but it is dated and old now a bit of reinvestment by the owners would do wonders for the business the bedroom had old creaky furniture which was too big in a small room the bathroom was tiny but did have a nice selection of soaps and products a wet room would be much better here the room was spotless and there was a kettle and coffee but no tea also in the room is an iron plus board and a hairdryer there was no air conditioning unit and the room was roasting would have been ok with windows there but we could open them more than a crack although we were there on a saturday the area did have much happening and seems to be pretty quiet the hotel has a pool and leisure facility which we did have time to but you do need a code from reception to get into it a carvery was offered in the and upon inspection we decided it would be better to,0.0

i visited this hotel having made a quick booking at the last minute through the club carlson app and opted for a prepaid non refundable rate which included breakfast i chose the hotel because i had noticed it on previous visits to amsterdam when i had stayed at the krasnapolsky which is relatively nearby i wanted to be near the train station on this occasion and hence my decision untypically i began to read tripadvisor reviews after i had completed my booking and as quite a number were unfavourable i felt a degree of trepidation and foreboding that i had made a terrible am happy and relieved to be able to report that i had a thoroughly pleasant stay notwithstanding that the hotel is undergoing massive refurbishment the temporary entrance to the hotel was for example down a narrow alley which would be daunting for the fainthearted if they arrived in darkness there seems nothing to fear however because i walked freely and in safety around the area in the stayed in what is called the urban wing my room was modern clean well equipped and of a reasonable size the decor is perhaps a little dark but this is to some people taste and not to others i quite liked it the staff were coping remarkably well with the works that were ongoing and while the works are obviously very extensive with dozens of various tradesmen in hard hats coming and going and my experience was that the works,1.0

super easy to get to from the airport bus or stops right outside the hotel fantastic lobby area bar and restaurant snacks and essentials available to buy in reception complimentary cakes every day staff were very friendly and helpful city map available rooms were spacious the single beds huge and very comfortable not much noise at all and we slept well great wifi and tv bathroom was spacious and had complimentary toiletries and plenty of towels my only complaint was the shower wasn t very powerful so it took a long time to rinse my long hair there was a safe iron tea and coffee making facilities lots of wardrobe space and a full length mirror we also had river views which were lovely a high standard of cleanliness it s a good walk to the temple bar area but it s a pretty walk along the river we walked everywhere from the hotel the guinness storehouse being a walk most places of interest were roughly walk away we didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that aspect the hotel has excellent public transport links and the hop on and off bus stops right outside the loved this hotel and would stay here again i d recommend for adults rather than children,1.0
we found all the staff very helpful and approachable they made a big effort to engage with guests which gave a friendly feel to our stay the breakfast was plentiful and good quality our room was not big but adequate for a night stay very little storage in the room for clothes so only hung up what would crease hotel bar is full of character helped along by the bar man who has a dry sense of humour the central position of the hotel meant we could get to most places easily,1.0
i stayed at economy for two days before meeting a friend in the cyclades the room was nice with a small balcony staff were loaning me a charger for my computer when i forgot my converter providing directions etc breakfast is a very simple buffet but fine the location is great and i would stay there again,1.0
great location and very friendly and helpful staff the rooms a very nice appointed with nespresso coffee machine and giant tv with german and english channels free wine cocktail hour in the evening the concierge was very helpful in advising us on everything same price museum tickets without having to commit to a special day all a very good experience,1.0
my son and i stayed here for nights the rooms are well maintained and bathrooms are clean but with the shower in the were allocated a room with poor wifi connectivity but were moved once we reported the issue wifi is good in the room and lounges but be careful as some rooms do not have wifi repeaters and therefore poor only had one meal at the hotel and enjoyed it staff are friendly and helpful,1.0
the plusses great location for the arena handy for the airport and the luas the stop is just outside great rooms a good restaurant good bar and a good breakfast staff were very friendly though i found that getting things done took longer than expected the minuses the port area is surrounded by construction which means that at some point this looks likely to become a buzzing area but at the moment it is a minute walk to the grand canal street area with its great restaurants and cafés and longer to the city centre the walk did bother me as i happened to be staying during a week of fine weather but i would be keen to be so far out of the centre in rain or cold moreover taxis seemed to have a problem both picking up from the hotel and dropping off in front we kept getting dropped off a few minutes walk away which i did appreciate late at night also the floors dedicated to rooms are a maze i had friends staying on the floor below me and searching for their room the first time was an experience for us i were in town specifically for the arena i would probably stay somewhere more central but for those needing to be in this area the gibson is a very fine choice,1.0
hotel is beautiful location is perfect rooftop was great and changed rooms as initial room was tiny we changed to and was just enough bigger to make the difference no one would be happy in breakfast buffet was amazing staff great,1.0
the maldron hotel pearse street is a clean comfortable hotel the hotel is walking distance from city center and about minutes from the dublin bus airlink pearse street station stop making this hotel ideal for a short stay on a long layover front desk staff is excellent and at times provided rooms are available will allow early recommended,1.0
we found the croke to be a very pleasent hotel for staying a few days in dublin we stayed there with our daughter and it was one of the very few hotels that offered a family room for the three of us the breakfast was great and we enjoyed the well equipped fitness room every morning we also appreciated the very knowledgeable concierge who helped us organize our tours in dublin it is located a bit outside of the city center but it only takes you a minutes walk to get there,1.0

the hotel is beautiful and very close to great restaurants and not a very far walk from the acropolis minutes the thing that sets this hotel aside from others is the staff they are very accommodating and have great advice on restaurants you know th advice is good when you run into staff members at the restaurants they refer you to not to mention the breakfast was delicious i would stay here again in a heartbeat,1.0
my wife and i stayed two nights at the ohla eixample and july took the aerobus from the airport to placa de catalunya and from there the hotel is a pleasant minute walk straight up rambla de catalunya before taking the last left onto carrer de corsega before you hit avinguda diagonal you can get there on public transport as well but if you do have a lot of luggage i recommend the was a breeze and while we were there i heard the staff speaking to guests in german and italian as well as english and rooms the whole hotel in fact is tastefully decorated to a very high standard with lots of nice little touches like built in usb chargers beside the desk a discreet room safe with an integral power socket so you can leave your ipad or laptop in the safe and charge it at the same time and room lights with levels that you can control from either side of the bed the hotel offers free but not terribly fast as well as an ethernet connection in the did make use of the lobby bar or the restaurant but we did spend the last couple of hours before our flight home on the roof terrace where they really have made the most of the space available with a pool and sun loungers cafe seating and a fully stocked bar we ordered a burger and a club sandwich while we were here and both were freshly,1.0
spacious suites with lovely view on the canals staff was wonderful helped us out with everything restaurants tickets they really know the city would recommend it to all my friend to stay in this hotel,1.0
we visited the hotel in feb and again april it a great local small boutique style hotel it is well located and a cute looking see no reason not to visit the staff were very good and even emailed prior to visit to assist with our specific requirement for a family reunion thanks,1.0
great hotel hip hyatt we stay here when in amstrdam have connecting rooms with kids breakfast is fantastic buffet but a classy and serious buffet although the wait is sometimes too long for the coffee order think housekeeping can also be more proactive in putting new soap we stay at least a week when we are in amsterdam shampoo and cleaning up empty bottles etc if the hotel sends up for example a piece of and you take one bite they will leave it in your room for days so housekeeping needs a bit more attention and please please please do turn off my air conditioning by taking out the room key from the electrical trigger thingie i hate coming back to my room and having to wait two hours before the temperature is back to where i want it,1.0
shared a twin room with my best friend on a night break everything was top class loved the room little balcony modern shower ca fault it very clean we sat upstairs on the roof top one night and tapas and drinks were brought up to us they said minutes it was only what can i say reception staff were truly delightful always helpful we were on the floor their are two lift wifi was good,1.0
this hotel was located in a great area everything is within walking distance las rambles and the airport shuttle were only a few blocks away as well as the university the hop bus is nearby too the breakfast opens at but we had to depart to the airport shuttle by so they packed a good breakfast for us to take with us the room was large with a king size bed and it was very clean the flat screen tv was large the room was very clean our room over looked the street and their was very little noise the hotel staff was friendly we were in town for one night but will definitely stay here again,1.0
being an spg member i loved the flexibility this hotel offered me it was one of the ones available for the dates i was traveling but i must say i was impressed by the rooms had both the standard and deluxe rooms and they were pretty comfy and offered ample space for groups to get dressed and sleep one thing i must point out is that this hotel went above and beyond for my birthday waiting for me in my room was a handwritten card and some pastries to congratulate me on my birthday which was the same day i checked in so shout out to them for that gesture would stay here again nice view of the river but restaurant is a little expensive,1.0
the staff speak perfect english food on roof top superb pool too small kids took over rooms comfortable and spacious beds lovely clean centrally located this is a must stay in barcelona boutique style hotel built behind the old facade modern well equipped rooms,1.0

they do understand the difference of freezer and refregerater when i was check in at midnight i asked the staff to freezed the icepack that i brout form my home because to make it cool to carry my sons eye medicine but after four days when i checked out and asked them to bring it back they give me a unfrozened icepack when i complained they just said sorry but now i really worry about the medicine if you are travelling with a child who need special care this hotel is not the right place the staff of this hotel are lack of professionalism,0.0
my mother and i chose this hotel for the end of our athens trip due to the price the hotel itself was fine very courteous and helpful staff moderately comfortable mattresses clean room the room was very much no frills with tile floor throughout and a miniature bathroom this being said location of this hotel is in a very unsafe block of town it is fairly close to a main street but i would never walk down those streets in the night and was uncomfortable in the day the closest underground metro station omonia is the most dangerous in athens we did know this about the area talking to many locals in restaurants and uber drivers confirmed how unsafe this area is if this hotel were transplanted to a safer street it would be the perfect basic affordable hotel however based on the location we do not recommend,0.0
we loved our stay at this hotel the suite was wonderful had every luxury comfortable bed etc the pool was amazing and we loved the setting for our nightly drinks with a spectacular view very central to everywhere wonderful service and friendly staff,1.0
initially we booked a hotel miles away from the city centre then came across barry hotel the price was cheaper and is literally around the corner from street high street the room was a decent size and to a good clean standard there was always someone on reception to assist if needed and a breakfast could be provided at an additional cost of the odd improvement could have been made to the interior here and there but this was not an issue for us as we were paying to stay at the hilton the fire alarm did sound once or twice during the early morning but stopped before we had a chance to react the windows were only single glazed expectant of a georgian period building so the odd bit of traffic could be heard although if you truly commit to irish culture getting to sleep after a long day of exploring dublin should be an summary we would definitely stay here again but if you used to staying at more high end establishments this hotel may not be for you the location saved us a lot of time and energy and the staff were helpful and polite if we ever look to visit dublin again this hotel will be our first choice,1.0
nice room and good equipment kindly personal and very good breakfast just a little far from the center but near the metro and the main bus lines for visiting go there and you should be happy recommended,1.0
incredible location right on la rambla so you can walk anywhere the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel is secure with hour reception and elevators the rooms get a lot of street noise but are insulated from it when the windows are closed great people watching from our room two balconies,1.0
very bad staff management and attitude for a star hotel we checked into this hotel with adults and child but apparently we booked a room for adults and child by accident we showed up with passports and the man at the reception simply said you ca stay here with an attitude he was very impatient and did seem like he wanted to try to help us after talking to him for a bit he said there a room at another floor and checked us in our luggage took forever to be delivered to our room like a good hour or so later this woman walks into our room without knocking on the door and says she needs to check the mini fridge did not say anything like i sorry to disturb you or i come back later but simply came in and said she needs to check the fridge after checking she says there are stuff missing in the fridge when we literally just checked in a few hours ago should this be done before we are brought to our rooms then later at night we get a strange call from the desk asking if we want the other room because we never got the key but we did they also said someone came in but since we did have the key they found it strange and asked us a bunch of random questions when we kept telling them we got the key and we were the ones who entered,0.0
no wonder this hotel seems to be constantly sold out it may have the best ratio in amsterdam the hotel is located in amsterdam zuid next to the rai train and underground station a tram stop line no and a bus stop the ride to the centre takes minutes and trains go frequently rai station is only two stops from schiphol airport our comfort room was sufficiently spacious with two large windows very comfy bed and the usual motel one bathroom now featuring cosmetic tissues magnifying mirrors will be introduced until end of as always with motel one there were no closets just a few hangers and shelves but that was ok for our stay the room was very clean so far but the windows and the upper part of the leather headboard were a very annoying thing the elevators have just a call button on upper floors which means you ca indicate if you want to go up or down wthich leads to many unnecessary stops of the already crowded was of high quality with many local dutch items as usual with motel one it was served in the bar lounge area meaning sitting pretty cramped sometimes at low lounge table sometimes on bar said we nevertheless enjoyed the stay very much and will happily return as we ca think of a better affordable alternative,1.0
arrived from paris by thaly train service this hotel was perfect as it was just a minute walk out of the station staying two nights we were on the floor facing the front giving us great views took city sightseeing tours both bus and boat as for the bus we were seated on the top deck the configuration of the bus with its obstructed view made it next to impossible to take photos in addition the glass ceiling produced a greenhouse effect making the bus extremely uncomfortable even though the air conditioning was on the canal cruise you have your pick of different routes was a better experience check out the ruks museum and a good photo opp of the i love amsterdam sign behind the museum also the diamond cutting store is also on the tour we purchased a nice watch there and the staff filled out the vat form for us the hotel has an extremely tasty buffet breakfast service it also had a nice serving decent food at a good cost we found that getting meals outside was problematic due to the extreme numbers of people the train station itself does have some restaurants and stores a pleasant experience at ibis amsterdam central,1.0
flew into barcelona a day early for a med cruise asked for an early as we were coming off and overnight flight we were given a lovely room mini suite with a view of the avenue very comfortable room blackout curtains so we could sleep for a bit very efficient air staff was welcoming and friendly providing us with a local map and directions the hotel is very well located only a couple of blocks from las ramblas and close to the gothic quarter it was a great place to stay in a great city,1.0
traveling with our children we needed a nice but affordable hotel in athens he hotel was perfect for our needs and we got two rooms very nice hotel and the man at the front desk spoke english and was very nice breakfast was free and had an excellent variety with something for everyone just remember that the key card needs to be in the slot on the wall in order for the lights and ac to work the hotel is not directly near the main attractions such as the acropolis but this is what makes it more affordable and it only a minute drive from acropolis area we highly recommended this hotel for the price,1.0
i went to this hotel and asked for a room the girl at reception who was too busy flirting with a mexican old man took a long time to even say hi when she finally acknowledged my presence she gave me a price for a room which changed every day what the f and which ended up being different in total when she finally gave me the room higher than she initially said as she kept adding things she showed me one room that looked nice and big before booking it and then gave me a key card for a very small one with a very small bed the hotel does not look good inside halls elevator etc i was very upset so asked for a refund and left i do not do con artists or liars i recommend you stay away from hotels that abuse their customers go to hotels that respect you and have decent honest prices that match what they offer,0.0
we loved the electra palace location was fantastic right in walking distance of the plaka district and easy to get to all the sites the breakfast was huge and high quality lobby was spacious and had two computers we used to book our ferry tickets and some excursions room and bathroom were a little small but clean and in general could use some updates all in all i would stay again but a little pricey for what its worth,1.0
during an unplanned stay in barcelona after my flight was delayed and my luggage was lost i made a late night booking at hotel to my surprise the staff at was pleasantly helpful and accommodating and the process was relatively my further surprise the room was relatively spacious the bathroom split toilet in one stall shower in another and the shower staff was exceptionally offered a small amenity kit a minibar for purchase room service until sat tv with dozen channels and excellent climate my room faced the street gran via it was still relatively beds were reasonably comfortable with sufficient pillow the location is excellent cafes and restaurants within a short walking distance small market across the street for late night snacks or drinks and walk to the metro station which can take you to other parts of the city within a few stay was so pleasant in fact that i decided to stay a second night while i awaited my luggage to arrive from another city,1.0
this hotel had everything we needed for our night stay in dublin location is great you can walk to all attractions we walked to everything dublin has to offer except the airport bus stop for the airlink airport bus fare is euro is just min away the hotel room itself was small for american or german standards but it had everything you need beds were comfortable and the tiny bathroom had a shower there was a tv with not many channels hot water kettle for and a safe in the room for your valuables built in shelves but not much room to maneuver around the building was old as most in the centre of dublin are but everything was clean and you can open the windows there was no but it was not needed either we were there end of august and it was only in the during the day there was a radiator for heat ca say anything about it as we did need heat either staff is very friendly the irish breakfast buffet not included was very good and carried you through the day until afternoon tea or coffee our room was facing the street and there was some street noise during the night you may want to ask for a room in the back of the building if that bothers you overall the perfect place for my sister and myself for our excursions in dublin,1.0
this is a quality clean hotel and staff is efficient friendly and professional the breakfast was fantastic what a great view of athens the elevator requires your room key to activate makes you feel completely will always stay here when we are in athens,1.0

this hotel is in a strategic location just across the main train station the brilliant harmony between the interior redecoration and the theme of art sculptures is mind blowing this is evident even in the finest detail such as the carpet design the theme has to do with the evolution of life with its daunting lessons we all come to realize being able to achieve such a powerful design impact on the inside while preserving the exterior shell of the historic building is a fantastic work of art this is on top of the friendly hospitality fine dining and comfortable lavish rooms,1.0
clean and quiet when i was there though it was a week night welcoming staff allowed an early and were helpful recommending restaurants room spacious and comfortable would happily stay again,1.0

my husband and i stayed at ariel house for three nights in july and to say that our stay was absolutely wonderful is an understatement the location is quiet convenient and charming the hotel is beautiful and comfortable the breakfast is fantastic the customer is outstanding and beyond anything we have ever experienced upon our arrival i was quite ill and realized that i required medical attention cecelia immediately called different medical providers and arranged an appointment and transportation to the facility on that first evening we had an unfortunate accident involving the toilet in our room our fault the ever kind and cheerful cecelia evaluated the situation and arranged an alternate room for the night the toilet was repaired actually replaced the next morning at and the owner jennie absolutely refused to allow us to pay for it jennie and her staff assisted us with bus routes sightseeing tickets and more the staff is readily available to assist with any questions and requests when we return to dublin we would not even consider staying anywhere else ariel house does have ample parking and is a leisurely walk from the nearest bus stop congratulations to ariel house as you are finest accommodations in dublin sincerely your american friends karen and gary gray,1.0
second time back to grand hotel central coming off the back of my first stay last year and what a brilliant hotel from top to repeating most of what i wrote last time the staff location hotel in general were all as to be expected perfect they will do anything to help you and go out of their way to ensure you are having a pleasant stay excellent roof top pool gives you such a good city scape view but do make sure you also go for a drink at night the ambiance is totally different and seems to be quite a hot spot for guests to brilliant and ca wait to come back,1.0
the only thing that would make this hotel a better experience for a mid price hotel would be a better kitchen the room service food was disappointing however everything else here is a winner lovely staff a comfortable hipness totally unpretentious yet stylish the rooms are not huge but tick all boxes especially the comfortable beds for a barcelona beach weekend on a medium budget this was a find oh and the pool is quite nice for a rooftop pool i would stay here again,1.0

i booked this for a city break with my daughter and was attracted by the central location accommodation in dublin is relatively expensive particularly the city centre hotels i booked online and chose a twin ensuite room but what we actually got was a whole apartment with single rooms a bathroom a lounge and a kitchen we were only there for one night but if we been staying longer we would have made more use of the lounge and kitchen it was clean secure had free and was located in a nice quiet corner of the campus ideal for our needs there was also luggage storage available before and after which was handy,1.0
great location rooms at back clean cleaning staff seemed to take a genuine pride perhaps motivated by wall mural of cleaning staff air conditioning worked well shower was excellent breakfast was really good layout was great and variety of foods available serving staff were great attentive when needed but not in your face,1.0
we took our extended family on a trip to ireland and booked this hotel primarily because they offered family rooms for those of us with children in tow in addition it a nice location near but not in the middle of most tourist sights from the time we arrived at am hoping for early access to our rooms the hotel staff exceeded our expectations they worked hard to get us in as soon as they could were very helpful and accommodating about needed services extra blankets pillows etc and suggestions for tourist options rooms were clean and spacious the restaurant offered a very nice full buffet breakfast at a very reasonable price ours was included in our rate three bus lines stopped in front of the hotel all in all a very nice stop with special thanks to the wonderful staff,1.0
i stayed here for nights while visiting getting the metro from the airport to the city take the sud to treessa i may be misspelling this and transfer to the until urgell the hotel is just a short walk from the urgell stop i would recommend getting the bcn card for days for at the airport this will cover all of your transport on metro train etc around barcelona as well as the trip to the airport our flight was delayed and i emailed the hotel and they kindly reassured me not to worry they have a hr check in the hotel staff kindly informed us of the onsite gym the restaurant and also the snacks and drinks available for purchase in the lobby hotel also has got a twin room which had a mini bar and the usual requirements the house keeping is very good and the room was always cleaned with plenty of clean towels it is a nice and modern had a difficulty with the safe in our room due to our own error and the lady on the front desk helped immediately to resolve were also stopped the night before we checked out by staff who kindly told us that there would be a taxi strike the following day in case we were getting a taxi to the airport this was first class service as we had not seen any news or notifications regarding the taxi strike it was real personal service and we really appreciated,1.0
we stayed here for a conference being held at adjoining convention center extremely convention center located behind the was very impressed with the hotel rooms differ in size and layout and was fortunate to have a larger room with a fabulous view to the south west looking over a harbour and a cruise ship was included in my room what a fabulous best i have seen lots of hot and cold food cheeses hams salmon eggs cakes and pastries it about a minute walk to the ramblos same to adjoining shopping center and harbor rooms were fabulously appointed and well i loved the shower with vertical streams of water as well as conventional shower a great for soaking my hot aching feet yes i do know how a bidet is meant to be used i never used the pool but it was surprisingly small according to my co is a large hotel but service friendly and helpful it conveniently located for conferences and to the city center,1.0

stayed a few nights last week to kick off a jaunt through spain portugal we re platinum and were upgraded to a higher floor facing the city beach which was appreciated decided against the club level upgrade since we d be touring most of the general the hotel is beautiful but falls a little bit short of standards the bathrooms were lovely sitting bed area plenty spacious but somewhat sparsely decorated definitely appreciated the shades as we were a little the hotel staff was wonderful and couldn t have been more helpful the folks at the desk were great the concierge was very helpful and the complimentary champagne cold water in the lobby is always appreciated the main issue we had with the hotel is the location it s located on the beach and is far from the old town tourist attractions sure you get access to the beach but most ppl don t come to barcelona for beaches and then there s the issue of foot traffic from the cruise ships which isn t always the most pleasant we found ourselves spending a significant amount of time in transit between the hotel and other parts of town when it would have just been easier to stay elsewhere overall a perfectly lovely hotel but be aware of its locations with regards to what you want to do and the extra time you may need to allot for transiting between the hotel and the main tourist attractions of the city,1.0
stayed for nights in the beginning of july quite charming place to stay and indeed very central it is walking distance to almost everything and the tram is also nearby this is very close to the dam square we had a window towards the busy street but it was surprisingly quiet still it was a bit damp atmosphere in the small room especially after showering but no big deal no aircon though but a fan is provided the receptionists were very kind and helpful smiling everytime we entered the hotel with steep was average but will definitely stay here once more if we ever visit again,1.0

the royal olympic is a lovely comfortable hotel that is located in easy walking distance to the many of the major sites in athens its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant which i shall review separately with breathtaking panoramic views that include the acropolis and the lycabettus hill the rooms were comfortable and well maintained although not we stayed at the hotel and both the beginning and the end of our trip both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool although our second room had only a stall shower but no bathtub as had been in the first the swimming pool was another welcome feature though not very large it was clean temperate and enough for swimming short laps there were sunbeds which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel as well at patio chairs and tables the staff was uniformly courteous and helpful and finally the price which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was quite reasonable though perhaps not the institution that it purports to be the royal olympic is certainly a comfortable place to stay when visiting athens,1.0
we were street facing and although the part revellers were expected the constant noise of lorries unloading beer barrels street cleaners and the like kept us awake all night the staff were very helpful there really is nothing they can do about the noise the owners need to address the lack of air conditioning and windows the rooms need modernising but if you are staying for just one night or two it a great location breakfast was nothing special i would have liked a traditional full irish but it was more like an english chain hotel reception staff very helpful,0.0
got a great deal for four nights at this hotel it is a little out of the way but the subway is just over the road and the main attractions really do take long to get to the rooms were spacious with amazing air con we used the gym a few times and it was great did eat at the hotel but the menu looked delicious reception staff were really friendly and helpful too i asked about the best way to get to the airport early and they booked a taxi for me would definitely stay here again,1.0
arriving at north star hotel in my car i soon realised that the nearest parking was mile away where i had to drag bags from the reception were that friendly and advised me there was no lift to the floor with my bags i went in the summer degree heat no air con in the room although a star and had to suffice to opening the windows which over looked a busy main road and very noisy so no sleep was had during the night i stayed i was meant to stay nights and checked out after stay at a least hotels a week and normally star worst star hotel i have stayed in for a while and not impressed by the cost nor the location avoid the only positive was the restaurant in the hotel who were excellent and great food,0.0
so good for a cheap place i really liked how the set up was and how we were able to go from place to place and make sure that the locaiton was legit all of that really helped and i hope to go again so i can help,1.0
absolutely stunningly designed boutique hotel in barcelona loved the location gothic staff food drinks the burgers and mojitos are delish the rooftop deck was lovely as long as you do want to actually swim the pool is only about a foot deep but we really did mind the guest rooms and baths are beautiful and well appointed the whole of the hotel including the is but i am sure that is intentional we found the small room a little challenging to manage with two large bags overall lovely,1.0
a little far from airport and shuttle requires fee free for hh members dinner was good also had entertainment in bar which was also good bed was a queen but was two less than twins couples together not great but we were exhausted and slept well,1.0
as a no service hotel element has cracked a formulae the hotel is great rooms are big and comfortable with a built in kitchenette connected to the mall so there is a supermarket open till pm on hand but all this is perfect for the business traveller whose work is in zuid if you are liking to spend two days in amsterdam as a tourist this hotel is a bit far from all the madness while it a min tram ride from the city centre it not a super huge inconvenience but for amsterdam where everything is five mins away this does seem a bit of a shlepp since the tram station is is min walk from the hotel but besides this one small issue the hotel is great and the staff is very helpful do note the breakfast is super healthy and vegetarian,1.0
perfect hotel in ideal location the rooms are carved out of several canal houses so be prepared to walk up down many levels and corridors everything was tastefully done right on down to the paint colors and artwork the staff was very efficient and accommodating the pulitzer bar was certainly a highlight as was the center garden did i mention the comfortable bed wonderful i will be back,1.0
stayed here in march this was supposed to be a three night stay but my wife uncle became very ill and had to return after one night spoke to hotel and even though it was booked through voyage prive they informed us they would happily refund the two nights we were not going to be there they were very sympathetic and very considerate this is a sign of a hotel that really cares the towels we had were new and so a lot of the fluff came off onto my black jeans but hotel stepped in and were willing to get them washed but i requested a flint roller and this removed the fluff so this was great service on the afternoon of us leaving we discovered how central the hotel was all you have to do is walk out hotel and walk to the right for minutes and you are in central barcelona amazing laughed when we discovered this as we had been using the metro before to get to the centre manager we spoke to when we were leaving was a very friendly lady if we go back to barcelona we will definitely want to stay again as rooms are clean and modern definitely worth staying here people,1.0
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hampshire hotel the staff were friendly and all of our queries and requests for assistance were dealt with promptly and efficiently we were disappointed on our first night to find ourselves in a room which overlooked a ventilation shaft in addition someone banged on our door in the middle of the night when we told reception they moved us to a lovely room overlooking a canal and gave us a free complementary breakfast the rest of our stay was perfect the hotel is ideally situated for the city and transport to the airport everything is clean and well cared for we would recommend the hotel as pleasant and good value for money amsterdam is not cheap,1.0
this is a great hotel the rooms are immaculate and there are extras that everyone loves slippers that are disposable and a bathrobe to use makes this stay a spa experience the lotions are top quality and they use the most comfortable bed linens there is a restaurant and bar on site so you can relax and enjoy also i felt very safe staying here since you needed a room key to use the elevator as well as opening you room i loved the usb ports were available at the desk in the room so you did need a converter it was a great stay,1.0
the property was great i would have liked to have my status as a lifetime platinum respected i got the same room as the people traveling with me none of them were even platinum i mention it to the checkin person but she said nothing,1.0
excellent hotel and i can definitely recommend i visited amsterdam for four days nights with my daughter i found the staff friendly and was impressed with the is good minutes from amstel station i unfortunately had a leg injury so might have taken me longer the restaurants looked very nice but probably too pricey for us good location,1.0
just returned from a three night stay hotel is situated in a area which makes it quite nice as it out of the busy tourist area still offers a lot around with great restaurants supermarkets and a market within min walk the metro in min walk and only stops from the main station the hotel itself is small but adequate staff are a real asset to the business on i discovered that my safe was not working and the receptionist on duty tried to fix it was unable to so called out the maintenance man who arrived an hour later to resolve the issue daily housekeeping was good cleaned the room thoroughly room had an air con which was definitely needed only let down was breakfast service was great and breakfast was neatly presented however the quality of ingredients was not that great which is a shame maybe we were spoiled by eating at one of the nearby bakeries two of the days but i think that this is one area that can be improved upon i would rather pay more charged at pp and have freshly squeezed juice better quality yoghurt etc having said all this it would not stop me staying again overall a great little hotel in a great area,1.0
good hotel with large breakfast buffet furniture carpet somewhat outdated well located to metro and tram in between downtown and congress center overall good experience for business and excursions,1.0

this hotel rocked if you are looking for rooms with tremendous size then you are not being realistic as that type of space does exist in amsterdam on the other hand the staff was very nice and accommodating we enjoyed the enjoyed the location we were able to walk everywhere would love to stay there again,1.0
our expected view of the canal was more a glimpse but as the staff had been so helpful in getting us into our suite really early i did not mind the room was beautifully appointed and furnished we found ourselves sleeping much longer than usual due to a combination of the peace and quiet of the hotel the blackout curtains and the superbly comfortable bed service was exceptional from all staff members particularly paul thomas and margeurite breakfast offers a wide is an historic hotel and its location is superb as we could walk to most attractions amsterdam in summer is very crowded and busy but all this disappears as you turn off the street to the haven of the courtyard and the hotel buildings,1.0
loved the historical aspect the park location the amazing and all of the of this place i felt like a local while being treated like a special guest i am hoping that this hidden gem stays as such so i can afford it the next time i go to amsterdam the white sangria imagined by bar manager dior is to die for the breakfast buffet is worth starving yourself the night before for,1.0

stayed here as our daughter was working in amsterdam and we were visiting for a long weekend and had things to see before we met up with location walkable to where we needed to go and well known enough to ensure the uber drivers could pick us up and drop us appointed room but due to the age of the building a slightly unusual layout but the bed was had just refurbished the bar area which is very nice when we were there and husband and daughters boyfriend watch the rugby in my ipad while my daughter and i sampled the cocktail menu which was very good unfortunately due to the layout the nice big comfy table could be seen from the bar but once you got their attention they were friendly and hotel would go back,1.0
this is a new clean hotel situated above a night club i do know who made the decision to put rooms where people are supposed to sleep above a pounding nightclub but it was a poor choice if you do wind up in this hotel request to be above the first floor or you wo sleep at all you might not sleep if you higher up as well calling the front desk does nothing they just tell you that the nightclub was supposed to be closed already at the location is convenient but it is worth not sleeping,0.0
excellent location between the seaside and the city centre lovely envoiroment recently refurbished rooftop swimming pool is amazing with a great service during all day staff is professional and polite,1.0
we stayed here for two nights although the second night we have to leave at in the morning for a flight it was clean comfortable and walking distance to the old town area and acropolis breakfast was simple but ok the only negative is the desk controls the air conditioning and will only turn down to a certain level not to your comfort level this part was not comfortable we had a view of an abandoned building but were in the room much anyway easy to find your way around from here,1.0
this was our first time staying at the corner hotel and we were treated like old family friends indeed we were treated better than most family friends the staff were the friendliest most genuine group of individuals i have encountered working for a hotel oh by the way did i mention the staff thank you vanessa lynn and serenna among many others as to all the other amenities you expect you expect from a hotel of this standard they all present and correct rooms are comfortable without being spectacular but this is barcelona who spends time in their room the breakfast is excellent the rooftop pool is a lovely place to relax the lobby area is a great place to try one of their amazing in all a wonderful place to stay go and stay you wo regret it,1.0
this restaurant sits atop this boutique styled hotel it has an unencumbered view of the acropolis and serves elegant greek dishes with a twist the service was outstanding and we had the most romantic evening drinking wine and enjoying the view i highly recommend getting a reservation however as this has become the hot spot in athens for even the athenians well worth stopping by,1.0
if you want something centrally located and away from the hustle and bustle of las ramblas this is the place to be clean spacious and just far enough away from big touristy crowds excellent location especially if you would like to immerse yourself in one of the old villages and be a part of the plaza life gracia was an awesome suburb to eat in and is close to metro we took advantage of the nice rooftop patio in between touring around and was great staff at hotel balmoral were also extremely helpful and knowledgeable muchos gracias,1.0

we had a nice room that looked over the canal spacious could use a dresser but it did really matter the staff was excellent especially dominique at the front desk she steered us in the right direction for food and local who took care of a lot of the dining room service was also stellar the food was very good especially the bitterballen the bar stayed open late and had a very nice vibe the clientele were very cool and well mannered to you could walk anywhere within minutes time,1.0

clean and modern hotel with very easy public transport access rooms are good sizes with a safe and mini fridge showers only no bath which was abit of a downside especially after long days of walking big comfy beds though staff all speak fluent english very helpful and is euro which is slightly over priced however no other places to eat fall into the trap of getting a taxi from the airport approx euro we got the train to amsterdam zuid straight from the airport then the metro to overamstel metro was for two days unlimited usage and train was for a single travel very easy and simple hotel was approx from downside is that it a isolated hotel with no nearby shops or restaurants hotel and hotel shop are very expensive,1.0
booked this hotel for a long weekend to dublin it was an easy stroll to grafton street and street it was the staff that made this hotel we arrived at and daniel on reception did a bit of shuffling and gave us a room straight away the same for the couple in front not many hotels do this this was a real bonus as we could get in immediately no hanging around and storing bags nice comfy lounge good self service breakfast with delicious yoghurts nice pub opposite called the ginger man just round corner from national gallery too,1.0
i just returned from days in spain and was lucky enough to spend the last three nights at the serras upon arrival we were greeted by happy staff members a warm towel glass of water and then a mimosa and the service continued at that level throughout our stay the rooms are high quality and i particularly enjoyed the baked treats and water left by our bed at night the location is great just a short walk to the picasso museum and great boutiques and restaurants the roofdeck was a great place to relax and have cocktails after sightseeing i highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again,1.0
same high standards lovely rooms great staff great location spotless nothing too much trouble only down side was the poor lady looking after us at breakfast she was amazing but needed a helping hand,1.0
the hotel is not close to the center but has a very good connection with dam square using tram the hotel is located in a green area near rembrandt park the services are ok breakfast is fresh and various at the floor with a very nice view over the city i ca say that is a stars hotel but could be a good choose for a crowded city like amsterdam another plus is that the hotel has its own bus to and from the airport taking only min one way road,1.0
nice clean hotel and good location room was clean and good amenities in the room minute walk from amsterdam square plenty of bars and eateries near by to the hotel only drawback on the room was the ceiling was quite low in our suite and if you over then you will bang your head on the wooden beams around the room,1.0
the hotel was about out of the city centre but only a min walk from a bus stop where buses ran every minutes friendly staff they could do enough including sending up maintenance straight away when the room safe failed and setting aside an area for us to put up pictures and play a few games for the hen food and reasonable bar prices fabulous,1.0

we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite upon our arrival at reception we were offered two double rooms instead which was a very welcome surprise this amazing service continued throughout our stay we were just minutes walking distance away from the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka if you get a chance book a rooftop table at their sister hotel herodion just around the corner for a spectacular sunset dinner with view of the acropolis,1.0
we were two couples in june wanted to have a hotel in the plaka district but all the affordable stars hotels were unavailable so we ended with this lovely hotel the room is spotless and spacious the bed which is very important to me when i travel is very comfortable also the pillows the amenities in the bathroom is standard there is no toothpaste and toothbrush and no shaving kit but honestly i did expect due to its price there is also a free shuttle to the center but we did use it the breakfast is okay there not much variety but i was pleased with got a massage in the spa which was very very good the service is very good and very reliable also the business room is very practical we made a check in to the flight and had them parented without any the last day when we finished our breakfast and intended to get in a taxi to the airport one employee of the breakfast worker came and gave us an phone which our friend forgot in all it a very good experience,1.0

good hotel in a reasonable location close to metro and beach purobeach pool is available to hotel guests but sun dloungers are charged for an in my opinion are very expensive breakfast is very good although the queue can get very long at peak times,1.0
it is close to the see and offices in that area however far from city center i could not set properly the room air condition it was too coold or warm i didn ot find description about room thermostat settings the area is quiet but i do not recommend to get room on the street side on to floors too much traffic noise,1.0
my boyfriend and i stayed here for one night in athens it was perfect for that amount of time the staff were very pleasant and the room was clean it also had a modern bathroom it a good hotel to stay in if you are getting the train to meteora which we were doing be careful walking around though we were in a beautiful area drinking wine and turned the corner and were in a very dodgy area i would recommend walking home in the dark comfy bed and excellent nights sleep,1.0
we had a great stay at the hotel we came to amsterdam for an extended weekend and find better place very good location quiet with walking distance to all interesting sights we loved stylish design of interior friendly staff small but very clean and comfortable room breakfast included i will recommend this hotel to my friends,1.0
i agree with a previous poster that this hotel does not respect its affiliation with fhr we arrived at the lobby is simple and beautiful and all the staff were amex platinum we have a guaranteed at noon at we were told there was no room ready we did mind at all said no big deal we have lots to do we are only here one night have to leave early so can we have a quiet room then we trotted off to walk around dublin had a ball on the trinity historic walking tour went to guinness and dinner and back to the hotel exhausted around to be brought to a room on the ground floor where the window is on ground level with a road um this seems like it is going to be a quiet no it is well of course it is ground floor it not a busy street noise and on top of that we were in the middle of a block of rooms of a family who are slamming doors and going into each other rooms and shouting down the hallways until surely management knew we were in their midst not sure what the morning will bring but i still up at feeling frustrated by not insisting on checking in earlier when we were here at the very least i thought our flexibility and cheerfulness would be a mark against us oh well a previous poster mentioned that they do like the amex platinum,0.0
upon arrival i was greeted with free ice cream which was perfect since i was in a hurry to get to my room change and head out to the convention center which i walked to every day comfortable clean room i enjoyed the free little cookies and even the candy bar on friday night yes you are in a lively loud area of the city as mentioned ear plugs are provided to use while there was a fan in the room i did not use it the room comes with all amenities except conditioner which is okay as i packed my own upon reading a previous post i could walk to many locations in the temple bar area including the locations of tours that i signed up for i appreciated the free map and directions since well google maps had me going in the wrong direction,1.0

horrible experience reception staff accused me of trying to leave without paying at despite us having paid them the full fare at i stayed here july with my boyfriend but by thought it was a bit strange that they charged us at also charged us a different price then quoted on when i booked about more and i pointed that out and they said it was due to taxes they also scanned both our passports and had us fill some forms with our home address and contact details they issued us a receipt which i showed to the staff as proof of payment but the staff would accept it claiming it was for another room and that my name did appear on the receipt they also refused to return the receipt i handed them and kept it despite the lengthy process with the passport scans reception staff at days later claimed they had no records of our or payment i asked them to check records of payments that day in both their booking system and their accounting but they did not want to help instead acting suspicious towards me and asking me questions indicating they did believe me eventually i had to pay again to end the scene and leave this time the fee i was charged was exactly the price we were quoted on and different from what we paid at again strange there was probably a mistake somewhere and i asked the reception staff to consider this but,0.0

great view of ronde lutherse kerk just across the street from our floor room the hotel was perfectly fine room with a comfortable bed the worked great expect plenty of tour groups and americans we were very pleased that we were able to check in early before after a long overnight flight from the us i suppose we were lucky that a room was available at that time but it probably did hurt to check in on the mobile app as an elite gold marriott member,1.0
great service from the front desk we arrived very early in the morning after being awake all night and we were checked in right away our room overlooked christchurch cathedral this hotel is in a great location to walk almost everywhere in dublin the only thing i would mention is that although we were three booked into the room we were given towels for two on more than one night and had to chase down an extra set otherwise we were very pleased,1.0

comfy hotel all mod cons really good breakfast available and caters well for those with intolerances we had a basement room with a courtyard view but it was lovely and airy so did actually feel like we were downstairs at all,1.0
booked king room with river view a bit pricey very clean and smart imaginative decor but bathroom disappointing shower over bath i would have thought a smart hotel would have made bathrooms as smart as the rest of the clean tidy cleverly decorated and furnished public areas staff equally smart and breakfast a la carte choices such as eggs benedict were best i ever had well done chef,1.0
this is a nice hotel close to the main city centre attractions easy enough close to a number of underground stations staff were friendly my boyfriend and i would like to mention member of staff miriam in particular she was incredibly helpful with check having to change to a quieter information nothing was too much trouble please send her our regards and best wishes rooms are a good size with a decent bathroom could perhaps do with some slight updating but it totally adequate for a city centre base did not have breakfast with the hotel as there are affordable alternatives nearby would recommend this hotel to friends and family,1.0

i stayed here in and the hotel was a great find back then i felt it was in a good location and the hotel was clean and modern however during my recent stay it was dated the bathrooms were the cleanest and the staff were not friendly the place has gone downhill there are also no safes provided in the rooms in a city with pick pockets galore you think this would be a standard amenity in a nutshell shame on you for claiming you are a star hotel,0.0
my husband and i recently spent nights at central athens hotel we are very pleased with our decision to stay in this hotel the rooms are spacious by european standards clean and modern the staff is very friendly and were helpful with any of our questions about the city or traveling in the area the rooftop bar was excellent we made a point to have at least one drink there every evening of our trip and we were never disappointed by the drinks or the view in addition we very pleased with the complimentary breakfast buffet you get a wide variety of choices including those that are and more authentic greek dishes central athens will even pack you a breakfast if you must depart before the buffet opens as was the case with our last found the location to be fine it is an easy walk minutes from the syntagma metro station which is a major stop for most modes of transit to and from the airport it is also less than a minute walk to the major flea market area of athens which we loved the walk to the acropolis was a bit longer but it could not have been more than minutes evidently athens is currently summer experiencing some domestic unrest but we never felt unsafe during our only problem that we have with the central athens hotel is the spottiness of their wifi it is free but it is also incredibly unreliable just be aware,1.0
perfect location for everything that you need great room would have loved to check out the bar too jet lagged next to gaudi home stroll to gothic area and marina cheap taxis to about it staff very friendly and helpful added to experience,1.0

this hotel is in the perfect location to acropolis plaka and are very small however clean and comfortable the only reason giving it instead if is the size of the bathrooms they are tiny be careful not to bump into the door handles which are sticking out very odd days and enjoyed every minute of it,1.0
we had awasome stay we had an eight flour junior suite bigger than our permanent place with a huge bathroom and an excellent beth and clean hotel in a nice neighbourhood and parking lot included in the room price staff helpful,1.0
the location of this hotel is very convenient it is a very short walk to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum as well as the plaka area the neighborhood is close to restaurants including those by the acropolis room was small but clean with included bath and balcony a nice touch was a small fruit plate and bottle of water provided worked it was needed as the temperature in athens was close to loved the breakfast with a nice selection of food including yogurt etc the staff was very friendly and helpful we let the hotel arrange our taxi to and from the airport would stay here again if we are able to go back to athens,1.0
this was possibly the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in smaller even than inside cabins on cruise ships that said the room had everything one would need including air conditioning a comfortable bed tv and a central location we might have been less happy but for the consistently friendly service we experienced from the entire staff this place is not handicap accessible there is a long and steep flight of steps leading up to the hotel which is on the second level of the building one of a series of small hotels within the same antique structure there is a nice reception and breakfast area the included breakfast offers breads cheeses cold cuts and scrambled eggs definitely sufficient to get you moving in the morning overall a reasonable value in an expensive city,1.0
whilst it is getting on in age the davenport was still very comfortable bathrooms a bit old fashioned but everything you need is there and the staff ca do enough for you buffet breakfast as good as the other hotels in dublin and belfast that we stayed location to walk to everything,1.0
we enjoyed our one night stay on a saturday night in july the hotel is large and in the newer part of dublin so it lacks some of the charm of a boutique hotel however there are plenty of amenities vending machines with drinks and adapters and a nice large restaurant where we had a nice dinner and enjoyed the very large breakfast buffet not included in our stay no air condition that i could find so the room was a bit stuffy opening the slider helped it is a bit of a walk to the center of town but it is pretty to walk along the river the area is a bit deserted on the weekends but it is nice to get away from the hustle bustle,1.0
accessibility was foremost for me choosing this hotel it was my second time visiting barcelona and i would stay here again was quite happy that i did and was in no way disappointed everything that was shown and mentioned on the site was delivered and up to par exceptional front desk and dining room staff overall my expectations were met and petit palace museum will be hotel of choice keep up the good work hopefully in the near future i will be back,1.0
lovely hotel nice food and very accommodating staff i really enjoyed my stay here and i would highly recommend a visit if going to dublin i had dinner in the restaurant and it was beautiful i could recommend it enough,1.0
it what you expect from star hotel nice and quiet very close to the pijp area which we enjoy for the center it a bit of a walk the michelin star restaurant is nice but for me a bit over the top we had a super somoliere and waiter he really made our evening thank you,1.0
loved the property and very helpful staff greatly decorated and really enjoyed the terrace in our down time only complaint was that the room is terrible not near cool enough for summer however there was great coffee and pastries in the morning it made for a wonderful stay in central rambla,1.0

i highly recommended this hotel if you are looking for services and nice boutique hotel staying experience i have booked for nights executive suites given i have impressed by the hotel photo that this suites come with a patio with garden view and i expect the suite will at ground husband got the room first as we flighted with different airlines however the hotel have allocate a rooftop floor executive suite to us when i arrived the hotel i shared my concern and expectation on the booking all staffs in the hotel are so helpful and the manager have allocated back the suites i chose promptly the reason why they allocated the rooftop to us because that room is newly renovated however the rooftop one with no balcony and have to take stairs to the room the room also in smaller size i suggested the hotel spell out clearly with customers on the executive suite on ground follow with patio and rooftop one customer choose hotel rely heavily on the photo in the web site i accept deviation if the hotel prices is cost for night other than this little story everything in the hotel is perfect nice caring helpful polite staffs i feel so warm when u walk around my room is perfect with the patio beautiful garden view luxury buffet breakfast the room with a sauna shower room and jetted tub hardly find this in any hotel around the world when the stream it can come with tea,1.0
this hotel is in the middle of downtown just above the action that means that if you go in a weekend night you wo get to sleep unless you wear the earplugs that the hotel provides for you but honestly they do not serve much the view from our room was to the air condition machinery another noise to add when we checkin we were offer a room with air conditioning even that in dublin does go over the with an over price of euros so we said no that s what we got staff is friendly and the room was clean the location is very good you only have to put to the noise level at weekend nights,0.0

i absolutely loved this hotel and i very hard to please the beds are nice and comfy and the rooms were spacious light and pretty the only downside is that we payed for a room with two single beds at arrival the staff said they only had rooms with a double bed left if we wanted two single beds we had to pay to be upgraded to another type of room with a balcony i felt like it was bad service from our balcony we could look down to see la sagrada familia,1.0

my family stayed here with our two girls and as long as your kids are well behaved then you will find no problem staying here we decided to book two rooms which gave us ample space the suite rooms are very large with a big whirlpool tub enjoyed by all of us after walking all day i would recommend booking a suite room as the amenities are worth it the staff is excellent they look after your needs well and are very friendly breakfast is served in the main bar and offered a good selection to start the day the hotel is centrally located a quick walk to anne frank house canal tours and many restaurants the hotel restaurant recommendation list is spot on,1.0

we were here for two nights at the end of a week road trip across spain and certainly the alma is now one of our favourite hotels located in eixample just a block away from gaudi casa mila and a short walk from the sagrada famiglia it is in a nice neighborhood with high class shops like cartier around the corner the ambience and decor are modern and very cool the reception staff are friendly and most eager to help i can only remember the name of andrea but they were all fantastic the rooms are all operated on fingerprint recognition and were well equipped and designed minibar items were free usb charging slots were provided the bed linen and mattresses were really comfortable the only thing missing which seems to be the case in most spanish hotels is a kettle for tea and ground floor restaurant and bar were wonderful and we had two great meals there the gourmet tasting lunch in the outdoor garden area was especially memorable even more amazing were the views from the rooftop bar where we could have stayed all evening to enjoy the lovely we did have time to try the spa and hotel thoroughly deserves its five star rating we would certainly come back to stay next time in barcelona,1.0
i stayed here for a week with my girlfriend the pool bar is great and the pool even though small is a nice touch on the rooftop you not use it for swimming but it great to cool off rooms are but nothing special not much choice on the tv if you wanting english having said that who wants to spend time in the room location is pretty good there are plenty of cafes and restaurants close by it about a min walk to the main area but only a few minute walk to the us parking underground but be aware that any large wide car may have difficultly staff are really friendly and helpful i shall certainly be back next year when in barcelona,1.0

this was the first time going to amsterdam i was taking my daughter age for her asked the advice of a friend since he had been to amsterdam quite a few time where he would suggest we told us of this hotel as it was very central and true to his word it was it was right next to the train from the airport and across the round from lots of the main hotel looks grubby from the outside but inside it very area is bright and clean staff are room itself is small just about enough room for a double bed and a chair we did find this a problem as we only slept found the bathroom more of a problem it was really small overall they were both very ate breakfast in the hotel even thought we thought it was over priced it saved us looking for something breakfast was good but not euros good per in all i enjoyed our stay and if i was ever going back again i would use this hotel,1.0
amazing place to stay absolutely gorgeous and the food is amazing very clean place to stay as me and my wife have gone travelling too class and would definitely recommend to friends me and my wife loved it,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the hotel is beautiful and elegant and immaculate had it not been for our mediocre experience we would have given hgb stars after a very long flight we arrived at the hotel about hours before the official time we acknowledged that we were early but requested an early if possible we understood when they informed us that they could accommodate our request so we asked if they could notify us when our room was ready we were unapologetically told that they could not and that we would need to periodically check with the front desk to learn if the room was ready they would even give us a time estimate frustrated we decided to go sightsee instead of staying in the hotel a hotel of this caliber we feel our request was not unreasonable all we asked for was the courtesy of a phone call or text but we were denied that gesture great hotel facilities are important but even more important is great customer service in all the hotels we visited in many parts of the world this was the first time we were treated so indifferently at it colored our entire location is great and all the other hotel staff were wonderful everything else about our stay was very positive and i would still recommend this hotel highly,1.0
great style distance to beach and shopping very polite and efiicient staff good breakfast restaurant kids loved the pool stands a bit alone in the old workshop district overall out of,1.0
the nh chain in amsterdam has some excellent locations this hotel location is one of them it is near everything and mid range price for your stay the rooms are good but forget the view the breakfast is excellent with super service but a little bit hard to access free wifi in the lobby area and good airport shuttle service i rented a car with a driver from the hotel and it was excellent ride the driver was very resourceful and helpful one of the things i like is that the elevator generates electricity when moving between floors so an hotel with a sense of responsibility great,1.0

i stayed at this hotel whilst on a short business trip i was immediately wowed by its grandeur and without the stuffy formalities that sometimes come with hotels of this type i was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome this friendly do attitude was consistent by the staff throughout my stay room amenities were first class spacious and very comfortable sadly i only had time to use the lobby bar no bar it was a bit busy and service was not particularly great but none the less a hugely popular venue for an evening drink this hotel is also in a great location for the best shopping restaurants and bars a in short walk it now the place to stay for my next visit to dublin,1.0
we stayed here at the end of our viking river cruise viking picked the hotel and we were happy with the location tram accessibility and other amenities breakfast was buffet style with many great choices large lobby great harbor view knowledgeable help at the desk and and the concierge i would stay here again,1.0
truly a nice and a hotel with a good and relatively calm location rooms are spacy enough and decor is as expected from the website staff is friendly and professional one exception though wad the areal there the staff was not so keen to take our orders and they sometimes left the used porcelain on the tables for hours time for hours also in contrast to all other staff their english language left a lot to wish for on the other hand the breakfast staff was extremely competent and friendly i recommend hvis hotel,1.0
we stayed at the ink for a short stay in amsterdam the location is excellent and practical being a minute walk from centraal station or a stop tram it is not on one of the prettiest streets in amsterdam it is within easy walking distance of the main sights and has a tram stop directly outside for a trip to the main in was easy and no fuss and we were given rooms on the ground floor the rooms did have a view but were not overlooked and were size was ok what you would expect from a standard hotel room but the only quibble was that there was limit space to store our cases once unpacked we only had carry on cases but they were too big to put under the bed or under the sofa i guess the hotel would store larger bags if was plan to the bedroom which may put some off but no problem for was very clean and well equipped coffee maker kettle hair dryer robes and slippers and loads of soaps gels shampoos in the bathroom bathroom has plenty of space for his and hers toiletries the room was decorated in a large scale querky map of amsterdam so you could easily get a idea of where everything was breakfast buffet included in our deal was very good loads of choice for all tastes and very pleasant was excellent for after dinner drinks with friendly and helpful bar staff,1.0
great place specially the staff and the room size our room was over looking the river the location was great as well handy to everything amsterdam got to offer the room service was great as well i highly recommend it,1.0
we stayed here for our two nights in athens and it was really a perfect location and the price could not be beat the boutique feel and breakfast were wonderful and the staff went out of there way to help us when their usual touring company was unavailable for us in fact one of their staff members put together a complete day walking tour for us with a map and print outs of information for all the sights our room itself was just ok which is why i rating it at a our shower was draining really slowly the first night and the window shade did not work both were fixed by the next day one of the outlets in the bathroom also did not work but i just dried my hair in the bedroom definitely recommend them for the price and location there are also a number of great restaurants right around the corner,1.0
we recently stayed at hotel fita for a two night trip to amsterdam from the time we booked our room to the moment we checked out the communication with hotel staff was clear and reliable directions to the hotel from the airport were very useful and easy to follow we asked for suggestions from different staff members and all the info we received was spot on and fun once at the hotel we were greeted by the amazing kees who welcomed us with warmth and as an ambassador of all things amsterdam our room was comfortable clean and ready upon arrival we enjoyed the size and configuration of both the bathroom and sleeping room with good amenities for a short stay the complimentary breakfast is not to be missed a full spread including wonderful fresh dutch pancakes made to order we found it easy to walk about or take the metro and while we felt close to the action the room remained quite and the buzz of city center was left behind once inside the hotel melo and donna were fantastic as well and apologies for not catching the name of our room attendant who did a terrific job as well thank you for a wonderful stay we hope to return soon,1.0

my husband and i stayed here for nights whilst visiting dublin on arrival staff allowed us to leave our luggage so we could explore the city before checking in the hotel is situated in the heart of dublin and sits right by the ha penny bridge we ca fault anything about this hotel staff are very helpful and welcoming the food is perfect and the bar is the perfect place for the we payed to attend the celtic night which is situated in the downstairs area of the hotel and i would highly recommend this for all people young old especially families the food and music really made our trip even more enjoyable,1.0
we stayed at wyndham grand athens in our lasts days of our honeymoon trip through took a taxi from the airport straight to the hotel and we were a little bit shocked when we arrived since the area in which this hotel is has this heavy atmosphere you can feel that this is not the right place for a tourist to thing is that there is a subway station really close and is easy to get a taxi from the hotel entrance so you do really need to walk too much around this not so good areaother than that the hotel was really nice specially the rooftop from which you can see the parthenon all lighten up at are really nice so is the bathroom we never understood the shower there is this really nice rain shower but there is no shower plate so the water floods the whole bathroom after you might sound exotic but when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is rather a slippery cold and wet staff were mixed either they were really helpful or did ignored us or talked to us even without looking us at the face so i guess it depends on your luck when you visit the counter,1.0
we only stayed here for one night they did make a hash of the room as we wanted a twin and they gave us a double they did correct it quickly then there was a knock on the bedroom door within a half hour of us getting to the room and the person seemed surprised it was occupied she did apologise but did say why she knocked on the door but saying that the rooms are lovely the bathrooms are great and the beds are brilliant they were very comfortable and unusually we both slept most of the night would definitely stay here again,1.0

quiet comfortable extremely convenient to trains and convention center nice size room we were in but pretty unimaginatively furnished couch was pretty uncomfortable rain shower and soaker tub not much storage for clothing huge and well equipped fitness room on site nice hearty breakfast included though no one told us about it til we asked generally the staff was consistent with other reviews not terribly nice brusk and quite terse especially given the general good humor and helpfulness of virtually everyone else we met in ireland during our stay really excellent gin and tonic selection in bar make a point of trying the suggested citadelle gin with tonic and star anise and orange coffee maker in room made virtually undrinkable coffee no matter how many times we tried there is a small indoor mall a block or so away with a good food court for breakfast and lunch btw are definitely some tradeoffs here but i would stay here again,1.0

this was an absolutely fantastic experience the staff were friendly and helpful and gave me the attention i wanted when trying to pick from the rooms they had available upon they were also responsive to emails and phones prior to my arrival i was able to choose a spectacular room with two windows and full renovations the huge bed was extremely comfortable while the large bathroom provided ample room to get ready there was space for a big screen tv and desk the spaciousness even allowed for the room to accommodate a entry foyer with a and mirror coming home to cool air conditioning was a welcome surprise for a european would recommend this location and hotel to anyone visiting the city and i look forward to returning while not necessarily the most economical hotel it was only marginally more expensive than the others in the area and paying the small difference to stay here will see you experiencing a very comfortable stay,1.0
sir albert was definitely by far one if not the finest hotels i have ever stayed in the hotel decor itself in the reception corridors bedroom are very modern and chic with a touch of class we were offered complementary prosecco on arrival the staff were more than helpful when we were checking in another day we asked for directions to the van gogh museum and the man at reception went out of his way to help and assist us with directions and offered umbrellas to each of us as it was a rather dreary day the room itself was very edgy and modernly decorated and felt very personal and welcoming with complimentary messages on the mirror and my name on the tv to welcome me it took maybe walk to get to dam square but there are lots of lovely bars restaurants shops and markets on the way which was nice to experience there was also a tram about a walk away that can take you to dam square i would recommend this hotel to every type of passenger and hope to return to it once again in the near future,1.0
location of the hotel is great a minute walk to the nearest metro station the hotel is clean and modern beds very comfy good shower the variety of food for breakfast was excellent staff friendly and keen to help we stayed for nights and used the pool most afternoons it is not a large pool but really great to swim and relax around towels for the pool available at the rooftop bar which we used every evening fantastic views across the city the acropolis is lit up at night so its quite something to watch the sun go down there is a varied drinks menu and meals available also metro ticket for days is euros very easy to use the metro gets you everywhere you need to go only minus is the wifi free is great but that was the same all over athens nice restaurant close by called alexander the great would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
another first class experience at the westbury hotel it is really a staff is extremely helpful and friendly the fresh flowers in the lobby set the hotel is a short walk from the excitement of grafton street pubs restaurants and more the rooms are a little small but very nice i had a great bed plus two very comfortable chairs the desk allowed for work plus it had an american electrical bar was an experience elegant is the only word for it,1.0
perfect in every way very big modern rooms by european standards and the staff are always smiling and helpful the breakfast with its buffet and a la carte options is the best hotel breakfast i have ever had both in terms of variety and quality this is our first barcelona visit we are on our day so we were sure what area to stay in but this location has turned out to perfect the only thing less than perfect is the rooftop pool a lovely area up there to have a drink and soak up the sun but the pool is little more than a wading pool this hotel has turned out more than we could have hoped for highly recommend,1.0
first off i love this hotel the staff is amazing and very helpful all around the common areas and the rooms are spacious clean bright and welcoming the bar and restaurant are great i would stay here again in the future there are a couple things that i think the hotel could change to make it a much more a star visit clean the pool area we wanted to use the pool but not two occasions there was either a large party hoarding the pool or the area surrounding it was dirty full of dishes and generally a mess from other guests which detracted from the experience and caused us to go elsewhere the ac in our room was it was hot while we were in so ac was key in picking a hotel the system in my room was lacking and could not keep even on high output also the strange setup of the room where you enter the room to two other doors one to the bathroom and one to the sleeping area while nice because of privacy was strange because the ac could not flow to the bathroom making it incredibly hot all the time other than those two things which can be corrected the hotel is great and i would recommend,1.0
part of the autograph collection of marriott boutique and unique hotels this is a terrific option in the eixchample neighborhood the building was a commercial property that was beautifully renovated to a hotel but kept much of the old world charm and architectural integrity of the building excellent staff at the front desk and we used marriott points for two rooms and agreed to pay a per day upcharge for the cotton king room these rooms are larger than the base madras rooms which must be very small there is a beautiful roof deck with pool and bar with a view of the city including the sagrada de famiglia the hotel is within walking distance to the la rambla el born and many other neighborhoods our favorite meals were at el national a cool food hall we also liked tapeo in the born neighborhood for tapas there is a good italian restaurant very close to the hotel called luigi if you need a break from tapas the only thing i did not like was the gym it very small otherwise i really enjoyed staying at this very unique and original hotel i also recommend using barcelona day tours for sightseeing options,1.0
we friends were a weekend in dublin for visiting at croke park but of course wanted a good location to spend some time in the centre of this beautiful city this hotel is km walking from the famous area of temple bar nice hotel with good facilities compared with the price,1.0
we had a fantastic stay the staff could not do enough for us on our last day after checkout we asked to swim somewhere as their pool was being cleaned they paid for a taxi for us to go and swim at one of their sister properties what service would highly recommend we rented a scooter from cooltra away this was the best decision of our stay as we saw so much of the city,1.0
the staff at hermes are some of the friendliest i ever met in a hotel they genuinely care about your stay and are very helpful the room we had was very cozy and spacious and was clean and well maintained perfect for getting some good rest after a day in the hot streets of included breakfast is amazing and we loved that the location is within walking distance to everything we definitely stay again,1.0
i am writing this review to inform people of this very beautiful hotel my friends and i stayed on the top floor room it was outstanding all newly renovated and soooo spotless every day cleaned with lively fresh towels and linens a lovely friendly cleaning lady also a wonderful air conditioning room to come back to in to every day the room was stunning amazing facilities in it and a balcony view to die for a gorgeous american breakfast awaited us every morning and once again so clean with lovely staff to greet us on arrival the reception staff were incrediably friendly and welcoming and nothing was to much trouble for them at all the pool bar restaurant was gorgeous opened daily serving lovely delicious food and drinks amazing coctails the life guard george was one of the loveliest people we met on the holiday just a pure gentlemen he had fresh pool towels for us and anything we wanted he hit amazing service from all of them i would recommend panorama resturant i will do a seperate review later about minutes away in taxi the most amazing seafood resturant on our trip also athens sailing tours amazing this hotel in offers everything yes it is hour by tram or daytime by taxi to plaka wonderful area but you have the beach and beautiful area of gylfada as well i can not wait to vusit thus beautiful country and hotel again tgank yiu to all at palmyra beach hotel for,1.0
stayed here for nights while on a visit to dublin hotel was spotless staff were warm and friendly room was lovely and bed was very comfy with crisp white bed linen great location with both dart and bus service on your doorstep the only thing missing was a fridge in the room however it was available on request will definitely be back well done to all a very comfortable stay,1.0
sadly this trip was disappointing due to his hotel rest of dublin great but avoid his place sewage coloured water in bath unresolved even though changed rooms and only comp offered was a glass of wine could drink or use water in my room and had to wash using bottled water like on camp manager lady pleasant but ineffective in sorting base issue have never complained before but added to false alarm at this morning too no breakfasts for that price value for money want single people off,0.0
great location european size rooms but what stood out was the extremely good and friendly service be it at breakfast or on the roof top bar the level of service was truly an established hotel rooms were fresh and pleasantly decorated a good balance between modern facilities and charming environment,1.0
not too central but only a minute walk to las to and the national theatre room small as i expected air con ok internet good fridge good bathroom was basic but as expected,1.0
very nice hotel with great service and food centrally located for access to points of interest the have an incredible view from the rooftop bar and restaurant with very personable staff i highly recommend it,1.0
the staff were amazingly helpful especially nok and sandjay always ready with some recommendations happy to check dinner bookings and full of smiles the room was stunning with full panoramic views of the water front lots of nice touches including a glass of prosecco on arrival a funky disco lift and i especially like the addition of a record player in the room location wise i was a bit concerned about this when booking but i should have been adam is just five minutes away from centraal station by a ferry that runs all night long but make sure you get on the right ferry we made that mistake and ended up extending our minute trip back to minutes we did have a couple of gripes which they did their best to sort out and which i was satisfied were taken seriously the first was a weird low pitched buzzing noise on two nights which seemed to come from the central air cooling system we turned off the air con in the room and it was still there when a staff member came up he checked out other free rooms and said the noise was also bad in those and so there was little point in changing they did provide us with ear plugs though which did the trick they did seem aware of the problem but unable to do anything about it other gripe was that our room was cleaned on one day we asked reception to sort it,1.0
the hotel looks very and clean the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was not small which is the case in many other hotels also the shower was perfectly spacious hotel was right at the beach and a bus stop was around the corner,1.0
wonderful location to get to all the sites loved walking daily through st stephen green family room was great with the two rooms and two bathrooms fantastic full breakfasts friendly knowledgable and attentive staff especially katie and jake old world charm,1.0
we were warmly welcomed into this beautiful oasis in the heart of athens i was traveling with two teenagers who were very quickly made to feel welcome during a summer heat wave we were fortunate to be allocated a triple room with a breathtaking view of the acropolis the breakfast were very well prepared and extensive lunch however was very slow and i am guessing most people do not have lunch here as the bar man who took our order seemed bored and made us feel as if we had disturbed him the front office staff were initially very helpful however i guess it depended which individual served you overall a very pleasant and well situated hotel,1.0
located in plaka this hotel is steps away from good shopping museums syntagma square and metro it is convenient for families couples and tour groups it has a nice pool although there are only a few lounge chairs and people fight for one throughout the day breakfast is included or it was for our booking and is an exceptional buffet with many choices including waffles,1.0
from the moment we entered the hotel we were welcomed by professional and friendly hotel itself is situated in a great central location walking distance to bars and food in the restuarant for evening meal was gorgeous and breakfast was moreish we will be back,1.0
this was our third stay in amsterdam during a euro cycling trip we decided to stay outside the city center to avoid traffic noise and all of the tourists corendon is in amsterdam west and is miles from the city center by bike it is about minutes but is nice to ride through vondelpark the hotel is clean large has a nice restaurant for dinner and breakfast we had mediterranean fare at cor don after a long day of cycling into the city it was perfect our room was cozy and has air conditioning cold for the summer months there is a smoking cabin outside and covered bike parking the hotel also has a lot of mac bikes for rental if you looking to stay close to the city to walk do not stay here if you ok to take the tram are looking for nightlife just outside your doorsteps and enjoy some quiet corendon is suitable for that,1.0
the ofelias hotel is great for a quick trip to barcelona it is in a lovely area and it about a minute walk to the gothic quarter there is a lovely roof top pool with really comfortable sunbeds but you need to get there early because space is limited the reason i did give it an excellent was because we paid to have the breakfast day thank goodness we did pay upfront for the whole week it was disgusting the coffee is from a machine and they have cold eggs on a plate with a bit of cheese and some salami there is also no bar here which was fine as there are so many to choose from in the area the beds are uncomfortable and gave me a bad back because they were so hard but we managed a good night sleep we would definitely stay here again without the breakfast it a very stylish boutique hotel,1.0
i booked a room here recently for my parents to visit dublin when booking i realised it was expensive but worth every penny the hotel itself is clean bright in a great location and with a nice view of the river i went to the hotel myself a couple of hours before my parents checked to ask if i could have them leave a bottle of prosecco in their room for them the staff did this no problem and after just chatting to them and telling them the room was for my mama birthday they upgraded their room to a room with a view of the river at no extra cost they also had the prosecco on ice with glasses in their room for when my parents arrived any staff member that i or my parents spoke to that weekend was incredibly friendly chatty and polite really super,1.0
not downtown but strategically located a ten minute train ride to the airport and right in the centre of the buidenvedert shopping center but just a short tram ride from downtown amsterdam fairly big rooms with kitchenette reasonable pricing friendly staff and bicycles for rent as well very quiet and safe neighborhood,1.0
the hotel is located far away from the bustling touristy part of barcelona yet you have everything in the hotel and around for a nice relaxing stay the area has lots of restaurants and a shopping mall bogatelli beach very busy is in about minutes walk via a nice pedestrian route dotted with cafes and small shops taxis are not easy to catch on the street though we saw a couple parked just outside of the hotel as to our stay we stayed for nights and were pretty happy checkin and checkout were easy the front office staff is very nice and helpful the room size was ok for two adults breakfast was fresh and very good choice the manager and waiting staff were welcoming and helpful parking is available around the corner but you could park on the street even on the lane this was what we did all in all a very good choice if you want to stay away from the noise and traffic of the central barca,1.0
i stayed for nights and it was in a perfect location away from the hustle and bustleof placa catalunya but close enough to walk to if you are feeling up to that the hotel staff is very nice the rooms were very roomy and mine had a little juliette balcony facing the front very cute there was an issue with the bathroom it did seem to flush properly other than that it was very enjoyable there is a roof terrace with a bar and the restaurant bruc tapas was very good if you want to dine local,1.0
we have just completed nights at the andaz and found it to be spectacular on every level the interior design comfort of the rooms and buffet breakfasts were all outstanding but what truly put the experience over the top was the incredible customer service every andaz employee we encountered went out of their way to be polite and helpful and meet our every need sera was the first person to greet us when we arrived and continued to serve us impeccably throughout our visit patricio calvin and patrick were all friendly and gracious as well as was everyone else at the andaz whose names we did learn we loved our stay in amsterdam and look forward to another stay at the andaz next time we visit,1.0

i stayed here for a total of nights recently i booked this as expedia said there was ac however we go to the place a bit out of the way from main and to our surprise there was no ac staff hours are very limited so we were even able to get a fan when we complained they said they ca keep fans in the room due to fire hazards in addition on our last night we switched rooms this one was even hotter i did sleep and the room looked like it had been cleaned hair in the bed and make up on the pillows hair in the shower definitely not worth over euros i complained to the staff and through expedia and they thought euro credit was enough mind you there was false advertising on the website definitely would not recommend and will not be back,0.0
we stayed at fitzwilliam as a default location when we could get into merrion although all previous comments are true that this is a centrally located hotel there is no way this is a star hotel this hotel is quite dated and in fact staff indicated there is a renovation scheduled sometime in the near future the breakfast as well as breakfast location is mediocre at best rooms are ok and as one previous guest stated achieving the correct water temperature in the shower is a challenge and getting into the shower is a death defying feat due to the height of the tub the reason why i gave this hotel a very good as it has an incredible staff from the front desk housekeeping wait staff in restaurant everyone stands on their head to make this as best experience as they possibly can and their concierge staff is one of the best i have ever experienced in travel hopefully they will embark on some renovation improvements in the hotel and the environment will be consistent with their incredible staff,1.0
lovely placewe went here for a small celebration after my son graduation we had delicious bar food in very pleasant surroundings the selection of deserts and cocktails were delicious a small problem with one meal was rectified easily all staff were very professional polite and efficient a delightful spot in the middle of a busy city,1.0
train station only minutes centre directly over road with plenty of food staff friendly and was lovely on clean and was great experience and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in barcelona,1.0
we found the hotel staff very friendly the room light comfortable and beautifully clean the breakfast delicious and the location ideal for us as it was a short walk to the dart station with regular trains into the city centre we had brought our car for use later in our holiday so the car parking facility made life much easier for us,1.0
after reading lots of mixed reviews about hotels in the athens area we were apprehensive about finding a good hotel but we got lucky as philippos hotel ended up being a good spot it in a great location in a cute neighborhood with lots of restaurants and bars that are walking distance the acropolis and metra station are also about a min walk very convenient even though it near lots of things the hotel is on a quiet street which is great for sleeping they have a nice terrace on the top floor with great views of the city def take the trip up the hotel was clean and the breakfast was decent it a good spot to stay at as you explore athens,1.0
stayed for nights as part of a coach tour to the hotel to be large modern and very room was of a very good size with a powerful con was not too effective and a little found all of the staff to be cheerful and most helpful at all was a little hectic but a good choice was on offer but the hot food was only tepid at meals were good but again the hot food was not hot would revisit and recommend,1.0
the amalia hotel is central to all things in athens the staff are friendly and professional and are willing to help the guest with a range of travel related questions the rooms were clean and well maintained the view from the roof of the acropolis is great and when we were there private will recommend it to family and friends,1.0
not worth the cost does deserve stars probably not even faulty plumbing we had to change room faulty elevator one permanently out of order the other unpredictable noisy rooms you will hear and feel the trains passing every minutea and your neighbours coughing so imagine what else you will hear in the halls outdated rooms dirty carpets on the floors and broken floor tiles orange and brown seems to be the location ok central in dublin min walk to centre and temple bar but across the river however we had daily fights and drug deals taking place on the doorstep of the hotel so slightly dodgy hotel policy we do provide you a mini bar but please do eat any of your own food on our premises what,0.0
from the moment we checked in until the second we left the staff at the grand hotel central led by saul canal the manager made us feel at home in beautiful bareclona the accommodations from our room to the rooftop pool were first rate what really makes this place special is the people everyone was friendly and helpful service was outstanding help with directions transportation and reservations made this hotel far more than just a place to stay we felt at home food room and ambiance were first rate go see saul and his team,1.0

recently stayed at the hotel for nights could not fault the hotel great modern rooms equipped nice gift of toiletries loads facilities bars limited menus but sufficient for snacks only downside for us was a music event on nights at the forum behind the hotel this led to sleepless nights as could hear music from hotel otherwise good stay breakfast was great,1.0

athens was our first stop on a day holiday in greece and i was a bit skeptical about the city post recession and the customer service levels i was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality shown by everyone at this hotel the receptionist xristina was particularly helpful as she helped us making reservations and figure out our itinerary even for our next stop mykonos furthermore they were very flexible with the checkout time and offered a great breakfast the hotel is and feels very new and the location is perfect if you do want to be right in the middle of the action but want to be close enough,1.0
although it was a bit further away from the center we were extremely pleased with the hotel the room was comfortable clean and they checked us in early in the day we used the pool a couple of times and found lots of great local places to eat nearby the breakfast buffett was out standing with so many items both hot and cold to choose from we would definatly stay here again if we returned to amsterdam,1.0
we stayed at centrotel hotel for four days and it was fantastic the hotel interiors are very clean modern and comfortable the location was perfect for us very close to victoria metro station which is two stops away from monastiraki station square which is excellent for restaurants views of the acropolis and the famous flea markets we were able to get from the airport to the hotel no problems via the metro at the cost of you can also purchase a metro ticket for the city for days at each which was also perfect for us due to our early flight home we preferred to book a taxi back to the airport which the hotel was more than happy to arrange for us taxi was fixed price they also provide breakfast for euros if you are hungry in the morning the staff were super helpful recommending local restaurants on the first night as we arrived late providing us with a map and advice on how to get around the city i ca fault was a little apprehensive about the reviews regarding the neighbourhood but i would say there is nothing to worry about yes there are some migrants walking around but it is like that all over athens not just at the hotel even in the main tourist attractions there were migrants walking around and begging so do let this stop you booking this gem of a definitely would stay again and also try out the jet stream baths in,1.0

min walk from temple bar nice area not congested and not full of tourists good vibe in the hotel very clean and the sheets and beds really spoil you no mini bar but that to me is not really a problem hotel staff went out of there way to assist on most anything including reserving dinner at restaurants etc great gym and spa facilities new and impressive good place to stay in dublin,1.0
i booked six weeks ahead made sure that i communicate our needs by email twin beds two single and good view non smoking arrived late in the evening checked in but was shocked with the room so smelly double bed no view the street was so dirty with the same price rate you can rent better rooms in the same area omonia square such as chic hotel dorian inn hotel,0.0
great hotel so clean and modern we had an amazing stay but the one thing that made our stay even better was the staff the man on reception was so pleasent and explained everything perfectly to us in such a friendly manor also all bar staff could not have done more for us and they were so friendly and chatty the athmosphere was so good we will be back to stay here and would reccommend this hotel to all my friends,1.0
i originally booked here for nights because of the reasonable price i ended up staying for a week the staff were all very friendly and efficient it nice to come back to your hotel and be greeted with a friendly smile and recognition rooms are simple clean and comfortable i was too keen on the breakfast but it was still neighbourhood is a little rundown but i always felt safe close to omonia square metro buses etc so convenient for getting stay at the hotel again when i return from the islands i plan to stay again,1.0
the hotel is beautiful and top notch so you have nothing to worry about there if you choose to include breakfast with your room it is excellent rooms are so clean and nice but it is the people that keep us coming back no question goes unanswered and always with a smile ca thank them enough for making our visits wonderful,1.0
just stayed here for nights found the staff extremely friendly the room we had booked did have a double bed so they upgraded us with no fuss to a superior room with queen size bed the breakfast was quite expensive and you can eat round the corner in the museum quarter i would stay again although was very business like and not usually the sort of hotel i would visit with a girlfriend,1.0
the service here is exceptional so you ca go far wrong the first week i stayed they upgraded me to a suite hot but lovely and spacious the second week was a considerable step down a tiny room no road drilling just outside the window i complained to the duty manager and they had moved me to a quieter cooler bigger room within the i would recommend they work very hard to make their customers happy and most of the property is spectacular,1.0
we are here on a two night stay and loved it so much we booked another night for our return trip the staff is truly wonderful from the moment we checked in we were given great service the concierge provided two great restaurant recommendations pinchet and rustic stone both exceeded our room is clean well appointed quiet and there is a beautiful view of the city from our mint bar was a nice surprise great wine selections and highly recommend the westin not only for the local but more importantly for the outstanding service and wait to return next saturday,1.0
stayed here recently with friends hotel is much bigger than expected and the rooms were spacious enough although not overly plush the bar area was however beautifully decorated and was extremely easy to relax in the guinness was perfect and the staff were attentive located a short taxi ride costing about euro from the city centre i can recommend this hotel as a place to explore dublin,1.0
we went to this hotel only for the afternoon tea and we glad we did the service prior to our arrival and during was excellent i allergic to gluten and i got in contact with them a couple of weeks before our trip margot campà was utterly professional and made sure i had a menu that was absolutely delicious i also mentioned that it was my friend birthday and they brought out a birthday pastry that was so i could try it for attention to details and outstanding service the sandwiches were really good and the pastries to die for they also have a very good tea whole team made sure we had a superb time there and we thank you for it the only reason i did not rate it a star is because the atmosphere was we were the only ones there and there was no music playing you should definitely advertise this experience a lot more as i absolutely positive it would be a smashing success,1.0
great hotel in barcelona center in gay eixample where are based all premier room is amazing great service a bit small pool in top roof but enough to enjoy a perfect sunny day have a lovely spa and restaurant in same hotel well recommended to stay in solo or with partner,1.0
hotel is of good standard and situated close to city center would recommend staying if you are looking for an overall good hotel we had a room facing the back which was very quiet parking is good and close in the next door multi storey car you are looking for something exciting this hotel is perhaps on the boring side of things,1.0
amazing experience at sixty two hotel my room was right on passeig de gracia with a little sitting area to enjoy staff could not have been more accommodating especially gisela who went above and beyond to make my mornings extra special when i return to barcelona i will definitely be booking this hotel for a pleasant stay recommend,1.0

we stayed there for nights while exploring barcelona the first time we especially loved the roof terrace near the torre agbar this was a perfect location for our trip we walked a lot or used the hotel bikes for sight seeing ca say anything about the breakfast,1.0
stayed here for nights on first visit to barcelona situated just off the famous la ramblas promenade and close to subway not exactly inexpensive but rooms were excellent and hotel service good staff very friendly and helpful only downside was the breakfast which at is overpriced for what you get but that seems to be to trend in barcelona hotels rather do take the breakfast and instead go to a taverna or the great food market down the road,1.0
what a wonderful little hotel right in the middle of the old part of the city and mins walk to the port had a wonderful room overlooking the garden two lovely little pools very very very clean great design great buffet breakfast so happy we chose to stay here nice one casa mimosa we will be back one day easily in the same league as say the majestic where i have stayed in the past and more boutique and romantic all the staff were amazing and helpful,1.0
the very clean and spacious close to the port of barcelona perfect for beginning of cruise the food was location is not the best seems to be an industrial location was too far from airport and the city it made touring difficult and euros i ca stress this enough dollars not widely accepted and if they do accept prepare to be ripped off with the exchange rate not just at hotel overall good clean and decent hotel perfect for short stays nights max and business trips,1.0
perfect hotel to stay at if you want to have easy access to all the historical sites clean rooms good view from the roof terrace buffet breakfast included ask for high floor as it quieter the higher you go staff very friendly helpful great restaurants bars around the corner in the plaka area very reasonably priced hotel restaurant expensive and not much of an atmosphere when we visited athens a great city to visit would love to go back,1.0

there is not a single thing we did not like the hotel is a perfect spot for a weekend getaway but also for longer stay great location with walking distance to both shopping and historical sights staff is great service amazing buffet breakfast with wide choices to please anyone and eating with the view of acropolis is hard to beat we had also cocktails late at night again the view was amazing and the terrace with the pool is a perfect spot to both start and conclude a day room was of a good size bathroom too highly comfortable with all the amenities one could needwarmly recommend,1.0
the katerina is a very lovely hotel it has a friendly reception and old fashioned decor overall it exudes a cosy charm the best thing about it is that our room was really really clean the downside would be the can be quite dodgy as many immigrants prowl the area waiting for any opportunity to pick pocket easy targets,1.0
new hotel in superb location close to bars shops and restaurants but not very friendly and helpful decor in rooms was very modern and tasteful with facilities in room excellent from kettle tea and coffee to iron and board loved floor to ceiling windows giving view of air conditioning a bonus especially in multi floored freshness of breakfast and variety especially being able to take away a bacon or sausage bap,1.0
nothing to say in particular apart from the fact that i spent great nights at the hotel the staff was professionnal friendly and available for any enquiry the bedroom was perfectly clean and comfortable,1.0
the room was a good size and the bed very comfy the location was fabulous i found the room we had on the street side extremely noisy from the party goers on the street below staff were friendly and the bar was a lovely place to have an evening drink the only downside for me was the noise i would go back to this hotel but would request a room on the quiet side,1.0
when i first arrived at this hotel i was pleased with the look of it it was clean and well presented the streets around the hotel are not very nice but exploring the area further many streets in the athens area seem run down but once you are in the hotel you feel far away from it all the hotel is located right near the metro station so you do have far at all to go if you want to catch the stayed in a room on floor the room was a nice size and very clean the only let down was the balcony view it was overlooking other hotels and a dirty street but this did really bother me too much as i did spend much time in the room as i was out exploring athens the bed was very loud and creaky any movement in the bed made a loud sound sounded like it was going to collapse in the mornings from half to half is the breakfast buffet there is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up one night at the hotel i decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the floor top of the hotel it had a great view of the acropolis you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat the menu did have much food choice i went for the burger it looked great but came out cold so i had to,1.0
we have just returned from a fantastic three night stay in dublin could fault this hotel clean modern and with a great bar and restaurant if you need them room was lovely and staff were all really friendly not right in the centre but only a pleasant minute walk to grafton street or you have a tram stop literally right outside we used to walk in during the day and catch the tram home from grafton street at night for minutes later we were back at the hotel perfect and means it just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre loved dublin as a city do expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful welcoming people eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from transport options from the airport were superb we chose the airlink and it dropped us off about a minute walk away the guinness factory is obviously on most people list but the jameson experience is also well worth a visit even if you do do the tour the bar is superb and has a great atmosphere the zoo is also a brilliant visit and great value at,1.0
room was clean and big however we stayed on the floor and the wifi was ridiculous after sight seeing and travelling we wanted to contact our families but could not get anything to load at all for the two nights we stayed if you are going to run such a big hotel and we are paying a lot of money to stay there there should be boosters on every floor so this is a problem and everyone can have access to fast loading internet also for the price we are paying for accomodation breakfast should be included the first night we got in after delayed flights we slept in the next morning deciding to head down to breakfast at we payed for full breakfast and once asked if we could get a few things refilled were told that breakfast is nearly over so no we are still paying the same amount of price so things that are requested should be refilled or breakfast should be discounted when checking in we had to fix up our bill which was fine however we were charged an extra aus dollars for the accomodation as they accidentally converted the money exchange after we asked them not to very frustrating stay,0.0
best good is not on the roof with great the breakfast an outdoor swimming spa with fair prices for money realy recommended,1.0
was the only place other than a hostel that we could get booked when attending a robbie williams concert in the aviva stadium and it was expensive but soooo worth it the hotel is within spitting distance of the stadium you can walk to it in about mins unfortunately when we arrived most of the carpark was taken up by a radio tourbus and we had to park nearly half a mile away and walk back with our cases in degree heat but we entered a large luxury air conditioned lobby the male receptionist dealt with us very efficiently and we were on our way to the room in minutes added security of having to use your room key to access the hallway to the elevators and rooms so no random people wandering about the rooms were large and airy very clean the bathroom was big too we didnt get time to try dinner or the bar as it was so busy breakfast the next morning was great wide selection and piping hot buffet the best coffee ive had in a hotel in a long time staff were all lovely so yes its expensive but a great hotel id like to go back when its not jam packed with robbie fans,1.0

we stayed here for night after hearing good things about the hotel on arrival the reception staff were really friendly and accommodating the downstairs area was really large comprising of a cafe as well as lots of seating where you can charge your electronics or simply relax we later found out there was a ping pong room the hotel is also right next to the metro with quick links to the city centre less than minutes there is also a massive supermarket mins walk away there are also a variety of activities in the hotel to attend such as yoga parties on the roof and fitness classes the hotel itself is huge with floors our room was very quirky concrete ceiling hanging tv pod like beds only thing the room could have benefitted from was a mini fridge the room was on the smaller side but still ok for people the shutter blinds also made the room dark which helped early on in the morning when we were trying to sleep on the roof is a lovely restaurant and rooftop bar area with impressive views of the city the breakfast the next day was fantastic a great range everything from fried breakfast to fresh and ham only downsides would be when i pulled the sheet up from my bed there were other guests hairs that had probably been there a long time which was pleasant to see the hot tub on the roof seemed to be dominated by groups of,1.0

this hotel was clean and the rooms large however it really is near anything so you either have to walk quite a ways or take a taxi the hotel does have and traveling in july it was quite warm since our room looked out into a courtyard we could get any airflow windows only opened about at the most we opened our room door but they had painted the hall and fumes were overwhelming everything great other than lack of or a fan,1.0
a clean and comfortable hotel maybe a little bit out of the heart of athens but in the evening it took half an hour to arrive from the airport and all around there are some taverna and restaurants with some typical greek food with convenient pricedefinitely i would advise this hotel to people traveling for business,1.0

truly loved it here from to our room to breakfast and drinks in the bar we felt really special and nothing was ever too much trouble the interior design is urban sophistication but does take itself too seriously an example would be the yellow telephone and the dutch bike hanging from our ceiling lots of curios to delight the senses it is expensive but you know what it was worth it you must go if only to have a naughty negroni in the bar a great birthday weekend in a wonderful location,1.0
the hotel is located on several bus routes so it easy to get around the city the staff are friendly and helpful the rooms are very comfortable and pleasant the hotel is located near the temple area there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby would recommend,1.0
this is a nice hotel like many others we stayed her during the recent joshua tree tour in dublin like those others we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by bono and the edge kinda nerdy but there it is i wanted to give this hotel stars but i ca this is not a holiday inn you paying more for a better experience and in some ways the clarence fell hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist it an easy walk to all of temple bar the book of kells and the fun stuff on street its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the guinness factory most public buses run on either street or dame street either one is a five minute walk away the temple bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did i feel uncomfortable walking around regardless of the hour the staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system printing out maps etc if my review ended there it would have five best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds the bed was probably one of the best i ever encountered in europe the front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing they made me want to stay longer this hotel could be so much more sadly several of us met in,1.0

the hotel has friendly staff is in a good location with clean and fresh rooms i like the decoration in the rooms i visit barcelona regularly and pol and grace is always my first choice there is a wide variety for breakfast well worth it,1.0
we stayed at the amalia for two nights the location is great to be able to walk to all tourist areas very good breakfast for most but can be a challenge for someone who is gluten free elevators are very small the rooms were decent except for challenges the hotel staff are very friendly time to athens but if we were to return i would not hesitate to stay here again it is so close to parliament that you can easily time seeing the changing of the guard routine,1.0
everything was great the only issue i had was when i called to the restaurant i asked what was gluten free on the menu and he had a bit of trouble telling me when i asked a few specific things i feel he got a bit annoyed and said look just tell me what you want and i let you know if it gluten free with attitude i was prepared to order right at that moment and i felt that reaction was a little bit rude,1.0
we were marooned in barcelona due to the british airways computer meltdown in may we were supposed to fly out immediately after disembarking a cruise instead we ended up spending hours in barcelona airport during the wait to rebook our flight we realized that we needed to find a hotel room for the night and we did want to trust british airways to help us we had stayed in a hotel near cristal palace in our last planned stay in barcelona when it came up as having a room available we jumped at it and were very happy that we did the staff were very helpful especially once we told them how we managed to end up staying there that night the room we had was on third floor there was much of a view but the it had a good bed with ample space the bathroom was huge with good water pressure and temperature the wifi was easy to access and was quick the breakfast buffet the next morning was excellent with ample choices and everything was fresh upon leaving the young lady at the desk invited us to come back if we encountered more troubles at the airport on our next trip to barcelona this will be the hotel we will try to book first,1.0

we stayed at this hotel for four nights as a family of four we stayed in a suite and had roll away beds added to the room and still had plenty of room the service was impeccable the linens were beautiful and the artwork in each room and in the corridors were inspiring most of all we loved how the hotel treated us and took care of our every need a few things to consider before staying there the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader the pool on the roof is very small so the photo is a bit misleading having said this our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city in addition it is much quieter to stay in the gothic quarter than in a hotel that faces a bustling street but this means that a taxi can barely squeeze through finally there is the price tag it is definitely luxury pricing but you are getting what you are paying for,1.0
hotel itself is very neat and clean with friendly staff just steps to the glories metro stop we never worried about transportation to all the things we wanted to do while in town the roof top offers great views of all the major landmarks of barcelona including the tower directly next door and overall our stay was perfect i would stay here again if i returned to barcelona just because i know what i getting at a reasonable to the wise do not eat any of the food at the rooftop bar we would go to the local grocery store and pick up cheap wine to drink on the roof each night just to soak up the evening but the one time we got food it was disgusting let me also point out that i easy to please but i thought i vomit after eating about half of the roast beef sandwich i bought,1.0
i was positively surprised with this hotel it not near the touristic attractions but there a subway station two blocks away it an efficient mean of transportation except for the stairs inside the stations a big advantage is the existence of a mall with stores like fnac carrefour h m etc the room had adequate space for a couple with a child wifi was good too there were not many options of tv channels a nice restaurant with activities for the children at diinner the terrace had a pool and fitness center during several evenings there were a musical programming for the guests,1.0
we booked nights at this hotel for our wedding anniversary hoping for something hotel was perfect booked a terrace room which is very stylish and the terrace is very spacious the city the street below has a couple of cafes where street musician work a visit for tapas the hotel room is always very clean tidy having a champagne breakfast on the terrace was pool area is a nice mixed and great for a relaxing afternoon but get there before as most go out in the morning and back for pm plenty of rooftop restuarant is very good also although on the night we booked a table the manager seemed to take a long time to recognise we were waiting smile a little it helps all the other staff are great evening thought after dinner sat and had drinks chilled overall this hotel is perfectly situated to get everywhere in barca and the hotel itself is excellent,1.0

we recently stayed for a week in a very spacious and beautifully decorated junior suite overlooking the placa reial this is a historic building sensitively renovated into a boutique gourmet hotel it is owned by one family who own no other hotels therefore the staff attention to its guests to ensure their every comfort is excellent there is a wonderful feeling of camaraderie throughout it begins at the front desk with right through to thrice daily housekeeping the restaurant staff were terrific remembering who we were from day one including our quirky food preferences at breakfast the food was superb with an accompanying comprehensive wine list it was a delight to sit outside for meals watching the activity on the placa we appreciated that breakfast was available on the terrace from am altho one could have eaten inside from we also had room service breakfast on our last morning it was as good as going down to the restaurant so full marks there as well the location was perfect and a cab rank just outside on the ramblas within easy walking distance of most everything from the port up through to la pedrera etc staff were wonderfully helpful recommending and making reservations for us to dine in the evenings altho we did have dinner twice at the hotel and it could not be faulted the garlic anchovies and beef carpaccio were magnificent,1.0
we stayed here for one night before our viking river cruise the room was small but very clean the staff was so friendly and the location was great we walked to anne frank house and we were right on one of amsterdam lovely canals it was in an older building but off the beaten path i would describe it as more of a boutique hotel with quirky hallways just what we were looking for after an exhausting overnight flight,1.0
booked this hotel for our honeymoon after a long search for the perfect hotel i think it safe to say we found it i contacted hugo and mentioned it was our honeymoon and he could have been more helpful nothing was too much hassle and he always had a smile on his face the hotel is very well situated and is within walking distance everything is no more than a minute walk away or minute taxi ride of some incredible restaurants and all the of the usual sightseeing destinations associated with the city the streets around the hotel are nice to walk through and it is a two minute stroll to the arc de triomf the rooms were excellent really well maintained and very fashionable the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a nice shower and bath last but not least was the rooftop pool the views towards the beach were perfect and being able to relax and swim away the days was lovely i could imagine us spending our honeymoon in a different hotel it was a perfect getaway and i sure we will return before long,1.0
was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a larger room for ourv night stay really appreciated it the hotel is about a walk to old town very pleasant walk in summer the breakfast and lunch was great with the chef taking extra care with our dietary requirements i used the gym which was well equipped with a fantastic indoor pool overall a great base for a stay in athens,1.0
i had the pleasure to stay at the hilton dublin recently as it is one of the hotels recommended by my company the location of the hotel is definitely very convenient within a walking distance of our offices the staff is very friendly as breakfast is very good with great choices of a different note i was expecting a little bit more of the bedrooms which are bit outdated specially the bathrooms it was a bit of a disappointment,1.0

very nice hotel in the center not too big although it is close to rambla it is in a quiet street easy access to the important places in barcelona very friendly staff good breakfest clean rooms,1.0
it has been remodeled to strengthen the walls and provide modern rooms without losing the flavor of the castle consequently there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies staircases and balconies to explore there are also several dining opportunities but the bar is very popular with a variety of food choices from small snacks to full meals it is a popular venue for weddings christenings etc it takes time to get a taxi so plan ahead when going into the city,1.0
just returned from a night stay at this hotel and the best thing about this hotel is it central location which is close enough to walk to most of the main rooms are clean and whilst i understand it is an eco hotel a fridge or facilities in the rooms would really enhance the overall experience of staying at the hotel the breakfasts were great with an extensive for a star hotel which really set us up for the day there is a carrefour across the street with several shops cafes and eateries and souvenir shops all within a few mins walk la rambla is a min walk montjuic is min and the beach took us about mins the metro is at the end of the street and v easy to use you can buy the metro card for from recommended,1.0

after using my trusted travel consultants to find an excellent hotel in amsterdam i was excited when entering the nh krasnapolsky hotel lobby however my expectations came crashing down when met by the hotel staff who demanded a euro deposit for the pleasure of using the mini bar and other facilities within the hotel it was more the manner in which this was demanded and the lack of flexibility until i challenged the request this was then adjusted to euro miraculously the room was average with no view not what i have come to expect when travelling around the world in some of the finest of hotels there were many negatives to this stay i have not got the energy to go through all of them on this review the communication with staff was poor i completed all the paperwork for my laundry the morning before my check out date i tipped the concierge to get this back for the morning after and was assured this would be no problem the morning after i was due to check out no laundry i was told on the phone it would be posted to my home address this was not an option as i had business meeting in malaga that day very disappointed overall with the stay,0.0
absolutely loved every minute we spent at this resort the location is perfect close to the beach and also to the city the hotel is separated into two sections they have the melia which is downstairs lounge and the lower levels the level is the stars hotel with an amazing floor view and a fine dining restaurant do not miss the breakfast i wish i could have that breakfast forever the breathtaking taking view the personal chef and the huge selection of are also have a swimming pool located on the rooftop it is not heated they also have a really modern gym and spa if you book this hotel you will never want to leave,1.0
i really like the marriott brand and this hotel was up to its high standards service was attentive rooms well appointed self service laundry available which was helpful concierge staff was helpful in finding sights and restaurants best part is the hotel is centrally located major sites all within minutes walking distance right next to vondelpark the museums were about minute walk although no airport shuttle the bus from the airport stops right in front of hotel very convenient only euros would stay here again if i returned to amsterdam,1.0
stayed overnight in this wee hotel in athens is in the omonia area of athens convenient for the subway and a short walk to the famous omonia square one part was a bit shady but the rest of the area was fine like any huge just be sensible do be out and about late at night perfectly fine during the day hotel itself was brilliant value we had a room and breakfast for breakfast was a bit spartan continental but was rooms are painted in weird colours but are lovely and clean and the bathroom is tiny but really well thought out with everything you need we loved the quirkiness of this little place you could stay more than a couple of days there i think or the lack of space might get to you but brilliant for an liked this wee place and the reception staff were just expect beautiful views from your it in the middle of athens and not very but within walking distance to the acropolis etc,1.0
