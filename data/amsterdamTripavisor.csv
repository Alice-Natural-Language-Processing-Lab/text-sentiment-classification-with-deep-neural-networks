If over 5'2'' you would have a problem. Other room's air conditioning not working well (had an odor and thus we had to open up the windows. Thankfully it was cool during our stay). Location is close to 'center Amsterdam', but away enough to be quiet and more residential. Close by bakery was great for breakfast (Simon something). Albert Heijn market close by as well for snacks etc.We found a wonderful laundrymat nearby (Powders Laundrette). They have self service machines and will also do your laundry for a very reasonable price.

Breakfast was included which was awesome. Normally free breakfast is just continental however was pleasantly surprised to see eggs, bacon and sausage too!! You won't be disappointed as there was plenty of breakfast options.We hired bikes here which cost about 18€ a day, was convienent for us.Decent sized rooms and bathroom, plenty of space for our luggage too. Beds are comfy. Good location - 5min walk to the Heineken experience and maybe 10mins to mussuems. 20mins to the centre.

It is located in what appears to be a residential area close to schools and cafes. It is also close to the tram heading into central station (though the tram stops were a bit of a walk when we were were there due to road works on the main road).While this is called a ""Mercure"" to me it was more like an ""Ibis"" in Australia including the size and layout of rooms and casual reception. Unfortunately the price we paid was not an Ibis price....While the room was clean, the rooms and bathrooms were very small. The free internet was very slow (much slower than standard Accor free wifi)I am Gold Accor Plus member however the receptionist was not interested in my card. I assume that I will have to follow up and make sure my points are allocated.The reception was also very little help when I asked for a boarding pass to be printed (I often just email the boarding pass to hotel reception and have never had a hotel say no - until now). I was told that I had to come down and print it myself, which meant that it took 15 minutes rather than 1 (it seems the computer in the lobby is purely for data collection purposes as you need to enter names and emails etc. just to print out a boarding pass). The hotel restaurant also tried to charge my son €5 for a small cup of ice (about 8 cubes) that fortunately when we checked out the receptionist said we didn't have to pay).NOTE re mobility: There is no lift accessible on entrance level (it is either about 8 stairs stairs up or 8 stairs down to access the lift).Environmental watch: Despite environmental cards in the bathroom alerting you to save water, our towels that were hung up each day as requested, were replaced two of the three days of our stay. There also did not appear to be any means of recycling paper and plastic. The snap off / screw on lids in the toiletries did not work very well meaning that the bottles were hard to reseal. p.s. The Accor Map was appreciated however at least 6 of the marked tram stops were in different locations than what was marked.",3,Well located hotel if you plan to explore central Amsterdam but want to avoid the red light and central station areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229124-r506036171-Mercure_Amsterdam_Centre_Canal_District-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,EatWellEatSafe

We paid for a standard room and were upgraded to one with a view over the canal. The room was very clean and small (which we expected) but had plenty of well designed storage and shelves etc. The windows opened but the location is quite noisy at night. There was no air conditioning but a good sized fan was provided as standard.The hotel oozes a local character.The staff were always very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. As many point out the stairs on entering from the street up to the reception and rooms are a sight to behold (steep, curved and narrow with short steps - oxygen is not provided). The staff at the hotel ALWAYS offer to carry everyone's bags from street level to room and back out if you want them to - so the stairs are not really a major issue. The only problem would be if you can't physically cope with difficult stairs.Breakfast was 'basic continental' but always kept well stocked as people came and went.The location is perfect for a city centre stay. It is within easy walking distance (20-30 minutes max) of all the city centre attractions. There are many very nice bars and restaurants within a short walk.If you want a basic reasonably priced city centre hotel with 'oodles' of local character and can climb steep stairs this should be on your list!

My wife and I booked a standard room for 1 night. It was the middle of the week and they upgraded us to a balcony room. We probably would have booked this room had we been there more than one night. It was amazing, if a little small. The balcony was nice, had a great view of the canal, and allowed us a nice cool place to people watch. There were a few quirks here. When you leave, you leave your key with the front desk and pick it up when you get back. I assume this is so you don't lose the physical key while visiting the city (smart). The stairs to the rooms are a bit steep and narrow. I'm a big guy (6'4) and still made it just fine, even loaded with bags. The bed was comfortable, but not overly lavish.Overall, we loved it. The staff were nice and friendly and spoke perfect English (as do many many people here). The location was close enough to everything we wanted to see so we could walk everywhere.

It is in a large historic building where Queen Beatrix was actually married. It is an absolute must stay in if you are in Amsterdam and looking for luxury and superior service. We had the pleasure of being greeted and accommodated by a well trained guest services manager, Roel Backus, who extended himself graciously to my family and especially to my daughter to ensure that our stay was perfect, which is was. The buffet breakfast is a must try, even if you are not staying at the hotel. The variety is plentiful and quality is very high. There is even a nicely sized swimming pool, steam room, and sauna which is unusual in European hotels but added an extra level of privilege and relaxation. Yes, it is expensive, but it is well worth the price you will pay from top to bottom and I highly recommmend a stay here.

He marked a map for us that we used all weekend, even though we've been to Amsterdam many times before, but the leads gave us great intel into the city as it is now.Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the entire weekend. And to top it off, they left a note and Dutch cookies in our son's room, welcoming him back to his birth city. I must have mentioned it over the phone, because I was trying to get a specific set of rooms and online they were sold out.The vibe of the hotel is very cool and reminds us of The Ace hotel, from our home town.

Overall the hotel has a hip vibe and is clean and very convenient.We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine. The front desk staff was attentive and helpful.But.................Be careful what you ask for. My wife wanted a tub so we requested the ""tubbie"" room, one of the only rooms with a tub. It is on the top floor in the back building and requires a 1/2 flight of stairs to get to once you are out of the elevator. Inside the room, there is a very small entry that is dark and the light switch is hard to find and another very narrow, spiral staircase up to the attic where the room is. So no matter what, you have 1 1/2 flights of stairs to get to this room. In the room, there are several beams going across it at a height of less than 6'. If you are that tall, you will have to duck several times when walking across the room. The TV is obstructed by those beams.There is no closet or dresser. Only an open structure with 2' of pole space and a couple of hangers. There is no place to put suitcases. The lighting in the room is dim.The door to the bathroom is translucent and unfortunately the toilet is right beside the door so anyone in the room has a full, if cloudy, view of whoever is on the toilet and what they are doing. The bathtub is a claw foot type and is out in the room about 5' from the bed. There is no privacy for whoever is taking a bath.The windows in the room start at eye level when standing and only about 18"" high. The view is of the canal in back, but you have to be standing right at the window to see it.

Our only real negative was that our ‘Roomy’ room wasn’t particularly roomy. As we were in the eaves we had restricted head height on one side of the bed, which became a bit annoying after a while.

This was a wonderful hotel experience - how you might ask? Maybe it all began with check-in, which was quick and efficient (we had an early check-in and the room was ready). And then lovely room 214, a large and tastefully decorated room, with massive floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Herengracht canal and romantic 17th century burghers homes across the way. This has to be the best room in the hotel, with both the bedroom and gloriously large bathroom overlooking the canal and with a small Juliet balcony off of the bedroom. The king bed was firmly comfortable and covered in luxurious white cotton sheets. The room has a/c, which is important in the humid summertime, and a flat screen tv (if you like that sort of thing). Bag breakfasts arrive at your door with yogurt and bananas in the morning and there is coffee in the room, but the part that makes it special - a pint of fresh milk for your coffee (why doesn't every hotel do this?). There is also unlimited bottled flat and sparkling water (again, every hotel should do this). Downstairs there is a fun and lively bar and restaurant, with reasonable prices, that seemed to be a hot spot for hanging out. The hotel location is also fantastic not far from the trams and shopping. Oh, I almost forgot, they have four free bicycles available for their guests to use! #IloveTheHoxton Minor complaints, to get to room 214 you get off of the elevator walk down the hallway and then have to go up 4 stairs, a bit cumbersome with luggage.

We did, and chose the Hoxton as our hotel (recommended by the groom himself who had stayed there before).Since this is a hotel review, I'll just keep it at that...A few days before we arrived, I sent an email to the hotel requesting 1) the groom be given special outstanding service, and 2) a few bits and bobs for the groom (including a plate of curry and chips) which I felt were symbols of some of the unique & quirky aspects that reflected our 16 year friendship. Evelien was the first to respond and did so with such genuine enthusiasm, that I got an immediate insight to the warm & hospitable culture there. The email correspondences from the various rostered staff afterwards carried on the attitude from Evelien. So when we arrived and the groom sauntered into his hotel room, there waiting for him were the curry & chips - sitting on a tray and piping hot, with the other items which had been arranged between the Hoxton and I. We were blown away, and needless-to-say, the groom WAS treated like a king for the duration of our stay.Bravo to the Hoxton team (Evelien, Micha, Yorinda, Karim, Lennart & Diego), you are a credit to your hotel.

The bathroom is actually really big, with a good shower. The beds were comfy and the TV was a good size with a range of channels to pick from. The walk to the Dam and Red Light District is about 10 mins, while a walk to Centraal Station is 15 mins.

The hotel is clean, modern, and comfortable, the one caveat being that the ""cozy"" rooms are very small indeed. We had requested a quiet room and early check in and got both. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. A special thank you to William, who was at the front desk early on a Sunday morning when my wife became very ill and we needed advice on medical care. He told us our options, then, at our request, called a cab, told the cabby where to take us, and we were whisked off to a wonderful, modern hospital where my wife received excellent care at a reasonable price. Later that evening, 14 hours later to be precise, William was still on duty and noticed us dining in the hotel dining room. He sent over complimentary after-dinner drinks since, as the waiter put it, we had had ""a rough day."" Then he came over to chat and asked us how we were doing. Service with a warm, human touch! Thank you, William! (The hotel restaurant and bar are great, by the way, with the bar known locally for its innovative cocktails.) The one thing to be aware of is that the ""cozy"" rooms are a tight fit for two people. Still, this is central Amsterdam, right on one of the main canals, within easy walking distance of Dam square, so you have to expect some trade-offs.

The blend of old and new is masterful, even unique for a hotel. It was exciting to walk through the portal and anticipate a luxurious experience. Didn't happen that way. The room was extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient, The corridors are gorgeous san AC...that omission was a mistake. Maybe the AC was on the blink. Watch your step as you leave the room as a step-down is not marked or illuminated. I had a deluxe, two floor suite (514) with a view of the street...a bit noisy but tolerable. After climbing the steep, Amsterdam-style stairs to the bedroom and having my luggage carried upstairs, I went to unpack. Surprise -- the closets are on the first floor. Back down the steep staircase with my luggage in tow. But how do you open the closets or turn the lights on/off or even the TV? My remote didn't work. Even the bedside lamp required ""instructions."" When using the desk, it was inevitable that you hit your head -- every single time -- on the light fixture that hangs over the chair. And, my knee got a bruisin' from hitting the desk drawer when trying to avoid the pendant light. The furniture is low to the floor -- a trip factor vs. comfortable. To net the experience, the designer thought about clever, unusual, or even tech-forward and NOT guest convenience. Yeah -- there is a user manual to explain it all but who wants to read a manual for normally very predictable operations. Service was abysmal, especially in the bar and dining areas. One morning I ordered an omelette but the server told me ""It will be a long time. The kitchen is backed up."" Seriously? That was discouraging and even funny given other service issues. Got the wrong check in the bar, used dishes and glasses weren't removed after guests, sheets were not changed daily (my requirement when away from home) crumbs everywhere, chipped furniture and it goes from there. On a positive note, the Van Gogh Museum is literally across the street and the boat tour through the canals was memorable...neither had much to do with the hotel experience. While it was expensive, we hired a private and luxurious boat service to tour the canals with lunch and wine...worth every penny.

As we walked into the atrium upon arrival, I was in amazed by the modern atmosphere. While checking in, we were all offered a glass of either water or apple juice, and to have our luggage taken up to our room.The building apparently used to be a music school, so there are some nice heritage elements of the hotel, such as the dimmer lit hallways with concrete pillars and mosaic floors, and a violin chandelier just past the main lobby.Similarly to the lobby area, the hotel room was very bright and modern. We were four people in a suite, which had two levels: a lower level and a mezzanine. I've heard many rooms have steps, so it'd be a good idea to ask the hotel for a room with no stairs if you have trouble climbing them. The lower level had a bathroom, television, closet, kitchen table, bench, mini bar (and nespresso machine), and couch which converts to a bed. Since we were four people, we asked for an additional cot. The mezzanine had a couch chair, television, king bed, closet, and a bathroom.Despite the aesthetically pleasing decor, the advanced technology caused much frustration among all of us, including millennials! The day and night curtains are operated by a switch on the wall, which didn't make sense to me when you can open the curtains manually twice as fast and decide how far open you want them. The lights were also very confusing. Firstly, the closet lights and some of the bathroom lights are operated by a motion sensor. For the closet, it's okay, but it's quite a shock to walk in to the bathroom at night only to have a light suddenly turn on. The other lights were also difficult to use. Some lights had their own switch. Unfortunately even after I've left the hotel I still don't know how to use the lights, so I can't really explain it in this review. But there was an ""all lights off"" switch, a ""daylights on"" switch, and some other switches. Some lights wouldn't go on unless some other switches were on, and some lights couldn't be turned off without making the whole place go dark! I'd much prefer to have each light on it's own switch.In addition to the lights, the garbage cans were very small with ridiculous lids that just get in the way. The doors were also very big and heavy.During our stay, we made use of the hotel's amenities. They have a spa, gym, and pool. The gym was very nice–many machines and for the most part quite empty. I'm not sure what it's like at other times of the year, but when I went there were only two people in the gym.Breakfast was very good. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast for two days, and the other days we went to a bread place a couple hundred meters away and had croissants. The hotel breakfast offers either cold breakfast for I think €30, or hot and cold for around €40. Although the price is quite high, they offer a wide variety of food both cold and hot. The cold buffet had some fresh juices, smoothies, yoghurt, avocado chocolate pudding, cheese, fruit, salads (pumpkin salad, cucumber salad, and quinoa salad to name a a few), avocado, and smoked salmon. Perpendicular to the cold buffet was a table with a selection of cereals and breads. The pain au chocolate was so good I ate two, and had to resist a third!Overall we were pleased with the hotel. I recommend staying in this conveniently located hotel (visit the museums close by!), despite the very confusing light switches.",5,Beautiful Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2418096-r503539326-Conservatorium_Hotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,raspberrysmoothie

The classic design and the modern design were mixed together and the result was the European modern classic interior design. The furniture was not very modern but still comfy. It was simple and has less carving on it. The amenities were fantastic and so the bed was very comfortable. Throughout the penthouse, carpeted flooring and a big painting on the wall help warm up the interior and white painted-woods emphasize the clean lines of furnishings. A warm, earthier color set the tone on the walls of the living room area, serving as an upbeat yet interesting background for furnishings in accent colors inspired by the outdoors. A Rooftop-large balcony with breathtaking the canal views illustrated a historic view of Amsterdam. Sunsetting from this balcony was so relaxing, this is what it is like imagining of living 'A classical way in urban society'. My dinning experience at Bord'Eau was perfect and spotless. I highly recommend a business lunch at a romantic dinner at Hofdstaad Brasserie, an all-day dining experience offers a wide selection of chef's specialities. I would suggest to experience an authentic afternoon tea at Hèt Terrace and to chill out at Freddy's Bar with friends or family.I truly enjoyed everything that the city has to offer benefiting from the hotel's perfect location, touristic attractions like Rijksmuseum and Heineken Experience are on walking distance. I suggest to go for biking in the city and discovering hidden places, Most of biking tours are located close to to Madame Tussauds Amsterdam located in the centre of the city on Dam Square, near the Royal Palace of Amsterdam.

My husband and I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights before boarding our Viking River Cruise. Check-in was quick and easy. All hotel staff we encountered during our stay spoke English and were quite helpful. The huge brass room key is accompanied by a key card that unlocks you room's door. If you leave the hotel, you drop your key by the front desk, and retrieve it upon returning to the hotel. We had no issues or long waits with this. We had a room on the second floor overlooking the canal. I would recommend a canal view room. It was quiet and one of the expansive windows opened to allow for fresh air to come in. The A/C system is a mini machine by US standards, but the temperatures do not call for a turbo A/C. There was a large duvet and a rather rough bed spread on the double bed in our room. I would have enjoyed if a flat sheet was included in the bedding. Otherwise, the bed was not only beautiful, but also quite comfortable despite its diminutive size. Two water bottles are replenished daily in a rather large wall beverage fridge. It seems like a rather large system to fill with two measly bottles of water. The bathroom in our room was extremely small but well equipped and it appeared to have been recently renovated. The tub/shower combo was tight, as was the small sink, toilet and vanity. Louvered, full length swinging double doors served as the bathroom door. There is no bathroom fan. L'Occitane soaps, shampoo, conditioner and shower wash are available. A small bath salt cube was also included one of the two nights. The towels in the bathroom were somewhat of a disappointment compared to the overall quality of the hotel. The were rough, and did not scream 'luxury'. The blow dryer had a plate that slid from side to side to expose either a European two pronged or a standard American corded plug. Upon registration, you are lead to your room by a staff member. There is a small elevator and steep stairs in the hotel. You will be left with a hotel IPad and I recommend you read the hotel information included on it, and look at the nearby tourist attractions explained on the device, too. The hotel refreshments are delightful! Flavored water or a slightly sweetened tea or lemonade were elegantly displayed in the hotel lobby with an array of cookies, chocolates, tea biscuits & surprises for the guests to grab and enjoy in the nearby bar or in one of the many chairs or sofas nearby. Additionally, there is an automated coffee, tea, espresso, hot chocolate, latte, etc. machine in the lobby area. To-Go cups are supplied, so you may grab a cup of Joe before heading out for the day or you may whip up a cup of camomile tea as I did to enjoy during a good, long soak in the bath tub.You must have drink in the hotel bar! It is over the top beautiful, and I had a fabulous bowl of asparagus soup there. The prices for the bar food were reasonable for better than average bar food. The complimentary nuts & olives also helped to make the visit extra special. The television in the room was minuscule and quite far from the bed. We were so busy and there were a only a couple of American channels provided, so we did not bother turning it on. The biggest negative we experienced was the spotty 'free wifi'. There were periods of time where we were dropped 4-5 times in an hour! We intended on having the breakfast buffet at the hotel, but we slept in too late. We did have the desk store our luggage and then call us a taxi to our Viking Boat which cost us 20Euros.

When the hairdryer broke just one call to reception and a replacement was in the room within minutes... a crisis diverted. The meal choices were all you could ask for with breakfast and dinner within the hotel providing excellent choice and quality of food presentations. It surpassed even our high expectations. Congratulations to all concerned.All of us would very much like to thank everyone on the Front Desk and Housekeeping for providing great customer service and those little touches that mean so much to a guest. We would like to highly recommend Angela, Cindy and Annelieve (Hovenor) for exceptional client/guest service at every breakfast time and Michael behind the hot plates..... they deserve individual recognition Miss Turnhout-Ammerlaan.I'm not certain why other contributors have criticised the hotels location. Yes its outside of the City centre, but you know this before you make a reservation. It is perfect for the peace and quiet it brings and its location within the business district gives one a great insight into the modern architectural building designs being brought into the area.A five minute stroll from the hotel in one direction and you can catch the very regular number 5 tram into the centre in about 20 minutes and in the other direction for another 5 minute stroll places you into Amsterdam South rail station which gives you choices to reach many other parts of Amsterdam and regular buses. It also has a direct link right into Schiphol Airport... perfect!!All in all I cant believe anyone would be unhappy or unsettled here. The hotel is great, the staff superb, ambience relaxing and it is an excellent hub to explore this beautiful City.

The first was a weird low pitched buzzing noise on two nights, which seemed to come from the central air cooling system (we turned off the air con in the room and it was still there). When a staff member came up he checked out other free rooms and said the noise was also bad in those and so there was little point in changing. They did provide us with ear plugs though which did the trick! They did seem aware of the problem, but unable to do anything about it. Other gripe was that our room wasn't cleaned on one day. We asked reception to sort it out and were assured it would be done by the time we came back that night, but it wasn't. Unfortunately that was also the same day as my husband's birthday and so I felt especially disappointed. I was given a reduction in the room rate, but still very disappointing as this isn't a cheap hotel and we were there for a special occasion.I'd certainly recommend this place if you want quirky and funky and good service.

Of course I shouldn't have taken a cab; I should have just taken the ferry from the train station right across the harbor which runs constantly. I’ve stayed in lots of boutique hotels, but this was among the best in terms of design. Also during the checkin process I experienced something new, the person who checked me in offered me a drink and then when we were done with the registration process they personally escorted me to the room with plenty of explanations along the way. My room overlooked the harbor with big picture windows, and the view even from the 5th floor was great. The was room was overflowing with storage so even two people shouldn’t have a problem finding places to store their luggage and clothes. I loved that the shower and toilet were in two separate spaces, and the bed was super comfortable. On the weekend it can get to be a bit of a scene down in the lobby but it gives you lots to look at. My experience with the restaurant there was mixed so my advice is not to stray too far from the burgers and chicken wings. One weird thing is that all the seats at the bar have their backs to the beautiful harbor views and instead look into the kitchen - weird. My only criticism is that the hotel service didn't always match the surroundings - more than a couple of things got screwed up in the 3 days that I stayed there, but that didn't take away from the great surroundings and the my favorite elevator ever with a rotating disco ball. One downside is that the hotel isn’t particularly near any of the attractions (except for the stunning film museum next door). Hopefully the level of service will improve and maybe they will even get some discos LPs in the bins downstairs.",5,"Beautiful Hotel, Service Level Still Catching Up",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d9589433-r509076281-Sir_Adam_Hotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,jrcw75th

If you care about money, looks, being cool then this hotel is perfect for the vapid and self absorbed millennial generation that shops at urban outfitters.  Opinionated hipsters and oblivious iPhone zombies plagued the entire area and you could tell how annoyed most of the staff were and even the locals by the run of the mill basic white Americans that argue about their own privilege stayed at sir ADAM hotel for five days,I arrived in Amsterdam after a week of traveling through Germany and needed my clothes washed but their website stated they had a laundromat to self service our needs. Once we arrived (before check in) the front desk was busy helping other guests and explaining how the hotel works (which is confusing to most people visiting for the first time), once we were able to ask about doing our laundry before checking in they told us there was no way to do so unless we walked/taxi to the closest town laundromat. We walked for about twenty minutes from the hotel to get to des roos laundromat which was very busy (sir ADAM hotel drops off their guests clothes here to get washed too but for 5x the price) but the woman who was running the place was very welcoming and kind. After 2 hours we walked back to the hotel to check in. Our room was spacious and had high ceilings. It was clean but always dusty. The butcher is a casual place on the ground floor where anyone can eat, and has decent burgers, but the breakfast was disappointing. The servers were rude and it seemed like the setup of the building and seating were not thought out enough to execute properly. Madam restaurant is almost at the top of the building with a nice view, you need a reservation for Moon (their nicest restaurant inside which is four star quality/five star price) and madam to eat or drink. Neither place made a great impression being that we found so many great places to eat in the city. I thought the turntable and selection of vinyl records in our room were a nice touch, but sadly they chose to use Crosley turntables (which are the worst and destroy vinyl faster than anything) and most of the Lp's were in too poor of condition to listen to. It wasn't a horrible experience in any way, but I expected the service standards to be higher based on appearances. This hotel has a lot going on all the time and also has plenty of hidden gems most people overlook due to how busy it gets.It's a unique place with plenty of things to do to pass the time, and a short walk to the ferry which is free to use and takes you to the other side of the river to get to the city.

Hotels which try to be different can often end up just being odd, and lose sight of what matters (nice stay) but not here.

The bar area is a 'social club' with DJ, relaxed atmosphere and amazing burgers and beer. Reception staff very friendly.The lifts are all themed, including a disco lift complete with light up floor and glitter ball on the ceiling.

It took maybe 20-25mins walk to get to Dam Square but there are lots of lovely bars, restaurants, shops and markets on the way which was nice to experience.

The hairdryer is very poor with an extremely short lead so I would advise you to bring your own. There is also a secure safe located in one of the presses. In regards location - it's fantastic. You take the train from Schipol to Centraal Station. It costs €5 for a one way adult ticket and it takes about 20 minutes. Once you get to Centraal Station take the exit towards the river. Turn and keep the water on your right hand side. The hotel is no more than a 5 to 7 minute walk. From Centraal Station you can get the hop on/hop off bus so from a tourist/sightseeing point of view the hotel is ideal. If you don't get breakfast in the hotel there are 2 or 3 small eateries directly across the road (no more than 20 steps away from the hotel exit).

The rooms were large with lots of natural light. Everything was extremely clean, and the amenities provided were more than adequate. The wifi was fast.In terms of location, it's not the best. The hotel is located away from the old city on the ""other"" side of the Centraal station. You can either walk 1 km from Centraal, or take bus # 48 (1 stop). However, this means that you are far away from the charm of the city on a modern and artificial island. Eating options around the hotel are rather limited. The restaurant in the hotel offers limited options, and is rather expensive. Also, everytime we dined at the restaurant, or ordered room service, we were asked to settle the bill immediately instead of charging it to our room. Not the most convenient option.Also, another issue that is specific to our stay - we tried checking in at around 2:30 pm, and we were told that since we wanted 1 double bed instead of 2 single beds, none of those rooms were ready. We could either wait, take a room with 2 single beds, or upgrade (not free - for EUR 12.50 a night). We ended up upgrading with additional charge, just so that we did not have to wait. Hardly an ideal experience. The hotel should have offered a free upgrade since the rooms not being ready were really their fault. We had booked months in advance, and had very clearly specified that we wanted a room with 1 double bed.Will definitely not be my first choice for a place to stay in Amsterdam in the future.",3,"Good hotel, not so great location, average experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d4345724-r507057913-Room_Mate_Aitana-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,RAHULD86

Although when we returned at 3:30 p.m., our room was still not ready yet.

INK is centrally located, just a 10-minute walk from the big train station. Its public spaces feel unique and intimate, from the sloping entryway that brings you down a tad below street level, where it is cool and quiet, to a very casual check-in desk (employees stand behind a wooden table to work; it feels like they could have been printsetters in another time). The bar and restaurant, with their attentive help, are inviting and casual, so much so you might not want to leave even though the action-packed city beckons. Rooms upstairs carry on the word and story themes: In each an artist has sketched a black-and-white map of the city on the bedroom wall and written her/his favorite spots to visit. It's actually a big help. Rooms are small -- tight, even. But nicely appointed, and the bed comfy. And after all, the point in Amsterdam is to get out and explore.

I queried it and the girl on reception said there was an extra (quite high) charge for early access. I was not told that. So pointless checking in in advance. As I had expected to be able to freshen up and change my clothes before going out I then had to spend the afternoon in boiling hot weather in unsuitable clothes. Not a good start.The other thing I had done in advance was to ask if they had a private bathroom as I did not like the look of the clear glass in the pictures on the website. I think they had tried to accommodate this as the glass in our bathroom was opaque but you could still see through it and I was not comfortable with this.Also the room we had was very dark and we had to have the lights on constantly as it looked out onto a solid wall!The service in the restaurant was not great-very slow considering there was only one other couple in there!Also they could do with more staff and a bigger check in desk as there were always long queues.But on the positive side-all the staff were lovely and friendly.

After the last stay we won't be returning. The first issue is the staff, not true of all the staff members but most were generally rude. Entering and leaving the hotel was uncomfortable as some of the staff at reception did not make us feel welcome, I don't really appreciate being silently stared down as I walk to my room. Another issue was the relentless mini bar check while we occupied the room, not a practice I expect from a four star hotel. The problem with attitude among the staff became really evident when someone who came to check the mini bar while we were busy, entered our room without making himself known (there were a few times where someone entered our room without permission which was real invasion of privacy) and then proceeded to move our belongings with his foot to gain access to the fridge, all without saying much to either of us. We made this incident known at the end of check out and they were obviously apologetic, but during check out we were not asked how our stay was or if there were any issues, and we were told we'd used an item of the mini bar when we had not - which you'd think they'd know we didn't seeing as they checked so much. The bedsheets weren't changed for 5 nights and other areas of the room hadn't been cleaned, I'd expect more in the hygiene and upkeep of a busy hotel. Dodgy loud air conditioning and being able to hear noise from other rooms did not make for a decent rest. Issues with fees and unnecessary ""holding"" of money were a bother during a couple of our stays as well. They held £500 without any mention after we had already returned from our trip which is really underhand. I mean, aside from all that the stay was fine, but for the hotel element the priority should be the comfort of the guests. De Hallen seems to be more focused on becoming an institution. Reading through some of the comments it's clear we are not the only people to have experienced these things during time there and De Hallen seem to be vigilant at replying and apologising to poor reviews, however apologies are not going to mean much if nothing is done about the issues.",2,"3rd stay, last stay ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d5971630-r503091712-Hotel_De_Hallen-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Dave B

We found the rooms pleasantly quirky and were not bothered by the lack of windows - we were there just to sleep after all! Although the ground floor rooms line the main foyer, they seemed at least as quiet if not better than other rooms we have stayed in. The décor throughout the reception area and foyer is really funky and we enjoyed just sitting there and having a drink.The reception was very helpful at check-in and they have nice cool water on offer all day (which we helped ourselves to regularly). With one exception detailed below, the service standards were high.Although the location is a tram trip from the main tourist spots, it is a picturesque tram route and they run regularly. The added bonus of the location is the adjacent food hall which we ate at on both nights.On the last night of our stay, we spotted a used coke can lying under the bed. We could have just disposed of it but felt the reception would want to know their cleaners had missed it. They told us they would come down and remove it straight away but nobody showed up. We had to contact reception again 45 minutes later at which stage a different person said he knew nothing about it. He did come down and remove the can but by then it had turned into a larger issue for us then it should ever have been.Overall, we were happy with Hotel De Hallen and it was just a pity they handled our one complaint a little clumsily.",4,Wish we could give it full marks!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d5971630-r504744541-Hotel_De_Hallen-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Angry_Scampi

The rooms didn't have a view but were not overlooked and were quiet.Room size was OK (what you would expect from a standard hotel room) but the only quibble was that there was limit space to store our cases once unpacked. We only had 2 carry on cases but they were too big to put under the bed or under the sofa. I guess the hotel would store larger bags if needed.Bathroom was semi-open plan to the bedroom which may put some off but no problem for us.Room was very clean and well equipped (coffee maker, kettle, hair dryer, robes and slippers) and loads of soaps, gels, shampoos in the bathroom. Bathroom has plenty of space for his and hers toiletries. The room was decorated in a large scale, querky map of Amsterdam so you could easily get a idea of where everything was.

From bed to bathroom to power outlets we felt that a lot of smart design and well-thought through interiors had gone into the process.

Moreover, the room offered well airconditioned, quiet and uninterrupted sleep and the room felt as private as should be expected from a high-class hotel.Similarly, the hotel is built in a way which values its secluded though transparent spaces and we registered that both a birthday was celebrated and business meetings were being held without anyone distrubing one another.We came back several times to the hotel rather than staying out late simply because of the bar and lounge area, which added on to the experience - the signature INK drink (picture) as well as the artichokes are recommended!Breakfast was a bit busy, but still worth the additional price.",5,Lived up to every expectation and more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230120-r510491421-INK_Hotel_Amsterdam_MGallery_by_Sofitel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,VertigOslo

Check in was thankfully quick, however, make sure you enquiry exactly what security deposits you put on your credit card, we were slapped with a huge deposit. The rooms are very tiny, and when I say tiny I am not over exaggerating. The room pictures they use on Booking.com look deceptively big - but once you check in you quickly realise why don't publish pictures of their standard rooms. But after all you are here to explore the city, not sit in your hotel room all day. The location is what makes this hotel so fantastic, we could stroll around the corner and be at the Van Gogh Museum, Rijks Museum and the ""I AMsterdam"" sign. The Heineken Experience building is also down the road and really a MUST do. The beds in our room are incredibly soft - but not in a good way. More like when you sit down on your bed, you almost sink to the floor. So not the most comfortable sleep. The towels also need to be replaced, they have been bleached so many times they are already showing signs of tearing apart.Our air conditioner was making a horrendous noise when we checked in - we enquired with reception if they could send someone from maintenance to have it checked. But we were advised that maintenance would only be able to do it the next day??! Knowing we would not get any sleep, we asked to be moved to a different room, and thankfully they had another standard room available.The breakfast buffet is the usual European selection of bread, yoghurts, cereal, cheese and meats. The coffee tasted weak and the juice diluted - so rather opt for a cappuccino - which is available for an additional 1 Euro. The dining tables and chairs are in serious need of a revamp. The seating chairs were worn out and torn and not very comfy to sit on.

The two beds probably cover 50% of the floor space. Other furniture includes a wardrobe, two bedroom cabinets and a desk (with chair) with shelf above.The beds themselves are extremly comfortable and the only issue we have is the squeeze to get into the one nearest the window.

This was a little trickier than first thought as the airport is vast and we found ourselves wandering around for a while looking for the WTC (world trade centre - pick up point). The WTC is located behind the Sheraton (which you can see when leaving the airport) and not really visible from the airport, also no signs. However this was not arranged by the hotel but thought its worth mentioning for anyone else who pre books a taxi and are given the same instructions.When we arrived at the hotel, check in was quick and easy and off we went to our room. I enjoyed the fact there were fresh apples on reception for you to have whenever you liked. Yes the rooms are small but when in a city knowing we weren't going to spend much time in the room itself it did not bother us at all. Nice bathroom/wet room. Coffee making facilities. Hairdryer. Aircon.... perfect. My only gripe is that the bed was a little hard and it did need a lick of paint in places but it was clean.We didn't drink or have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment on prices. There are so many nearby shops to pick up a breakfast.The hotel is situated on the outskirts of the 'centre' which is where we always prefer to be as we always discover lots of things on the walk into the centre (Dam Square). It is right next door to the Van Gogh Museum and the Heineken factory. Sorry, didn't go to either so can't comment on these attractions.We came to Amsterdam for the U2 gig at Amsterdam Arena. The arena is located in the middle of nowhere really and not within walking distance. A taxi cost us €30 from the hotel to the arena - about a 15-20 min drive. It cost the same on the way home from the main taxi queue outside of the arena.We also visited the Anne Frank Museum which is located in the centre, about 15-20 min walk from the hotel. I highly recommend booking online before you travel. We booked 2 months in advance and there weren't many tickets left. My partner thought this would be pretty boring but he was quite surprised at how interesting this was... make sure you you pick up an audio pack at the entrance as most of the info is given through this.We found drink prices to be approx €6 a pint. We didn't even entertain the pubs that advertised the price the food but not the beer as we were warned that these places around Dam Square would be very expensive.In between our hotel and the walk to the centre there are a few streets of restaurants which are cheaper than the ones bang in the centre. You have the choice of Italian, Greek, Mexican food etc. We visited the 'El Vino' Mexican restaurant and loved the food and the friendliness of the staff. Sorry, can't remember the names of the other restaurants but we all looked to serve nice food.The streets of Amsterdam are like a spiders web, you will get lost, its a given. Make sure you pick up a map out of the magazine in the hotel room. This came in very handy.",4,Nice hotel in a great location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d662193-r508776059-Apollo_Museumhotel_Amsterdam_City_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,shelstar86

If you want to get cheaper transport you can get the train to Central Station and the tram which then stops right outside the hotel, like literally drops you at the front door. First impressions of this hotel were good, the reception is well decorated. The location is great, you are 30 second walk from the flower market, and a 10 minute walk from the Royal Palace and the Red Light District. The hotel is also located with Bars, Pubs and Restaurants in a 5 minute walking distance, just across the tram track, where you will find coffee shops, Wagamamas, McDonald's, local cafes and lots more. The Ice Bar is also located in this area. Back to the hotel, the hotel has great first impressions but the room we stayed in was on the 7th floor and was very small, and an extremely small bathroom. Definitely not worth the €200 a night price (approx). The staff can be a little rude and stand offish. Sort of this you are a burden to talk to. The house keeping is poor, the sheets are not changed, ours were not changed in 3 days. The bathroom again is SMALL, and dated. It also needs some serious maintenance.

I intend to lay out this review in the form of the meal I ordered but never received from the hotel (in case you didn't notice, that was the first negative point).For starters, upon entering the 'hotel' (more like a hostel because of the 5:00 AM raves and appalling hygiene) I found myself the room as the staff were 'too busy' to show me to my room. The first thing I noticed about my room was the carpet which had mould around the edges which when I informed a member of staff about, I was greeted with the message that ""all our carpets are like that"". For the 'main course' of my review, I received dirty towels in my bathroom. And of course, by 'my bathroom' I mean the bathroom which was communal for around 6 family size rooms. Over my three night stay. But of course it was my personal error as I should have known replacement towels are not complementary and would set me back €25. To top it all off comes the dessert. On the other half of the queen size bed I 'slept' on was a yellowish stain which was later identified as urine by a member of staff who I caught the attention of whilst she walked down a corridor doing nothing instead of cleaning the people whos bookings keep them employed.

Very disappointing as the bedroom was quite small, there was a small area through an alcove with a sofa wardrobe and a shelf with the kettle. The tv was in the bedroom therefore the only use for this was to put our suitcases on the sofa. A big issue was the mirror was too far from an electrical socket to use the hairdryer. A small mirror above the shelf with the kettle would resolve this. The bathroom is small and the bath mat was more the size of a bar towel, it was removed the 2nd day and not replaced. The bathroom floor was a bit slippery without it. The lighting in the bedroom was poor with the wall lights above the bed not working. The curtains were coming down and the space on the right of the bed too small for any bedside cupboard.

As we had booked a non-refundable room I received a blunt response saying in no circumstances would they need to provide a refund. I asked the hotel is we could potentially keep 'nights' to use at a quiet time for the hotel later in the year, but they said I had to confirm the dates we'd be travelling immediately to do so. I explained that we do not know exactly when we will be able to travel given that we do not know how many more months we will have with my partner's father and need to be available are caregivers for him, so I cannot confirm dates. They told me in that case they won't offer anything.The money would have been a small amount for the hotel to absorb and I would have definitely stayed with them in the future if they had been lenient and understanding about my reason to cancel, but the 'not my problem' attitude I received was not appreciated in an already exceptionally difficult time.I do appreciate that they don't have to do anything in this situation and it's my fault for booking non-refundable, but most providers would have shown some compassion and humanity to our situation.My advice: book the hotel and stay there as it's a reasonable price, but do not expect them to do anything they don't contractually have to do.

And it was such a delight to discover this quiet hotel just off the main drag. Trams 24 and 2 from Central have stops on both sides of the hotel, and literally up the road are bars and restaurants. The hotel itself has small if adequate en suite rooms but you do see a canal when you peer out of your window (I was placed in a canal room which I didn't book but eventually got thankful for) so I had no reason to complain. Though the lifts were apparently not working @ various points of my stay, luckily they were working every time I WAS in and didn't experience the inconvenience of climbing up those narrow steep stairs to the 5th floor carrying luggages. If I did, staff were obliging enough to do it for you according to the other guests.

I emailed them the night before our arrival to check the 2 rooms I'd booked were together and to confirm our time of arrival. To my horror they cancelled allegiance g the hotel was closed due to fire regulations. They had relocated us to the Blue Tower hotel 5 miles outside Amsterdam! Apparently, according to the cab driver who took us to our hotel,this happens a lot ! Hotels get late requests for parties willing to pay s premium and move people to other hotels.I had not been happy about being relocated to a hotel I didn't book but Blue Tower turned out to be a great stay. The staff were very helpful and the rooms had a panoramic view of the city. It's just been refurbished and the work is ongoing. The European breakfast was also great and runs later in a Sunday! The location was a down side and tram needed into the city but on s positive the tram stops are a couple of minutes away on foot. Definitely consider buying tram tickets from the hotel for the days you're staying rather than in s daily basis and you'll save money! The only criticism of the hotel was the wifi in our room was terrible!Loads to do in Amsterdam galleries, canal trips to appreciate the beautiful architecture shipping and culture all around.

This is my experience and there are no allegations in this. I had booked about a month or so ago, through my travel agent AAA who went through Travel Bound. When I arrived, the part time front desk receptionist did not have rooms. Then she found me a super small room, where I had to go to the thrid floor and then climb some steps to go to it. It had views of pipes and roof tops. I think the rooms with views that Amy J refers to are reserved for people considered ""special"" (?). When I asked to change to a room with a window that was being cleaned, I was told ""no"" that that room was reserved for someone else. After enduring one night in a super small room, where the shower leaked all night leaving water and mosquitos, I asked to change in the morning, and only upon the importunate request of the plumber, was I given a slightly larger room in a dark and dingy basement, under a pavement grate that gave me night mares all night. Was absolutely no slice of heaven for me. The pictures in the hallways were not to my taste and the neighborhood was full of ""weed"" smoke! I came back hopelessly sick. On the one hot day there was no air conditioning and when it was freezing cold, there was No heat! But the lower level staff, the housekeepers, the kitchen staff, the plumber and handyman, were all VERY helpful, sympathetic and caring. It is not a 4 Star hotel. Even the vinyl corners of the beds are beat up.

This was really inconvenient for us and very disappointing as I had spoken to the hotel on many occasions prior to our arrival, and had our booking confirmation in black and white. I had, had a confirmation email from booking.com and The Albus themselves so I was very shocked to be told this. The member of staff that dealt with us was a trainee and she was very polite about the situation and paid for us to get a taxi to a hotel that they were booking us into instead for the night, and when we arrived at the new hotel everything was organised as promised. The situation was very inconvenient for us as it also made us run late for our booking for Anne Frank's House but the hotel had arranged for the taxi to wait for us whilst we checked into our new hotel and then took us; luckily we were just in time for our booked tickets. Thank you for sorting out the mix up, everything did work out ok in the end. I do think it was a little unfair that a trainee was made to explain the situation to us. She gave us a free drink in the bar, either a beer, house wine of soft drink; a nice offer but I don't think it really justifies the inconvenience. The next day we missed a booking due to checking in and out of the 2 hotels as The Eden (new hotel) was very slow at calling us a taxi, in the end I frantically chased the concierge around the reception as he was dealing with so many people and the rude receptionist wouldn't call us a taxi she just kept saying ask the concierge who was clearly very busy, and she clearly was not. The Albus hotel itself was very clean, however the shower wasn't great, wasn't that warm and was very slow.

I chose the hotel because I had noticed it on previous visits to Amsterdam (when I had stayed at the Krasnapolsky which is relatively nearby). I wanted to be near the train station on this occasion and hence my decision. Untypically I began to read Tripadvisor reviews after I had completed my booking and as quite a number were unfavourable I felt a degree of trepidation and foreboding that I had made a terrible mistake.I am happy and relieved to be able to report that I had a thoroughly pleasant stay notwithstanding that the hotel is undergoing massive refurbishment. The temporary entrance to the hotel was, for example, down a narrow alley which would be daunting for the fainthearted if they arrived in darkness. There seems nothing to fear, however, because I walked freely and in safety around the area in the evenings.I stayed in what is called the Urban Wing. My room was modern, clean, well equipped and of a reasonable size. The decor is perhaps a little dark but this is to some people's taste and not to others. I quite liked it. The staff were coping remarkably well with the works that were ongoing and while the works are obviously very extensive with dozens of various tradesmen in hard hats coming and going and my experience was that the works were minimally intrusive and did not disturb my stay (or indeed my sleep and I am a light sleeper).The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedwear of obviously high quality.The bathroom was small and well equipped with nice quality toiletries. There was a handbasin, toilet, and a shower with waterfall shower head. Housekeeping was faultless during my short stay.The buffet breakfast was excellent with a extensive choice of cold cut meats, cheeses, fruit, fruit juices, breads, pastries, hot cooked food such as eggs, bacon, sausages (chicken sausages which I had never tried before and which proved surprisingly tasty) and soforth. The waiting staff were efficient and very friendly and engaged in chat whenever a reduced pressure of numbers gave them an idle moment or two.Reception was extremely efficient - check in and checkout without any hitches which can often commence a stay with a degree of irritation. The accommodation booked and the rate quoted were adhered to with accuracy.My stay was so thoroughly pleasant and enjoyable that I can only imagine how perfect it is likely to be when the major refurbishments are completed and the configuration of the hotel is back to normal. I will definitely stay here again should I ever have occasion to revisit this charming city of Amsterdam.For those who may have misgivings because of negative reviews I would suggest that they perhaps specifically book a room in the Urban Wing because I found my room there to be faultless, comfortable and quiet.Incidentally wifi is free in the hotel (including bedroom) - quality connection and good speed.",5,"Convenient location, great staff",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230125-r503320477-Park_Plaza_Victoria_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,emjaykay

My sister's room was fine. Lighting was odd in my bathroom as the ceiling light shined downward behind you as you stood at the mirror which made it difficult to see what you were doing as you put your make up on (particularly since I wear glasses).

Being a no-frills restaurant, the only staff available was at the reception, so don't expect any room service/housekeeping support.

At first, when you open the bathroom, you almost miss the shower area because the shower cubicle is that small. Also, please note that there is no ""Air-conditioning"" in the rooms. I'll quote the receptionist, ""we do not have air conditioning, but we have air cooling, and there is a fine line between them"". This was a new concept for us to grasp. These ""air coolers"" would go off every hour or so at night, and the reception told us that they control them centrally and turn them off if they feel it's too cold. Our room became very stuffy without any cooling system. The room has a small device to control this cooling, but I think that's a dummy device and the hotel controls it. We didn't buy the breakfast because 17€ per person for breakfast was expensive for Ibis.

Took City Sightseeing tours both bus and boat. As for the bus, we were seated on the top deck. The configuration of the bus with its obstructed view made it next to impossible to take photos. In addition, the glass ceiling produced a greenhouse effect making the bus extremely uncomfortable even though the ""air conditioning"" was on. The canal cruise (you have your pick of 3 different routes) was a better experience. Check out the Ruks museum and a good photo opp of the "" I lOVE AMSTERDAM"" sign behind the museum! Also, the diamond cutting store is also on the canal/bus tour. We purchased a nice watch there and the staff filled out the VAT form for us. The hotel has an extremely tasty buffet breakfast service. It also had a nice bar/restaurant serving decent food at a good cost. We found that getting meals outside was problematic due to the extreme numbers of people. The train station itself does have some restaurants and co-op stores.

As far as the location if you are going to the Van Gogh museum, it’s just down the street. There are tram/trolley stops close as well to get to other parts of town. Vondle park is right across the street, treat yourself and stroll through the park. plud walking up trough the park is a great start of finish to walking into the main part of town.

Staff were polite and welcoming and check in was very speedy. On going to our rooms we were very disappointed with the standard as they were nowhere near the standard shown on the website (131 & 106). I would say avoid room 106 as it is in the basement, with a very small window facing onto the street, it was next to the lift shaft, toilets and offices. Not pleasant at all and my 2 friends didn't sleep at all in there the first night as it was very stuffy and very noisy. Staff changed their room the next day to a much nicer room, still not really like the ones in the pictures but pleasant enough. Staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome. We had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning and it was good value 12 Euros. There were hot drinks, juice, water, cereals, full English, pastries, and more - Very nice.

My partner surprised me with the trip to Amsterdam for my birthday and I was really looking forward to it on the day as I had not known up until the night before. When we arrived to the hotel I was happy with the lobby area as it was quite modern and nice. The man on the desk gave us poor directions to our room. He wasn't very clear on exactly which way we must go when we get to the stairs. Once we found our room, we was a little shocked at actually how small it was. We knew it would be a snug double but it was very snug. There was barely any room for our luggage and we struggled to get down the sides of the bed. Also the room was quite dated. Not all of it but the carpet was horrid. It looked like they updated the rest of the hotel and then got the carpet out of the loft. Once I opened the door to the bathroom a wall of Sewage stench hit our noses and we rushed to open the window in the bedroom where I found bird poo on the inside of the window and someone's used plaster on the floor next to my side of the bed. Also in the bathroom the towel rack was above the toilet so over the course of our stay the towels kept falling off the rack and into the toilet. It was also very dark in the bathroom probably because of the black shower curtain. There was no hair dryer in the room which was an annoyance as it states on the booking details that there is one in every room. It took 3 days to get one in our room. Every night I asked the man on the desk which rushed round the hotel looking for one. And every night he said he'd get the day staff to get us one. On the 3rd day my partner went up in the morning to ask again which is when they finally said they'll bring one down shortly. The man who brought it down wanted to come in the bathroom and fix it to the wall whilst I was showering. The maids were rude. They came into the room one morning whilst we were still in bed. Later they returned at 11:30 and we were still getting ready. My partner had just got out the shower so I said to the maid we'd be out in 15 minutes. She said that's too late. So she just gave me towels. We walked out the room 15 minutes later and she had just entered a room down the hall to clean. So how is that too late? We hadn't had our room cleaned for 2 days. Still had bird poo on the window and dust on the window sill. The pillows were like bags of potatoes. Really lumpy and there was only 2 per bed. I personally sleep with 2 for myself at home and most hotels provide 2 per side of the bed. Found it very strange that this hotel was different in that regard. Our room was one right at the bottom of the stairs. Our view was a brick wall. Wasn't too bothered about the view, it was more annoying the fact that the smoking area seemed to be right outside the window and seeing as there was no Air Con I'd have to have the window open at night. So at 2am we had people, right outside our room walking on the gravel. How is one supposed to sleep during that racket? One night the man at the desk told us our room was one of the new ones. Me and my partner looked at each other both wanting to burst out laughing. So for your own sakes after reading my review I hope some of you book a room elsewhere. This stay has really made me appreciate my own home.",2,Would not recommend ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d232459-r507170794-Hotel_Piet_Hein-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Ckpearce91

There was always delicious cold lemon and mint water in the lobby which we enjoyed on every trip into the hotel after days out touring the town. The location is awesome. Across from the Vondelpark makes it easy to find with a beautiful park to enjoy. A five minute or less walk from the major art museums makes the location ideal. Close to the sights, but far enough away to be out of the extreme touristy zones. The hotel is also close to several tram and bus lines, including a bus for 5€ direct to the airport. There are several places to eat and drink very walkable as well.

This was our last hotel stay after three weeks of traveling through Germany, Czech Republic and the Netherlands, and it was not what was advertised on their website. Our positives are that the hotel offered free water in the lobby and that they successfully scheduled a taxi for our early morning trip to the airport.The air conditioner was broken during the entire duration of our stay even though multiple staff members told us it would be fixed when we inquired about it on different days. We were told that the hotel had been struck by lightning, and that someone was coming to fix the AC, but this never happened during our five day stay. After reading recent reviews on Tripadvisor, it is clear that this is just a standard lie that they tell hotel guests upon arrival. The ventilation in the room was horrible, especially on the two warm days we had during our stay, even with the window wide open. We slept with the window open each night and the security arm on the window was broken, which allowed the window to swing completely open. Due to this, we could hear late night conversations in the garden area while we were trying to sleep, and cigarette and marijuana smoke would blow into our room. When it rained, it allowed water to come onto the windowsill on the side of our bed. The size of the room we booked was misrepresented on the hotel website compared to the room we received during our stay. The bed fit the entire width of the room and the area in which to move around the room was extremely small. The ""mattress"" was a mattress topper - less than five inches thick - which constantly slid off what you would consider a futon base. There was no room to put our two large pieces of luggage so we constantly had to step over them or move them in order to simply move throughout the room. In the bathroom the toilet paper is dispensed like napkins at a fast food restaurant, which is unpleasant and unlike any other hotel we stayed at throughout our three weeks of travel. The wake up call we were to receive on the day of our departure did not happen. When the gentleman at the front desk was asked about why we did not receive our call, he told us that he did call and that we did not pick-up. Thankfully we were up before our requested call time, but the fact that this person did not think to even knock on our room door leads us to believe that he did not call or that the phone was broken, just like most other things in our room. Look elsewhere when planning your stay in Amsterdam.

Nowadays it would be suitable to add gluten-free and soy alternatives, but overall it was very good.The service is friendly and nice. But it all does not make up for the room, where you do not feel comfortable in. Like not wanting to take your shoes off and not feeling good using the dirty bathroom where you actually want to get clean. Where you as a paying guest need to buy hygiene wipes to clean the toilet before using. Also the glass doors of the bathrom (also dirty) do not close properly, so good-bye privacy.We could peek in a standard room which looked exactly like our junior suite. Since the dusty nespresso machine (still containing water) did not appeal so much, there is probably no difference besides the extra 4-5 m².All in all: do not trust the pictures, it is ""okay"" to stay there but I would never book it again.

Public transit is easily accessible and we could walk to dinner or drinks with more than enough selections. It was about a EUR 50 cab ride from Schipol.I'd also list the bar/lounge as a pro because it was a nice place to relax and work while we were waiting to check-in to our rooms. Final pro was the staff that was very friendly and accommodating. The cons: No climate control... When I was there this was okay because it was cool enough outside that you could open the window. They do leave a fan in the closet if you need additional cooling...Cleanliness: Not good. When I got into my room after check-in there was a giant wet spot on the floor next to the bed. I do not know what that was; but, it was unnerving.Breakfast: It wasnt bad; but, it wasnt good. I got it included with my room in a promo deal; however, I would not pay additional for this breakfast. There is a Starbucks (BTW the coolest Starbucks interior I've ever seen!) literally 100 yards when you walk to the right out of the hotel. You would get a better value going to that Starbucks than doing the hotel breakfast. Value: You are paying for the location.

NH Schiller is a beautiful art-deco hotel located in the centre of Rembrandt Square, a bustling area full of hotels, restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Rembrandt Square is only a ten minute walk from Dam Square and the Damrak, and 15 minutes from Central Station, so ideally situated for the sightseeing we were doing. It's also close to the beautiful Herengracht area and to Rembrandt House Museum. The hotel reception area was stunning and the bar/restaurant too, though we didn't actually use it. We were on the 3rd floor and front facing. The room was clean and large enough for our requirements. My only (minor) complaint would be that the room got very warm at night (it was hot weather) and as it is an old building there is no air conditioning. With the room being front facing of course, with the windows opened, it was very noisy at night, due to the nightlife. There is a fan in the room however, so we left the fan on all night and also during the evening when we were out for dinner, so that the room had a chance to cool in advance. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful, and printed out tickets for us for a tour for which we required a paper copy.

Situated right in the middle of the west shopping center, which means close access to budget shopping, decent restaurants, Albertine XL and a nice open area with fountain for some kid’s fun. There is a lake a few minutes’ walk away. The staff is very friendly, reception is open 24 hours and you feel very welcome. They run a nice small café in the ground floor. Since the reception is open 24 hours, you get access to stuff in this café 24/7. Rooms are named after cities of the world with a full wall view of that city in the room.The hotel is entirely in first floor with lift from reception at one end of the hotel. From there it is basically a loooong corridor with rooms on both sides. If your room is at the other end, you would have walked half way back to Amsterdam by the time you reach your room. Rooms are extremely small. Actually, our room was as wide as the cot (6 or 7 ft). When you enter, the room, you have toilet on one side with a ground glass partition. There is no way to lock the toilet door. There is a shower room also in there. After the toilet you have a nice washbasin behind the shower room. The bed is next, and as I said, it takes 50% of the room space. The bed is extra comfy. My room had a full width window after the bed. You will not feel boxed in at all. The city view printed on one wall make it seem like you have space. You can stove your luggage under the cot. Both sides of the cot, you have a little bit space to keep your camera, purse, hand bag etc. Above the washbasin, you have a big mirror. The lighting design is nice as well. The design is highly space saving. To be honest, this feels like you are in a luxury boat cabin rather than a hotel. This was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in my life. However, let me tell you it is comfortable and cozy. One suggestion to management, please provide additional coat hangers opposite the bathroom, so that we can hang more cloths, small bags etc.",5,Very small but cozy and comfortable hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d10264789-r503478863-Citiez_Hotel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Kiran B

I stayed in this 2 nights from the 7th to 9th July. Was a simple trip from right outside the airport to the hotel by bus...buses do not accept cash so buy a travel card!!! I had to pay on card but when I got to the hotel there was a tobacco shop that sold 3 day travel tickets for 17 euros. The hotel is in a lovley little town called Osdorplein it's a good 20 minute tram ride from Dam centre but I much preferred being away as the town was lovley. Your right in the middle of a shopping centre , lake and transport links to one side and shops everywhere you look the hotel has water fountains outside which everyone seems to go in what a friendly bunch of people too. There's loads of places to eat near the hotel and a supermarket called Hema which is extremely cheap and sells brilliant things. The hotel it's sell is modern and clean, we arrived early and they got the room ready for us and let us check in which was nice of them, we had a room for 3 people which was big, beds are super comfy. The maids are always about cleaning rooms and restocking supplies. Breakfast was included in our room which was continental style and really yummy. I plan to come back here every year it truly is one of the best breaks I've ever had. Everyday I was there I went to Amsterdam centre, it's a different way of life over there everybody walks or rides it's a lovley laid back place to be. My tip is to explore while in the centre I come across some of the most amazing restaurants, coffee shops and people too. I would highly recommend the ice bar and pub crawl we had an amazing second night there.

There are tram stops near the hotel, but I used the Connexxion airport shuttle (takes around 60 minutes and 28 euros for return trip). Hotel: It is essentially an old building (it would have been interesting to have an insight into its history- for e.g. the Hampshire Hotel-the Manor is a converted hospital). Accessibility: The hotel does have two elevators, but none for reaching the reception desk from the street (there are several steps and, as a small individual, I do tend to struggle with cases). My room was on the same level as the reception, but I had to negotiate another flight of steps. Room: Comfortable and exactly as in the photos. I am not necessarily a fan of dark decor, but it's better than the Manor's red theme! It overlooked a construction site, which also meant that I had to leave the blinds closed when I was in the room. The bed was twin (not double), but it was comfy. You do tend to hear noises- especially people talking on the corridor and noises from other bathrooms (I could hear someone using an electric razor).Amenities in the room: Tea and coffee facilities, an electric fan, heater under the window, and a safe (do note that the instructions in opening/closing it may be different from those in the US). There is free WiFi - but it is not particularly strong enough, for example, to make calls via WhatsApp. The room lacks a fridge, ironing facilities, and air conditioning. Bathroom: Very clean. I do not know if it was malfunctioning, but the exhaust was constantly on (even when the lights were switched off). The shower was also temperamental (fluctuating between hot and cold water), but this is something I would expect in an old building where the plumbing is likely to be old too.Breakfast: It is open until 10:30 on weekdays (and they do close it on time). The lady in charge was very friendly and welcoming. There is a good selection of food (cereals, salads, sausages/bacon, eggs, pastries) and hot drinks (and an excellent selection of teas). Check-in: This was fast and efficient, but when I tried to pay upfront for the room, the card terminal did not accept both my cards (my bank later confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my cards). Check-out: I finally paid for my rooms the day before (the card worked), but my request for the return shuttle went strangely unregistered. I realised this only after waiting 30 minutes for my shuttle (which never came) and the receptionist found a solution by calling a taxi and paying for the difference in fare. Although I am still poorer as I had paid for the return fare, I appreciate her quick thinking as it ensured I reached the airport on time.On the whole, I am giving the hotel a rating of 4, although there are some negative aspects. When I asked myself, ""Would I stay here again?"", I realised that I would- although, I may have to bring a lighter case so that I don't struggle with the steps!",4,"Will stay here again- but, will bring a lighter suitcase!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229170-r502628165-Hampshire_Hotel_Lancaster_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,oxongriffin

The first hiccup was seeing £150 leave my account 4 days before our check-in (even though I was still inside my cancellation terms and could cancel up to 24hrs before), I had no communication from the hotel about the charge and so rang them up to confirm what this was, placed on hold for 30 minutes. I had to ring up another 2 times. The hotel then confirmed with me that this was a authorisation charge and no money would leave my account, no problem, I put this experience down to me just missing something in the small print and the hotel being busy that day. Our check-in experience was really REALLY poor. Not told anything about the hotel, about the shuttle service, when check out was, how to use the phone, if we wanted breakfast, did not acknowledge our anniversary I emailed ahead about, nothing about the city and how to get there. Literally no information was given to us. She handed us our key and said here you go. I wonder if it was her first day on the job? No personality at all. The location of this hotel is not great, it's in the middle of nowhere and I had massively underestimated how expensive Uber is out here. It cost us about €30 to get into the city with Uber each way each time. It soon became very expensive. We did not use the shuttle as we expected it would take a long time, that and no information was given to us about it.I question the hygiene in this hotel too. The maid did a really poor job of our room, not changing towels, making the bed with the TV remote still inside it. She would give us new bottles of water and leave the empty bottles from the day before on the side. Rubbish that was left on the floor wasn't moved at all during our stay. The toilet floor wasn't moped once. When we did get up to the Sky Bar we had lovely views however noticed that this hotel is actually situated right next to a prison! Lovely. Oh and there is also no lock on the bedroom doors to secure your room that bit extra when you go to sleep at night. We ate in the lounge one lunchtime, my partner ordered a €14 Turkey club sandwich, the sandwich arrived with turkey out of the packet. Food was very average. And service SO bad. I give this hotel 2*'s as the overall look of the hotel is very contemporary, which I like. However location and service were big factors for me that let this place down.

The carpet in both our rooms were threadbare and badly stained. We had to climb into the bathtub to use the shower and when you have 80 year old parents with you this can be both very difficult and very dangerous There is no fresh milk in the rooms only whitener. There are no coffee mugs in the room only paper cups. You receive only one bottle of water for two people. The most disappointing part was we were charged 70€ per night per room as a safety deposit when there is no mini bar or snacks in the room to purchase in the first place We have stayed in other Novotel motels around the globe and we have never encountered these issues.

This time however, it truly amazed me. The rooms are very comfortable with soft carpets, enough electricity outlets, a large safe which will fit your laptop, and a giant (GIANT) flat screen TV! What surprised me however, was their call for reusing the towels and promising to plant a tree for every 5 towels reused. Also if you put a notice on your door that your room doesn't need to be cleaned, you receive a bar voucher of 5 euro. Win-win I would say. For dinner there are plenty of nice places in a 2 km range, so if the weather is good and you fancy a walk, go in the direction of ""Scheldestraat"". Breakfast blew my socks off. I felt like I was in a 5-star all inclusive! There's an omelet service, a incredible wide choice of meats and cheeses, yoghurts and cereals. The omelet was better than I've ever had, with exactly the right amount of cheese (and salt). The jam is served in eatable cups! Orange juice is freshly pressed and, very important to me, coffee cups are real mugs, so that you can get a decent cup in one go!

No more than a 3 – 5 minute walk.Room was very large but fairly basic. Bed was 2 big singles pushed together. Unfortunately had to get the bedding changed as the beds were made up with single linens and quilts. Wooden floor so think it could be cold in winter. Large lounge and a single lounge chair. Tea and coffee making facilities along with a fridge. Bathroom was adequate. No bath. Just a shower.Huge buffet breakfast. Would have to say this hotel does one of the best buffets I've ever had. You name it, they had it, including a whole gluten free section. Catered for many nationalities - lots of Asian items, so many different cold meats, more cheeses than I could count - and so much more. Divine pastries. Not just 2 or 3 different plates but a whole table full of varying types.Near the foyer is a bar and there are 2 sitting areas where you can sit and relax or eat and drink. There is a bar menu and a main menu. Ate there twice. First was a club sandwich and a glass of bubbles. Very nice. Second time ordered from the main menu - a glass of bubbles along with Bittergarnituur warm - bitterballen, kaasstengels, krokante gamba and viammetjes. Sounds very exotic. Reality - cheese sticks, crispy prawns, spicy dumplings, deep fried meatballs all with a Dutch twist. Very yummy but not cheap.During our stay, partner received a lovely birthday surprise – a birthday card, balloons and a small package of goodies. How nice.On arrival, amazingly the room was ready at 8.30 a.m. On departure presented with 2 bags of gifts on checkout - bottles of juice and water as well as 2 different snack bars. That's a first.

It was my first time in Amsterdam and my partners' 2nd so I had no idea what to expect but from the airport to the hotel was a pretty seamless experience.Got an express train from the airport to Amsterdam Centraal which took about 10-15 mins then a metro three stops to Weesperplein, which was another 5-10 mins then a short walk to the hotel - another 5 mins and we're there.Warmly greeted by the lady at the front desk and swiftly checked in, our room was only a standard King size room but it was pretty spacious with lots of closet space. Bathroom with a rainforest shower and a also a normal shower head with different pressures, lovely smelling citrus amenities.We were so tired the first night that we decided to just order room service and as it was not too pricey it was the best decision we made on the holiday as we hadn't the most delicious burger (order it medium-rare and you'll see what I mean) and really really good chips. Also try the sticky rice dessert with mango and coconut cream as it's delectable. Cocktails also very good and strong- I had the Pineapple. Worth mentioning also is that room service comes on the normal table but within the table there's a hot box to keep your food hot if you want to eat it later. Brilliant, so brilliant in fact that we ordered steak frites the next night too. The guy on room service is the best, didn't get his name unfortunately as he really deserves a mention but wonderful polite guy with the best attitude.Now as you know the hotel is a bit of a distance from the city centre which was exactly what we wanted as it was quiet and we liked the walk. In fact not once did we take public transport apart from back to the airport nor did we rent a bike. We walked to the Heineken brewery which took us about a 25 mins and then approx 35 mins to Van Gogh museum, Anne Frank house was also about half an hour all quite easy to walk and navigate as the roads are flat. I would say though to pack a pair of very comfy shoes to do so as there is a lot of stopping and starting due to cyclists so this prolongs your journey a tad.Breakfast is from half 6 to half 10 weekdays not sure about weekends as we were there during the week and we could pick from either the buffet or a la carte as per our booking, the buffet was the normal stuff which tbh I wasn't that impressed with as I'd usually be able to at least pick something up but nothing really took my fancy. So off the a la carte menu I ordered the smoked salmon, avocado on toast and then for the last few days just ordered poached eggs with smoked salmon and toast all very tasty. I would say definitely order the hot chocolate. My partner had the waffle each day as it was very light and fluffy.Worth mentioning is that there is a 24 hr gym and sauna- all brand new state of the art equipment in the gym and mostly empty.Just to touch on the free wifi, this was mainly unstable if you want to load anything other than a webpage during most hours. Late at night became faster as people went to bed but don't be relying on this for anything strenuous.So to sum this all up, we had a delight of a time at this hotel where we were treated to the best of service throughout our stay and the most tasty food. We loved it and will definitely continue staying with Hyatt going forward.P.s there is a very handy supermarket opposite the hotel- what more could you ask?",5,Hyatt at it's best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d12264790-r506886502-Hyatt_Regency_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Charmaineluvsu

The bathtub is very dangerous and slippery with no mats provided (even when we requested them, they did not arrive) causing us to not use the facility at all while we were there. The complimentary breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever seen in a lovely, light and airy room overlooking the canal. The food was simply delicious and a great way to start the day. The hotel is far from the center of town but accessible with a tram or taxi. Robert, the Concierge, was the nicest, friendliest and most helpful person to us and perfect for his job. He is a great asset to the Apollo since from 3:00pm to 11:00pm, he is the first person to greet you as you step into the lobby. His towering figure and huge smile make you feel right at home. We are now proud to call you our friend.

The interior of the newly renovated rooms is nice and the rooms are comfortable, especially the beds allow for a good night sleep. However, I would not have necessarily thought of design hotel when seeing the interior. Please don’t be shocked when approaching the hotel.

The coffee was also very good.All the staff we encountered were courteous and friendly.The hotel is relatively small and has a good vibe.Though we aren't spring chickens, we took advantage of the nearby venues such as Pllek, Noorderlicht and 't Loetje and enjoyed them all. We felt that we had a ""true Amsterdam"" experience in that we were away from the main tourist areas. The NDSM Wharf is being regenerated and the hotel is right next to the old slipway. The nearby NDSM boat works is now home to many local businesses. There's even a hotel in one of the old dockyard cranes.Getting to the hotel isn't a problem. The free ferries run every half hour (every 15 minutes at peak times) and the journey takes ten minutes. This gives you an opportunity to watch the yachts and boats sailing up and down the Ij and see the landmarks as you pass by.

It was recommended by secretplaces.com, where I always check before going on a trip, because their recommendations have never disappointed - so far. I scored a 4-people room (2 queen beds) for 369€ for 1 night in July. The design of the hotel is ... nice, modern, ... but nothing special. The carpet on the stairs is disgusting and old. And the handrailing is sticky in sóme parts and could use a good clean.The room was also not completely clean. I mean it was cleaned, but quickly and without care. Could see dust everywhere, on shelves, lightplugs, lamps, the ventilator was full of it, and in the bathroom you could see that the cleaning cloth did not make it into the corners and not to the rim where surface meets wall. The day blankets had spots and there were crumbs underneath the sittee. Well, I thought, maybe the breakfast is amazing. But wasn't. Just average Dutch hotel breakfast, not even scrambled eggs. Additionnally, the breakfast room was really busy, and a lot of food was always empty, or we needed to wait for plates, or for cups, or for milk, etc. There were 2 girls that tried to do their best, cleaning up and refilling. This would have all been quite okay if the room would not have cost more than 220 for 4 people. But for over 300 I have a certain expectation for the value for money.

My first visit to this hotel, yet their staff could not have tried harder to be as helpful as possible with the smallest things and the hotel was quiet and clean and cheerful.On arrival I was met by smiling, happy staff who welcomed me as if I was a regular. I had a good sized room on the 6th floor with a canal view, a window that opened enough to let in some air but wasn’t really necessary as the air conditioning worked very well. The maid had done a spotless clean with plenty of towels and I want to give a special mention for the young lady who came to put the water bottles in the room and asked if I needed anything else. Her smiling happy face lit up the room.I slept soundly on a comfortable bed and also because the room doors did not crash each time a guest came in or out of their room which is the normal disturbing factor in most hotels. The elevators were speedy and operated by a room key - hence secure.Breakfast was good. Items included 2 kinds of eggs, cheeses & hams, breads, jams, cereals and croissants etc. and a variety of fresh fruit and the coffee was better than expected. A trifle expensive but if you like a hearty breakfast, not so.Location was very handy for both trams at one end of the street and buses at the other which took one into the town and to the Central Station. A 6-10 minute walk to either would get you to transport of your choice and round the corner of the street were many cafes and stores and a flea market if you like to browse.

I asked what happenned and was told that she thought I want housekeeping to clean my room.Next, I was given wrong information. It was Saturday 8.30am when I asked if the Noordermarket is open. The front desk staff said it is closed. Luckily, I checked on Tripadvisor website and it say open 9am-4pm. I decided to have a look for myself and Noordermarket is indeed open at 9am. I returned to hotel to ask the staff why he told me it is closed. He say it say so in the website that he looked at. I think he should check properly.

I was originally concerned that this hotel wasn't quite in the city center but it is in the canal belt. Having said that, I think the location of the hotel was ideal! The city center turned out to be way too crowded and busy. I enjoyed the side canal streets of this city more. The hotel is within a 5 minute walk to the metro and was very easy to get from and to the airport. It was a nice and easy walk to the canal belt which I enjoyed. There is also a nice delicious bakery cafe nearby next to the metro station called Bakhuys. Hotel staff themselves were nice and most helpful. They were all very knowledgeable if you're looking for plan ideas. The only two thing that made my hotel stay not as ideal was 1. housekeeping who made my room didn't make my bed the first night I was there. she cleaned the trash and the towels but the bed was left unattended it which was a bit strange. 2. the 2nd and 3rd nights of my stay, ALL the lights came on in the room (#402) while I was sleeping for a total of 3x in the middle of the night. It was a bit creepy but I was too tired the first night that it happened where I just fell back asleep (maybe it was a glitch). When I brought it up to the front desk at checkout, they were quite confused (as was I) and apologetic.

It can get a little much so we really liked this location a lot. easy walk to quality restaurant. But we loved our in house restaurant so much that we opted to eat there twice for dinner. An indonesian fusion restaurant with authentic indonesian cooks. My son loved the fried rice dish so much he asked the chef to give away her secret tips and showed how how to cook it. That was at the end of her long shift, we were impressed that she had the patience to teach him. Breakfast buffet was varied and typical European spread with fresh breads, cheese, meats, fruit, cereals and many other yummy treats. We could have stayed all morning just for that.

I was in bed when we rang down because we were exhausted, but we were told it was the Broccoli again so we got dressed and went down to eat. They served us some other soup which I did not even eat because it was not good, and the waiter told me it had pork in it. I had told him I was a vegetarian so I was upset to say the least. He then went away to check and came back with a different answer in that it did not have pork in it. Regardless, I could not eat it but they still charged us for it.

Originally she had booked with a friend however plans changed and I decided to go in their place. We had done a bit of research so we knew which bus we wanted to be on to get to the hotel (number 69) once we arrived at the airport. Once we got on the bus the incredibly helpful driver looked at her phone and worked out what stop we needed to get off at for us to get the tram to our hotel. She shouted to us when we reached the stop - this was our first experience of Amsterdam friendliness and it didn't stop there. After a short tram journey we got off and we felt at a bit of a loss as our hotel was nowhere to be seen. We stopped a passer by and he was able to direct us. The walk from the tram stop is around 5-8 minutes and takes you through houses however once you know where you're going it's easy.The check in was efficient and you must pay a city tax on arrival which was around 20 euros. The hotel itself is stunning inside with lots of quirky artwork and the rooms are quite stylish done out in dark wood. Mini toiletries are provided in the bathroom and there is a kettle with tea/coffee and a free safe which you choose a digital code to use. There is a TV however we never used it. Our break was during the heatwave so we were really glad of the air con in the room. Ice is available from a dispenser in the hall outside the lift.We went into the city centre every day, again using the tram. We bought passes from the hotel reception and the cost was only around £25 each for the four days. The trams are really efficient and reliable however these passes can be used for buses and trains in the city.At night we sat outside as the weather was so warm, there is a terrace beside a waterway at the back of the hotel. The drinks in the bar weren't cheap however drinks are strong as they don't seem to measure anything and the bar staff are all lovely. We never ate in the hotel however the menu looked good.This was a lovely hotel to stay in, very clean with friendly, helpful staff however it is a bit far out of the centre. There were a lot of business people but plenty tourists too. I think if I were to go back to Amsterdam, which I would love to do as it's an amazing city with lots to do and helpful, kind, friendly people, I would want to stay somewhere less off the beaten track.

First impression in the lobby very good but that's where it ends. The rooms are maybe 3 star at best bathroom a 2 star max. Serious my grandmas bathroom is more luxurious and that hasn't been updated in my lifetime. Appliances in the room are terrible. The hairdryer looks like something George Lucas casted when making The Empire Strikes Back. No iron/board, coffee machine and the kettles barely big enough to make one coffee at a time. It's 2017!!! Get some sort of device that make a decent coffee and not that freeze dried cheap stuff. For the prices you charge this isn't asking for much. Also where do you get of charging an €3 for the desk phoning a taxi!! Absolute scandalous if I knew this at the time I would have phoned it myself would have cost less even with the overseas charges on my own phone. But I wasn't told this and was unable to dispute it because you already taken it out of my holding deposit which you take on arrival in case of any damage done durning the stay.

We arrived early due to our flight coming in at 10am, but they were helpful and let us fill out all our details to make check in easier when we returned at 3pm, and also let us store our bags in a locker room which was controlled securely. We stayed in a triple room, which was quite small and basic, but suited our needs as we were out all day in the centre of Amsterdam. It's very easy to get the train from Sloterdijk station into the Central station, it takes 5 minutes and a return ticket for the day costs €5.60. We also used it as our transportation back to the airport (a taxi costs about €45) and the train only cost €4.50 each. Therefore this hotel is in a perfect location with many transport options around you. We chose not to get the breakfast from the hotel, but instead go to the Spar store which is right next to the station, and does fresh pastries, fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice and fruit smoothies, and was all a lot cheaper than paying for breakfast at the hotel! We also found the staff very helpful in regards to buying attraction tickets, you can buy many different tickets for popular attractions at the desk, which was better for us as we got ourselves organised on our first night.

It's a good 4K walk into the centre but expect to be out for the day on this basis and wear good walking footwear - no returning to the hotel to dress up for dinner. Amsterdam is a very casual city. The walk into the centre however is enchanting and you will cross many canals and bridges. And we clocked up 12k average each day. Of course you can take the tram or bike but you get a different view of life on foot. There is a multitude of cafes and bars en route for coffees beers or breakfasts. The roof terrace looked lovely but it rained heavily whilst we were there and we weren't able to take advantage. We didn't take breakfast -e18 per day single but e15 if booked in advance . We thought this a little steep and chose to eat out. To be fair once you added in coffees and juices etc unless you're just a croissant in the morning type person. A breakfast in a cafe will come in near enough 15e. So for convenience you may consider getting brekky at the hotel an advantageFree shuttle from the airport is great - just outside and to the left of the main airport entrance. Keep an eye on the minibuses coming in as it can be quite a scramble. Would recommend booking the return shuttle which is not free as we were a party of 6 and they couldn't accommodate us on the day of departure and an uber cost over 50 quid to the airport. Love Amsterdam such a cool and picturesque city. This hotel very comfortable but not necessarily that convenient but expect to pay double for a more central location.,3,Great hotel if you don't mind walking - a lot ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2151608-r509102936-Ramada_Apollo_Amsterdam_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,sonnetts67

The room key was highly problematic throughout, the room phone is tricky to use, housekeeping is very very poor. There is a mention about green choice and not changing your sheets or towels, but there's no way to opt out. So if you prefer clean bedsheets, you won't get them. There was no change of linen for 3 nights. Bathroom amenities are not replenished so if you're staying 10 days you need to make do with the amenities you received the first day. Repeated calls to front desk for toiletries went unanswered. Laundry was undelivered after 2 days. Room incorrectly mentions complimentary tea service on the top floor when what they mean is there's tea bags in your room that you can use. Housekeeping does not vacuum or clean the bathroom - to test, placed the shower gel cap in the middle of the bathroom floor, found it right there upon return:( Overall, this place feels like a motel. Definitely not at par with other Ramadas.There's a beautiful rooftop restaurant though with great views of Amsterdam and breakfast buffet has a wide spread with waffles, breads, cereals, salads, yoghurts, hot foods and fruits.The location is also a plus point because it's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but very conveniently next to the tram so downtown is just 10 minutes away.

It was only a 15 minute drive from Schipol and only a 15 minute tram ride into the centre so the location was ideal.We were aware that check in time was 3pm so we weren't expecting a room straight away, however, when we arrived the receptionist offered us a change of room to one that was already ready but it was a twin instead of a double. We thought this was the best option so we took her advice. The room was very spacious and modern and the beds were very big and so comfortable (they were also pushed together) and it was a lovely room to come back to after a long day of walking around the centre of Amsterdam.The staff were very friendly and keen to meet the needs of their customers. They also offer bikes to their customers to rent which was a fantastic idea and cheap for what it was therefore I would definitely recommend to anyone staying to spend the day in Rembrandt Park (just outside of the hotel) on these easy-to-ride bikes.They also offer a 5.00 euro drink voucher to spend in the skybar in exchange for having your room tidied, we were interested in having a drink on Floor 17 so we were definitely for this offer. The bar was very relaxing and they had lots of drinks to offer, however, be prepared to spend quite a lot of money up there. (Just like the rest of Amsterdam)Overall, the stay was wonderful and my boyfriend and I will definitely be coming back for a longer stay hopefully within the next year. The trip we had wouldn't have been the same if we weren't staying at this amazing hotel.Thank you to all the staff.",5,The perfect hotel to come back to after a busy day in Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2151608-r507430202-Ramada_Apollo_Amsterdam_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,TillyBancroft_

Thousands of fans in the city had pushed the price of hotels up but I’d booked this trip back in January so had managed to get a decent rate.The hotel provide a shuttle service from the airport. You just come out of the arrival hall and find shuttle bus stop A9. The service runs every 40 mins and takes about 15 mins to the hotel.Check in was quick and staff efficient and friendly. Had brought the wrong plug adaptor with me but the souvenir shop sells them so was able to buy one easily.Breakfast is in the restaurant on the 17th floor. Fantastic views and superb choice of food. We were offered a discounted rate of 15 euro per person at check-in but didn’t think we be eating there so didn’t take it up. As it was, we ended up eating breakfast there on two mornings and enjoyed it. Full price was 18.50 euro p/p.Had a couple of taxis on the first night to get into the centre and back – they were around 20 euros each time. It makes much more sense to buy a travel card (again from the souvenir shop) and use the trams which run every 10 mins past the end of the road the hotel is on. For 12.50 euro each we got 2 days free travel on trams, buses and metro around Amsterdam. The woman in the shop explained exactly how to use the tickets, gave us maps and we had hassle free travel for the whole weekend.Had a late night drink in the bar on one of the nights. Good service and nice atmosphere.Hotel arranged a shuttle bus back to the airport – I would advise booking this when you arrive as it only has 7 seats on the bus and gets full.Nice hotel – would definitely stay here again.",5,Good stay and shuttle service too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2151608-r508072612-Ramada_Apollo_Amsterdam_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,paulforde

Called hotel and they advised traffic issues ( this was correct and assured the next one would be Within 40 mins) again a no show. The other hotel shuttles even recognised us from how long we had been sat there! Eventually came. Checked into hotel no problems. Tram 13 straight into central. Even walked too and from central. Bar and terrace lovely - pricey however. Be careful of the showers, low trays mean towels used to stop floods. The lockers in the luggage storage don't work so ensure luggage padlocked. Biggest let down was the shuttle back. Advised no space back when enquirer so an uber booked. While waiting for the booked über - shuttle driver asked if we were going to airport- strange question for a full minibus being already booked with uber waiter we ended up 50euros down due to highway shut.

Both for the same type of room, at the same time, arriving and leaving on the same days. We had completely different experiences. CHECKING IN: all 4 of us arrived together as a group. My friends did a pre-check in at the desk, took about 10minutes. My husband were unable to do a pre check in, because they could not find our booking. When they did eventually find it, they did not pre check us in, and we had to come back and wait again later. Complete waste of time. Also, the other couples bags were taken by staff for holding, where as my husband and I had to walk down to the basement and do it ourselves. Why the other couple had service and we didn't I don't know.ROOMS: On arrival the other couple had water, robes, chocolate and slippers. We had none of these. Our towels were also not replaced on the second day, and when I phoned down for replacements they didn't answer their phone, twice, but did tell me it was a 24/7 service. They also had a better view and a bath. We had a crack which was glued back into our room door, and a separate shower/ toilet area within the room. We also had a cupboard area tucked into a corner with no light above it. Our desk light didn't work and bathroom doors needed you to push your body weight against them as they stuck so much. The room was clean but poorly designed and I was furious that my friend and I paid the same price when their room was so much nicer.BAR: A joke. A complete joke from the start. The staff were rude, overwhelmed and had no idea what they were doing. We came up to the roof for some food and drinks, we were not approached for a very long time. We ended up going to the bar to get service, despite people around us being served at the table. We asked if they had a menu in English (there was one on the wall, but not on the table), we were told 'no'. When we asked for some help translating (it wasn't offered) the gentleman proceeded to tell us that the portobello mushroom was a fish. We then asked for a wine list (we run our own restaurant at home- so I admit, we like to know our wine options to match our food), we were told there wasn't one- so we ordered beer, as we didn't know the options. Then we saw people being served several wines around us. Also, there is a huge bar/ fine dining restaurant on the floor below, with a two page list of options. Why a staff member could not access this, or at least tell us about it I don't know- but they lost out on a huge amount of custom from us by doing this. The food itself was good, but then again, we didn't know what else was really on the menu. On another night we went to the lower bar, I had a mojito which was cheaply put together and very basic and they brought us the wrong drinks- 3 times. They had no idea what we ordered and only admitted on this on the last occasion. It was embarrassing when we had to point out we ordered a sherry, not a wine. Normally, I would not hasten to point these issues out- but if you are going to sell yourself on being a high end bar- live up to it. It's basic with some pretty lights at best.And if you want to get to the 17th floor- good luck. The 17 button was broken in our lift, so we got out at 16 and walked up.CHECKING OUT: Again I have no idea why my experience seemed to take a complex amount of time. I stood in line at one desk, then was asked to move around- whilst carrying all my luggage. I complained about a few of the more prevalent above issues and was given a limited drink voucher. Poor effort as far as I'm concerned. The other couple we came with don't drink wine, had a room full of extras and quick/ helpful service- but we didn't. I am so angry we made the same booking for the same price, arrived and left the same day but left feeling completely deflated.",2,Inconsistent from start to finish,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d2151608-r505520144-Ramada_Apollo_Amsterdam_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Crishowells

The hotel is in an old Amsterdam style canal house, tall and narrow. We were on the top floor and we were warned about the steep stairs, so we didn't mind it, but if you do have health problems, I wouldn't recommend a room above the ground floor.

The hotel had great reviews and great photos on Booking.com.We arrived late at approx 2 am and given our rooms. Unfortunately our twin 17 year boys where given a double bed to share when we had requested two singles. However we were so tied and hoped this would be rectified in the morning. It also did not assist the check in process failed as there was a computer issue and the night staff came to our room at 2.30 am to say the system is now working and could I pay for the room. I would have thought this could have occurred in the morning!.In the morning a spoke to the duty manager and stated i was disappointed about our twin 17 year old boys sharing a small double bed when we requested 2 singles. I also stated the rooms were not big enough as the door to the room and bathroom could not even fully open and you had to step over your bags in the room to get in and out of bed. Basically it is the smallest room I've stayed in. And I've stayed in plenty of small rooms in Europe before. The photos supplied by the hotel of a small room is misleading. If a knew it was so small, I would not have booked this hotel. The staff member basically stated i could find elsewhere to stay if i was not happy with their hotel, however he will attempt to find a twin bed room for my boys. His attitude was poor, dismissive and not addressing the issue in a pleasant manner. He also gave me a lecture of how old the hotel was and that is why the rooms were so small. I did not realise 300 odd years ago every bedroom in these old houses had an ensuite bathroom!!!! I get that the Dutch can come across as arrogant, but i expected a little more empathy at $300 AUD plus per night room rate. Thankfully our twin boys did get two single beds and a room that you could move around slightly more than ours. There bags were also placed in the new room by staff as we were out sight seeing. Thank you for that assistance.Just to assist others considering staying at this hotel. There are very step stairs and numerous levels you might need to go up to your room. The rooms are very stuffy even with a window open. But now the good bits. The location is fantastic and easy walking to some of the beautiful sights in this beautiful city. Main train station is only a 10 minute walk away. The design of the hotel is funky and very cool. The breakfast was usual European foods and tasty. The younger staff were friendly at least , however no good bye as we left the hotel after 4 nights.This is the only the second time I've given a hotel a poor review. I've stayed at a lot off hotels all over the world, so slightly qualified to give some input. I'm only doing it so the hotel can improve and maybe assist a traveller when choosing this hotel. I was very surprised I did not like this hotel considering other reviews had been great. I'm a great believer in making my bookings on reviews by other guests.",2,"Very small room, poor senior staff customer service",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d238569-r505014869-Max_Brown_Hotel_Canal_District-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Charlie O

On canal (I had canal side room), about 15 minutes from Central Station. So close to station if want to take train or bus to attractive Dutch towns like Gouda but away from seedier area close to main train station. Lots of restaurants on Spuistraat side of hotel. Also a fancy take-out food place. Pretty walk along Singel and cafes on Singel canal on Singel side. Can walk to a supermarket (Alfred Heijn) north to just south of Dam Square on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal or walk south to Koningsplein area. Amsterdam takes farther to walk than you might think because of the canals and while I could walk to some areas, personally, I found too far to walk to museums but can take a tram easily. But I think no where in Amsterdam can you walk to everything. In walking distance of the Leidseplein which is one of the ""party"" areas of Amsterdam but not so close the noise bothers you.I had been worried because heard so much about noise in Amsterdam but not a problem. I was on third floor (fourth in North American terms) on canal side. Aside from Friday and Saturday nights between 11 pm and 12 when some noise from canal boats going by, quiet both inside and outside the hotel. Firm bed.I had a superior room and fine for one person but would be small for 2 persons. Desk, TV, refrigerator but only one desk chair and one sitting footstool. Had twin beds so obviously for two people. I used the second bed for my suitcases. Modern clean bathroom; modern light décor. Very nice toiletries including hand cream. Lots of light through window and nice to look down on canal from window.What is interesting is when I contacted NH hotels Central Reservations directly, they insisted could not guarantee a canal view. But when I inquired through Tripadvisor, a City Centre hotel representative said could have a canal view if booked a superior room with a view. So I booked superior room with a view and contacted hotel directly to confirm. The hotel did have signs saying ""pay extra to get canal view"" in lobby so you could wait to got to hotel if you wanted but I wanted to make sure I had a canal view. I don't understand why Central Reservations and the hotel have different policies but if you want to be sure to get a canal view ask for superior room with view, put in comments you want canal view and contact hotel to confirm canal view. I also contacted hotel to make sure could put own food in refrigerator and they confirmed I could.Hotel about 15 minutes from self-service Laundromat (Happy Inn 30 Warmoesstraat). Walk north on Spuistraat until it turns into Prins Henrikkade (opposite Central Station), then turn right (east) and walk one street past the Damrak to Warmoesstraat and turn right (south) on Warmoesstraat. Walk about 1 block south.Can walk in about 15 to 20 minutes to Central Station by walking north along Spuistraat. Walking from Central station to hotel slightly more complicated because Spuistraat does not go under that name all the way to Central station so with back to Central station have to go down a small street called Martelaarsgracht which becomes Hekelsveld and then Spuistraat.Great breakfast, better cappuccino than I had in Paris. Six kinds of cheese, croissants, meat for those who want it in morning, hot foods (at end of buffet breakfast room). Very good Dutch style breakfast.Their maps are very helpful. Had a problem which they corrected which is what one expects of a very good hotel.",5,Great Hotel in Great Location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d194317-r503295359-NH_City_Centre_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Woman_in_Toronto

And i booked with my travel agent. Planning for staying 3nights. When i got there, they said i couldnt get the river view room cos it's fully booked. And theres no view for the street view either. So really disappointed!!Okay let's start from the entrance. There's a stair at the entrance. Quite high..You have to pass the stairs if you want to go to the hotel. You have to think twice if you're alone and bring so many luggage. You'll get the trouble. And theres no staff to help you bring the luggage either.At first got room number 030And i really would not recommend you to stay at this room.The same floor with the receptionist. Theres a stair in the middle of hallway!!are u kidding me?!! no way! If you bring big luggage, you'll be in trouble. Especially if you're old. No view at all. The room exactly the end of the corner. Kind of spooky. Theres a noise like a wind blows or the blower of air conditioner i dont know sure. But kind of annoying. Something trouble with the parquette in the front of the bathroom. Becareful for the door stopper. Often bumped to it. Not really safe.It's not worth it for the price, if u stay in this room. Really disappointed!The next day, we move to room number 243 . More better but still No VIEW. Only view for another room. So frustrated here.If you want to iron your clothes, you need to go on 3rd floor. Sleepers dont get in standard room. Or you could buy for 5euros 20euros Breakfast charges if it's not includes with your room.Overall..you guys have to MAKE SURE if you want to stay here, if you want the river view or street view. Cos i got no view AT ALL. Only back corner like barn not good at all. And this hotel more expensive than another NH cos it's quite strategic.

They have just about anything you could want there - spin bikes, punching bag, yoga classes...etc. They also have a sauna which was nice and appeared to be clean. Other items - You can rent bikes on site. If you want to go into the city after check in, I recommend asking for another shuttle voucher.

Needless to say, we declined her ""offer"". The room itself was excellent, quite modern furnishings, spotlessly clean, with all necessary amenities. There was no outside view, but we did have a window overlooking the main atrium.

We only had one main meal, in the hotel bar, and this was also of excellent quality.

Particularly when I came to check-out and I found that computer had charged me for four breakfasts instead of two (something to do with single occupancy of a double room I gather - or at least that was what I was told by a friendly human, who had to sort out the muddle the computer had caused!).The other thing was the Wi-Fi. This was not working when I arrived at the hotel, which was pretty irritating as I had work to do. I called down to Reception - no answer after calling twice and allowing to ring for in excess of 5 minutes each time. I went down to Reception to find one poor member of staff trying to deal with check-in/check-out/computer issues/complaints about no Wi-Fi etc. Feeling it was a bit unfair to burden her with more issues, I asked to speak to the manager and was told that there was no manager available. Furthermore, the hotel had no idea when the Wi-Fi would be working again, and apparently the service was nothing to do with the hotel anyway, as it was provided by a third-party - and was a service that the hotel could choose whether to provide or not (which I disputed, as the hotel advertises free Wi-Fi, and I wouldn't have stayed there if it didn't have it!).The above rather marred my visit, which was a shame, as otherwise the hotel and staff appeared perfectly pleasant and I might have considered staying there again.NB.

I then proceeded to call them for the next few days and when I told them yes we did indeed forget it there and maybe housekeeping must have taken it because there is no where else it could be we looked through all our luggage and everything. They insisted that the housekeeping supervisor inspects the rooms prior to anyone cleaning it - If that is true or not - a member of their staff have taken the item as it was a very high priced item and did look expensive. It's unbelievable that someone in housekeeping did such a thing and I called them for 3-4 days in a row with no help.

Born and raised in Amsterdam I try to stay in or near my old neighbourhood in Amsterdam East (Oost). I recall when I lived there The Manor was an old hospital and always admired the building when cycling into town. When my usual hotels were fully booked I decided to give The Manor a go and I wasn't disappointed. The staff upon arrival were lovely and the checkin extremely quick. The hotel has a fantastic Amsterdam theme and the three crosses are everywhere, bit too much for some but I loved it. The room was great, very spacious, huge bed, lovely bathroom. Everything I needed and even a tv attached to the bed that could swivel round, fab. My room was at the back of the hotel and there was no noise what so ever had a great night sleep all weekend. The hotel's location is great, the area has improved so much since I lived there and there's so much to do. Fantastic restaurants and pubs, a little shopping centre and you're a five minutes walk from the Tropenmuseum and a few tram stops from the zoo. Speaking of trams, the tram 9 practically stops outside the hotel and that will take you into the city centre within 10minutes. But if you're a real Amsterdammer like me you like to cycle. This hotel cater for that, you can rent bikes at the hotel for I think €12.50 for 12 hours. Perfect!

This 4* hotel is well appointed, very clean and a good sized room with excellent bathroom. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Booked through a well known consolidator and was a little disappointed that it was not made clear during online reservation that breakfast was extra so had to find another £92 (for two people) on arrival.The hotel is right next to two tram lines, one of which goes to the centre and the other to the museum district, and there are plentiful shops and cafes within 200 metres. However with hindsight we would have paid extra to stay nearer the centre and would happily use another of the many hotels within the Hampshire Group in Amsterdam.The tram journey is 15-20 minutes each way and even with multi-journey tickets the cost adds up. In the summer heat it is not practical to walk back each time to the hotel and for those of us who are of 'mature' age the bicycle hire was not a welcoming alternative.In summary this is a great hotel but visitors need to balance the savings available by being away from the centre against the time and inconvenience of not being able to 'pop' back for a rest.We regularly visit European cities and rank Amsterdam as one of the safest and customer-friendly.

Checked in late in the afternoon and room was ready for check in. Check in was very quick and my husband is diamond so we stayed on the 4th floor. We overlooked the train tracks so the view wasn't great but the location is excellent. And I never heard any train noisesI never found a concierge but the front desk was some of the most helpful front desk that I have ever had. They all gave directions and great information on what train to get and when they left. They were great. Located next to central station which is a very easy walk. When we arrived I felt odd carrying luggage across train tracks but don't worry you will see lots of people doing it all week. Its close to trains and buses and the Amsterdam information which I didn't find until the last day and I wish I would have found it on the first day. They were also very helpfulBed was comfortable but the queen bed was really just 2 twins next to each other but comfortable. I always felt that the room was clean but we were without towels one day and toilet paper the next even when the guy knocked on the door to see if room was okay we said we needed towels he left and we never saw him again. We got free breakfast daily and drinks at night but it was very crowded but a nice perkI loved Amsterdam and I would totally suggest the hotel to anyone for any reason.

In fact, the service is excellent and they try hard to give a personal service despite the high number of people just 'milling' around the hotel. Reception staff were friendly and the warm 'welcome' cookies were a nice touch. The breakfast buffet restaurant is large but finding a table was a challenge on both days, although staff quickly cleared a table for us and were very attentive and helpful. The buffet was kept refreshed and offered a good choice (although it wasn't cheap at e25 for my 15 year old, under 12s are free). The room was fine, although the view was of the railway lines not the canals (which are on both sides of the hotel). It was a disabled room (not required) which meant some of the aesthetics were given over to practicalities with a shower seat, extra handles, safety cords etc (I'm assuming not every room had this). Towels were large and fluffy (I do hate tiny threadbare towels in hotels so extra points for that!) It was just a little 'tired' in places (the door chain was loose and hanging off) but the hotel is easily accessible for the main station, trams and other transport so was very convenient.

Coming back at 5:00 our bags were delivered promptly to our suite which was on the executive floor. Our travel agent suggested a suite for us since we were traveling with our grand daughter and were considering booking two rooms. Booking a suite turned out to be less expensive then two rooms and having the Island suite gave us a spectacular view of the city. The hotel provided a roll cot which proved to be uncomfortable for my grand daughter, but she simply moved to the couch which served her needs very well. Being in an executive room we had access to the executive lounge which provided free light snacks, wine, beer and soft drinks from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. This was a lovely treat. Our breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was delightful. The buffet was varied and well stocked. When my grand daughter voiced a desire for a crepe, the kitchen was pleased to provide her with it. The number of gluten free options for my wife was outstanding and at the end of the meal you could take a few items from the buffet for a later snack or light lunch in a provided brown paper bag.After a busy day in the centre of the city the tram left us off a short walk back to our room and this wonderful hotel.

They appear more like a budget Travelodge than a 4 star hotel. The room and bathroom were on the small side with basic furnishing although a computer was supplied sharing the monitor with the television. However the rooms were spotlessly clean and housekeeping very efficient with toiletries renewed daily. On the positive side the breakfasts were excellent with a really comprehensive choice of buffet. On our first morning service was great both offering juices and coffee to the table and immediately clearing dishes. However next morning (Saturday) hotel was extremely busy and service became a bit chaotic. Complementary newspapers are supplied as is champagne at breakfast.We had dinner on first evening in the Rosewood restaurant, which has very limited menu and on the expensive side.

We chose the DoubleTree because of the proximity to the piers where the Viking ships usually dock, as well as being in a central location. The location was ideal - it was so close we were able to walk with our luggage to the ship. If you're arriving by train, the hotel is ideally situated, as Centraal Station is a short walk as well. We arrived in the late morning and had requested an early check-in. We knew it was unlikely and we were right, as the hotel seemed very busy, as I believe it is most of the time. We were given a warm cookie and found a place to sit and wait. Fearful of falling asleep sitting up, we set out in the rain to explore to stay awake and find some lunch. We highly recommend an Argentine Steakhouse called LaGouch, which is close to the hotel - we had memorably wonderful burgers and fries there. The hotel had many eating areas and places, with a very large Starbucks among them. When we went on a walking tour on the first day of our cruise, the guide told us the Starbucks is owned by the DoubleTree. There is bottled water and green apples in the lobby for the taking. The hotel is close to restaurants and shops, as well as the Red Light District, and there are some nice shops in Centraal Station itself. I have to say the exterior of the hotel is one of the ugliest I've ever seen, but it's also one of the most bustling and clean hotels I've ever stayed. Given that the hotel is next to the many train tracks, you heard no noise inside the hotel - the trains actually make little noise. We had a King room and it was a small room that is modern - maybe Spartan - in appearance. A ledge running on either side of the wall serves as the night tables. In addition to a phone, there is an Apple Mac TV in the room. They use iconic symbols to mark what is in the drawers - with a coffee pot on the drawer of the desk and a blow dryer in a drawer in the wardrobe. There was only one picture in the room - above the bed. There was also a mini-fridge that came in handy. The bathroom was all gleaming white and chrome and extremely clean. The sink was square - again, very modern and attractive. There was no tub - just the shower with a shower head providing various settings. Overall, this is a wonderfully convenient hotel that seems to be well run and very clean. The staff at the front desk all seemed to speak excellent English and were very professional.

As before we very much liked the Sky Lounge with its great views over the city and a nice food menu. This time we also tried the Eastwood Grill for dinner and were not disappointed.

Room perfect in both appearance and practicality .There had been some mixed reviews over the executive lounge, we found this on the first night, we got back at 5.15 ish only to find no food or drinks until 6. (only tea and coffee) never booked a ex lounge with these constraints before.This then created a stampede at 6. Family's also saw this as an opportunity to feed the kids for the evening .The did bring out meals rather than smaller canopies/sandwiches/cheese etc.Also the drinks were very limited red/white wine and beer.Also on the ground floor. Everywhere previous have been high up with views. Not a relaxing pre evening drink by any means. However two things to add, did complain and had a hand written letter in room with drink vouchers to main lovely bar area and also the breakfast on both occasions was nothing like evening. Great food selection and quiet atmosphere, we went around 7.30 ish. Roof top bar was worth a visit , drinks not cheap but would you really expect two drinks for 10 euros in that location,that is what you are paying for.

Another room was available but only with an additional 50 euro cost, but had Executive Club Lounge access. The Exec. Club Lounge was a joke with no food or drinks, other than tea and coffee and biscuits and lollies available all day or night. Fridge was locked during the day. Only drinks and food available was between 6-8pm when the place was packed with families and children who came to gt the free food and took servings that would cover their evening meal. Food and drink was over the floor and it was not a pleasant place to be in. Do not waste your money thinking you will get the usual Executive Club lounge facilities for your additional cost in the upgrade. The room you get with the upgrade is the same size as we received at other hotels during our tour as standard rooms. DoubleTree need to review their up-selling of rooms and the ""Executive Club Lounge"" access which is not executive at all.

The buffet had a very good selection of food including some Asian options (vegetarian sushi, Chinese congee with Chinese fried doughnut).

Checked in on 7/26/17 around 3:45pm for 2 nights. We paid a lot of money for a ""King Executive Suite on High floor w/ river view"" and mind you I had to pay in advance. We ended up with a room on 5th floor (out of 11 floors)....Room 501 with view of train tracks and buildings. One of which is an abandon building with graffiti on it...(see pics)...if this is what they called a room with a view, I can only imagine what a room with no views looks like.We spoke to the same agent at the HHonors desk who checked us in, about the room that was assigned to us. Instead of being apologetic, she automatically stated it was our fault. She stated we picked our exact room online when we checked in via the app...WRONG. When I checked in with the HILTON app, unlike other Hilton properties, this hotel DOESN'T provide you with the option to pick your room. Maybe she needed to be better trained on her customer service skills and knowledge of how her hotel app works.A few hours later, the manager called and gave us an option to move to another room in the morning, however it would be in a room with a smaller bed. Once AGAIN why would you offer me a room that is NOT what I had paid for in advance. Therefore we told her we don't want it as it's a smaller bed. No other solutions were given. We've stay at other hotels in Europe where they actually look at customer's reservations and have everything set up before you check-in....DoubleTree DID NOT do such. The sofa bed for my child to sleep on was not setup when we arrived, nor were there any extra bed sheets, pillows or blankets provided.Room had marks on wall, coffee table was all scratched up and stain on couch. A/C was not cold.With executive suite you get access to the executive lounge. We decided to have a snack and a drink before our dinner plans. Hors d'oeuvres starts around 6pm and we arrived around 6:10 and it was PACKED. You could not open the door as the line for food was long. My 12 year old even asked why would they setup food near the doorway?? It made no sense. We decided to go elsewhere.The next morning, we had a do not disturb on our door and the housekeeper still came in.....Double Tree please explain what's the point of the sign on the door????We were every excited to come to Amsterdam and enjoy our stay at DoubleTree. But turned out to be a disappointment. DoubleTree management, Below are some suggestions...1- hire front desk employees with customer service skills and who knows how to find solutions to problems and not blame customers!!!2- staff who handle reservations should coordinate/assign rooms accordingly3- housekeeping should NEVER enter a room if there was a do not disturb sign.4- don't place drinks or food near doorway as when it gets busy, people tend to line up near doorEither confirm your room a head a time or STAY at the Marriott!

We were told on check-in that it would be resolved immediately. When we returned to the hotel four hours later at 10:30 PM, they had not.

In the bathroom, the toilet brush was tangled with toilet paper from a previous guest stay and the holder was full of soiled water.

Why do you have to do this? Then a bunch of lovely young people made excuses for the room not being ready - we are OK with that. But finally after almost half an hour, we wanted to see the city and asked them to just store our bags, which is how we found out that the room was ready; nobody told us. Meanwhile we were given a free drink voucher. The bartender who was manning the bar must be the only person in Amsterdam who doesn't speak English. I asked for seltzer. Quizzical look. OK, agua frissante then? Oh, Sen-sir he replied and I thought he got ""seltzer"" but when I saw him reaching for the white wine I knew I'd be getting Sancere. And it was very good....so we surrendered to Fate. And the concierge service is so very dependent on who is behind the desk. Some were excellent, but our last one not so much. We asked about the tram, as we needed to catch the train to the airport and we were going to take the one in the back behind the hotel. No, take the one on the side. So we lost some time as we realized that our first instinct was right: EVERY tram from the back goes to Central Station, not so for the one the concierge recommended. But we got a great tip for a local rice table that was super good from one worker, and tickets and good information on the Rijksmuseum from another concierge - just still wondering why you couldn't just check in at arrival, why they split the desk responsibility. Still, it was clean, comfy beds, usual groovster eurotrash house music pumping (funny; one young man in the elevator as we were checking in commented on the ""upbeat music"" and the rest of us laughed as another young man said, ""This must be your first time in a W!"")

In truth, I've had very mixed experiences there - ranging from great to terrible. Most of the past negatives were the result of inadequate experience or training of hotel associates. However, during my last few stays, I have expressed some of my service concerns to the staff at the W, and I am pleased to report that I have noticed great improvements in service levels. There are still kinks to be worked out, but I'm happy to say that service levels are improving with time - particularly around consistency of service level between different associates. Kudos to the team at the W and I will certainly be staying again!I've stayed thousands of nights in hotels, and there are some very unique pro's about this property:- Try the rooftop pool. Long enough for short laps and incredible views. An amazing experience.- Spa in the Bank building is actually quite nice, but underutilized. You'll be the only ones there.- Great Centrum location - If you're runner, you can run down and around Vondelpark just to the south of the hotel. A solid run. If you're into shopping or eating, you'll be right in the middle of the action.- SPG Platinum breakfast at the Duchess is elegant and excellent.Special thanks to some memorable hotel associates: Charlie, Orlando, Yannick, and Andre!

Excellent customer service. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded. Our new room was not ready however, and the staff member let us know that they could text us when it was available. I was a little wary about this since we were not contacted during our last stay, but still provided our number. She also let us know of the new additions to the W (gym, etc) since our last visit. When our room was ready, the staff did promptly contact us and we were on our way. Room: We had a wonderful room with a gorgeous view of the city. As with usual W standards, the room was very modern and beautiful. It had the delicious smelling Bliss amenities and interesting reading material as well. Location: The W is very centrally located and it was easy to get to many places such as Anne Frank House or our canal cruise. Concierge: we had exceptional service when asking for recommendations on places to eat and which cruise to take. Concierge even went above and beyond to text us and let us know about the status of one of our dinner reservations. Overall, my second stay at the W Amsterdam really made up for my first one.

The architecture is stunning and clearly a great deal of thought and planning had gone into the design. The room I had was a fabulous room (upgraded) and didn't disappoint. Fantastic bed and bathroom, high ceilings and typically funky in a W hotel way.The problems started from the beginning. My room wasn't ready until almost 5pm. The check-in process was inattentive, being made to sign the same forms twice, as a minor irritation. I had to request that some of my bags be brought up. The mini-bar wasn't stocked at all, they forgot. The breakfast was very ordinary. An egg-white omelette I ordered was bathed in oil and inedible. The cold buffet was not properly stocked. A room service pizza arrived burned and when it was replaced, a side order was missed. At the same time, the chefs did seem to be having a very good time in the kitchen from what I could see and hear. After going out for a walk for a few hours, it was surprising that, despite a request to make up my room, it is 5.30pm at the time of writing this and it is still not made. This is despite complaining about it over an hour earlier. The staff do not talk to each other and share information. The manager was attentive to the feedback I gave but generally my perception was that the staff were (excessively) laid back and frankly lazy.

We were advised that the room would be ready shortly and that they could take our bags and would be returned to us upon check-in to the room and that they would contact us directly by text to advise the room’s availability. It came to 3.30pm and we had still not been contacts so we went through to reception where they’d re-requested my payment card, even though I had already provided full payment.Asked for recommendations of lunch and was given a suggestion of the focaccia w/ dip and the spicy tomatoes. The tomatoes were lovely but the focaccia was burnt and disappointing.We then asked about the spa facilities in the hotel and were advised that they were indeed closed for the day due to unforeseen circumstances.Previously being a guest at Hotel De’Lerope in Amsterdam I decided to visit W as it was a more modern hotel and thought that it would have a younger and more up-to-date feel to it but this did not live up to the hype.After calling reception 3 times over the period of 2 hours we still did not have our luggage and was delayed in leaving the hotel to meet friends. On the third occasion of calling “whatever, whenever” they finally asked us what our bag numbers were because they could not find our luggage... We then had checked with “whatever, whenever” to see where the pillows we had ordered through the tv which boasted that it would be ‘delivered within 30 minutes’. I called reception at 10pm – 5 hours after initially requesting the pillow requirements –Only to be advised that the TV system sometimes doesn’t work and that they were unsure whether or not they had the “buckwheat pillows, neck roll and body pillow” and that all they had were soft and hard pillows. Confused I asked him why my order was confirmed online, he said that he would double-check and then call me. He didn’t. Instead, no explanation was given and a dental kit was left outside my room.W hotel really needs to focus on it’s attentiveness as currently its customer service is in the toilet and personally I do not feel that the hotel justifies charging €14 for a gin and tonic.If you’re looking for a classy hotel the choose Hotel De’lerope and steer clear of W.",2,Service is appaulling,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d8470249-r510560818-W_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Matthew S

We were also sponsors of this event. Well, our visit was a farce from start to finish, largely due to this incredibly inept hotel.First, we booked MONTHS in advance and were relegated to a tiny room on the outside of the sixth floor. As we were on the outside perimeter of the building, the walls were slanted, just under the roof. As such, it was very difficult for two people to move around in this small room - and we had to do this for five nights. Even worse, the bed was simply too small for two people. I measured it to under 140 cm. My wife and I were constantly pushing each other over the side during the night. We asked to be moved, but the hotel apparently had no other rooms. Curiously, a colleague booked a room (at a remarkably better rate) about a month before the conference and had a spacious room on the third floor with a big bed and TWO chairs. She arrived a day later than we did...I had to send some documents to the United States and needed a FedEx envelope. The reception said there was no business center, but I should talk to the concierge. The concierge referred me to the business center one flight down. The business center said the FedEx envelopes could be obtained from the concierge, one flight up. The concierge claimed no knowledge of this until another staff member intervened and explained that the envelopes were in the basement. The concierge I was speaking with asked “Do you need me to go and get one? I’m about to go on break…” Honestly! And all of these clowns are called “Navigators” despite the fact that they clearly do not know their way around.In the meantime, the conference swag we had delivered to the conference organizer was stolen, so we lost our promotional reason for being at the conference. The hotel was “kind enough” to reemburse the cost of the swag, but not the substantial sponsorship fee we had paid.The breakfast restaurant had perhaps the slowest service of ANY hotel I’ve been at in years – unless you opted for the pricey EUR 29 buffet.That said, the bar staff was lovely. Hats off to Leonidas, who was the only genuinely service-minded staff we came across.To top all of this off, when it came time to check out, the network was down so it was impossible to pay by credit card or get an invoice. We eventually straightened this out, but to be honest, I have never experienced such ineptitude from a so-called “five-star” hotel. In fact, I will do my best to avoid Marriott properties in the future. This experience was simply too stupid to be believed.Expensive room. Miserable room. Clueless staff.

The service was excellent, and the hotel had a special room for its elite travelers that served a full, delicious breakfast, as well as snacks later in the day. The room was somewhat problematic in one area -- we could not obtain a comfortably cool temperature during the first two days of our four day stay. (The temperature in Amsterdam was unseasonably warm and humid during our stay.) When I brought the problem to the attention of the hotel staff, their initial response was to give us a portable fan, which helped somewhat but did not give us the level of comfort that we were hoping for. Finally, on the third day, after insisting that the room was still too warm, we received a visit from a building engineer who fixed the problem, and we enjoyed the room (which had a very comfortable bed and an excellent shower) during the remainder of our stay.

The service is poor to average or really non existent for the price you pay, which is not cheap Euro 250 a night. There is no porter to take your bags into the hotel, seemed short staffed. While checking in walked upto the reception the check in time in This hotel is 3 pm and I arrived at 9.30 am, so fair enough when I asked the receptionist for a early check in he explained the hotel was full so couldn't help with the same. I even offered To pay for a early check in and he politely refused as the hotel was full , but promised to call me if he could give the room earlier which he didn't. I basically was exhausted after a long flight from Asia and had to spend my time in a cafe and walk around the city. The room is pretty small for the price with a view of the buildings at the back, but covered all the amenities and services so that was great. At time off checking out requested for a late check out from 12 pm to 2 pm which is a fair and quite normal request in all the hotels we stayed at, I was quite surprised they said yes we could but a charge of euro 10 a hour so highly disappointing. I also got a call at at 12 pm in the room sharp asking us to check it which we were anyways. At the time checking out, we specifically told the receptionist that we would like to split the bill into two as we two friends travelling together and requested not to charge the amount on only one of the cards that was used at the time of check in. Few days later when I check my statement I was surprised to see that my card was charged for the full amount.

Cost-effective2. Four-star hospitality3. Proximity to the train stationWhile the hotel comes right on top on factors 1 and 3, the four-star hospitality that we expected was missing. Traveling to Europe for the first time with a 2.5 year old kid, we ensured that it was just the backpacks that we carry along with us with a pull-strolley as the only aberration in the luggage department. When booking a 4-star property, we expected a certain tier of hospitality and what greeted us was a clandestine structure when it came to hospitality.This hotel has no bell-boys to help you with the luggage. I am not sure if others have come across this situation but once the taxi drops you off by the kerb in the front of the hotel, it's up to you to haul your luggage to your room. The folks at the reception just pointed to the luggage carts and said that we can use them to take our luggage to our room. That was strange as this kind of a situation shone it the first time ever in our travels across different countries, cities and hotels. We did not face such a situation anywhere else across Europe, later on, as well.The hotel has a beautiful restaurant with a view of the industrial corridor but has a very limited menu.The rooms is small as compared in proportion to the huge bathroom, going by European standards. The window blinds restrict light very well and the rooms are pretty sound-proof.It's hardly a 5-minute walk to the train station and Amsterdam Central station is just a stop away.I have mixed feelings about the hotel and I am sure that it does not fit the four-star tag that it comes with.",3,"Decent place, don't expect the frills",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d7855996-r502710837-Mercure_Amsterdam_Sloterdijk_Station-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Unbelted

The mattresses are tiny: I had two single mattresses put together to make a double bed. They caved in the middle meaning I could not sleep in a flat position. I made a complaint to reception and housekeeping told me that the mattresses had not been zipped up properly. I tried the newly zipped mattresses the next night and they still caved in the middle. I asked to change rooms and they told me they were full , despite there being clear room availability online. It was quite stressful because no-one seemed to want to help, and apparently is its a ""known issue that people accept"" !! So I just turned the mattresses 180 degrees so at least they wouldn't cave in the middle, but they were too short for the bed which brought its own issues. Given that a hotel should be geared up to ensuring its guests get good sleep I rate this as TERRIBLE. A couple of my colleagues had exactly the same issues as me and the hotel didn't resolve it for them either. No one checked in on me and when I mentioned it again on check out (my 3rd time by this point) the receptionist just said it was too late to doing anything. Unbelievable! Hence this review. I would hate anyone to have the same experience as me and I would never book a Mercure again.. The rooms are also quite small but I would like to share that the room service is great and there is a chocolate desert on there that is literally other worldly: divine.",1,Great location for airport and into City but TERRIBLE BEDS!

The one downside was I found the room on the small side with hardly enough room for my wife and I to pass each other between the bed and the desk, but we soon got into a routine. Speaking about the bed, which was very huge and comfortable, but boy was it high I recon about 3.5 feet (105cm) there was even a menu for your pillows, also there was no need to close the curtains just press a button and it was done. We were there for an anniversary break and the hotel gave us a curtesy bottle of bubbly which was very much appreciated. I had to check in online for our return flights but for some reason I couldn’t complete this but the concierge called ‘Albert’ managed to do this for us saving time at the airport, another great service from the very helpful staff at this hotel.The hotel is in the perfect location for exploring the city, there are bars, restaurants, shops, ‘red light’ area all within walking distance and believe me it’s the way to see the city, not forgetting the canal boat trips.

The bathrooms, while not large, are nice (indeed, a GREAT shower) and easily accessible. The bed was large and quite comfortable. Only thing that keeps this from being a ""10"" is that while ""helpful"", staff attitudes always felt like they were doing you a favor by engaging you. I asked for help on a transportation issue at one point and got the distinct feeling that I was asking for something completely outrageous (which I wasn't); and, I really didn't need to be reminded four times that smoking was not allowed in guest rooms (I don't smoke - never have). To be perfectly fair, the concierge did give me a really great recommendation for a restaurant for dinner - perhaps, on balance, that makes it even.Only other comment I'd make on this is that if you book this hotel, please keep in mind that it is - quite literally - right on Dam Square and that means that once you walk out the door, you're in the middle of a massive flow of people, particularly during peak summer tourist season.

Every staff member we spoke to during our stay lacked any sort of cheer and nobody seemingly wanted to be there. For example it took us three attempts of asking to have additional pillows for the room. The room itself was clean on arrival but by the end we weren't even getting new coffee and tea.The rooms themselves are very basic and seemed to be furnished with a 'that will do' attitude. For example the curtains don't reach the bottom of the window, so light will always get in. A quarter of our room was taken up by a desk, which had no chair. The shower had terrible drainage and almost no lip, meaning every shower the room would flood. There is no air conditioning unit in the room, instead we got a rickety old fan which seemed the type from a bargain bin at a hardware store. There is a thermostat thing, it didn't do anything. The hotel did offer extra services like breakfast and bike hire, but all at a ridiculous surcharge. Breakfast was €13.50 per person and bike hire was €18 plus a €100 deposit per bike. We were surprised the wifi was free. You could buy separate items for breakfast but they seemed to have gotten the price list from a budget airline.At a side note, avoid the East 57 restaurant at all cost (there is a review on my profile). The rooftop bar was quite nice though.The hotel is covered in strange marketing propaganda which even extended to the rooms themselves. The hotel seems to still market itself as a cool-hip student friendly place, which at the cost and unwelcoming and unfriendly service makes absolutely no sense.

When we returned the following afternoon the maid had made up the beds with the extra pillow for us.The hotel is right by amstel station that stops at various points in the city and goes all the way to central. We never waited longer than 1 or 2 minutes for a train because they are so regular. Another plus is that you have to activate the lift with your keycard which stops any undesirables wandering about too.

You do have a desk the length of the room to work or put your suitcase, you don't have plastic wrapped slippers. You do have TV, a kettle for tea and a mini-bar and fridge, you don't have views of the city. There is a good restaurant and everything you want from a hotel breakfast - but you don't have room service.

Location:It is about a 5-7 minute walk from the Amstelstation which is a decent hub. 3 or the 4 metro lines stop hear and it is only about 5 stops to Central Station and 3-4 stops for other city center locations. The Sprinter and Intercity trains also stop at this station. In addition there are Casa signs almost the whole way from the station to the hotel so you know which way to walk.Hotel:The hotel is clean with a big lobby. The lobby also has tables set up where you can sit with your laptop and work and many people were doing so. This hotel has a young vibe about it with what seemed to be a younger type crowd staying there. It also has a great coffee bar in the lobby as well as a breakfast buffet, wine bar and 8th floor rooftop terrace. However, these all close at around 11 PM and there is nothing really close by so if you want a late night, plan on being out in the city. At check in the staff was very friendly.Room:The view in our room was not great. We were overlooking the other side of the hotel so we basically looked at a building for 3 days. Also, if you're on the side, you can see into the rooms across the way so keep that in mind. Had I known this, I would have asked for a different view or paid a little more for the view. This was probably the biggest room we had while traveling in Europe and I feel it was comparable in size to US hotels rather than European Hotels. There was plenty of room to put our luggage and spread out a little bit. The shower was okay but as other people stated, it does leak onto the bathroom floor pretty substantially. This is a design flaw in the shower and door set-up. Our room was on the top floor right next to the elevator however, it was pretty quiet and we were never bothered by the elevator noise. Finally, this was also the best wifi we had in Europe. It worked well every time we needed it.

I had used my google map to locate the rembrandt museum which is about 10-14 minutes walk for my purchase.The second issue was the elevator was making a loud sound since it was having problems closing. I saw what appears to be the repairman working at it early in the morning, but it was never fixed. It went on all day. I brought it to the attention of the hotel and I was told no one had reported it.",4,Great Amsterdam hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229182-r501761372-NH_Collection_Amsterdam_Grand_Hotel_Krasnapolsky-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,dannycheng15

Check-in was rather cumbersome and took a long time, we needed to fill in our address again (although they had it from our reservation) and they needed copies of passports for each room.

Furthermore, the current business model is to attract business people but also package deals for group tourism. When I am having breakfast and it comes across as being in a bazar then you wonder, why stay at this hotel at all. When the laundry is not carried out as requested and yet the only reply you get from the staff is; ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" then this comes across as a hollow statement instead of actually dealing with the issue. When you check out of the hotel, they do not drop the bill in advance in your room to review and sign off, instead, you are forged to stand in the queue between a group of tourists for about 45 min.

We're not too sure what we were being upgraded from, as our room seemed like a standard, run-of-the-mill double.The bed was large and comfortable with good quality linen. Bathroom was adequate, but with a small single sink with hardly any room around it for toiletries, so they had to stay in our wash bags.Our first night wasn't too bad. The outside temperature was around 10 degrees, so we didn't notice that the air conditioning, although blowing, wasn't working. We then realised that we both were being bitten by mosquitoes! We travel Africa extensively, and are only too familiar with this annoying creature. Despite our complaint to housekeeping, the issue wasn't resolved. The following nights, the outside temperature increased, the air conditioning still wasn't working and we again were bitten all through the night. Our suspicion is, that they are getting through the air-con system, and being blown into the room, as our window was kept closed for the duration.

There are many sights within a short walking distance from the hotel including canal boat tours, hop-on-hop-off, museums and shopping.",3,Darryl and Vannice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d189397-r507257496-NH_Collection_Amsterdam_Barbizon_Palace-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,vandarfelix

The place is spotlessly clean. Rooms are in good conditions. The bed was especially comfortable to sleep on, and the bed sheets were nice and cozy. Service was friendly and effective. Breakfast was really good. Location is convinient, just outside the main train station (Amsterdam Central). this makes it easy to get in from the airport (by train) and back. The hotel is right on the edge of the Red-Light District. I usually prefer to stay more south in the city, but there were many advantages to this location. We were a group of three couples who stayed at this hotel in late July. Checked in on a Thursday late morning. and Checked out on Sunday (check out time is 3pm by default, which is really nice because we had an evening flight out). The rooms were not ready when we checked in, but were made available as we got closer to 3pm. The suitcases were stored in the storage. This whole process was handled very nicely, even though we were not easy customers, repeatadly remembering that we've left things in the suitacses that we wanted to retrieve. We received two rooms on the 4'th floor: one facing the canal and the other facing the inner court. The room facing the canal had stairs in the room (which is a little strange). We also received a room on the 1'st floor.The room were very quiet and sleep quality was very good. There is quality tea and coffee in the room. The shower is wonderful. The towels are very nice. Two robes with slippers. There is a safe in the room. And the lighting is good.We had one incident where one of the couples had an issue with room cleaning, which was done rather late in the day, but they were compensated to their satisfaction in return for this problem. Serive at breakfast varied between excellant and good. The food was of the highest quality and variety all three mornings.",5,3 nights over the weekend in Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d189397-r507428081-NH_Collection_Amsterdam_Barbizon_Palace-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,gadaha

Although this claims you'll feel right at home, we had a few issues.Positives : near the main museums and Albert Cuyt market area, which has some nice bars and excellent restaurantsThe room was OK but had a slanted roof which made about a third of the room a head hazard for me, and my wife (just over 5ft) had to lean over to get in that side of the bed. The bathroom is fine.The reception/bar and restaurant are nicely decorated.Downside - when we arrived we asked if we could access the room earlier than 3pm as we been up a fair while. When we've asked elsewhere, the response has been anything from a we'll see what can be arranged, up to, we'll take your mobile and text you as soon as its ready. This time we were told our booking commences at three and nothing could be done- strictly true, but not making us feel ""right at home"" They told us the minibar is restocked daily with non alcoholic drinks - when we got into the room there was no water and our request for some took a long while to be processed.The bar is open until 12pm, we got back from a local restaurant around 11 and went in, we were greeted by the bar person saying ""there are no cocktails available"" (we hadn't actually asked) when we asked for coffees we were told the machine had just been cleaned. At that point we left , found a nice bar down the street and decided not to bother with their restaurant the next night.The next day when we got back around 1-1:30 in afternoon the room hadn't been cleaned, we asked at reception and were told usually the occupied rooms are done after 3 up to 7pm. Never come across this before - they did arrange it to be done earlier but the attitude wasnt good -as though we were being awkward somehow. Finally the room card (only one supplied) is needed to access the lift, as its needed to power the a/c and lights in room, if one of you wants to go out alone, in theory they cant get back up to room.So nice enough place but not a good experience, we've paid a lot less for a lot more elsewhere, and staff attitudes cost nothing but mean a lot.

The first night we had only one fan and we had trouble sleeping because of how warm it felt. We were disappointed with our experience in arranging for a taxi to the airport. Two of the concierge staff and a front desk staff member said that the taxi charged a flat rate of 37.50 Euros to the airport and that the taxi would arrive in 2-3 minutes after they called. When we were leaving early in the morning, there were different staff members on duty. They said that the taxi could cost 60 Euros and would arrive in 10-15 minutes. We were also told the taxi accepted credit cards. The taxi driver charged us 57 Euros and said his credit card machine was broken. When we told him we did not have cash, he somehow found another machine and accepted the payment by credit card. He also drove way too fast.

You'd think the room would be outstanding based on the wait but it wasn't. The room they showed me had a dirty tub but it had a canal view! I had them move me and the next room was fine. The next morning I wake up to get ready for a meeting, and as I'm showering the water gets so high that I have to jump out of the shower and get into the tub so that the shower didn't overflow! Ridiculous! I expect something like this in SE Asia, but not in Amsterdam! Both bathroom sinks were also stopped up and there was a ball of blonde hair near the toilet. Just disgusting. I called to get someone to fix it and go to my meeting, requesting that my room be cleaned while I'm away. I come back, and the quality of the cleaning is abysmal. The housekeeper hadn't wiped down a single surface or taken away dirty cups and such. She didn't clean the bathroom, nor did she change the sheets. At this point I go and speak with management about how poorly this ship is being sailed and she offers me breakfast. Fine. I informed her that I wanted to speak with her to try to change the trajectory of my stay, she listened but the level of service continued to be appalling. Before I reached the actual manager I tried to talk to the front desk manager and she literally kept running from me whilst talking on the phone to a customer about why his money was not returned from what I could gather. In addition to all of this the spa area is filthy at all times, the hot tub is cold and forever will be, and they charged me twice for the stay. To boot I was there for my birthday which was ruined because the stay at this crappy hotel was so bad. I ran into this woman who was having trouble using her room key, which the reception did not help her with at all, and helped her get into her room and was informed that she got an upgrade! It made me wonder, because you'd think that's what they'd offer me after the terrible quality of service but they didn't. Just breakfast with a bunch of loud families. The only thing Grand Amrath has going for it is it's location if you like to party. Other than that it's just an old overpriced eyesore. I have learned my lesson, and will never stay at this hotel again.",1,Not a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d618996-r501809453-Grand_Hotel_Amrath_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Molly B

I agree with other reviews, the front of the house staff is top notch; friendly, polite, and professional. We were escorted to our connecting rooms, 105 and 106 (which are in the basement with views of the parking area), and the amenities were fully explained. On the positive side, the free breakfast was terrific and you can't complain about a free mini bar.On the downside, I feel this hotel deserves 3 Stars at best. Our rooms were not up to the same standard of other 5 Star hotels we stayed in during our 3 1/2 week trip. The entire hotel had an old, run down feel and the housekeeping was, in my opinion, substandard. Windows were dirty, crevices in the shower were not clean, etc.I had room 106 and the Nespresso machine did not work, the TV had been reprogramed so I was unable to access English stations, and the shower door was, quite simply, defective. The shower door in room 105 slid in three sections, creating an opening of around 20 inches. The shower door on room 106 had an oversized glass panel, which only allowed the door to open 12 inches (I am small and squeezed in sideways). When the maintenance person came to look at the shower door, he explained that was just the way it was. I asked how a large person could use the shower, he smiled and pointed to the bathtub. However, that is trivial compared to the problem with room 105 (occupied by my wife). It backs-up to the freight elevator and, around 3:00 a.m., laundry is delivered. The banging was very loud and continuous so my wife was unable to get a full night's sleep. I bet I am not the first person to complain about room 105.After the second night, we requested different rooms, and were told to vacate 105 and 106 (they stored our luggage) and our new rooms would be ready by 2:00 that afternoon. We returned to the hotel around 5:00 only to find just one room ready with the other room not cleaned until after 6:00. My wife had 117 which looked out over a construction site, but at least they didn't start noisy work until around 5:30. I was in room 111 that looked onto a glass panel roof which was dusty and had lots of debris (probably from the construction sight). The TV did not work at all (which was fixed after two requests) and the shower spray rod was loose at the bottom (which was fixed after only one request). The service problem is not with the front of the house, they are very responsive. The problem at this hotel is maintenance and housekeeping.The restaurant is only open for breakfast, with lunch and dinner (basically the room service menu) served in the bar. A room service cart was left in the hall for at least 8 hours. The list of negatives goes on and on. Very disappointing stay overall.",1,Very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d618996-r505815281-Grand_Hotel_Amrath_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Jerry H

Whilst we had a really enjoyable stay in Amsterdam, the hotel was a disappointment. I have stayed in a number of 4 star hotels and these were all better than the Amrath. I would say that the hotel was really a 3 star, not a 5 star.On the positive side, the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was good, the mini bar in the room was also a welcome change from most hotels, and the location (5 mins walk from the train station) was extremely convenient. The bathroom was also large and in good condition. However, the bedroom was poor. We were on the 1st floor overlooking the skylights above the breakfast area. This made it extremely difficult for fresh air to get into the room, and also made the room extremely warm and uncomfortable. The air conditioning in the room did not work, which the hotel were obviously aware of as they left a large electric fan in the room. When we were in the room we had to have the fan continually on so that the room was cool, as well as improve the 'musty' smell that existed. We were surprised about the lack of drawers in which to place our clothes. The decor of the room , and the hotel , was also extremely dated.

We had a room right at the top (300) and were amazed at how beautiful and in keeping with the original features of the hotel it was. Our friend had a double storey room (124) but we much preferred ours to theirs. The building is stunningly gothic and set within walking distance of tram stops into the centre and right inside a park. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and it was extremely reasonable in price too. Also the huge bath was amazing!!,5,Beautiful ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d249326-r500865168-Hotel_Arena-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,franskininio

When we arrived we were shocked about how lovely it was and the settings. We went to check in and were told that check-in was not available till 3pm, it was only 2.15 so we were provided lockers for our luggage and went to the hotel bar. This bar/restaurant is the reason that I never gave Hotel Arena 5 stars and in all honesty I near gave only 3. There were 6 of us and we tried to find a able without a reserved sign on and finally managed to get a 'spot'. We asked for food and drinks menus, after 20 minutes we still have no menus so went and took some off the surrounding 'host stand'. Then we tried for another 10 minutes to get someones attention to take our drink order. Put it this way we had been in the bar for over 40 minutes before we had got one drink. We even tried to go into the bar area but was told that someone would come and take our order. When our drinks did arrive the wine was warm, we asked for ice but once again too ages.By this point it was around 3.50 so we decide to check into our rooms. My key came first so up I went, have too say the room was lovely although very small (room 133), it was a twin room and the beds were very close together but for a 2 night stay it was sufficient. Thankfully we didn't have much baggage as there wouldn't have been much room to store it but on the whole it was ok (the shower was realy lovely and powerful). The only other comment on the room was that the air con only went as low as 19 degrees, during the night it was very hot.We went back to the bar to all regroup, one couple still had thier suitcases with them, it was now over an hour and a half after check-in time and their room still wasn't ready, the hotel supplied them with a small beer each as compensation. Once the rest of our party arrived and everyone finally got to their rooms we all went out for a walk. The next morning we went down to breakfast. This was not included in the price of the room and had a charge of around 20 euro's. The food was sufficient, nice touch of a bottle of cava on the side patrons could pour themselves. There was 8 of us staying at the hotel and we poured about half a glass each before it run out and we were told that there was no more in the hotel. They only had another 'make' but we could only have a glass. I doubt that any of us wanted more than a glass but it was the point, the other bottle was left on the side for people to take as much as they like from...... We then asked if we could book an outside table for lunch, we were going to the North Sea Jazz Festival with a driver picking us up from the hotel so didn't want to go out. We were then told that they don't take reservations for tables outside (even though the day before tables had been covered with reserved signs'. So I went to reception to ask if we could book an outside table and explained how the day before loads of tables had been reserved. I was then told (after a call) that there was no problem and it was all booked. When we went down for lunch of course it hadn't been booked. With some rejigging of tables and chairs we all managed to sit together (not that the staff helped us with that), lunch orders were 'forgotten to be cooked', drinks were wrong, I asked for a vodka and tonic and was asked if I would like hendricks? There is also an issue with the staff do not seem to be trained to 'think outside the box', if you have run out of one type of rose wine, please then tell us the rose you do have. When taking drinks orders, maybe notice how many empty glasses are on the table and think of moving some away? The people that brings your drinks are not allowed to take orders. People who can take orders seem to spend most of the time hanging around the 'host stand' shuffling menus, We did ask someone and was told that the waiters apart from a couple are all contract staff and we all guessed which ones were permanent straight away as they were the only decent staff working there. Would I stay here again? Yes for sure but do not expect me to be trying to buy any drink or food.",4,Fabulous hotel let down by rubbish staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d249326-r500831433-Hotel_Arena-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Emma500

The hotel itself is absolutely fantastic, very large and with nice, clean, spacious rooms. The larger room we got was situated on the top floor, maybe in what had once been the attic, with exposed beams. The bathroom was exceptionally large with a shower and a bathtub.Now on to the breakfast buffet: Amazing. A wide selection of food, very fresh and nicely presented. A lot of staff who made sure there was plenty of everything. We never tried the restaurant for dinner, but the bar offers some very nice cocktails.Would I recommend this hotel? Definitely.

The hotel's appearance is captivating from the moment you arrive and then we were lucky enough to be greeted by the lovely smiley Lisa on reception. Our room was beautiful (we were even fortunate enough to get an upgrade as we were on our honeymoon). I have seen people comment about bathrooms with little privacy - it is right to say that in certain lights you might get an eyeful so sharing with a work colleague for example might be a tad awkward but didn't bother us - not sure all rooms are like this tho. The terrace/bar/restaurant/rooms are even more stunning than the photos show. Staff were a joy generally - helpful, chatty and welcoming. We even got to have a look at the chapel. Food was super, and the cocktails were really rather good too. If you fancy staying in a laid back neighbourhood a stones throw away from central Amsterdam but with its own trendy cafes and vibe, Oosterpark is ideal. Only pernickety grumble - it's really no worse than this - was a screechy bathroom door (just ill fitting so caused a noise when my husband or I used the loo in the night!). Do go!",5,Wow!

The room itself was ok, if you don't mind the broken window that can not be closed (hello rain) and a mini-fridge that contained some sort of a bio-weapon (at least i guessed so by the smell of it) I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex (btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling ) was offered a room but only the next day.SO, i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to. Not the best way to begin your holiday. so we had to wait till 13-00 in order to check in my new room. what a wonderful waist of my time...The room (#023) i got was just as i wanted to - peaceful internal garden view, big window. We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city. In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room - i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something.. it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am, making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife. I have an audio recording that i can not attach here, but if you want i can send it via e-mail. The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so, i was offered to change the room once again. the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left - the one that was smaller but seems newer. the problem is - it was just outside the restaurant and it was not so relaxing as i planned. As it was already a late evening i decided to drink myself to sleep and deal with the problem later. The next day even this option disappeared so i was left with my problem. No complimentary things were offered to me for such an experience, no one checked on me or tried to fix the problem later (may i remind you - my wonderful experience here was for 6 nights in a row, not that short time to get neglected). May be i should have made a dramatic scene right in front of the lobby and demand my money back BUT as long as we were not planing to spend too much time indoors i was thinking it was not such a big deal and it won't screw my remaining vacation, as i was hoping the problem would be solved.we loved the park with a small pond that is just outside the hotel. the more wise thing for us to do would be to buy a tent and go sleep in a park.i would have understood if it was a B&B or a hostel... but you should pay 170 Eur for a night to have a chance to book a room here.My advice - stay away or be prepared to deal with the problems of an old remodeled building by yourself.",1,Not so great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d249326-r505052350-Hotel_Arena-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,k0zyr

Overall enjoyed a decent trip to Amsterdam however the hotel proved to be the ""blot"" of the trip.We arrived at around 1:30 in the afternoon to be told check in wasn't until 3pm so we left luggage in the lockers provided and headed out. Upon arrival back at 3, we were told one of our two rooms would be ready shortly and the second may take longer. The receptionist then headed off to check with the housekeeping as to when the rooms would be ready. Around 15 minutes later she headed off with her coat and bag as if she was heading home without any word or update to when the room would be ready. We eventually got the keys at 5pm. A plus point for the hotel is we had requested rooms close together and we were across the corridor from each other, so this was executed as requested.In my room the safe was broken. In both of the rooms my family occupied there were non of the usual instructions on how to use the television or telephone. There were tea and coffee making facilities as promised however absolutely no milk or anything in the fridge (even some UHT cartons would suffice, just to get you started) plus the placement of the kettle meant the lead didn't actually reach the nearest plug. Housekeeping itself seemed to be, literally, a days work. There were times you still saw the housekeeping staff going around at 5pm and what ""cleaning"" actually took place was questionable. It seemed all that was done was change of the towels, cups, emptying the bin and straightening the bedsheets. Unlike many of other places we have stayed, there didn't appear to be any cleaning done in the bathroom or floor, no bleach smell or anything to suggest things had been scrubbed- thankfully we had our own cleaning wipes to go round and give things the once over. I would hope that these things get properly cleaned during the changeover, however having not had these cleaned during our stay, possibly not.... Maybe this could be as we had standard rooms and the costlier, plusher rooms get priority? The were grubby marks on the wall of the staircase leading up to the bed. There was one occasion where I hung the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, only for the housekeeping lady to come barging in regardless, turn all the lights on and then seem shocked I was there. Do not leave your ""spare"" room key in the power supply for easy use as we had done as the cleaners had a habit of removing them. This meant a trip to reception to get another set. The rooms, despite the need for a decent deep clean and maybe a lick of paint, did the job and were sufficient for what we used them for.We felt there was a lack of coordination and trust between the hotel and ""The Park"" restaurant/bar despite being told both were the same company. Whilst we had not prebooked for breakfast, we chose to eat there on two mornings. Breakfast cost €19.50 (or €17.50 if booked through reception the day before). For the cost, the choice on offer wasn't value for money and there was a feeling of making things stretch throughout - I never felt there would be replenishments being brought out quickly once something had run out. The staff though were incredibly quick to remove dirty cups and plates from the table. Perhaps they thought this was being efficient, however we felt pressured and unable to enjoy our food without somebody hovering waiting for you to finish so they could clean up. On the first morning we had breakfast and were presented with the bill literally as we found a table - so without having even eaten, already expected to cough up. Maybe the staff don't trust the customers?Location wise, it is nicely just out of the way from the main city centre - it took us around 20/25 minutes walk or the nearest metro station is five minutes around the corner. The park itself is nice however there did seem to be a few undesirable characters lurking in the corners. All in all there is room for improvement however having said that, certain members of staff were obliging.",3,ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d249326-r506485462-Hotel_Arena-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Globerunner7

I would say the overall setting of the hotel is lovely. Really grand looking and great decor. The staff were friendly. Our room wasn't ready on time so we got a free drink at the bar. Our room was nice; it was a bit shabby in places though. There were 2 dead fly squashed to the wall and the side walls had scuff marks etc. Part of the wall was peeling. It was very clean just a bit shabby though. I would say the hotel should make use of the side entrances this would make for a much quicker journey to the tram stop!! The doors are there so let your customers use them. It's a 5-10 min walk to the tram stop and a 12 min tram too town which is nice enough.

The room was very interesting as it had the bathroom and seating area when you come in and a small stairs up to the double bed above you, which I found very quirky.

However owing to circumstances beyond our control we had unexpectedly been called back to England. At that time we were at the Ibis in Bruges when I used their wifi system to inform the Hilton in Amsterdam that we had to cancel our booking. This was done on Tuesday morning at around 7am. I firmly believed that I had given the hotel plenty of notice of my cancellation. Upon arriving back in England at around 11:30 pm 'from Dieppe I discovered that the email was sent by the iPhone when it connected at home. I have subsequently sent two emails asking for a refund and received no reply. Just goes to show how bad wifi can be. Cost me £150.00 because email not received before checking in. Beware anyone using wifi abroad, make sure that if you are relying on email to cancel bookings that you also phone hotel to check. A very expensive and unfortunate lesson not of my making.

Then FO manages printed out recite for room cost & parking, I assigned it and asked when rest pf amount will be released to my account back. FO manager answered it will be done immediately.

Yet you are away from the some of the more crowded, noisier, seedier areas. You are also literally adjacent to the lovely Vondelpark. Beautiful for morning jog and midday stroll. Another street over has all the high end shopping. Hotel itself has excellent bar/lounge/restaurant overlooking the main intersection. Club lounge had outstanding breakfast and dinner, and staff was fantastic. However, gets a bit crowded. Hotel itself was fully modernized, especially rooms which were super clean and contemporary. Beware, beds are very very firm. Elevators a bit tricky with card readers not working so well but everyone managed. Very modern American/business type hotel, and I mean that as a sincere compliment.

The suite was large, but about 20% of the space was wasted on the entrance foyer. The foyer was the only part of the room with good lighting, which was waste since there was nothing in the foyer. The foyer led directly to the bathroom, which had no entrance door. There was one sink. Space was tight. There was a door inside the bathroom, which led into the toilet and shower--also tight space. There was a large king size bed with a mattress that was saggy/sunken in. Opposite the bed was a huge flat screen tv which was great, but could only be seen from the bed and the occasional chairs next to it. There was a large sectional sofa against the wall opposite the bed, but it was pretty much useless because you couldn't see the tv and the lighting was so poor you couldn't read.With the exception of a few framed photos under the tv, there were no wall decorations. Essentially a stark, bare bones look.The Ugly----the club lounge, which used to be located on the top floor, was moved to an enlarged space on the ground floor. Picture a high school cafeteria. Lots of space, but shabbily furnished. Always crowded with at best a mediocre assortment of complimentary refreshments. Guests were not greeted, much less given an overview or seated by staff. You were on your own. Breakfast was a horror. If you could find a table, it was typically strewn with the dishes and food from the previous occupants. The minimal staff just couldn't keep up with the volume of guests. To make matters worse, they were constantly being taken away from their cleaning up duties to go back to the kitchen to deliver guest orders for cooked eggs/omelets. Of course the only way you discovered you could get an omelet was from other guests. The fresh fruit was good and there were 2 cappuccino makers (which most times worked)The evenings canapes if you could find any were mediocre. There was complimentary wine, one lower quality white and one lower quality red. The same every night. The only thing that didn't run out.The hotel was filled with Marriott Platinum and Gold elite members. There seemed general agreement among the ones we spoke with that this was about the worst club lounge in the chain.Lastly, despite being and elite Ritz Carlton member, not one person on staff during our entire stay, addressed us by name or even made an effort to know our names.

The Amsterdam Marriott is situated in Leidesplein, a stones throw from the Rijks and the Van Gogh museums.And it is right next to Vondel Park. Perfect urban location.The rooms are well maintained but small according to American standards - however they are comparable to most European hotel rooms in size. After looking at a regular room I decided to stay in a suite on the 11th floor (the highest floor) which was very roomy with a balcony. This turned out to be a perfect choice as the room overlooked Leidesplein and afforded a view of the canals as well.The staff are extremely polite and pretty much handled everything with professionalism and courtesy. The hotel has two restaurants, Midtown Grill (steakhouse) and Sorels. We had dinner at the Grill one of the days and found the food to be excellent.There is an executive lounge for use by Marriott members and we had breakfast there most days. It was well stocked and the staff made sure that everything was replaced promptly. They also have made to order eggs for breakfast. We did not use the lounge for evening snacks but did notice that it got a little crowded in the peak hours of 6-7PM. The evening snacks seemed to be quite sumptuous as well.The service was excellent. The concierge booked all the tickets we needed and made the requisite dinner bookings and also had some great touristy suggestions as well.

My deluxe room overlooked the roof and air conditioning. Ugh! If that was my view I guess the standard rooms overlook the dumpsters. The executive lounge is nice but not big enough. It seems every one can get it and there were kids running around everywhere! Awful! The person working in the evening doesn't have enough help so it takes forever for things to be refilled and she runs it like a military operation. When dinner is over and desserts come out, heaven help the person who goes up to get a piece of dessert! You'll be told to sit down and wait. Also, this is the first executive lounge that doesn't offer bottled water!!! I am a platinum rewards member so I stay in Marriott a lot and know. I just don't understand.The a/c wasn't working properly in our room one evening causing it to drip all night on the stone floor. It was a danger zone in the morning to not fall. With towels at a premium in this property it was tough. We reported it to the front desk at 8:00am and returned around 7:00 in the evening. We were instructed in the morning to check at the front desk before going to our room to see if they were able to repair it.

When I wanted to write down my complaints I found out there was no notebook. We were not recognized as Platinum members. No upgrades whatsoever, it felt more like a downgrade, a room next to the elevator with all the noises that it brings being on that location...Normally we like to have a drink in their executive lounge....but this time t was hard to find a seat or a table...Way to busy...we wanted to have a little bite but everything was empty...Kitchen staff did their very best to refill everything but people seem to use their dinner here....They fill their plates till it doesn't fit anymore.....Positive point that they should do always, there was a man at the door in the morning who checked your roomumber so it was more quiet at breakfast than I had ever seen...So they should check more in the evenings as well, because I had the feeling that a lot of guests slipped in the lounge while they had no access......Complete family's showed up.... At check out I told the lady at the desk my points and what happened, I wanted to give her my note, but she paid a little attention...It was busy that morning, but at least she could have taken my note and paid attention to it and tell housekeeping later about the missing items etc...My husband had left the hotel very early already for business and when I told him in the evening about my experience and about the check in experience, he called the hotel and the manager on Duty, told him the GM came back on Sunday and would contact us immediately..A few days past, still no reaction. Then I made a little reaction on a comment on Facebook, not telling the details and the hotel contacted me...They had my contact-information details on file but it seemed difficult to contact me....Finally, after I sent my complaints by email, and I told them that I preferred to tell straight to them about my experiences so that I hadn't have to do it on social media or tripadvisor whatever, their response came.....with a lot of excuses and further nothing......""Is there anything that we can do to make you have a good feeling about your stay"" was there reaction....No, thank you Marriott, this stay was definitive not a good one...we might come back when in the area to give it another chance (or to talk to Frans) but I rather go to Renaissance, close to Central Station and even better maybe the Sheraton at the airport, a short train ride away from the city......",2,Not worth staying anymore.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229495-r509971793-Amsterdam_Marriott_Hotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,koala2409

The bellmen and lobby Concierge were personable, and very helpful. Sorry I can't remember their names but they were great to interact with. We checked in at 10 am, coming off a river cruise. Of course, a room wasn't ready, which was no problem, but when I asked to make sure we were on a high floor with a canal view it didn't look like it was going to happen. Nicole came to our rescue and worked the system to find us a room while we were exploring Amsterdam. We got an outstanding Executive level room on the ODD number side, which gives the best outside views. We had a very large, clean room, with a large bathroom and a walk-in shower. Thank you Nicole. When you check in work with the front desk people. Our friends traveling with us got an even number room which looked at a wall, and worst of all the bathroom was small with a pedestal sink and absolutely no counter space to place toiletries. And we paid the same price for the room. Our advantage was being a lifetime platinum, and I worked with Nicole. Thanks again for taking great care of a frequent stayer. Thanks to the Concierge who booked tours for us cheaper then I could get online in the States. Also, when they called a cab, they were there at the appointed minute. The hotel is in a perfect location to visit the Rembrandt and Van Goth museums. It's only a 10 minute walk to the museums. Watch out for the million bikes; they are crazy and feel like they always have the right of way. I recommend seeing the museums with the ""Skip the Lines"" with lunch and canal cruise tour that you can find at the hotel, Viatar and Trip Adviser. It's a wonderful way to see the museums, and more, and have an art knowledgeable guide take you to the important pieces in the museums. You'll see and learn a lot more with a guide. The downside of this location is it's a hard walk to the Old City area, Redlight District, etc. Unfortunately, my wife had a bad knee and couldn't walk any distance. Walking into the center would have been more of an adventure and we would have seen more, but she just couldn't do it. So we cabbed everywhere and the cabs are expensive. Plan on about 20 Euors +/- depending on the honesty and route of the taxi ride. This is more for Marriott mgt, but it was strange to have the Concierge Lounge on the lobby floor. No views from this lounge, but the food and beverages were good and appreciated. Another thing that was different was on more than one occasion the lounge was filled with kids, with their families. It wasn't the quiet resting place that most lounges are.The last comment to Marriott is that the room key reader in the elevators doesn't work very well.

All we talked about at our 2nd hotel stay was how good JL No76 was and how we needed to return. Check-in was easy.

It was clean, facing the street, beds were comfortable. The honesty bar came in handy. We had planned to eat breakfast elsewhere but always ended up at the downstairs restaurant. When the weather is nice, the courtyard in the back is open for you to sit and enjoy your meal. I wish I could remember the person’s name at the front desk. He was hilarious. Hotel is close to everything touristy. Was able to get up early and get a nice pic of the IAMSTERDAM sign – 5 min walk, if that. Multiple lines to Amsterdam Centraal and to everywhere really. Found a nice restaurant named Pompa nearby and there are lots of food options around. We didn’t eat dinner at the hotel ever so I cannot comment. You may be able to hear your neighbor’s television through the wall but other than that, it was very quiet every night. Did I mention that the beds were comfortable?

The location was great. It was an short walk to the museum district, the tram, the street market, the Heineken experience and many restaurants. Although the rooms are smaller than I am used to, it was clean and comfortable and quiet. We arrived before our room was ready, so they stored our luggage and gave us directions and maps so we could get around. We returned at the time they suggested and the room was just about ready, so they offered us some wine while we waited the last few minutes. There is a restaurant in the lobby area that was always busy, but we chose to eat in the area of the city which we were visiting for the day. The little restaurant/bar on the corner across the street was excellent, too.

We were taken to the study where we were checked in by Marin/ Maureen. An extremely professional and friendly person. We were started off on some prosecco. The room felt fresh and well serviced. During those four days, I also had my birthday. The hotel left a beautiful card and balloons on the bed for me. I was rather hot in the duvet. On requesting them for an alternative, they didn't have any thinner duvets but they did leave some sheets for us. Responsive hotel, happy staff and charming environ. The red light area shares the same block. I had a walk towards that side too. Walkable to all city center attractions, I think I was all in all happy. We were driving but didn't park the car with them. It was mostly on the street. The hotel breakfast buffet is popular but we couldn't really try it. May be another time.

We had visited the restaurant in the hotel on a previous trip so selected the hotel as we felt we knew what to expect.On arrival our room wasn't ready, nor was it ready over an hour later when we'd been told it would be.We had paid for a Deluxe room, this is not the basic level at the hotel, on check in I was told that the room did have a city view even though it was on the first floor. On entering the room it became very clear that not only did the room not have a city view but it did have a very unattractive view of the bins and yards of the opposite apartments. I will attach a photo. The room lights did not respond to the remote controls and the room was very dark.When I raised this with reception I was told that if I wanted a city view I should have asked for one, even though it is part of the room description described on the hotel website. We were moved on our second night to a room of the standard we had booked, however that's hardly a good start to a vacation. The room we moved to was great, had lots of light and a view we expected. But no apology or recognition of the issue with our initial room.All in all we felt that we were not valued customers and that quality of service and ensuring that we had a good vacation was not of interest to the hotel. We ended up cancelling our planned dinner in their exceptional restaurant as they would not assure us that we would get a table seat (opposed to a bar seat).

On the second night we were moved to another suite that was above the restaurant/bar area where the music was loud until 1 am on a Tuesday night. So make sure you aren't above there if you like a quiet nights sleep. The staff were on the whole friendly but not consistently offering great service like I would expect from this kind of hotel.The hotel itself is very smart, comfortable and quirky so it has all the right ingredients for a top hotel but this didn't follow through on our stay.Also the restaurant in the hotel is very nice and the food was pretty good but not worth the excessive prices in my opinion, especially the breakfast.

The staff were lovely, but the rooms felt a bit in need of refreshing.. or maybe just deep cleaning. The first room we were put in didn't have a working light in the shower and wasn't very clean - dust in a lot of places and scuff marks all over the walls, and stains on the curtains and coverlet. We were moved due to the light issue to a larger room on the lower level of the hotel, which was cleaner and better overall, but proved to be noisy at night due to poor soundproofing and the bustling restaurant down the hall. Given it was below grade I suppose it's understandable, but I wasn't thrilled to see a couple of silverfish during the course of our stay (including one in a water glass we left upturned overnight ). We were also unable to control the air system in the room and found it got uncomfortably warm at night. Having said this, it was still a good experience on the whole and the staff were very nice, and helped us to rent bikes one day and gave some great suggestions on where to go.

The iPad lets you play music from different radio stations or airplay from your android/iPhone.We would fall asleep to a movie and the iPad had a feature that powered down the TV after a certain amount of time so we weren't disturbing our sleep. The alarm was a gentle wake up, the blinds opening slowly and the lights coming up really tied it all together. Ready to start the day we navigated to the closest tram stop (2 minutes away) and got the number 5 tram straight to the centre. Cost us €2.90 for a single tram journey but get a 24 hour ticket! It's only €7.50 and can be used on all trams all across the city for the entire day. Journey only took about 20 minutes to get to and from the centre. Such a walkable city!One of my favourite things about the hotel is It's constant attempts to bring you to the social areas where you can meet other travellers, sit on the big comfy sofas (where I currently write this review), or get a drink at the bar. Being new to the hotel I was given a 2 free drinks voucher so naturally my girlfriend and I got one of their lavish cocktails. Tasted amazing and was presented beautifully by our incredibly friendly bartender. One of the perks of the hotel is that if you hang a sign up on the door that asks the cleaners not to replace your towels then you get €10 every day to spend at the bar! Brilliant! 2 disaronno and cokes later and the bill comes to just €9, free drinks!I can honestly say that before booking any hotel in any city I will always look for a citizenM hotel. Amazing decor, incredibly friendly staff, a huge king sized bed, amazing drinks at the bar, the ability to control your entire room with an iPad. I will definitely be back.",5,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1372848-r504685105-CitizenM_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Mark B

We were greeted by a friendly member of staff who talked us through how to use the self service check in.Our room was very similar to Glasgow with the only noticeable differences being the shower and toilet were in separate pods.The huge bed is incredibly comfortable. There is a great choice of channels and movies on the TV and I always love the mood lighting. Great shower too.Everything within the room, from the curtains to temperature, is controlled by an iPad.The rooms were quiet except for the last night when the construction work at the front of the hotel was noisy and woke us a few times.The staff are what makes a great experience an excellent one. All very friendly and helpful. We were able to buy our tram tickets at the hotel and staff told us about how to check in and out of the trams and talked through the map with us.The hotel provides bikes free of charge which is another nice little added extra. The hotel is next to a tram stop and is a 10 minute journey to Dam Square and closer to the Museum Quarter. It is a short walk to the train station and a short train journey from the airport.The location meant that we could enjoy breakfast in a quieter location and experience the laid back atmosphere as well as the hustle of the city centre.We didn't spend much time in the hotel other than to sleep but we did have a few drinks and there is TVs, computers and comfortable seating areas in the main foyer.We had another fantastic stay at citizenM and look forward to another stay in the future!",5,Perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1372848-r505365656-CitizenM_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Melanie W

For a single traveller it's fantastic - although you'd want to be VERY close with your partner to share a room, as the toilet and shower are part of the bedroom so there's no hiding any intimate details.

Personally, I find it perfect for a city hotel although my brother finds the rooms too small. The idea in the Citizen M Hotels is that your leasure area is in the lounge/bar area and the rooms are literally only to sleep and watch a movie in. The staff were great and very friendly.I love the ambience, the moderness and the overall idea and setup of Citizem M. To get into town it takes about 20mins by tram and the tram station is just around the corner. This makes it a bit far out for some people, but it is definitely doable although coming back in the early morning hours was a bit challenging and we ended up having to take an UBER.

The cabs are not outrageously priced and two of our three cab drivers were great city guides and raconteurs.",3,John & Yoko's Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d228438-r509071908-Hilton_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,EpicureoEducado

This is my first review but thought it was important to support independent hotels such as this and give credit and recognise the great service they provide.Amsterdam is a city that will accommodate every need. If you want history, fine dining, easy relaxed weekend, art, music or a wild time - Amsterdam manages to deliver all.Volkshotel is exactly the same, it manages to address the needs of an eclectic mix of guests. When we arrived we were welcomed and efficiently checked in. The lady at the desk was informative and friendly. The mix of people in the hotel lobby and bar summed up Volkshotel. There were students, groups of young men/women, families, couples and older friends all enjoying the same space. This is the beauty of Volkshotel it manages to meet the needs of all.We had the Johnny Jukebox suite and it was brilliant. The sound system set up was great and the room was just perfect yet quirky. Food and service at the hotel is very good. On the Saturday evening we arrived after the chef had finished taking orders. However the chef still offered to cook us a main course and it was excellent. We had our meal and the restaurant then transformed into a club with some great disco/funk and house music.In terms of location it is right by a Metro and short walk to Tram 3 which takes you to the museum quarter.Volkshotel has captured what it means to be cool. That is be yourself, be inclusive, enjoy what you do and don't take yourself too seriously.Yes you can find hotels that are more luxurious and high end but if that is what you are after you are missing the point of the Volkshotel and indeed Amsterdam.

This is a very cool, colourful and characterful hotel offering very good quality accommodation for a reasonable price. We chose the petite room, but were pleasantly surprised by its size (it was considerably more spacious than many hotel rooms in which we have stayed in similar cities); in fact, the hotel as a whole feels spacious and benefits from high ceilings and generous proportions. The room was spotlessly clean, the shower was perfect, the bed comfortable, and the view from the room was better than expected thanks to the very large window and pleasant aspect (facing attractive period housing across the street, but also with views to the adjacent busy main street). We didn't try breakfast, but the 7th floor restaurant/ bar/ nightclub offers great views, as does the top floor roof terrace (next time I'll remember to bring my swimwear!). The only drawback is the fact that the hotel is not really centrally located, but it's a 20-30 minute walk to many key sights and just four stops on the metro to the Central Station (or about 35 minutes' walk). The immediate area seems safe and perfectly fine, and there are local eateries as an alternative to the city centre.

One day they even did freshly squeezed orange juice.Rented bikes with them with no problems, location was right next to the metro which was handy. Super friendly staff.

For any first time visitors to Amsterdam- Get on the train from the airport, it costs 5 euros each and brings you right into Amsterdam Centraal. From Centraal Station, you need to get on the Metro (That's the underground one, not the trams above ground) for four stops. You can buy a ticket from the machine outside or inside the station...I would advise getting a ticket that covers the amount of time you are in Dam for...Very good value!Conveniently the hotel is located before the lines all split off so it doesn't matter which you get on...You get off at Wilbautstraat. This means the metro is running every couple of minutes to the hotel rather than having to wait for a specific train...Handy! When coming into Centraal Station from the hotel, you need to cross the road and ensure you get on a train heading to Centraal Station...Again, because there are five lines all running that way, you never wait very long!When we checked into the hotel, we had a party bag waiting for us as a gift to the newlyweds which was a nice touch. A party hat, a couple of party horns and a pack of bubbles. Made us smile! The check in was swift and simple and the staff were friendly. We chucked our bags in the room and had a look round the hotel. There is a cafe on the top floor...We didn't eat there but everyone seemed friendly enough! We went up to the top floor to have a look at the hot tubs next. It wasn't quite what we were expecting but was very much in line with the theme of the hotel. The hot tubs were sort of large barrels with what looked like a log burner next to them pumping heat in through a pipe. No jacuzzi buttons or fancy lights but they looked like a nice place to relax in the right weather conditions. While we were there it was wet & windy so we didn't take the opportunity to take a dip!The room was more spacious than we expected (My missus had been trying to blag a Honeymoon upgrade so maybe we were in a bigger room than we had booked!) and the bathroom was nice with a good shower. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of room for us to both get ready for a trip into the centre. I noticed another review suggesting the area looked a bit dodgy but we didn't get that vibe at all. When we first arrived and came up out the metro near the hotel, a friendly local drug dealer saw our confusion at which way to go next and asked us where we were trying to get to...He pointed us in the right direction and told us he would be around there later if we needed anything...haha. If the drug dealers are that friendly in the area, it can't be bad! Walking back from the metro late at night, we never felt unsafe...I would say the previous reviewer had a one in a million experience!We had a great time in Amsterdam again and if we go back for a fourth time, I will certainly check in on price and availability at Volkshotel before booking anywhere else.",5,Nice hotel in a decent location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d6599284-r508243116-Volkshotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Nottingham1987

A mere few stops and you're at Amsterdam Centraal and the metro stop is literally a 2 min walk from the front door. Thumbs up. Comfort: room perfectly comfortable. Decorated in a minimalist / brutalist kind of style. Unusual shower which you could look into from the bedroom. Fine for us as we are a couple but maybe take heed if you're not! Atmosphere: hip and friendly. Always greeted by friendly receptionists who would go to great lengths to help you out e.g. orienteering you around city, printing tickets etc. Also appreciated being fast tracked through to front of queue for lift (was a busy night in night club on roof and there was a queue for that). Food: only tried the brekky. At around €12 if I recall correctly, it was good value. Expansive selection of quality hot and cold items. Interestingly had one of the most tasty salads of recent memory from the breakfast bar. Value: it wasn't cheap as such, but I think it was because we visited when there was a big music festival on so it must have been a busy time. Nonetheless, think good value for money.

We had 4 people in our group so we reserved the Ms.Big room - it is a lofted style room with one big bed on the ground and two suspended bunk beds up top. My husband and I slept in the suspended beds (climb ladders up), which were actually very comfortable and gave us a little ""hiding area"" where we could eat snacks while watching the TV down below.The hotel is equipped with everything you need. There's a fancy restaurant called Canvas on the 7th floor with great views and a bar with drinks + snacks in the main lobby. Our last night in the hotel we enjoyed the rooftop hot tubs and sauna, enjoyed a small plate and cocktails at Canvas, then headed down to the bar for snacks, drinks, and a round of Scrabble.

Loved the breakfast (don't go to any of the nearby breakfast places - the hotel is much better value for money). A/C worked great and the room was very quiet despite being on the 6th floor (below the bar/nightclub). The downsides are:- Really strong perfume smell in the room. Way too much. Probably from cleaning products. - Rather hard beds. Especially in the elevated area in the family rooms. Also note that if you're staying in a family room and have smaller kids, you probably won't like for them to sleep upstairs (steep staircase, not enough protection from falling down).

The hotel was perfect for our needs. When we arrived at around 12.30pm the hotel let us check in early which was most welcome as we had an early flight. The room was a total hit with us and the kids - comfortable , spacious , impeccably clean and different from your average hotel! We used the top floor hot tub twice and were surprised that there was no one else availing of the facility. The top floor has a fabulous vista over the city. The hotel is so convenient for the underground which is just outside the hotel door. There are reasonable places to eat close by. The only slight downside we had was the hotel food which was overpriced for the quality of food received. The continental breakfast was €48 for two adults and two kids for a fairly basic buffet breakfast.Similarly after coming back from a day's sight-seeing , the food offering is limited and expensive.

The Canvas breakfast buffet was good although it was one-up'ed by the buffet at my Zandvoort hotel.

My bank explained it will take a long time for the funds to show in my account as available due to being in Europe. My bank recommended emailing the hotel and asking them to cancel the authorised payment. Which I did and received no response. I am still waiting for this money to be available in my account. Secondly when we arrived, I requested my friends room was near us. The manager immediately interrupted and said in a sarcastic/rude tone ""You book with a Multi Million pound company and expect a personalised service, Booking.com take a huge amount of my profit. If you wanted a personalised service you should have booked with the hotel direct"" We had just finished travelling and were feeling a little bit flustered as it was, and this was not the welcome we were expecting. For the remainder of the trip I felt uncomfortable being in the common areas if the Manager was there. The hotel is advertised as a art hotel, but most of the art covering the hotel is pretty ghastly, and gives the building a very confused feel. The swimming pools advertised to not belong to the hotel, these are public swimming bathes but are available to use if wanted. The hotel ran out of bikes for our second day which ruined things considerably as they did not give us any help to find alternative bikes, and the hotel is a long way from the centre.

In short, I was overcharged 110 euro on my bill, and the amount I agreed to pay in advance through booking.com (436) was not the amount the hotel charged me (456.58).It took several emails to the property to finally get it to admit the overcharge and refund my 110 euro. The additional 20.58 euro overcharge on my advance payment was explained as a “city tax”, although a 25.78 city tax was also applied directly to the bill. So double city tax then?I am no accountant but the various explanations to try and clear this up just left a sour taste in my mouth. At this point, I took the rightful 110 euro refund and have to walk away in frustration.It’s too bad because we enjoyed our stay at the property, but next time in Amsterdam the hassle of dealing with this bill issue will make it tough to justify staying here again.ORIGINAL REVIEWStayed in ""4 star"" area - not sure of the difference - but it was perfectly fine for a family of four. Nice hip vibe to the place.Impressive swimming area (didn't use), nice vibe in lounge (small food menu). Staff were pleasant and gave us umbrellas for the day it rained.It's a little ""out of the way""; 5-10 min by bus to centraal plus 5 min walk to the bus stop from hotel.

The front desk staff goes into quick mode when a few customers are waiting which is fine but unfortunately it does not make you the customer feel very welcome. Now when no one is waiting the two ladies running the front desk the day we arrived helped us out a lot. We got our city map along with a book of tours in the area and then sat down to decide on what to do. We decided on a tour and they helped us book the tour and get us our local city bus pass for 24 hours. The next day when we asked out the shuttle to the airport we found out we needed to pay for the service even though the website makes you believe it is part of the hotel service. We then asked our options and the gentleman behind the counter tried to steer us to a cab instead of the local hotel shuttle service and that goes between the area hotels and the airport. He also suggested the city bus over the shuttle and there was no way we would attempt the city bus with all of our luggage from out two week cruise. When we refused the cab and the city bus he seemed to be affronted to our decision to take the shuttle. We asked if the van service takes credit card and he said yes but the information was not completely accurate. He did make the call to get the shuttle to stop by but after that he was done with us. The hotel should have offered the tickets there at the front desk. Why could we book and pay for the tour and local city bus service the day before but not the shuttle? The shuttle driver could NOT accept credit cards, only their service desk at the airport could. The driver had to make two extra stops just for us so I could pay for the transport to the airport because the first desk we stopped at was having problems with their credit card machine.

The rooms are cleaned daily. The rooms and the hotel are designed simply, they are warm, comfy and welcoming. The lobby also has a wonderful area with couches. The beds in the rooms are comfortable. The location for people who eat Kosher is terrific, being a few minutes walk away from local stores and restaurants all Kosher, as well as Supermarkets with Kosher departments in them. The location of the hotel is great as well in the sense that there is a tram and metro that pass very close by and they can get you everywhere. (Most importantly, the city center and the central bus station). If you keep Kosher, the hotel gives a Kosher breakfast (notice that the Kosher area is opposite the non kosher area, so if you see a hog picture, you are not looking at the right foods for you :)). The kosher breakfast is sufficient, but not much more. It includes slices of bread, cut up cucumbers and tomatoes, a boiled egg, slices of yellow cheese, fruit and some spreads (honey, jams, butter etc.). Drinks include juices and coffee/tea. I think that's more or less all. (If you do not keep Kosher, there is a much wider variety of foods for you! I saw muffins of different sorts and all kinds of pastries. Looks good ;).)As this hotel is marked as an ""Express"" hotel, it is aimed for business people and not intended for long stays. Thus, you will not find any closets at all in any of the rooms!!!! (I received this explanation when we arrived and discovered no closets). As we stayed 8 days, it was quite uncomfortable in that aspect. If you come with children, naturally, you will have a lot of things you will need handy...it is hard to keep any order in a room with no closets...(We just kept most of our clothes in the suitcases :( ). There is only a shower in the room (no bath), and the hot water becomes cold every few minutes (only for a few seconds, but still), also the water pressure doesn't seem to stay the same. All this being said - since the staff is so welcoming and the feeling of the hotel so warm and friendly, we did have an excellent stay nevertheless.",4,All in all it was a good place to stay at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d3170495-r501193586-Holiday_Inn_Express_Amsterdam_South-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Devorah S

It was then that we noticed the continuous noise coming from the lift shaft as the lifts went up and down. We contacted reception and requested a room change to a quieter part of the building but were informed that this was not possible due to the usual response that one gets at hotels ""we are fully booked and there is nothing available"".We were quite disappointed at the response.

I booked the hotel at a flexible rate so you normally should expect that you can cancel but only the noon before the day ahead of arriving. I booked after noon the day before so why not showing during the booking that the rates are not flexible anymore? When I arrived four agents were at counter. 2 of them taking care of guests and 2 just sort paper or play Sodoku. No idea. But no attention to the line in front to check and call someone from the backoffice. Check-in time is 15.00 hrs. Normally in other good hotels they check if any room is available earlier. But here not. I am sure they have a screen saver showing say ""Our check-in policy is 15.00 hrs - our check-in policy is 15.00 hrs"". Other would try to check and make a call with the Housekeeping department but not here: ""Our check-in policy is 15.00 hrs"". For the credit card they asked for an authorisation: While plugging in and out the electric power of the credit card reader they tell you: ""Sir: you were to slow when you entered the PIN and confirmed"" and while they say it they pressed reset, pulling out the plug, etc. And if you ask if we can move to a different credit card reader: ""No we cannot. It is working. You were too slow"" (and while they are plugging and out). We should keep our bags with the concierge. So concierge available. So I asked at he front desk (10 m apart) to call concierge: The front desk could see that nobody was there and just make a phone call to a phone which is unattended. I asked them to take care of my parents (handicapped) who should sit there for 90 minutes and they should come to the front desk and ask from time to time to ask for a key. No willingness to help. No need to mention: no concierge helped with my bags. My parents need to carry the bags (incl. mine) all by themselves. I was unfortunately not there when the keys were released. Someone told my parents that we got an upgrade to Executive Rooms incl. Lounge access. But that was anyway the rooms and rate I booked. What kind of fake upgrade. I requested by eUpgrade (against payment) to Junior Suite. But none at the front desk that such a programme exists. So I payed what I ordered and the most helpless front desk (incl. supervisor) but a great hotel, incl. location, food, rooms and parking arrangements if you are willing to walk two blocks which is interesting for someone like me who need occassionally park + sleep + park arrangements. Only 10.00 EUR as hotel-guest who stayed the night before in the hotel. Just wondering why it is a Swiss hotel chain which normally should know how to run Swiss hospitality. Why are in Switzerland the best hotel schools but you cannot find the well trained guys in Swiss hotels?",3,"A great hotel, great location, great rooms, great breakfast BUT...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d601686-r507621114-Movenpick_Hotel_Amsterdam_City_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,HeinBloed

Check in was fairly easy.The room was very large for a European hotel, and our room had a large couch, king bed, a desk and 2 closets. One of the 2 closets was taken by a safe and refrigerator, so that we did not have as much space to unpack as we may have liked. Our room overlooked the harbor and gave impressive views of ships passing through.The room had a flat screen tv with a huge variety of channels and the WiFi was very good and fast.The bathroom was large, withonly a shower, but the shower had good hot water and the water pressure was good.We did have problems with the air-conditioning in the room. We could never get the room as cool as we would have liked, and the lighting and heating/air-conditioning was activated by having a room key in the slot, so I think when we were out the room got warmed back up.We ate at the bar area the first night, service was very slow for the area not being busy. The servers in the bar area did not seem to have assigned tables, and when asked if we wanted an additional drink, we said yes and were forgotten about The bitterballn appetizer and the pizza we had for the main course were good, but expensive for what they were. The breakfast buffet was huge, but the immense selection made it a little chaotic. With so much to choose from, the buffets were typically crowded. That being said, the breakfast was outstanding and everything we had ate was fresh and flavorful.There is a Movenpick ice cream stand in the bar area that servers great ice cream and I highly recommend if you like sweets or ice cream.The location is a little on the outskirts of the city, but getting to city center is an easy 30 minute walk, or you can take the free hotel shuttle, which runs every 30 minutes to the tram station. The tram station is also a 15 minute walk from the hotel.There aren't many immediate eating options outside the hotel in walking distance. We spotted a coffee/sandwich shop, a subway sub shop and a bowling alley/bar on the harbor, but not much else. They also seemed to have limited hours on weekends.I think that if we were to visit Amsterdam again, we would consider the hotel for another stay, if there was nothing comparable price-wise with a location more in the city.",4,Nice hotel with impressive views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d601686-r506407288-Movenpick_Hotel_Amsterdam_City_Centre-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,BergholzTimelord

Reviews were positive and I was very intrigued!The space is always bustling with life and there are more than just students that stay there...lounge areas in the lobby are cozy and active....(there was never a time while I was there that I did not see someone playing ping pong!) I was fortunate to meet a fellow traveler and we ended up touring the city together for the week!I stayed in room 1230...was a deluxe room, I believe, so perhaps it was larger than different rooms?? I can't be sure. On the 12th floor, it is on a corner--had two large windows that overlooked the street (a bit noisy sometimes, even from up there) and had a great view of the city. There is a large support column in the room that makes getting to the window a bit awkward (I know the building used to be a printing place), but that wasn't a big deal. Also, a couple of other room notes:* housekeeping comes every other day*one hand towel and one large towel in my room*shower has no curtain is open and will get the floor a little wet.*look for 3 outlets conveniently near the floor in the base of the bed so you may charge phones as you sleep.*walls are very thin--could hear my neighbor coughing in the next room.*bed was very comfortable.Location is good--4 stops on the Metro and a short walk to the hotel. also, about a 20 minute walk to the Van Gogh/Museum District. I was not feeling brave enough to cycle, but the hotel offers rentals.Breakfast is 14 Euro and I found this to be most disappointing for the price. Selection is adequate, but no hot foods, no eggs, just breads, cold cuts, cheeses, coffee, juice, and yogurt some cereals (didn't see bowls for them, though). Wish I would have tried the place for dinner, but that didn't happen. The bar is nice and casual. Was nice to go later at night for a glass of wine; kind of wish they were open later than midnight.

Beware - it doesn't look much from the outside - but give it a chance and on the inside it's got a cool relaxed (admittedly very studenty) vibe. The decor is much like if Urban Outfitters decided to make a hotel. There's a restaurant/bar/pool table area/gym at your disposal, and everyone gets greeted with a glass of prosecco and a smile from very efficient staff. And of course one of the great things about going to a hotel used to young adults and students is that amenities are presented to you with a smile at any hint that you might need help -i.e. Bus/tram tickets are available to buy from the desk; maps, info and vouchers are laid out for you. The only reasons I gave this 4 stars was because putting the 'wet room' style shower on made the entire bathroom into a swimming pool - which became mildly annoying - and because the options for having breakfast in the morning were pretty poor (tiny muffins, the odd piece of fruit, or a yoghurt if you came very early). The rooms themselves are purely practicality-led. The double beds are huge and comfortable, and there's everything you could possibly need presented in a clean and pleasant environment. However, if you are people who like a luxurious hotel experience as part of your holiday - this isn't for you.

The front desk staff was always friendly and gave some great tips on where to eat and what to do. They also hooked me up with a hair dryer for the duration of my stay. The hotel itself is like a big college dorm with ping pong, pool tables, a TedEx listening pod, and lots of cozy hangout spots on the main floor. The rooms are rather large for Amsterdam (this is my 4th visit to the city and this is by far the biggest room I've had) and though there is A/C it is set to go no lower than 25C (77F). It was not so hot the week we were there so this wasn't a big problem, but sometimes you just need it a bit cooler! The other issue with the room was that there were VERY few electric outlets. There was one by the TV and one in the bathroom, but NONE by the bed - how can this be?! I wonder how students actually live there during the year with only 2 outlets! The bed was mediocre - kind of hard and not all that comfortable, but it was okay for a week. The bigger issue was that the blinds at the big, full wall window had a gap in them and since there was no curtain the sun would come in and blind me in bed early in the morning (which was great I guess since my phone was charging in the bathroom and I didn't always hear the alarm). Breakfast was an additional 19 euro per person so we opted out but I went down for (free) coffee every morning and the buffet looked nice (just not 19 euro pp nice). There is a great little cafe close by called Benji's that has great food and nice people working there. We tended to have breakfast/brunch there in the morning.

I completely understand them charging me for two nights (of three because I was going to arrive there on the third day) but they gave zero leniency and basically told me that if I had booked through the hotel's website that they would've helped me and that I should contact Booking.com, which I did. Booking.Com's response was that they couldn't refund me but the hotel could if they saw fit to do so. When I finally arrived, they had deleted my reservation entirely, likely so that they could book out the room in my absence. I had to wait almost an hour to have my reservation reinstated in the computer system. The young lady that completed the reinstatement of my reservation was the only staff member that was in anyway helpful or kind.

We stayed 2 nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with 6-8 people. So we really appreciated the privacy, cleanliness, and an actual quiet and comfy bed. However, I do have two criticisms that I believe can be easily fixed. Firstly, our room was never cleaned even though we put up the ""please clean our room"" sign. Not a big deal, but just letting you know. Secondly, when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city, we accidentally biked all the way to the Student Hotel Amsterdam West. When we tried to return the bikes we weren't sure why our bikes didn't match the bikes there. I checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at. My boyfriend and I did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel. When I was about to check my email receipt my phone died. But we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel. We started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when I saw that our bikes said Amsterdam City and the other Student Hotel bikes said Amsterdam West. This was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place. It turns out we were quite a ways from our hotel :(So my advice is to specify on the room keys which location guests are staying at.

First the front desk staff is so warm and friendly; and, even though our room wasn't ready took our phone number and offered to call us when it was available. Next, the concierge was incredibly helpful, and offered advice on a great lunch spot plus arranged for us to take small and personalized canal tour (Cruise like a Local) -- it was so much nicer than the big tours. The room is well laid out, and the bed is so comfortable that the only reason you want to get up is to go out and enjoy Amsterdam. Finally, when we were leaving the bellman / luggage person was so helpful. We had 3 large bags and he helped us carry them to the Amsterdam station, plus showed us to the train and explained how to figure out where we were sitting (we still can't thank him enough for all his help).

The place is beautiful, the location perfect, the food delicious, and the staff AMAZING!!

I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the Penthouse suite and my God was it amazing!!! No spoilers....go there and experience it!I took the time to read the not so stellar reviews left here and sure, there may have been a few kinks as is expected with any new establishment. Also, the IHG/Kimpton merger has created some reward program issues that I'm sure will require time to work through. But through my many many Kimpton stays over the past 2-3 years, I have never met a mediocre Kimpton employee. They all behave as though they have a personal investment in the Kimpton establishment.

It also happened to be our anniversary. We were greeted kindly and check in was smooth. I was impressed by the brand new remodel that the hotel just had finished. It was probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. It was fresh and modern. The room we stayed in was a little small, but I didn't mind. I absolutely loved the design and modern touches applied to the rooms. After arrival, we were provided a bottle of champagne with a nice note congratulating us on our anniversary- how thoughtful! The bed was absolutely superb- so cozy and comfortable. Robes were provided and they were very comfortable. One problem we had in general with staying in Amsterdam was the noise! We were so relived with this hotel as it was so so quiet! We slept so well, we almost missed our flight the next day. Room service was good, but I have had better meals.

The hotel was extremely accommodating - they put us close together and made sure the boys had a frosted glass door on their bathroom. We were able to check in early to one of the rooms - helping us feel a lot better.The hotel is quirky with great and unique design features - really fun! The rooms are really comfy - the beds reminded me of the Hypnos beds used by Premier inn - really comfy!! There was a choice of pillows and there's loads of plug sockets, mirrors and lighting. There's a Nespresso machine - and three free pods each day - as well as English blend tea bags, sweeteners, milk and sugar. However if we went back we might bring some of our own pods as we couldn't see any in the local shops. There's also a free spacious safe which gives you good security - really impressive! There are two supermarkets about a ten minute walk away - with a full range of goods to buy, and they're near the tram stop - which takes you into town. We bought a three day pass (about 17 euros each) which gives free travel on trams, buses and the metro. Get the number one to central or the 17 to Anne Franke's house.We ate out - breakfast at the De Vondel Tuin in Vondel Park (20 minute walk) is great and dinner at Beer Oslos was fabulous but I'll do a separate review on those. The pool was lovely and warm - for extra you could get robes and go for sauna and treatments. The Sky Bar was a nice place to have a nightcap - great views over the city. All in all it was a fabulous quirky hotel - we didn't do breakfast as we thought 20 euros each was expensive - our only thought was that the hairdryer lacked a bit of oomph. I didn't use it but if you have longer hair you may want to bring your own.

The room was spotless on arrival and kept that way by housekeeping all week. The reception staff were excellent. Polite and perfect spoken english. Very welcoming and full of information which help us on out trip. The hotel facilities were also excellent. The gym and swimming pool were well maintained and very clean and again kept that way by the cleaning staff.  Access to the center of town was simple using the trams which stopped 5 minutes walf from the hotel. Hop a number 1 or 17 which take you straight to central station.(15 mins ride) Make sure you get an i Amsterdam card as this makes travel and visiting attractions really simple and cheap (look it up). The only negatives were the cost of the breakfast which was 18 euros if booked and 20 on the day. Nice but a bit steep really for what it was (continental/full english buffet) and the cost of drinks in the skybar, whick looked great but we avoided due to the costs. Also avoid getting a room near an ice machine! It makes a lot of noise when filling the metal ice bucket up at midnight! (Who needs ice at midnight!) Room could also do with fridge and not a vending machine like they have. Just a way of making more money im afraid.

From the moment walking in the door they were friendly, attentive and helpful. As we were on our first anniversary which they noted and we later we found chocolates, flowers and a lovely happy anniversary card in our room. They even found us a list of restaurants and then made us a reservation in a local steak house for our anniversary dinner (look out for that review ). The staff do this hotel proud! The hotel it's self was up to standard, the decor was a bit weird but that made no difference. The rooms was lovely with a great shower and bath! Our safe broke, leaving our passports and money trapped inside but the staff were straight on it and it was fixed with a new one installed within hours. Most areas of the hotel are accessed by your room key/tab and this includes the lifts so don't do as my beloved did and forget yours or you may just get stuck in the lift as he did lol. The location of the hotel isn't close to the main square but it is quite easy to get to with a short tram ride but do make sure that you get a travel pass for a few days. The airport is super easy to get to, literally a few stops on the train and then like two stops on the tram. The whole journey took no more than about 30-45mins. We had a spa day within the hotel too and choose to have the couples massage. The atmosphere was as you would expect for a spa however we both had very different experiences of the massage. His was fantastic and mine wasn't bad but it wasn't great! That's just down to the individual therapist. The pool was small, they do a very good job with their online pictures. They also have a sauna, steam room and infra red room. I was greatly impressed, however these comes with an extra €10 cost but that includes robe and slippers if needed. Be warned it's a naked area . Now the sky bar was a great spot for a romantic drink or two but quite small especially if it's busy. This however was the only place within the hotel we thought the staff weren't up to scratch. Overall we would definitely return to this hotel, it met our expectations and exceeded them in some places.",4,Anniversary Getaway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1382766-r503312148-WestCord_Fashion_Hotel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Blessedindeed

The room was nice with a large bed and clean bathroom. Only complaint was quite noisy and you could hear noise from the corridors clearly. The only improvement I'd give would be to provide fridges so that guests can store there own food and drink. The hotel was in a great location. We bought the 3 day pass for both tram and train. The train from the airport was around 10 minutes. We then walked from the station to the hotel which was a 20 minute walk. On our way back we got the tram to the station which was less than 5 minutes. The nearest tram stop was a 5-7 minute walk. Trams were frequent, maximum wait time for us was 8 minutes.

When we first pulled up to the hotel I was a little concerned about the location being right by a main road and seemingly in the middle of no where, but it was absolutely fine.The hotel is tasteful and spotlessly clean. The staff all friendly and helpful but not intrusive at all. The terrace area is absolutely lovely, as is the Skyy bar at the top of the hotel. I have seen some reviews saying that it's a half an hour walk to anything but this isn't the case at all! The tram stop is about a 5min walk away, and as soon as you get to that there's cafes and restaurants around you. Tram into the centre take 10-20mins depending on where you want to go, which was absolutely fine for us because it's a nice way to see the city. Vondelpark is also an easy walk away.There are only three (relatively minor) bad things we could think of. Firstly, the bathroom door for the shower room is glass. this wasn't a problem for us at all since we're a couple, however I can imagine if you are travelling with friends or family it might be a little awkward! The cleaning staff also come into your room before you have answered, which also could prove a little awkward! The final thing was that we found a dirty pair of socks in our room on the second day, which we are sure were not there before! We just found this funny however it did make us wonder how on earth that could happen!!!The room was so big and bright and wonderfully clean (other than the mystery socks!). The bed was absolutely huge and it was so quiet we slept better than we had in ages. They also have a Nespresso machine to make your coffee which my boyfriend was thrilled with!All in all it's a lovely hotel that we would definitely stay at again :)",5,"Lovely, modern hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1382766-r501904023-WestCord_Fashion_Hotel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,MelPB89

They main part of Amsterdam is easily reached by tram or bike. We walked and it was probably abit too long. My only complaint is that they didn't have enough bikes... we tried three days in a row to hire bikes and they were sold out each time.

I booked four rooms for a hen party and the location is fab. It is about a 4 minute walk to the station and for €12 you can get a 48 hour pass which you can use for trams, metro and buses. Grab Tram 4 to city centre, or Metro 51. No changes, just jump on! The hotel has a lovely breakfast too which I recommend is well worth doing, although there is a supermarket round the back of hotel. Italian Restaurant called Happy Italy is right next door for a nice meal too. the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and everything was so clean and new. My friends also loved the hotel, especially the drinks menu in the bar which was so good for the money. Cocktails for €6 - yes please! the hotel was not in any way rowdy either. Just a lovely big hotel with all you need. I don't want to fault anything as there is no need, but just to let people know, there is not a kettle or tea in the room.

The ride to the centre takes 15 minutes and trains go frequently. RAI station is only two stops from Schiphol Airport. Our comfort room was sufficiently spacious with two large floor-to-ceiling windows, very comfy bed and the usual Motel One bathroom (now featuring cosmetic tissues, magnifying mirrors will be introduced chain-wide until end of 2017). As always with Motel One there were no closets, just a few hangers and shelves, but that was ok for our three-night stay. The room (417) was very clean so far, but the windows and the upper part of the leather headboard weren't. A very annoying thing: the elevators have just a call button on upper floors, which means you can't indicate if you want to go up or down wthich leads to many unnecessary stops of the already crowded elevators.Breakfast was of high quality with many local Dutch items. As usual with Motel One it was served in the bar lounge area, meaning sitting pretty cramped, sometimes at low lounge table, sometimes on bar stools.That said, we nevertheless enjoyed the stay very much and will happily return as we can't think of a better (affordable) alternative.",5,Probably the best Price-Performance Ratio in Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d8126580-r503511695-Motel_One_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,JanBerlin

Pre-arrival contact was very courteous and helpful, as on initial booking, the site informed me that i would be getting a ground floor room. I contacted the hotel to request an room on an upper level with a balcony to get a bit of a view, and I had asked for a couple of extra little romantic decorations in the room and champagne to make arrival that little bit sweeter, and they certainly delivered.Travel from Schiphol Airport to Centraal Station was really easy on the train, this took about half hour, and we decided to walk to the hotel to get a bearing on the areas as we only had handluggage, this took half an hour, but there are buses and trams which will get you there faster. Centraal is busy and a little hectic, but as we got nearer to the hotel it quietened down alot. The hotel is situated in the Oud-West area, right on the outer canal ring and our room overlooked the street and waters edge through a little french balcony. Location wise, it was great. Though we were on a semi busy road, the area was tranquil and calm, and very pretty. Garvey checked us in and one other staff member out, both were really friendly and helpful. He hinted that we had got an upper floor room and our little requests, and when we walked it it was a lovely surprise. They had decorated the bed with rose petals and provided a little bottle of chilled prosecco with two glasses and chocolates. Not sure if this is for all guests, but our tea, coffee, and fridge contents in the room was complimentary for our stay, which was really generous.The room was clean, spacious, bright and luxurious, we were both very pleased with it. Bed was enormous and very comfortable. There was an aircon to make things a bit more comfortable on hot nights. Bathroom shower was spacious and pressure was spot on. Curtains totally blocked out the light for sleeping in.Travel into the main city was easy, the hotel is very well located for easy access to boat trips along the canal, trams, and buses from Leidseplein (literally a 10 min walk). Where you can find tons of restaurants, shops, and cafes. Its 10 mins from Vondelpark, and Oud-Zuid the museum district.Tips for places we enjoyed were the Carousel for breaky (waffles and pancakes), the canel cruise which you can book and board about 5 mins from the hotel. Pub Aran and Hardrock Cafe are just opposite the canal cruise booking office/port, if you are early go here for a quick beer or coffee, and overlook the waterway. Stop at the hundreds of cafe's by the canals to people watch and take in the city ambiance, we did at dozens and was extra fun in red light district. Visit a street foodies dream at the Foodhallen (like a posh Borough market), Artis Zoo for a never ending labyrinth of animals and gardens and the interactive Micropia exhibition, then go to the Amsterdam Borrl Kitchen just opposite for burger. Amsterdam tulip museum for gifts to bring back home (America friendly exports too). Make sure you see the city at night, go to Rijksmuseum at night for extra cool pictures of the IAmsterdam sign. There's tons of places to discover and explore, dont take the trams everywhere, walk if you can. get a travel card at Centraal for easy city travel, if your planning on seeing lots of museums and exhibitions and have the time and a plan, get the IAmsterdam card.",5,Everything was perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d6509723-r508655185-377_House_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,gericka

Then the desk person said if we paid $50 extra for the room, 1 room could be ready. We were tired so we agreed, then miraculously both our rooms were ready.

It took them a few days to clean it and even then it was quite stained. Management should either deep clean it or replace it before they rent out this room again.( I meant to talk to the manager about the rug but by the time I got around to it he was out and wouldn't be back till after we left. He struck me as someone who would have been very responsive to our complaint.)The beds though comfortable, didn't even approximate a double-- as in most hotels in Europe-- it was 2 singles pushed together, but what was unusual was there was no pad over both to in any way connect them and they were separately made up with individual single sheets and tucked in etc. The hotel staff and policy didn't seem concerned about recycling or the environment. I had to ask if they recycled paper etc. and bring it down separetly. And I ended up hiding towels we had used just a few times so that the housekeepers wouldn't take them to be laundered and bring fresh ones. I suggest that there be a sign in the room about recycling and a place for recycling and a note that if you want fresh towels to put any you want replaced on the bathroom floor as there is in most hotels conscious about the environment.In spite of these issues which need improvement, there was plenty to like about JL76. We appreciated the quiet of our room even though it was very near the elevator, and the black out curtains which amply blocked the light from waking us up in the a.m. We enjoyed the great coffee maker and excellent coffee that was provided in the room, the fluffy bathrobes and large towels were lovely. The garden out back was charming, and the beds comfortable. The TV in the jacuzzi was fun.The best feature of JL76 though, was the  reception staff, in particular Andre and Iris O. They were: friendly, very helpful, warm and both were fun with a sense of humor. They made us feel welcome.

This boutique hotel's location is wonderful, on the canal side in a quieter area of the city, but only a few minutes walk from some great restaurants, the tram at Westmarkt and just around the corner are the canal cruise boats. The hotel is located in two beautiful, old buildings about a minutes walk apart, not a problem, plenty of umbrellas provided to cope with any showers. What makes this hotel stand out from all the others are the staff who are brilliant, efficient, courteous and ever helpful, they even remember your name and the drink you ordered the previous night in the bar. Staff are an hotels most important asset and this hotel is rich in them.We had a room in the annex building, on the first floor, overlooking the canal. The double glazing kept it quiet and the aircon cool. The stairs are very steep as you would expect but there is a lift if needed. The room was a good size, perfectly clean and interestingly decorated. We had a Jacuzzi bath in the room which was wonderful and relaxing and could be curtained off, also separate shower. Great Nespresso coffee maker, free to use or kettle for tea. didn't watch TV but the wifi connection was very fast. The highlight was the extremely comfortable bed, with a topper, great sleep. Breakfast is served in the main building in another beautifully decorated, high ceilinged room which also houses the bar at one end. The breakfast manager and staff were again excellent, good choice of buffet breakfast and hot food to order, extra coffee offered. In the early evening or late at night the bar is a relaxing joy to spend some time in, they mix a good gin and tonic. At the back of the main building there is a garden/terrace area to sit and enjoy after a long day exploring the city.We drove to Amsterdam but I would advise against taking your car in to the city, parking is difficult and very expensive, however there are a few spaces outside the hotel. We left our car in the Park and Ride and took the tram in, it was on a couple of minutes walk from tram stop to the hotel. Return tram ticket 5 euros and as you have combined public transport with parking the car park fee was 40 euros for 72 hours.I would recommend The Toren to everyone wanting a nice, relaxing stay, you will be well looked after, I think it would be hard to find a better place in Amsterdam",5,Perfection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d229137-r508023461-The_Toren-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,melh13

What still amazes me is how quiet the hotel area was Big City and Quiet usually do not go together but in this magical location it happens.The Staff were so helpful and nice. They really made us feel special and offered great advice in regard to restaurants and activities. We were there during the 4th of July and we received a free cocktail to celebrate the USA. The special cocktails are excellent especially the gin and tonic. There is a courtyard behind the hotel that is a nice place to relax outdoors.

Once we were checked in and parked, the bartender walked us to our room (in a separate building a bit down the street) to tell us all the benefits of the hotel and instruct us on everything we needed to know about the room; he was most charming and personal, and did not leave before he was assured that we were satisfied with our room. The room was nicely sized and decorated seductively, with genuinely comfortable beds and a very nice and modern bath/shower. We especially loved the outdoor garden and intimate feel of the hotel. Though I am not sure whether it was part of their duties, the three bartenders we met were keenly aware of what people generally needed at the hotel and quick to make sure that guests were looked after in every way. My only criticism of the hotel was the check in process, which left me ignored and waiting for too long while the staff answered phones and ordered taxis. It should be noted that there is no designated place to unload, leaving guests to utilize an illegal spot and risk being ticketed. Overnight parking is either on the street (if you are lucky enough to find it) for 45 € per day, with a valet service that the hotel will phone for you at 35€ per day or in a garage that is a 15 minute walk away for 25 € per day.

Located on one of the main canals with a great view of Amsterdam's historical architecture, the location was near-perfect...close (easy walking distance) to quite a few attractions, sites and shopping, plus city transportation hubs. Food in the restaurant was the best we had in the city, exceeded only by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Our room (indeed all rooms as far as we could tell) was spacious, comfortable and beautifully appointed. Like most buildings of old Amsterdam, the layout is somewhat up & down and stairwells are narrow and often circular, so care is advised and proximity to the elevators is helpful.

The setting is beautiful, the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms are all full of character.The only issue this time was access to room 68. My wife has some mobility issues and so we were shocked to see the access was up a tiny spiral staircase. It was our fault as we know the hotel has lots of small steps and two lifts - but we never thought to mention my wife's problems when we booked and we hadn't come across this staircase in earlier stays. If you have similar walking issues please ensure you inform the staff when booking or you may find yourself in room 67 or 68. The hotel was fully booked - as it often is - so changing the room once you arrive is not a practicable option. The other initial disappointment was the lack of a kettle and tea/coffee facilities. However this was quickly rectified by the hotel - but it was odd it wasn't there already. Our luggage had fortunately been taken to our room for us up the stairs - so that was a bonus. The advantage of the room was as it is so high, it was completely quiet at night and the air-conditioning kept it just right - but we could also open some windows and it was still quiet.The room was very clean when we arrived and the hotel had thoughtfully given me a wonderful bottle of Red Wine as I was 60 during our stay. A really nice touch. Over the 5 nights we were there though the room became a little dusty and dirty. My wife said you could tell it was a man doing the cleaning just by the attention to detail. A shame but it didn't spoil our stay.When we caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel on our first day we were lucky enough to ride in an electric taxi - a Tesla. This made us feel quite special. At the hotel we mentioned this to the staff and they said the Tesla taxis are really popular now and they could book us one at the end of our trip as well. We took them up on that and the most amazing car arrived straight out of Bond film. The gull wing doors lifted and the inside was pure white leather. When we arrived at the airport and the doors opened everyone gasped and stared. We felt like real film stars arriving for our flight in a completely silent car. The absolute best €44 we spent all weekend!The only other point was the music in the library bar. I read they are trying for a Jazz feel but the music was so mournful and depressing it spoiled our time in the beautiful bar. I have never liked Jazz but our son, who met us in the city from Frankfurt, does but even he said the music was horrid. Sorry Ambassade - but this is the main thing that lets you down. Even other nationalities in the bar we spoke to said they didn't like the music - so it isn't just us. Overall we enjoyed our 5 nights with you.

Everything touristy in walking distance (30min radius). The canal view room was tastefully decorated and a good size. The bed was comfortable. The large windows opened to a beautiful view. The housekeeping was excellent-our room was spotlessly cleaned every day. The library area was a nice quiet place to have a drink. The main negatives came from our first encounters checking in and the subsequent 5 days. There have been very good reviews about the staff so it was confusing to us to have such a cool reception. The staff was distracted, even though there was only one other person at the desk, they overlooked us, then when they did serve us, they were not very hospitable. We kindly asked for a recommended barber but were given the name of a hairdresser they thought might do shaves. That seemed odd to us. They said they would book it and get back to us and did neither. My husband researched his own barber and found a good one within 5 min walking distance. Shouldn't they know these things? The interactions with the desk staff were disappointing. We've had lovely service at the Four Seasons and we thought a smaller boutique hotel would be just as good. We wanted that more intimate experience over 5 days and were disappointed. The last night, there was a female attendant who was warm and helpful while the other younger male attendants continued to stand around looking distracted and uninterested. Honestly! Other tips:Travel with smaller suitcases (we were glad we did!). The elevator is quite small and there are steps. There were a few kids at the hotel but it's not really family oriented.

After a recent visit the first week of July, I wonder why we stayed elsewhere. This is truly a magical place, and the magic begins once you make contact with some of the best staff anywhere. They will not only advise you on the best room for your needs, but they will also make reservations at restaurants and provide directions to wherever you plan to visit. The Ambassade is located along one of the most impressive canals and those rooms overlooking the Herrengracht will indeed be rewarding. Our room overlooked the canal but was also quiet. Breakfasts are a combination of buffet items and hot items made to order. At night this room becomes the Brasserie featuring dishes with a French touch.Some canal house hotels can indeed be musty and dark. Not the Ambassade with its sparkling interior and comfortable furnishings. A rarity here is an elevator to service some of the floors and rooms. If you have mobility issue, be sure to ask for a room near the elevator.We walked frequently to a vibrant section of town called Spui (ask a local how to pronounce it!) and has many restaurants and charming squares and streets.

The location was absolutely perfect for everything. On arrival we were given room 10 which despite being quite big, was very dark (I am partially sighted) with a view out onto the street. There was no noise as the room must have been sound proofed but it was the darkness I didn't like. Went straight to Reception and the room was changed for 302, which despite being smaller than the first, was light and airy with a canal view. Perfect and thank goodness it was changed. The bed was amazingly comfortable and so were the pillows - normally when I go abroad I tend not to sleep too well but I did at Banks Mansion. I also kept referring to it as home which is a great accolade as normally hotels aren't like that. The breakfast was great and a perfect way to start the day. Fresh eggs etc cooked to order, pancakes, fruit, yoghurt, meat, cheeses, bread etc and copious amounts of tea/coffee and fresh orange juice. I loved the cheese and saucisson at 5pm - a lovely little pick me up before heading out for the evening. The hotel is central to everything and we were amazed that a 5 minute walk got us to Rembrandt Square and pretty much everything else. We loved getting in after a hard days sightseeing and being able to have a hot chocolate enjoyed with a waffle that had been left in our room. The shower was wonderful and fresh products left in the bathroom every day if you had used them. My husband and I would now not stay anywhere else but Banks Mansion if we are to visit Amsterdam again. Somebody had listed about noise but as a very noise sensitive person, this wasn't an issue. If you shut your windows and put the air con on, it was no problem at all. Loved, loved, loved this place. Thank you Banks Mansion for a truly memorable trip. Oh and I wish we had been drinkers because there is a free bar and you just help yourselves. We saw quite a few tiddly people who had obviously taken full advantage of this. This hotel is one of a kind.",5,A wonderful stay at Banks Mansion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d230616-r503799586-Banks_Mansion-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,lainey1965

Not until AFTER we left the city did they even inform us that they were able to finally resell 3 nights of the 8 (on a busy summer weekend?) yet didn't even refund us fully for those they re-sold.

There was four of us between two rooms. My brother and I had a corner room on the first (European, not American, first) floor, and my parents were directly above us. Our room did not include an Air Conditioner, but we had plenty of openable windows, and doors out onto a small shared balcony. It's on a nice side street, just a block over from the Van Gogh museum, and another next to it, and very close to the Rijks and the Canals. There is a Tram stop just around the block for the tram from the airport.We arrived in the morning, and got to the hotel before noon. They had my parents' room ready, and let us check in and go up. The room my brother and I shared was ready within half an hour. It was comfortable, clean and the bathroom was in excellent shape. My only concern was the staircase... The building is an older one, and is narrow and curved. It's very stable, and has good banisters, but if you're at all scared of heights, it may be unnerving. They do have a little elevator, so you don't have to haul your luggage up and down the stairs at all!Do note that there IS a school and daycare nearby, so there will be children playing, during the daytime. I did not find, however, that there was problems with the noise when I was trying to sleep!We were greeted by the father of the owner, who assisted us with our luggage. He was often there during the day, and provided information and assistance. He also made the fresh pancakes that came with the breakfast... Utterly delicious! The breakfast has standard breakfast buffet staples (Scrambled eggs, bacon, cereals, etc) that are well made and tasty. They also have an epic coffee machine that, if you don't read Dutch, might take some assistance to use but provides VERY good coffee options. And back to the pancakes. Thin, somewhat similar to crepes, but so very good. Not a low fat food, they have a lot of butter, but it's worth the calories!All told, my two nights at Hotel Fita were lovely.

We chose wisely. Upon our early arrival, we were met by a lovely young woman who checked us in and acquainted us with Amsterdam. The map and her accompanying details about how to get around and what to visit made us feel immediately comfortable with the city. When we returned that evening, we found our room to be fantastic! We had asked for a large double, and it was large! And clean and included everything we could possibly need, even an ironing board that slid into its hiding place. Breakfast was great. Lots of yummy choices with delicious pancakes at the end.We had a one block walk to the Van Gogh Museum and a pleasant walk through the park to the Rijksmuseum. There were at least two other art museums within three blocks, too. The tram, which we rode everywhere, stopped within the block, too. One block in the opposite direction was a street filled with high-end shops and cute places to eat. Getting dinner was more difficult than lunch because most of the restaurants/cafes closed by 6:00, which I think might be because this is a museum district, and the museums close by 6:00, too.The owners and staff are absolutely lovely. You can tell this is more than a job for them; they truly enjoy talking to each visitor and look for ways to make them feel at home.

No other luxury hotel in Amsterdam offers that combination. Service is impeccable. We arrived before check-in time on a flight from Chicago, and were warmly welcomed by the manager and staff. They apologized for not having a canal view room for us, but made sure to accommodate my preferences of high floor, away from elevator. Indeed, we were assigned a top floor room at the corner of the building, and in the wing that was not covered in scaffolding. Our room was incredibly spacious for a standard room in a European hotel. The decor is very old fashioned, but well maintained and luxurious. There were 2 spacious closets, 2 windows that could be opened, and plenty of space for my mother and I to relax. Although we were on the courtyard side of the hotel, we could still see a canal from our windows, so that was a nice surprise. The bathroom was also old fashioned, but undeniably luxurious. Having a separated WC was essential in choosing the IC. The separate shower in our bathroom had natural light also. Despite the age of the hotel, I was impressed by the condition and features, especially the rain shower. The only disappointment was the lack of handy electric outlets.When we first got to our room, we noticed that one of the twin beds had a wobbly leg. I tried to fix it, but couldn't. When we finished getting ready and headed downstairs for a light breakfast, we asked the duty manager to take a look. She was genuinely horrified to learn about the wobbly bed, and when we returned to our room, it had been completely fixed.As for food and beverage, we had breakfast at the cafe, afternoon tea, dinner at La Rive, breakfast at La Rive, and also room service breakfast. Although expensive, everything was superb. I enjoyed the indoor pool on a couple of occasions. It was undoubtedly the most pleasant part of my stay. Have a swim after a day of sightseeing is an incredible luxury, especially with the fresh fruit, coffee, tea, and snacks available poolside. It was never crowded, and I was always able to spread out on a lounge chair overlooking the pool and the Amstel.But really, at a hotel of this caliber, you are paying for the service, and this IC does not disappoint. Every single staff member was genuinely kind and helpful and charming. We are especially grateful to Aad the lead concierge for giving us great advice. I honestly don't know when he gets any rest!The only potential downside for staying here is the location, as it is just outside of the Canal Ring. The walk to the major sights is incredibly attractive and pleasant, but you are definitely not going to be in the center of the action. That's the way I like it, and the neighborhood is lovely, with a wonderful square in front of the hotel.",5,Old fashioned excellence,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d190614-r508778364-InterContinental_Amstel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,pocmonster

The shower leaked on the bathroom floor so we needed a towel to stop the floor getting wet. Small windows (very small) with a beautiful view of a drain pipe. We had to shuffle things around and put things on the floor in order to use the kettle to make a drink. On the up side the valet was really helpful allowing us to park on the front whilst checking in. We complained about the room and were told that we would not be charged for the mini bar ( we had only had nuts and Pringles) but on arriving home they have been charged. This was a special treat for my partner - the room cost over £300 which I was happy to pay but unfortunately just it didn't feel like a treat and also didn't feel like value for money. Also on the corridor we were on there was a funny smell - but there was a sign saying apologies for building work - staff were pleasant but overall for a 5 star hotel was really disappointed !,2,Disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d189387-r505944171-Pulitzer_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,Carlton5566

Room 413 is two floors higher up in the cupola with a very small balcony but relatively large interior and a superb view. Office staff-- very helpful and considerate. Manager could not be nicer.
