this is difenitely the hotel to base oneself in for a visit to barcelona situtated in the shadow of the city ancient cathederal the hotel is an integral part of the gotic quarter step out the door and one is immiedately into the maze narrow streets and alleys some not even wide enough for a vehicle that make up the barcelona of old these medieval streets mostly pedestrianised are lined with cafes taverns resturants and of course tapas bars and often lead into unexpected squares where have room for outdoor tables or on to the ramblas barcelona most famous street itself which is only a short distance from the hotel is very modern inside i suspect recent refurbishment and the staff are very friendly and helpful and the room is compact but boasts a decent bathroom with a very good shower our room had a large balcony complete with table and chairs and even a despite being right beside the cathederal we were never disturbed by a single bell and the was argueably the quietest i ever encountered in a hotel room the only tiny we encountered was that the room balcony was accessed by a very steep portable step this might pose a challange to anyone with mobility issues but the rest of the hotel was well provided with ramps lifts etc and only the top floor rooms have balconys buffet breakfast was excellent and included in the quite reasonable price absolutely recommend hotel gotico,1.0
very pleasant and friendly staff and great central on top floor unit on roof was noisy at night no facilities which you would expect for this caliber of hotel rooms a bit small,1.0
three of us stayed in a junior suite very comfortably for nights the hotel and rooms have quality fittings and are modern and stylish housekeeping maintained the room very well complimentary water and coffee in room room overlooked via laietana and windows opened we liked the roof top bar and pool although the pool is only to dip your toes did not eat breakfast as there are so many options on the street for coffee etc at a fraction of the price reception staff are professional but not warm eg rarely greeted us when we came and went we did however get early checkin which was nice an enjoyable story stay overall,1.0
i am a fan of room mate hotels and can not rave enough about the high standards of customer care the room mate emma offers the rooms are modern and clean the beds hard and the sheets white and crisp the pillows were a little hard for my liking but that minor the bathrooms are glorious modern and outfitted with the best and most plumbing fixtures the shower head was divine i would suggest more lighting in the rooms especially by the bed breakfasts are great and well worth the price the reception is which was a blessing especially when my flight arrived at the front desk team is passionate and quite knowledgeable they knew everything there was to know about barcelona obtaining tickets restaurants and things to do in and around the city had it not been for their suggestion i would have discovered the quaint beach town of sitges which was a perfect place to spend the day patricio mar christina and pilar were great but special kudos to issac who helped me with my original reservation in february and was at the desk to personally greet me with open arms i will return to barcelona and to the room mate emma as well thank you all for a wonderful stay in your beautiful hotel and city,1.0

hotel stay was well priced and is very convenient to transportation hotels are very expensive in amsterdam and this hotel was the best value i found it very but had what we needed it was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful,1.0
we had an issue with payment checking in and even though we had the money and sorted it in the meantime staff were incredibly rude and laughing at us in dutch not knowing i a fluent speaker no food facilities and area is barren other than a small spar supermarket and sloterdijk hotel could have been cleaner but overall would recommend if it was for the terrible customer service,0.0

we stopped for a drink during the day whilst walking around and went back in the evening just to watch the irish dancing and listen to the music friendly place large area so plenty of seating and was an enjoyable evening better than being on temple bar area which is much busier and more rowdy,1.0
was not sure what to expect when we booked this directly from the quirky website but we were not disappointed the reason to pick this hotel was part price part location and part the unexpected hotels in amsterdam unless you want to share facilities and sleeping areas are extremely expensive in comparison to other hotels of a similar standard this place was great value if you dont mind a short walk to the trams or using the metro which is just outside then this place is great services are regular and cheap to use and get you to all the main hotspots across amsterdam the hotel itself is a glorious mix of the unusual the strange the unique and that is just the staff the place clearly has an idea about the vibe they are trying to achieve and do it very successfully,1.0
we love staying at the fitzwilliam when we stay in dublin mainly for concerts time we stayed for one night whilst seeing wish it could have been hotel is so stylish and comfortable from the prosecco on arrival to pillow chocolates every nice touch is there including an umbrella great rooms and is superb such friendly staff ca wait to return,1.0

i was staying several nights in the hotel it was great the best experience was contributed by the consultor concierge name keirn he was helpful and kind and he made my staying much much better is an asset to the hotel and i will sure come back because of only thing i did like was the bad behavior and very in kind of the reception stuff called evagilad,1.0
i have expectations as a diamond hilton member but this hotel exceeded even those let start with check in i was recognized as a diamond member and they insisted on an upgrade unlike the waldorf in rome that would rather charge euros for a martini the room with a view was awesome and i recommend it to everyone it was a surprise that was unexpected the best part however was the best executive lounge ever most hiltons have eli i aged this perk but this hilton upped the ante happy hour between to gives you not just extensive snacks but beer and wine and hard alcohol in a town that expects euros for breakfast this is an oasis in the crowd keep this up hilton you have reinvigorated my reason to be a hilton member,1.0
we stayed here nights over two rooms the rooms were fine although one had a musty smell that room also had some noise from adjoining rooms my right i was quiet and clean it is very close to the parliament building so we easily saw the changing of the guards and it is a short walk to the plaka area it is an easy walk to the acropolis too as long as you do get lost in the winding streets the top floors have a good view of the acropolis breakfast is up there on the floor i would say suggest booking the floors to if you want a room view the lower floors have terrible views fortunately for me i do not travel to sit in a room and look outside i am only there at night and do mot care,1.0
nice clean room a bit small but has almost everything you needexcellent location minutes walk to placa catalunya and has carrefour right in is good and good ac in the roomgood bathroom with nice walk in shower and good daily room negative issues are the lack of a mini bar as well as a adequate space for clothe and luggage,1.0

we booked very last minute and it was wonderful that they had room for us excellent staff lovely building the last minute deal was off but the room they gave us was far in the noisy back and not worth the price we paid for it better to stay in the wing and closer to the front to avoid the hostel noise,1.0

soundproofing is one of the most important criteria in our book and we were very happy with this hotel our alarm clock was just about the only thing that disturbed our mornings we know we had a neighbor on at least one side but we never heard a thing also virtually no noise from the hallway housekeeping is very quiet and professional the hotel is very new and everything is still nice and shiny really gorgeous bathroom space for clothes is rather tight but that about the only small issue we had we had a room with a partial view of the canal and loved having coffee there in the morning also beautiful views at night definitely worth the extra money,1.0
rooms are not grand had an executive canal view room which was small bathroom tiny so had to shower in the bath other than that the lounge and location and staff made it a very pleasant stay will for sure be back,1.0

i booked this hotel based on the relative closeness to airport and that they advertised that they offered airport shuttles be careful these are limited as i found out positive notes lovely girl on reception very friendly but she was a trainee and had to keep going off and asking questions this meant a less than speedie i had already been up travelling for several hours and just wanted to get into my room it was now late afternoon the apartment block was in a separate building across the street very very spacious apartment bedroom even though i only booked a bed very different in terms of a lot of black so it seemed quite dark the bathroom was all black tiling and very poor lighting excellent shower but it did leak all over the floor the kitchen was weird in that even though it had a microwave etc there was no cutlery or plates so even if i had managed to find somewhere to buy food i had nothing to eat it the internet was very poor and could get a connection at all phoned reception for assistance they said they send someone calls later and plus now getting very frustrated a lovely guy finely came got me connected using an staff access he escorted me back down to the main bar area where i got a couple of glass of wine and me again via a staff internet access restaurants close by and as a single female traveling,1.0
this is a clean but basic little hotel that offers excellent value for money given its central location the highlight is the roof terrace from which to have a spectacular view of the acropolis recommeded,1.0

ideal location for arena events next to station short train ride to airport and short metro ride to central amsterdam plenty of choices for complimentary breakfast luggage room was very useful,1.0
the hotel is in a great location it is right by the plaza de catalunya and close distance to la rambla street we joined the viator day tour and it was a short mins to walk to the gathering point musee de la musica and mins from where they left you la pedrera where along the way we did great shopping my son was asking for soccer jersey and if you do want to pay euros for the official stuff then the street vendors on the plaza late at the night is the way to got the room with the swimming pool on the balcony i was a bit disappointed to find out that it was a jacuzzi at first and it was too cold to use it the first day but the day was hot and after a long day it was a good place to wind down at the roof top and chill the key is to use the pool while the sun is still hitting the balcony before in july part that impressed us the most is the customer service by the reception staff there was a taxi strike from to on our last day and we needed to get to the airport at for our early flight the staff suggested cabify at first spain version of uber but my husband was cautious and wanted a plan b lo and behold when we tried cabify at it did work could locate a driver when we talked to,1.0
we stayed at the shelbourne again because we love the historical old place and it location our suite overlooked stephen green a more lovely view would be hard to find the staff is always friendly and the no lounge is a very popular place for drinks,1.0

the location is good but the services are very poor the air conditioning was not functioning only in our room the smell in the bathroom was awful the receptionist told us we will have the ac repaired but it remained the same for days so they told us to just open the window the cleaning service was very poor,0.0
we stayed at the electra palace in june beautiful property the man at the front desk went out of his way to make our stay the best possible with a double upgrade on our room the rooftop restaurant has a spectacular view of the acropolis however the food was pretty third rate and over priced hence the out of review,1.0
have stayed at the merrion on four different occasions now and every time has been a truly five star experience every thing is smooth from arrival to departure have stayed in different rooms between the garden wing and the main house and although they have been different in size and amenities each have been luxurious with everything you need for a comfortable stay have dined in the cellar restaurant during each stay and have always found the food to be excellent and beautifully presented looking forward to when restaurant is moved to first floor so garden views can be enjoyed while dining the staff are always most pleasant and courteous and attend to your every is one of our most favorite hotels and we ca help going back again and again looking forward to our next stay hopefully soon,1.0

when we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed in an exceptionally friendly manner by the staff and as we were proceeding to our room our luggage was being carried for us the proper way the room was exactly what we hoped for because it looked rather old and the bathroom was really the bath and shower were what i would call marvellous nevertheless we slept rather well the lobby itself was absolutely stunning as it was decorated with beautiful mosaics but still looked very modern on the rooftop one has an absolutely breathtaking view on the acropolis of athens and the restaurant there is one i can really we had a very pleasant stay,1.0
absolutely fantastic experience staying with my young son at hotel claris check was simple and all staff members were very attentive our room was perfect and the amenities were great we took advantage of the pool daily where we appreciated the views service and free available towels the terrace restaurant was great location was ideal tonnes of nearby with a walk to placa catalunya or sagrada familia great shopping very close by as well as a few markets for whatever essentials you may absolute best part of hotel claris was use of a phone that acted as my personal hot spot which allowed me to go by my day as if i was still at home emails phone calls etc this is something i never experienced at any hotel before and it was much appreciated,1.0
the location of this hotel is very good it very close to temple bar area and many other attractions the rooms are big and clean the beds are comfortable breakfast could have more options the thing that really bothered me was that i could hear a tram every few minutes and it really annoying in a whole if you are not sensitive to noises as i am i would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
we stayed for four nights great breakfast and nice rooms some noice from the rambla and also from adjacent rooms price to match the location but after all price was meters to liceau metro station and also bus to the beach,1.0

nice hotel completely ruined by a pretentious and overly noisy music pool area so bad we left the hotel during the day for peace and quiet at the public beach as the music was clearly heard in room great location and apart from noise the rooms were good as well,1.0
whilst not in the most salubrious of locations the stanley is right for the price our spacious room was one of the refurbished rooms and it was very clean comfortable and quiet the front desk staff are efficient and very welcoming providing top notch personal service to all guests despite how many check ins they were dealing with commendable unfortunately i did really get the same vibe from the roof top bar of variety and choices in the buffet breakfast served in the sun filled livingston room and there seemed to be a greek barista on hand to personalise your coffee order so great start to the handy to the metro and there a bakery conveniently located on the corner downstairs if you looking for a clean economical hotel and not too fussed with location you ca go wrong with the stanley,1.0
this hotel is in a fantastic location right on fleet street in the busy temple bar area and near all of the main tourist locations however when you enter into the lobby it feels serene and calm away from the hustle and bustle the free coffee tea and newspapers in reception meant that we spent a bit of time chilling out in the cosy lobby something we never do the room was basic but clean with a comfy bed and large tv the reason this review missed out on stars is that our room was so hot even with the fan on which is provided and the windows open it was still stuffy and both myself and my partner woke up sweating it was not a particularly hot evening either we noticed that the mini bar gives off an awful lot of heat which i think is the main cause as to why the rooms are stuffy massive shame especially as the hotel is based in a busy area so having to open the windows let in a lot of street noise back to the positives the breakfast was amazing so much choice and very tasty the reception staff were all very in all we will definitely come back to this hotel if we are in dublin again as it does make a wonderful base for adventures around dublin just a shame about the temperature of the bedrooms,1.0
all very good but parking is horrible expensive euro for days even as it is valet parking and i also think the breakfast is too expensive the rest is a good package in a perfect location would recommend,1.0
hotel was very clean staff were all extremely helpful could do enough for the breakfast was excellent and the cheeses were hotel i have stayed were spacious and very well equipped bed was large and comfortableall alcohol in the lounge was free as much as you want also take up to your room,1.0
my girlfriend and i stayed at this hotel for nights during a short break to barcelona the hotel was in an excellent location just minutes from la rambla and minutes from place de catalunya lots of shopping bars and restaurants nearby and also close to lots of sightseeing opportunities lovely and clean with an amazing smell to the hotel they must blow something through the aircon but it was a treat to walk into each and every time friendly staff and absolutely gorgeous decor and construction i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone,1.0

nice new renovated rooms corridors and cleaning service excellent nice breakfast good value for money nice helpfull staff nice location walking distance from plaka and ancient athens the hotel is recomdnded,1.0
stayed for days with family the breakfast was good with a good spread the only disappointing fact was that the spread remained absolutely the same for all the days the hotel is a good minutes walk to plaka or a cab for euros or minutes walk to the nearest metro station the rooms were spacious with an extra bed for our little one the room service was very good the pool was nice the coffee lounge vienna was very nice overall a pleasant stay however the only regret was that i could manage a table in the roof top restaurant despite having tried on two different nights tried the guest relations if they could help but could thought a star hotel should have a mechanism to find a way to get a table for their guests who stays for days,1.0
the hotel itself is just as you see in the pictures and is in a great central location for visiting all historic places we were very glad we chose this hotel what stood out to us though was the incredible staff that helped with every minor detail and any minor concern we actually had a child get sick on the trip and the staff was fantastic they got us to a local doctor that spoke english had all transportation arranged for us and then found a pharmacy open on a sunday and arranged a car to take me to and from the pharmacy the driver even came in to help as google translate and myself were doing a poor job the driver translated for me got the medicine for my child and took me back to the hotel the rest of the week the doormen asked my daughter how she was and watched after us what an amazing group of people and what an unmatched level of service the amount of languages spoken by the staff was also impressive michael the doorman is one of the nicest people we have encountered in our travels thank you for everything and for going above and beyond,1.0
everything you need perfect location centre of city and near railway station friendly welcoming helpful staff rooms perfect temperature all comforts kitchette with proper coffee maker and refrigerator the bathroom is stocked with hairdryer and most toiletries there was also a large bottle of water with glasses provided upon arrival in room and every night when the housekeepers turned down the beds they left little gifts of toiletries on bed,1.0

this is an upscale marriott and a delight in most ways the bellmen and lobby concierge were personable and very helpful sorry i ca remember their names but they were great to interact with we checked in at am coming off a river cruise of course a room was ready which was no problem but when i asked to make sure we were on a high floor with a canal view it did look like it was going to happen nicole came to our rescue and worked the system to find us a room while we were exploring amsterdam we got an outstanding executive level room on the odd number side which gives the best outside views we had a very large clean room with a large bathroom and a shower thank you nicole when you check in work with the front desk people our friends traveling with us got an even number room which looked at a wall and worst of all the bathroom was small with a pedestal sink and absolutely no counter space to place toiletries and we paid the same price for the room our advantage was being a lifetime platinum and i worked with nicole thanks again for taking great care of a frequent stayer thanks to the concierge who booked tours for us cheaper then i could get online in the states also when they called a cab they were there at the appointed minute the hotel is in a perfect location to visit,1.0
we stayed for nights and celebrated a big birthday which the hotel honored meaningfully and delightfully our junior suite was elegant plush and quiet on the floor we had a light dinner on the rooftop and the ham carved tableside was fabulous along with a bottle of rosé cava we have stayed at other supposedly good hotels in barcelona including the nearby claris and the modernist fuster and they do not even come close to the elegance comfort spaciousness and service of the majestic breakfasts were delicious and the buffet had many interesting items reflecting the tastes of the international clientele we have found our new favorite hotel in barcelona and will recommend it to family and friends,1.0
the breakfast was ok and the man from reception they can clean your room but the smell by old furniture and the view the location and people around you ca change that immigrants everywhere you do feel safe when you look at them i sorry but this is the true it was ok to be near to metro station that it,0.0
been there for nights with my wife we also stayed at the petit palace in malaga and madrid the one in barcelona is by far the worst in terms of facilities quite dirty and hotel is currently under renovation and there is dust around the reception area and other communal parts the path to the lift is poorly lit also reception the personnel is quite unfriendly albeit polite they distil relevant information slowly including on how to access the hotel with your hotel card compared to the other two petit palace they have a long way to connection simply embarrassing slow choppy and unreliable breakfast very expensive turn right and walk down one block then cross the street and keep walking down on your left you will find el fornet high quality breakfast for a very reasonable were also unlucky as the other guests were quite noisy and impolite our sleep was interrupted by abrupt noise in the middle of the obliged please stay away analysis very poor,0.0
shame they did not warn these young people in a graduation came at to and they charge thème an additional night absolutely unfaithfull way to make money on the back or young and unexperienced people do send your kids,0.0
the hotel is excellent in downtown area but not in walking distance of many tour sites like park guell they have taxis outside the hotel a lot of the time they also have a bus stop but they do run a lot so your better off with a taxi there is no free breakfast free breakfast is only if you have a platinum member in your room,1.0
we stayed from the july at the alexandra it was a good week we love the hotel and it location just off passeig de gracia just over for the stay not bad value the staff are very helpful friendly and we got nice fresh warm cookies on arrival in the hotel the bar downstairs is a great spot for chilling relaxing and having a quite drink with some local food we had a nice view over the swimming pool it does get kind of busy but we managed to get sun loungers no problem only down side the cleaning ladies start early and they can be quite noisy and they feel like they are practically in the room with you,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at the mirror hotel the location is great five minutes to the next metro station and the neighbourhood eixample is also very lovely the room was clean but not really comfortable because everything in the room is white the stuff was really friendly and helpful the best thing in the hotel is definitely the pool you have a great view to the skyline of barcelona,1.0
we stayed at the marker hotel dublin for nights for my business trip it was an excellent experience the hotel was modern and clean the service was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful whenever we made a request the staff took care of it right away during the first night of the stay the music from the roof top bar above my room was quite loud they immediately changed us to another room on another floor definitely recommend this hotel and will go back again if i am in dublin again,1.0
it was our third time in athens and we needed two nights hotel our flight arrived late night and we had a ferry in the next day becasue we wanted to spend the only day in athens in shopping we searched for hotel near ermou street this hotel is right at the beginning of the street near syntagma square so for our purpose the location was great the hotel is good nothing bad to right about it although we order a room with a baby cot and when we arrived the room was without baby cot maybe a mistake that not connected to the hotel we ordered from the staff arrange the missing bad very quickly i think it good value for money stayed in diffrent vactions at two other hotels new hotel and electra palace hotel and if your budget can allow you consider them insteded,1.0
my husband and i stayed here for the last days of our honeymoon this summer and despite the unfortunate construction going full strength at trinity we had a really wonderful stay when we first got to our room we could hear hammering almost right across the wall so we asked for a different room and the staff was nice enough to find us something a bit quieter on the other side of the hotel you could still hear it during the day but it was too bad they also brought up glasses of prosecco which was a sweet touch the rooms themselves were very nice and comfortable and we loved the bright trendy decor the hotel itself is in a perfect location too just far enough away from all the bars so that you not in the thick of it but within minutes walking distance to temple bar the only down side was that when we bought a bottle of champagne elsewhere my husband went down to the bar to ask for glasses and they would give them to him unless he bought them full of prosecco,1.0
we have now visited many different jury inns throughout the uk and our stay in dublin at the christchurch site was just what we expected it to be from the efficient signing in process through to cleanliness of the room the politeness of staff through to an excellent choice at the breakfast bar everything was just as we would have wanted it to be the hotel is close to many main visitor attractions and is but a short walk down to the main shopping streets and even closer to the evening entertainment a great place to stay to enjoy the people and sights of dublin,1.0
as i often say in my reviews i am an accors hotel member and particularly like the novotel my experience around the world has been extremely reliable and barcelona was no different the way their rooms are designed is especially a favourite for me very practical well thought out and stylish best of all they are well from the outside as well as the foyers and we were near the lifts it was whisper facilities comparative to the size of the hotel was the biggest con for me the bar combined is spectacular on first glimpse the gym is right next to this on the same floor but it was completely overrun by children not complaining i had a year old but there were too many people all of the time and not enough division between each area gym vs bar to get a noticeable reprieve there were never enough seats locations to set your things down and we were over it pretty quick the gym is also overrun by children who want to out the equipment not sure where parents were and surprised children were allowed into this location was a min walk to segrada familia but we had an yo and yo in our party so was perhaps a bit out of the way the local underground we struggled to find until the last day yet it is very close stupid on our part perhaps and the tram line is a nice trip into the are also only,1.0
very clean quiet and wonderful view from upper half of hotel get a city view right on the ij river so you can watch all the boat action as well as beautiful night and day views if the amsterdam staff was very helpful and friendly even had a current converter they let us borrow to charge our phones room was also good size and bed very comfy small fridge included very handy to tram station to take you to central station where you can get to anywehre in the city,1.0
we had a fabulous days here with our two teenagers the rooms were spotless cleaned daily and the air conditioning unit was so quiet and functioned perfectly the staff were helpful and courteous especially the pool side bar men and ladies breakfast was plentiful with so many choices to suit all needs the hotel was in a lovely area taxis were cheap approx euros including tip to park guell and sagrada famillia the taxi rank was right outside the hotel we visited the picasso museum and la rambla which were great and the gothic quarter was amazing to walk around we also walked to the beach which was quite hard in the heat but an experience worth having,1.0
we loved this hotel it had a cool vibe with an artistic edge the staff was helpful our room was very nice they have a very nice bar area and good food it was in a great location walking distance from most attractions like ann frank museum,1.0
we had a double executive room with a slight view over amsterdam the balcony had a great view but not really direct access from room we checked in early and received a warm welcome biscuit each nice touch the executive lounge is too small for the volume of people and afternoon drinks were an impossibility unless you wanted to fight for a place the breakfast during the week was fine but crowds in the weekend not like the executive lounge we used in other hilton hotels room clean and comfortable curtains able to block out the late night daylight in july close to train station and this was good for airport connection also close to other areas of interest,1.0
i loved this hotel it was so close to great restaurants bars and breakfast places plus the hotel has hour desk people who are very helpful free newspaper bar next door serves breakfast just for hotel guests and you can walk everywhere cabs are plentiful too,1.0
i stayed in hotel moka from june the to june the its a decent hotel it has a lift the reception is open hours also theres a small fridge that sells of beer the staff were ok the room itself was big with an screen tv i only paid euros for nights so it was ok pricewise would i go back yea i would go back the area was a little shabby with up shops fly posters but the hotel was alright the main square syntagma was only around mins walking time from the hotel,1.0
we loved this hotel so much the first time around we booked again for our trip this past april we had a different room on the top floor which was cute but a little smaller so we requested a new room and were given the same room we had last year on the main floor this hotel is fantastic it boutique with a very cool eclectic style and is located near the museums vondel park casino and a some cool restaurants and coffee shops you can walk into the action but far enough away to be quiet and comfortable the service was great the staff friendly and we just loved our room we will definitely stay here again when we return to our favourite city btw if you can visit for king day at end of april it an absolute blast thanks again for a wonderful stay,1.0
first time in athens and the electra delivered on its promise of excellence fabulous location magic views clean comfortable spacious rooms and attentive staff walking distance to everything and a great haven from the afternoon heat i would not hesitate to stay here again,1.0
it a lovely and friendly hotel that is not too far from the city the city center is walking in walking distance and everything else can be walked to for those who do mind investigating the city on foot the metro is also not too far from the is helpful and ready to help,1.0
stayed her for one night check in was quick but we were asked to pay on the arrival a bit unusual informed that breakfast was an additional ten euro which could be paid in the restaurant in the morning but this was wrong we had to go back to reception pay and get vouchers then go back to the restaurant also enquired at the main reception if the spa sold swimsuits and told no so went into dublin to buy one but i checked the next morning at the spa and they do indeed sell swimwear so could have bought one there you also have to pay deposits for towels and lockers and buy swimhats decided not to bother breakfast was awful very poor choice definately not worth ten euro each apple juice was like water no flavour at all very disappointed with looked out on a flat roof with lots of air con equipment supposed to be fifteen minutes walk from croke park more like thirty five,0.0
we were attending a family birthday party in dublin and although we only live in maynooth we decided to stay in town as my husband travels a lot we always make use of his hilton honours points we have stayed in the conrad many times and i delighted to say we have never had a bad experience we arrived early around midday as we had plans to visit the guinness storehouse and we were delighted to find our room was ready we had room and it was lovely the bed was so comfortable and the room had everything we needed and more the free shoe shine service was a lovely touch we were out for most of the day but had a nightcap in the residents bar again the staff were lovely the following morning we went down for breakfast which is served until there was a great choice of hot and cold dishes and the omelette was delicious we had a great stay and will definitely return soon,1.0
so this is a good hotel if you are cruising the location can not be cruise terminal is about yards away from the hotel entrance the rooms are clean relatively modern the hotel provided electric converters at no charge hotel restaurant is okay for sure but service is good in fairness everything in amsterdam is grossly overpriced for the biggest complaint i know this is an american thing the rooms can not be cooled to a point that is comfortable it would be nice if the hotel offered an oscillating fan to help move the not not believe signs outside of the hotel claiming it is a minute walk to the amsterdam centraal station it is every bit of hotel stay there if cruising,1.0
stayed in the marker just one night expensive but completely worth it the spa and rooftop are unlike anything you can find in dublin also the staff was very helpful with early and luggage storage,1.0
easy train ride to the acropolis and walk your way back through the ancient roman agora and the charming and historic plaka district to the hotel where you go up to the rooftop bar and watch as dusk settles over the acropolis life does give you too many better afternoons and the room was comfortable with good service thrown in when i get back to athens hotel atttalos is where i be staying for sure,1.0
we looked forward to staying at the hotel but had a terrible stay the room was so tiny that we could not unpack our suitcases the roof top pool is the size of a large bathtub service at the pool was non existent no waiter every came up to ask us if we wanted to order a drink the place is not cheap but we did even get help with taking our luggage to our room highly annoying stay,0.0
very nice hotel very clean and room was spacious breakfast in the morning was basic however was nice overall good experience buses into town minute walk shuttle bus on request to and from dublin airport which proved very handy,1.0
pros extremely being right smack in the middle of passeig de gracia where the metro luxury and high street shops and amazing tapas bars restaurants are in abundance room was comfortable and spacious toilet was clean and modern cleaning staff was warm friendly and wait to check in and out no clear queue system people are just standing around fighting for attention of the at reception seemed irritated when we made a request for an extra dental kit since only set was provided in the room and pillow even before checking with the relevant personnel he told us that he wo be able to provide pillows period but did bother asking how else he able to help etc but an overall decent experience,1.0
this hotel is very easy to get to with a metro stop practically outside the door inviting and comfortable with good amenities it is suitable for any low to medium budget traveler the ground floor has comfortable social spaces to sit and talk with friends and an attached all the staff were friendly and helpful,1.0
first class from beginning to end our stay at the marker was remarkable highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to dublin and looking for a hotel which is right in the centre of dublin but within walking distance great location and superb accomodation,1.0
my friend booked intercontinental amstel amsterdam for her wedding what a great experience beautiful interior excellent service and great hotel is a great venue for hosting events with around persons there are many beautiful rooms bars ballroom did not book a room to stay overnight but will look forward to any opportunity to do that in the future,1.0
great place to stay and chillout to charlie and all the team the room are good the hallways could do with a touch more lighting the new features in the rooms work enjoyed many stays here and look forward to many more,1.0
as billed the hotel is practically at the bottom of the hill below acropolis and very close to the metro station and the shopping area around it with numerous restaurants in one direction and the cathedral and parliament in the other with ten minutes or so of walk the hotel breakfast area is open all day long with free lemon and cucumber water in the jar for guests,1.0
i had a wonderful time here roof top pool and bar was amazing the breakfast which was included was great roi and service second to none this will be my first choice when i return to beautiful barcelona,1.0
we stayed here one night before embarking on a cruise the carpets were filthy in the hallways and in our room when we went to our room the door was open and we could see why the carpet was very wet by the bathroom they must have been trying to dry it we did want to walk barefoot on the carpet and we are not usually fussy when we told the desk clerk on checkout he basically ignored us the only good thing was the hotel is easy access to the cruise terminal,0.0
a really nice hotel in a great spot the pool is the icing on the cake such a nice spot to relax with a beer the rooms are really clean and modern staff are extremely helpful too and have great local knowledge,1.0
staying at this hotel was an amazing experience the decors are beautiful and the rooms lovely it has rooftop with a fantastic view of the acropolis we only stayed one night so we did get a chance to check out the facilities buffet breakfast was fantastic probably one of the best range and food freshness we have is also great right across the road is the parliament and the hotel rooms have great vista of athens if you are looking for a luxurious stay with the feel of exclusivity and professional service this is the hotel to choose,1.0
the friendliest most caring hotel we have stayed in the service was over the top everyone knew your name and always wanted to know how you were and if there was anything they could do to make your stay better the canal cruise in their vintage boat is a do not miss,1.0
the hotel is very well situated the room was nice and simple with a big smart tv and the staff was great however i was disappointed with my poor late night dinner ordered some pasta with tomato sauce but they tasted really bad,1.0
the good hotel is modern with new are access to rembrandt man in the gift shop is very bad despite the name this hotel is not at all central it a min walk to the tram then a minute journey to amsterdam when you include waiting time the centre is minutes area near the hotel feels a bit unsafe i would want to be a lone female near the hotel late at price is too high for the location i could have paid the same and stayed in the breakfast is much too expensive and was much too busy there were always queues for the coffee machines and we had to wait minutes for somewhere to sit can be rude especially the night is no way to have a shower without flooding the bathroom building is ugly it has to be the tallest building in amsterdam and stands out as an eyesore,1.0
the lobby of the hotel was promising but the hallways were awful the lighting was terrible an annoying fluorescent lighting that hard to describe when my wife and i got to the room there were twin beds which was annoying the bathroom is a little odd with the shower as it points straight down there is no curtain just a glass divider so water creeps around the edge and pools on the floor street noise is a problem but even worse was the flag of the hotel would bang into the window randomly throughout the night it sounded like someone was throwing snowballs at the window and it kept us awake the food was alright but you better off going elsewhere for breakfast the internet was free but you had to sign in with an email address to virgin so someone is probably making money off of my email which is ridiculous considering the rooms are over a night i would not stay there again for the price we paid,0.0
i agree with all the positive reviews this hotel has the following positives great location easy walking distance to all the main attractions of athens central city which is handy for a short stay great value for money normally accommodation in such a good location would cost or times as much great staff who are helpful and friendly and professional good adequate breakfast property may be a bit old but is very clean comfortable and well maintained with basic inclusions in good working order mini fridge tv free wifi negatives room is small for more than people we are a family of and once the bed is out not much room for suitcases but this was a problem for us as we were only staying for night if staying for a longer period i would book rooms next time for a family of and it would be perfect and still affordable i would stay here again if i return to athens and i will be recommending this place to others,1.0
i am a premier platinum rewards member and the service was awful our hotel room was over degrees despite having them fix it once and requesting a switch to another room after paying k points and in cash for nights the breakfast was good but after multiple attempts i gave up on getting a cool room i spoke with the director of engineering and he said it was fixed not i received no platinum welcome gift and the front desk staff seemed almost bothered at each encounter for change information etc overall i would probably not go back,0.0
stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel again to celebrate my husband birthday absolutely delighted with the room it was fabulous with a balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard it was amazingly quiet for city centre dublin highly recommended,1.0
fab hotel as you walk into reception you are struck by the cool air con a relief from the heat and a spa style aroma reception staff are friendly and professional the hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms spacious and the beds very comfortable we did book breakfast initially but were offered it for at checkin a saving of and the breakfasts were well worth it huge buffet style of hot and cold fruit cereal veg meats cheese eggs breads etc catering for special diets also the rooftop pool is small but big enough to cool off in and offers amazing degree views of the city the spa contains a pool with jacuzzi and a steam room there is also a small gym spa treatments are available if you want a little pampering a little expensive but what the hell it only money a great nearby restaurant for dinner is el clot,1.0
beautiful room great view particularly from the rooftop bar the only downside was the check in this was a mess all good otherwise several good restaurants within an easy minute walk room service and hotel food can be outlandishly expensive,1.0
this hotel is by far the best hotel we as a family have stayed in r frequent travelers so helpful welcoming accommodating we managed get a free parking space the front another bonus the afternoon was just so cute we got it complimentary as we stayed on a sunday nite we had reschedule a few things over r stay and they were v patient understanding we will def b back jade isaac r the stars of the show the room was comfortable although sum ac wud have been good in the rare irish heat thank u all skylon so much,1.0
this hotel is located in a very good position for las ramblas and all central areas excellent service staff were very helpful check in very swift and efficient hotel clean with modern facilities the breakfast was very good catering for all needs fantastic room on high floor at front of hotel good and free to use would recommend to all visiting barcelona,1.0
good hotel close to acropolis miles with gym roof top pool that closes at pm which is a shame as in the summer months you would like the pool to be open until pm felt like we just came in to the pool and were kindly hurried out to be set up for roof top spread in breakfast charges you up for sightseeing rooms come with jacuzzi which is a bonus after a long hard hot day a slight niggle was that the pillows were too big and can cause neck pain i found two smaller pillows in the wardrobe there were no kettle provided for hope they look into sorting out these two issues towels were changed everyday and good quality of toiletries overall good experience and stay,1.0
the hotel is ideally located near the quarters of the city making it a perfectly central location to most key tourist locations min walk from the metro min walk to la rambla and min bus ride to the beach myself and friends arrived for our first girls holiday to barcelona and were welcomed with a friendly reception as we entered the quirky hotel with little idea of how far we were from the tourist attractions we planned to visit the receptionist whipped out a map and gave a swift and detailed summary of our closest metro stations most accessible bus services and even the advised us on some of the attractions we planned to visit the rooms we booked two doubles were clean spacious and extremely comfortable we seen on the website that only a mesh curtain separated the bathroom from the bedroom and as we were sharing between friends we figured this would have been a bit intimate however there was also a white curtain which could be drawn for privacy the loo had its own private room as well thankfully i have to say the beds were absolutely incredible so comfortable which was a dream to come back to after our long out we spend a few afternoons and evenings on the spacious and modern rooftop area enjoying the fantastic cocktails and soaking up the sunshine when we were a bit too tired to head down to the beach overall i highly recommmend the hotel we received a,1.0
we had a big corner room with a nice view over the single canla bit small bath roomthe air condition worked but it was also nice to be able to open the was great with very nice staffsome may think that the design of the room was a bit sterile bit i do care about that,1.0
this hotel is ideally situated for the metro restaurants and sights our room was slightly cell like as we were only there for night it did not matter and we did feel this was an hotel where style won over substance at times the shower was a very good example of that however the location and the cost mean that all of that can be excused breakfast was also very good and we would certainly consider it again when we return to athens,1.0
room stayed here for two days following a cruise if you looking for a hotel with excellent customer service this is the place esmeralda did many things for us during our stay she suggested and made dinner reservations at a local restaurant an excellent experience she also helped us with setting up on our phones finally she checked us in and printed our boarding passes for our trip home although we felt safe with the hotel location the hotel is far from major attractions from a walking perspective it took about minutes to get to the plaza de catalunya and to the sagrada familia the only negative we had with the room was that the bathtub began to fill up with water whenever we took a shower overall we were very satisfied with our stay at the hesperia barcelona presidente,1.0
great hotel stayed here for business meeting and after flying hours the staff could not have been more helpful stayed on level with club access very high tech room and extremely quite across from the train and tram station and right around the corner from talbot street they do a great breakfast and room service is excellent only critique was they did take down my credit card details which meant i had to pay as i went for the breakfast and room service but the staff were very helpful each time will stay here again if ever back in dublin,1.0
so i picked this place because of the location and i have to say it was fantastic close to everything staff are great we had a mini suite which was also more than enough for adults and kids breakfast choice was good there is free water in the reception which is a nice bonus the executive lounge is tiny though and always busy it not somewhere i ever wanted to go due to it being overcrowded however i would stay here again in a heartbeat it clean it central it has a starbucks,1.0
on a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the morgan for three nights the location of this hotel is excellent for those wishing the fun atmosphere of the temple bar with convenient walking distance and to bus routes to dublin were so tired from our daily excursions that the nightlife noise did not bother us too much and the hotel provided earplugs which were included near the bathroom amenities our room was on the second floor facing the street so with windows opened it was a bit noisy we shut the windows the next night and put on the ac and that solved the noise problem we booked this hotel through tripadvisor which was easy and allowed us to get a better rate we opted for breakfast to be included which offered a great selection of fruit pastries eggs sausage bacon and typical irish breakfast fare breakfast wait staff were great and attentive in fact all staff members were helpful and friendly shout outs to sonia who directed us to a local vendor who helped with our computer issues and to david our personable server at breakfast the morgan is part of the intercontinental hotel properties i would highly recommend this hotel for tourists,1.0
i always try to be honest and find positives during my stay at various places unfortunately the bad outweighed the good on this check in we were able to get into our room early which was brilliant after a hours train journey from belfast and the weather was scorching however the receptionists were so busy talking between themselves that we were overcharged by unfortunately we did not notice this until we got home but after a quick email to the hotel we were refunded quickly had the check in staff been paying more attention this mistake would not have we got to our room in the blazing heat we were delighted to find it clean and bright but the corridors were tired however the heat was stifling you are not able to open the windows due to safety catches and because we were above the busy main road the traffic was deafening no win situation i now understand that the hotel provide fans on request maybe something the staff should make clear when checking in rather than having conversations with each other after a good nights sleep forget it because we had to keep the window open all night so as not to suffocate in the heat all we could hear all night was traffic and drunk people directly outside the window then at a knock at the door from housekeeping when check out is at noon and after a shockingly bad nights sleep being disturbed at that time was,0.0
a great hotel and neighborhood comfortable bed accommodating and friendly staff and lovely pool area we made the mistake of booking a place near las ramblas our first night and are so glad we moved to well and come after that close enough to everything we wanted to see and much more touristy great restaurants around safe to walk late at night the hotel offered a lot of little extras which were nice touches like a complimentary drink afternoon tea chocolates on the pillows water and other beverages etc very reasonable rates for the quality we have already recommended this hotel to a friend going to visit next month,1.0
i stayed here recently for nights and had a brilliant hotel staff were so friendly and helpful with recommendations etc the rooms are amazing and the beds are so comfy could not fault anything with the stay and this is definitely my choice when i am in dublin thank you to all the team at the intercontinental,1.0

a fantastic star hotel in the hub of amsterdam above the usual crowne plaza standard with spacious comfy quiet and clean bedrooms bar and restaurant were friendly nice atmosphere and varied menu and drink car park is for the night as i was on a family trip could put on business expenses this was a real shock when checking out so moral of the story is fantastic hotel do take your car,1.0
my husband and i are regular visitors to the herbert park have reviewed the hotel positively on several occasions based on location value comfort and friendly staff this visit i want to pay tribute to foyer staff and dharam who over many visits have proven to be at all times professional and courteous but also go that extra mile which is warm and friendly could praise the staff highly enough,1.0
the queen rooms are small as in new york hotel but comfortable if you can handle the size of the room this hotel has an ideal location across from stephen green and within walking distance to many sights shops museums grafton and temple bar unlike other reviewers we had a good experience with the staff and the concierge desk we found them to be knowledgeable and helpful and the concierge provided great suggestions regarding an excursion to howth that we were considering a trip that we made after the concierge enthusiastically endorsed the idea and gave us some tips and for pubs and restaurants in central dublin the gym is small but it has enough equipment to allow for a solid workout,1.0
on arrival in dublin our accommodation had been double booked our party of ended up for night at the clayton and the staff could do enough for us the rooms were beautiful and the breakfast was amazing a gentleman called marcus spent the entire saturday morning on the telephone trying to find us another hotel to spend the weekend as the clayton was fully booked eventually marcus found us somewhere and we had a fantastic time all thanks to him his supervisor was also a lovely helpful lady we would all definitely return to this beautiful hotel,1.0
my husband booked this hotel for a long weekend to celebrate our year wedding anniversary he researched several hotels and areas before choosing the metropolitan which is literally at the top of las rambla perfect location friendly staff and our upgraded premium room on the floor with a balcony overlooking the outdoor terrace and pool was great the hotel has pools a plunge pool on floor with small area for sunbathing and a larger one on the ground floor with a large sun terrace just above you can order drinks at the bar there and they will bring over bring to you on the terrace bar prices were surprisingly reasonable for beer and wine around euros for a glass the albariño is delicious a bottle of cava is around euros and is of very good quality it a small hotel so one tip is to go down to the bar to order drinks and take back to room yourself instead of paying the extra euros for it to be delivered our room had a huge walk in shower super comfortable queen size bed a docking station and a nespresso machine which we made much use of each morning the hotel had organised a bottle of cava and some chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room to celebrate our anniversary what a lovely touch we only had breakfast at their kitchen restaurant once and on the last morning of our stay although it was pricey at euros each i,1.0
we ended our trip here to relax before a long international flight could have chosen a more perfect place the hotel is clean modern with an attentive staff we had a room with a view of the ocean pool beautiful grounds we had snacks in a pool cabana swam in the lovely pool relaxed in the hammocks perfect beach walk to end the day,1.0
this was an answer provided by hostel after arriving to the spot with booking confirmation code and pin received from maybe it is not entirely hostel fault that overbooking occurred room was booked hour before arrival due to missed flight but still it happened around the midnight for super tired person or maybe it is a policy of the hostel anyway not the experience i would wish for traveling i wish to believe that confirmation of booking means that i have a roof over my head otherwise we screwed,1.0
athens avenue hotelgrounds and amenities fairly new hotel with a much appreciated cleanliness the designs are very sleek and modern nice touch restaurant the food was excellent the breakfast buffet is does have a wide variety however it has items you will desire to start your day well done staff very pleasant staff front desk and restaurant staff were phenomenal i had several questions and they were able to answer them and provide recommendations for me the was absolutely quick and painless very impressed location i was a huge fan of the location i am a solo traveler and found it difficult to walk around the area at certain times of the day alone even before sunset i did feel unsafe but i felt uncomfortable the location has large amount of strip clubs and sex shops overall i certainly stay here again but not alone i recommend to family and friends,1.0
fantastic friendly and helpful staff breakfast improved further since last time rooms very nice and good value area superb a few things to improve would be easier to use air condition another lift as waiting times can be high at times cooler bed linen for the summer as the bed feels a bit too hot in the hot season in my opinion,1.0
i had one night here on my own while i was working and for just me it suited well enough unfortunately my girlfriend joined me for the weekend and i just did feel comfortable letting her stay immediate grievance is that they took a photo of my passport and both sides of my debit card if i suffer identify theft in the short future i certainly know who to blame this is not an appropriate behaviour next the hotel is not terrible but there just nothing even slightly impressive about it and many things that just chip away at location is ideal for busses trams and taxis with the stop outside the hotel the downside is that the stop is right outside and at least midnight you have the related noises of also not in a particular nice area to walk back to in the evening dark streets under a railway bridge and as a result i really wished i had chosen somewhere more bedroom was tiny but appeared clean despite one of the windows being filthy oj the outside the is very poor and the television tuning was even worth turning the television on for channels had a reasonable picture but with static for audio and the rest were cheap laminated for the guests all over the hotel room also just looks doors in this building do seem to fit the frames so all night we heard doors being slammed shut including the front door to the hotel breakfast,1.0
i was there for a business conference the hotel is just mins away from the beach it was so close i could wake up to watch the sunrise and had a swim before breakfast a large shopping mall is located opposite the hotel if you want good authentic restaurants you will have to take a short mins taxi ride out taxis are easily accessible outside the hotel breakfast buffet range is good hotel is very clean good amenities although the gym is very small smaller than a single bedroom service is above average and seem lacking especially at all in all good stay and would return,1.0
really loved my stay at the w amsterdam i stayed in the bank building and loved it style the rooms were designed for maximum efficiency in a smaller space and the modern look is a cool contrast to the old building the location is perfect for seeing everything you need to see in the city and the concierge wish i remembered his name was so helpful and managed to get us tickets to the anne frank house for that day saving us hours of waiting in line and the rooftop bar is a must see for the great view would definitely recommend and stay there again next time i in amsterdam,1.0

i had a transportation issue that stranded me in togo africa for two days causing me to not be present to stay in the room i booked i was in africa as part of my studies assisting members of the peace corps i booked through and i did not choose the option to get a refund i acknowledge this fact i contacted the hotel to let them know the situation thinking that they might be customer service oriented and have compassion for a student budget i completely understand them charging me for two nights of three because i was going to arrive there on the third day but they gave zero leniency and basically told me that if i had booked through the hotel website that they would helped me and that i should contact which i did response was that they could refund me but the hotel could if they saw fit to do so when i finally arrived they had deleted my reservation entirely likely so that they could book out the room in my absence i had to wait almost an hour to have my reservation reinstated in the computer system the young lady that completed the reinstatement of my reservation was the only staff member that was in anyway helpful or kind i have worked in the hospitality industry including resort hotels and this experience in my opinion deserves a zero rating this pretentious frat house that calls itself a hotel is the worst i suggest,0.0

this is a very comfortable ultra modern buzzy hotel we were greeted by very friendly professional staff upon arrival and this continued during our stay soft drinks and snacks are available free of charge and wine is served in the library from pm every day very pretty garden spacious bedroom comfortable bed and pillows but the design of the bathroom did not do it for us robes and slippers supplied excellent buffet breakfast could not better the central location being within walking distance of most attractions very pleasant sitting in the bar at dusk watching the boats go by on the canal,1.0

my husband and i stayed at waterloo house for three nights at the end of may and could not have been more pleased the location is ideal for visiting dublin the airport aircoach stop is a couple blocks from the house and public buses into city center pick up just a few doors down the street only used them once however as it is an easy and enjoyable walk from waterloo house into downtown dublin the neighborhood is quiet and feels safe with numerous shops and restaurants in short walking distance the georgian house is charming and our room at the back of the house was sizable and very clean with a spacious bath and comfortable bed lovely view out on the garden and the rooftops beyond there was some barking from the resident dogs at the start of each night but they soon quieted down so it was not a problem fabulous breakfasts with a variety of cooked options in addition to an extensive buffet the staff were attentive and accommodating especially irene who was most helpful and and welcoming although the steps up to the front door are rather steep the house does have an elevator which i believe can also be accessed from a ground floor entrance if stairs are a problem all in all a delightful and memorable stay for our first visit to dublin,1.0
just stayed at the arlington for the concert we were greeted by maggie at the reception and she went over and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed this hotel had great atmosphere good food at great prices the staff was exceptionally friendly the arlington is located right in the heart of the city so everything you need can be within walking distance next time in dublin we will definitely book arlington cheers steve ocmd,1.0
my sister and i stayed at this beautiful hotel during our stay in athens this is by far the best hotel in euope that we stayed at comparable prices to or star hotels so far it is located in a quiet area outside the hustle and bustle of the city there are not too many eating options at the hotel and is it quiet pricey breakfast buffet is euros per person however there are a lot of great restaurants and cafes near by there are also kiosks directly across the street that sell snacks and beverages at reasonable prices the level of service from the front desk to room service staff was top notch the room we were given was bright clean and a lot bigger than any other hotel we had in other cities in europe the bathroom was bright roomy and had a variety of quality towels and two bath robes the toiletries were really nice and also included a shaving kit dental kit vanity set shower and sewing kit the shower was also enjoyable with a lot of hot water and great water pressure the hotel did not stop there to impress there is a pillow menu that offers three different options to your preference and comfort level after returning to your room in the evening your bedding is turned down for you with a chocolate on your pillow and hotel bedroom slippers on the side of each bed the hotel also offers a free shuttle service,1.0

our extended family recently stayed for nights in rooms at the house everything about our experience was fantastic the rooms were spacious with great canal views and coffee soft drinks and snacks included the location was ideal within walking distance of vondel park the museum district and the leidesplein neighborhood the front desk staff garvey and joanna were exceedingly friendly and helpful with directions reservations bike rental and helped direct an ill family member to nearby medical assistance the breakfast was superb consisting of eggs cooked to order freshly made mini dutch pancakes poffertjes and great coffee we wholeheartedly recommend no house and would stay here again without hesitation,1.0

this is a very intimate centrally located hotel the rooms are small but have all the amenities the staff is very helpful there is a bar downstairs that has good food and music on most nights i highly recommend the harding,1.0
we stayed three nights at camden court so got a good idea of what the hotel is like the customer service was good the rooms quite large and well equipped and breakfast was outstanding the hotel has an indoor pool and well equipped gym there is much more you could want in a hotel is also well located with easy access to the main attractions it is outside the temple bar zone so it relatively quiet but not too far as to make the walk to see everything too great it is also surrounded by many bars and thought overall it was good value for money,1.0
four of us recently stayed here for two nights in the family interconnecting rooms the whole experience was great the rooms are a decent size and the location is perfect it is in the middle of town but in a quiet enough area that you can not hear breakfast was a good mix of both hot and cold food and we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the cold breakfast is available all the time as we had to leave at to catch a ferry thank you for a lovely experience,1.0
stayed in the hermes hotel in the centre of athens handy for acropolis and the popular tourist areas nearby very friendly staff and good rooms with the much needed free internet rooms are fairly small but decent and the beds are extremely comfortable the hotel has a good and deserved reputation from local taxi drivers and again position wise it is ideal the hermes has a sister hotel nearby which has a rooftop bar which has views of the parthenon and guests of the hotel are able to use this if they want a good basic clean and friendly small hotel with very good staff and perfect location,1.0

i really enjoyed food quality provided in room very delicious and well made but the menu is short and you have few choices specially for vegetarians staff were friendly one negative comment is that i have requested to remove mini bar in room multiple times but they do response also the room ground is made from wood and when you walk in room you hear some sound from wooden ground the breakfast restaurant close early about am and this let us miss breakfast left is small for child trolly concierge very friendly,1.0
i am writing this review to inform people of this very beautiful hotel my friends and i stayed on the top floor room it was outstanding all newly renovated and soooo spotless every day cleaned with lively fresh towels and linens a lovely friendly cleaning lady also a wonderful air conditioning room to come back to in to every day the room was stunning amazing facilities in it and a balcony view to die for a gorgeous american breakfast awaited us every morning and once again so clean with lovely staff to greet us on arrival the reception staff were incrediably friendly and welcoming and nothing was to much trouble for them at all the pool bar restaurant was gorgeous opened daily serving lovely delicious food and drinks amazing coctails the life guard george was one of the loveliest people we met on the holiday just a pure gentlemen he had fresh pool towels for us and anything we wanted he hit amazing service from all of them i would recommend panorama resturant i will do a seperate review later about minutes away in taxi the most amazing seafood resturant on our trip also athens sailing tours amazing this hotel in offers everything yes it is hour by tram or daytime by taxi to plaka wonderful area but you have the beach and beautiful area of gylfada as well i can not wait to vusit thus beautiful country and hotel again tgank yiu to all at palmyra beach hotel for,1.0
we stayed here in may for just one night at the end of a cruise and had not ourselves chosen the hotel this time we came for a couple of nights having had a positive experience last time we were given an upgrade to an executive room which was a nice touch we can find nothing to criticise in staff and the waiters are all friendly and efficient the executive lounge is small but during our stay it was never though we can see how it could become so the snacks served at pm were really good as before we very much liked the sky lounge with its great views over the city and a nice food menu this time we also tried the eastwood grill for dinner and were not disappointed all in all another very pleasant stay the location is also excellent for sightseeing and is of course only five minutes away from the train station too,1.0
we stayed at the marker for three nights in july we arrived in the morning after an overnight flight from the us when we checked in our room was not available but were told if we waited in the lounge they would come and get us when it was we went to the restroom to freshen up returned to the lounge and our room was ready we stayed in a superior room that overlooked the canal and a public square the room was fresh and functional the bath was large and bright service was first class if i ever returned to dublin this would be my go to hotel,1.0
this hotel is a great base from where all the main tourist attractions are within walking distance and located down a quite side street next to the city main food market a must visit the rooms are comfortable but those facing the front of the hotel are nicer brighter and seemed to be larger than those facing the inner courtyard which were quite dark and smaller we had an inner room but to be honest one does not plan to spend much time in a hotel room when visiting athens the public areas are lovely and the roof terrace has wonderful views over the city and is very chilled and relaxed the staff were always friendly and helpful the breakfast was exactly what to expect of a hotel of this standard fresh juice good coffee and a good food selection i would stay at this hotel again,1.0
this hotel was a great surprise as it was a great value as well as a modern quirky fun hotel in the middle of the city the hotel was centrally located to walk to the squares and sites neighborhood was a bit sketchy at night and would recommend being in a group in the evening however we had no trouble and enjoyed our stay our room was huge with a large terrace and nicely appointed bathroom amenities the restaurant was lovely and the friendly waiter even taught us some greek to get us through our visit all in all the hotel and staff were pleasant and i would recommend this hotel,1.0
we stayed on the return leg of our italian holiday they treat their diamond members very well we were upgraded to a lovely corner room combined with complimentary breakfast the stay was great value given the size of long stay parking in dublin and the frequency of the buses to the car park you can get to the hotel quicker than your car most times pity the shuttle does run for an extra hour as many european flights arrive around midnight the taxi is only though,1.0
larissa metro train station is metres away the room was clean the pool on the top deck is a bonus only negative is that breakfast is basic and the bread on both mornings was stale reasonable value so no real complaints,1.0
the electra hotel is located within walking distance of the national palace national gardens and even the first stop for the hop on hop off bus there is also a subway nearby there are many great restaurants and cafes just steps away but even better at least once would be to just head up to the the floor and have dinner at sunset in their restaurant the view of the acropolis and surrounding area of greece is phenomenal as for the room itself it is contemporary the bed comfortable on the firm side the view from our room was just that of the building across the street but i believe there are probably a couple floors that might have a similar view of the acropolis as that of the restaurant we were on the floor there was a tiny balcony outside basically a person could take one step out to look right or left down the street the flat screen tv gave access to connect ones digital phone or pad up to screen their photos an ap was needed though to do it the tv had an alarm set up such that when programmed it the tv would turn on at the designated time pay attention to the volume when using there were other options available on the television as well the shower was very roomy and had one of those big rain head type fixtures the air conditioning worked well and was quiet the staff were all friendly the,1.0
came and stayed at the skylon friday july to the not a bad thing to be said my partner bought me here for my birthday and upon arrival a nice polite lady called hazel checked us in then upgraded us to a king suite we also got breakfast vouchers free of charge and a complimentary bottle of champagne thanks hazel on getting to the room we were loving how clean and tidy it was bed was so comfy that we hated getting in our own last night house keeping cleaned and gave fresh towels breakfast was delicious and our evening meal on the last night was just as nice staff are friendly and hotel for those not wanting to stay far out as it just a bus journey in to dublin centre bus stops right across the road and taxi service second to definitely stay here again,1.0
can not fault this hotel clean great location and staff were very friendly and helpful rooms are small as in all european cities but the location made up for this would definitely recommend for short city break,1.0
we picked this hotel over another athens hotel because it had dedicated parking and a pool we arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there i was not happy however the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage he was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our got up to our rooms needed to book because of our big family to find twins bed pushed together in each room not the best but it worked the furniture is dated the tvs are ancient smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain it is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere to top it off they charge euro a day for internet access in the room and that is only for devices probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area they have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar however it is a very small pool area it is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground so you can hardly walk around the pool we arrived at the first day at knowing it closes at with kids in tow the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have mins to swim so we should come back tomorrow well my kids were,0.0
i stood at the conrad dublin end of july i was there for the concert and had a junior suite this hotel is second to none beautifully decorated the rooms were spotless and the staff was friendly and paid attention to every detail we checked in on thursday morning were i briefly mentioned that we were going to the concert that coming saturday when we returned from the concert late saturday evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a lovely piece of chocolate cake with a note from the staff welcoming us back from a great evening wow that is attention to detail incredible hotel,1.0
this hotel was very nice and we enjoyed our stay we would stay there again the staff was great and the location although kind of away from the old part of the city was in a great place very near the subway and taxis were everywhere,1.0
we had a table booked as part of a hen do we ordered of a set menu choice of starters mains and desserts once we had sat down it took a while for us to be acknowledged and the service was slow for the whole we only ever saw waiter would be a lot better if they had more staff they sat us in a dark corner was provided at the table however he asked us if we wanted to order drinks then before we answered ran off and did return for minutes so we had to go downstairs and order wine at the food was hit and miss the starters were all delicious however the burger i had was over cooked and served cold the music was extremely loud and difficult to talk as a group as could hear people across the table drinks were extremely were only toilets for the ladies not enough for a venue of this size so gave up queuing to go at one point must have been waiting minutes also one toilet had no toilet roll this is more of a bar than a restaurant even then drinks are very overpriced probably due to it also being a hotel mostly tourists visiting overall i would not recommend this hotel for a meal for a hen party,0.0
cleanliness service and location close to the metro and acropolis all deserve stars in our opinion the only reason for a little lower rating is because hotel attalos could use a little updating in the hallways but otherwise we enjoyed our stay and even went back for two more days at the end of our trip take the blue line from the airport to montastiraki and you steps away enjoy,1.0
very clean and tidy great room with a large balcony great air conditioning for those hot summer distance from all the major sites in athens very friendly staff best value for money will definitely stay here again as well as recommend to others,1.0

this hotel was recommended to us by the travel information booth at the dublin airport when we arrived they made the reservations and gave us a reduced price we wanted something in city centre that was walkable to sights this hotel has alot of history it has been renovated our room was clean and comfortable not a large room the proximity to everything we wanted to see in dublin city centre was perfect for us we did not eat here,1.0

got a great deal for four nights at this hotel it is a little out of the way but the subway is just over the road and the main attractions really do take long to get to the rooms were spacious with amazing air con we used the gym a few times and it was great did eat at the hotel but the menu looked delicious reception staff were really friendly and helpful too i asked about the best way to get to the airport early and they booked a taxi for me would definitely stay here again,1.0
i can thoroughly recommend this hotel it is in a lovely location within walking distance to town ballsbridge and the lovely beach at sandymount the staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble if you are looking for a lovely hotel in dublin this is definitely the one to choose,1.0
hostel in itself was clean and tidy and the night manager was what i can only imagine was the cleaner as he was the only one with keys decided to use my bank cards which i stupidly left in the room and do some online shopping the day manager refused to accept this was the case even though i had messages from my bank and told me had been in the although the room was cleaned and the bed made so they try and rob you but at least they clean your room would not recommend as this ruined our whole stay,0.0
excellent location with sloterdijk train station and tram terminal on the doorstep long stays can be booked at reduced rates and the facilities washing machine roof terrace gym and sauna help make business trips manageable friendly staff and studio facilities with clean equipment fridge hob and microwave just minutes tram ride from central museum plein or mins on the train to central station,1.0
i highly recommend hotel omm with its prime centralized location that you can basically walk to most places restaurants and shops with great services very clean and with the most friendliest staff we have ever met the front desk staff were very friendly and informative and the rest of the hotel staff from waiters to housekeeping were very very nice helpful snd welcoming we were greeted daily by each hotel staff member with nice big smile all the time we were the hotel the bellmen worked hard to serve us to the extend that they will be running the streets to find us the best taxi since we are a big family of food was tasty and eclectic and each maincourse we ordered at roca bar was tasty and yummy especially the chicken tendoori with modern twist ca say enough good things we will be back again thank you you have a winning hotel team,1.0
we love the shelbourne and have made it our hotel when in dublin for a variety of good reasons the building itself heralds the georgian age of architecture that characterizes this corner of dublin the hotel sits across the street from saint stephen green a lush and park most major sites rest minutes away by foot from dublin castle to trinity college everything is near the service must be the very finest in all of ireland the staff clearly crisply and efficiently respond to all requests and anticipate the customers needs the concierge paul arranged a beautiful birthday dinner for my mother at a restaurant we would have never found without his help the front desk checked us in beautifully and responded to our many requests kindly and quickly the doormen are exceptional friendly helpful rooms offer plenty of space and amenities to make the guests more than comfortable and the beds must be the most luxurious in the whole short stay that shelbourne and know that every need will be attended with care and the stay will exceed all expectations plus the food is really good we fans for life,1.0

we stayed here for nights and the hotel was perfect a great location right next to the metro but also within walking distance of la rambles and the main harbour hotel staff are all very friendly the bar and restaurant are both good and reasonably priced we did get to use the roof top pool as it was that hot but the roof terrace has great views and i am sure from may onwards the pool would be great highly recommend this hotel if you are doing a short break to barcelona,1.0
we recently stayed nights in this hotel prior to a cruise followed by a further night post cruise we had booked a deluxe room for the night stay which we found to be very spacious and furnished to a high standard very pleasant on the eye very comfortable bed and tv both in the sitting area and bed area the bathroom was also spacious and nicely finished also pleasantly surprised to find complimentary wine water and snacks in the deluxe room on arrival the breakfast buffet was also excellent nice food and more than enough choice small pool and terrace on the roof bars in both the ground floor and rooftop at the pool but generally only bar open depending on the weather which is fine no restaurant facilities other than breakfast hotel is not in the most attractive street in barcelona but only streets off la rambla so overall a great location and good value for money min walk from metro station and many bars and restaurants approx euros by taxi to the airport and euros to the cruise port staff are very friendly especially ali on the front desk at night full of helpful advice i see from other reviews that some rooms are less spacious but we really could not fault the deluxe room we would definitely look to use this hotel if we visit barcelona again,1.0

stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon hotel is spacious conveniently located has a great hot breakfast buffet staff are friendly and eager to help and even has perks like a business center with printers for any last minute itinerary printing or changes we were even surprised to find a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in our room when we checked in with a note congratulating us on our recent marriage the sandymount has set the bar high for hotels on the rest of our european vacation,1.0
seems reasonably new but has an established charm about it directly opposite croke park it might be wise to check if any major events are scheduled before booking here it also a minute walk to the more touristy areas of dublin and the restaurant precinct he rooms a good size they were quiet and there is also free parking and beds were comfortable but the saggy pillows were a disappointment the bathroom was huge with a long deep soaking bath greta after all that walking those not from need to be aware of safety latches on some hot water taps our showers were cool to cold and we could work out why especially as we could have scorchingly hot baths hotel staff were efficient and friendly with the exception of those we encountered at the a latte seemed to take an indication the croke park is similar in both style and price to a mid tier accor properties such as novotel but it has a little more character i stay here again if returning to dublin,1.0
beautiful hotel lovely room and staff the only downside was it is out of the way of everything a train ride into amsterdam and a minute walk to the hotel otherwise it is a beautiful hotel and recommend it,1.0
the sandymount hotel is a good choice located in sandymount quarter it is easy to reach the center of dublin by the dart train at the end of an ireland trip it is very easy to drive to the airport within minutes,1.0
overnighted here after a late arrival into dublin airport with kids and adults we normally have to swallow the cost of rooms i was so impressed they offered a family suite beautifully appointed rooms and plenty of space it a gorgeous hotel the staff are friendly and kind the breakfast was incredible,1.0
stayed multiple nights here staff was very friendly rooms was nice had breakfast twice and was always greeted with smiles concierge staff was also friendly with tips and directions would have no problem staying here next time in dublin,1.0
as the title says the entrance to the hotel is very nice and worthy of a five star rating the room however left much to be desired travelling as a couple we were provided with a room that featured two single beds pushed together the decor was incredibly dated the bathroom cramped and the space not cleaned to the standards that would be expected the location is good and most of the main sights are within walking distance from the hotel we would not stay at this hotel again unless the room provided was of the expected standard we would recommend dining at the rooftop restaurant the food was exceptional as was the view which provided a panorama over the temple of zeus and the acropolis,1.0
we picked the nh as we have stayed at nh hotels before we had a great hotel room with two balconies not sure about the other rooms but ours had wooden flooring and not carpets as i prefer wooden flooring it was a big bonus for us location wise we had the best part of the city with great tapas bars food market and walking distance to train stations staff was very friendly and everything was not too much when we needed something loads of taxis was outside so that it was not an issue to get to the airport,1.0
this is a must stay it is beautiful inside and out totally worth it i highly recommend you staying here it is easy to use the restaurant and the staff is amazing not right next to the city but very easy to get too lots of resources and information given when you ask,1.0
awesome location next to omania square where you can get in all the tourist buses the staff are so lovely and provide you with great restaurant recommendations the rooms are clean and spacious one downside is the size of the shower i made the mistake of turning around to wash my hair and knocked the tap to hot there also a lift for those staying on higher floors would definitely come back,1.0
because everything is smooth and working well nice room rather calm nice and welcoming staff tasty breakfast nothins to think about so that you can save your energy for city discoveries and fun,1.0
the location is very convenient you only a short walk to la ramblas the desk staff was nice but the manager was useless the air conditioning was working but no one came to fix it the first night i tried to open the window for air but it is so loud all night long from the foot traffic below when the manager finally came to my room hours later after i complained a time he was rude and tried to insinuate that it was my fault that the ac was working as opposed to a dead battery in the wall switch i would not stay there again,0.0
i was very pleased with this hotel the cost is worth the room location and hospitality the rooms are very spacious and air conditioned the staff was very polite and happy to help i did not dine in the hotel because it near a ton of great restaurants and i was only here for a short period of time the room was very comfortable the hotel is located in a great tourist area with lots of shops restaurants etc nearby,1.0
the hotel is located in the area of montjuic just some minutes walking from the city center the views from the restaurant and the terrace are amazing the rooms are nice and well distributed they have a nice bathtub big king size beds and also have a lovely balcony to let the nice summer breeze in the service is fantastic the front desk staff is always on point and are willing to go above and beyond to solve any issue that you might have it was always a pleasure to be greeted by them and to see their smiling faces day to day overall a fantastic property top choice i could not recommend this hotel enough until next time,1.0
this felt more like a business hotel but was perfect for my two nights three days of sightseeing the area is unusual in that it essentially residential and not that close to transport links there is a lot of graffiti around the area but it more street art than tagging and some was quite good my experience at reception was great the lady was very helpful and took the time to explain the best things to do in barcelona which i found very useful i upgraded to a junior suite at reception as it only an extra a night i did regret it as the room was large with separate sections a big spa style bath two tvs king size bed and most importantly a nespresso machine the only thing missing was a balcony being on the ninth floor it was very handy to the floor pool the view from the pool is stunning and goes right around so you can see sagrada familia in the distance i enjoyed sunbathing and reading my book there the pool was quite small however i got the breakfast which was if you book in advance but not great the meats were not high quality and scrambled eggs mushy although the parties were very fresh and there was a good selection of fruit for it ok the room was spacious and very clean plus you can turn the air con up and a great stay and i recommend upgrading to the junior suite,1.0
comfy clean and fantastic staff the beds were very comfortable staff outstanding room a bit too warm but overall terrific place the pillows in the bed cleanliness delicious breakfast and polite and supportive staff made our weekend in ireland very memorable big thanks to stefania,1.0
i stayed here night with my family i would say the overall setting of the hotel is lovely really grand looking and great decor the staff were friendly our room was ready on time so we got a free drink at the bar our room was nice it was a bit shabby in places though there were dead fly squashed to the wall and the side walls had scuff marks etc part of the wall was peeling it was very clean just a bit shabby though i would say the hotel should make use of the side entrances this would make for a much quicker journey to the tram stop the doors are there so let your customers use them it a min walk to the tram stop and a min tram too town which is nice enough you can get the number tram from sq and get off at alexandraplien the stop after the zoo,1.0
great hotel situated on o connell bridge entertainment was good food was good rooms were good if its a younger type of nightlife you want then its just a walk across the bridge to temple bar this hotel is very deceiving doesnt look that big from outside once inside its amazing,1.0
we stayed here for a night our room was massive with great views out the huge windows bed was so comfy and shower was brilliant we stayed in a such a great location though we went out for a wonder round and found ourselves surrounded by armed riot police and masked men protesting about an anti government protest we was so scared unfortunatly it rained when we was there so didnt get to go in the pool but we went to look at it and the view from up there was breathtaking breakfast was included it was very nice lots of quality food and a great variety loved the freshly squeezed orange juice,1.0
it gives me great pleasure to review the stunning divani caravel hotel athens last week my family and i had the pleasure to call the property home whilst visiting the beautiful capital city of greece upon our arrival we were professionally and promptly greeted by concierge and reception staff our suite was that of above and beyond expectation and quality that was comfortable and spacious we could unwind within the suite with ease it contained flat screen televisions a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom the property is beautifully maintained spotless and reception is it a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us whilst we stayed with you everybody from check in through to house keeping food and beverage services were brilliant and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service you all made us feel right at home our experience was indeed sublime the roof top pool is very memorable for our and the food cocktails and stunning uninterrupted view of athens and the parthenon unforgettable breath taking breakfast was delicious and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay perfectly located in athens lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the but do yourself favor and savor the divani caravel club sandwich,1.0

this hotel while pricey is one of those hotels that gets everything right quiet elegant tucked away on a quiet street in a bustling tourist neighborhood the mercer has it all the staff is smart and accommodating the roof deck has a stunning view and tiny swimming pool the restaurants serve clever takes of traditional food all the key sites are within walking distance the rooms exemplify catalan chic and are also well thought out and well designed although the building is ancient and was remodeled when it became a hotel the architects and interior designers provided all the essentials kettle closet space reading lights while still keeping the unique historical character it took me a few days to realize we had no natural light in the room as our balcony looked onto the interior warning the hotel didn t tell us that it s hard for taxis to find coming in from the airport our cab driver gave up and dropped us at via laeitana we didn t have heavy bags and were able to carry them but if you need to be dropped off at the door then bring instructions to show your driver leaving is easy as the concierge can call a taxi when you go and they have a special map with walking instructions from the main squares nearby,1.0
this hotel is in a fantastic location for all the sights of barcelona the staff are amazingnothing is too much troublethe rooftop plunge pool is to die forthe food is excellentthe cleaning team are brilliant definitely well worth a visit,1.0
we arrived for nights we got a huge room with free minibar equipped with soft drinks and beer the stay was pleasant and the staff was kind and helpful anytime we asked for guidance or location is very walking distance from the central station and most of the old city attractions,1.0
it very hard to book a hotel when you do know the city we thought it a hilton so they usually are located in good areas this hotel was definitely not where a tourist wants to be if you stay in amsterdam rather book a hotel near the central railway station the hotel was ok the first time we stayed in a room with windows near the ceiling no view whatsoever anyhow you would not have wanted to look out the window as it was surrounded by ferry was an inconvenience to us especially on the day we departed we had a very early flight and the ferry was not operational that early so we had to take a taxi which cost we been near the station we could have taken the train to the airport for a lot less rather pay a little more and stay central hope this helps you in planning your stay in amsterdam,1.0
this is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in we thought we would treat ourselves to a hotel for the last couple of nights of our honey moon and it was fantastic they treated us so well gave us champagne when we arrived to celebrate our honeymoon the room was lovely and the bed was the comfiest the staff were really friendly and liked to make sure we were very happy the views from the roof top pool are just incredible the spa therapists were very friendly and great at what they do we had a fantastic treatment from them followed by prosecco and chocolates thank you for a fantastic honeymoon,1.0

we chose to stay at the hilton garden inn for one night because we were taking the irish ferry in the morning and this hotel was rather close to the port we booked two rooms one a family suite and the other was two double beds both rooms were clean and well appointed the family suite was spacious and comfortable for four people this hotel does not have air conditioning at this time for our visit that was a problem but if it was any warmer that could been uncomfortable they are installing ac the hotel is doing construction and while loud in the afternoon it was quiet by evening overall this hotel met our needs for our visit,1.0
the location is really good everything by walk good to visit plaka and acropolis nice hotel modern and the view of acropolis is really nice the room is comfortable modern but small for persons it was ok because we spend only nights i will recommend this hotel they have pools and is warm heated i love it yep it was hard to found in grèce,1.0
what a great hotel only two stars but we went off the reviews on and here and got ta say it great staff very friendly and helpful the roof terrace has a small pool and a bar that does cold food to a high standard and whichever cocktail you ask them to make really good sun trap and everything done to a high standard the rooms are small but well presented and very clean no fridge but much better than most star hotels i stayed in before but the the location is amazing in the gothic quarter it is a short walk from port olimpic short walk from the main square in the town centre and short walk to tourist hot spots the tour bus route goes right past the hotel too highly recommend best value for money hotel i ever been in and i tracked maybe five times a year,1.0
well located clean very helpful and friendly staff only negative remark is related with window insulation to street noise during the night nice touch the free tea in the lobby area,1.0

location was kind of bad the area around the hotel was not good a lot of homeless people guys taking drugs i did feel safe metro was near by room was bit noisy in the shower you got only super hot water when it was hot outside and super cold when it was bit cold outside so it was inpossible to take shower service was good,1.0

the hotel is placed at the new acropolis museum under the acropolis itseslf there is really nice view from the top the hotel where a restaurant as well as the section with two jaccuzi are placed so the position is the right one if you want to see the historical centre of athens it is around minutes from the airport by the taxi the buses stop from the hotel and it is the best way how to see all the main see the positives supperb nice nice personalsecond the neutrals the room was not very spacy our room was with the balcony over the street oposit the acropolis it was quite noisy when we opened the door but after closing them it damped it well i can not sey the walls were thin but we could hear voices from the other we slept good but the weather was actually a bit rainy and there was no need to run the which was not the kind of central had not negative experience in this will recommend the hotel to my friends for sure,1.0
my wife i went to barcelona to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite the hotel is so well appointed and the rooftop bar is the perfect place to spend an staff were ever so helpful and accommodating i can not thank them enough it perfectly located on la rambla only a few minutes walk from the amazing la boqueria market indeed most of the interesting sights in barcelona were within walkable would give this hotel stars if i could,1.0
not happy as we were all bitten by mosquitos were in the room in the morning upon showering in the morning discovered that the bodywash dispenser was compeltely advising reception the same morning iy was met with a response of complete silence by marta who handled our check was them spoken to by someone else on reception in spanish and she just raised her eyebrows and walked was ok the only redeeming feature of our would stay again,1.0

reception professional staff warm welcome welcome drink accompaniment to the clean so confortable bed huge tv wifi in the room turn down servicebest breakfast ever i barely saw such a variety and quality and healthy food on a hotel buffet breakfast you also have a lot of choice included in the breakfast service is ok,1.0
we stayed here after a day river cruise it was within walking distance from the cruise port which was great it is centrally located near the train station because it is on a busy corner it can be a bit noisy we were able to upgrade to a superior room which was amazing stop number is right out in front of the hotel they will sell the off tickets at the hotel one of the other great amenities is that the mini bar is complimentary and there is coffee and tea in the room i did not eat that the restaurant the breakfast buffet is euro each a bit pricey overall it is a really unique and friendly hotel,1.0
stayed here for me son birthday we asked for rooms close to each other prior to our visit and the hotel were true to their word and gave us rooms opposite each other the rooms were big enough and very comfortable we had a street facing room and heard no noise at at night due to the double doors over the roof area is great with a small pool and bar very comfortable for a relaxing great with plenty recommend the nespresso bar at front of hotel snack food was great and good value for walk into the town centre is about mins and the harbour a little further we walked in and got the metro back which we found very safe even late at very enjoyable stay and would recommend hotel without hesitation,1.0
stayed at this hotel for week hotel is nice room are big bit outdated but fine lobby downstairs is lovely room high up has good view good coffee shops etc pool floor is nice overall would stay her again,1.0
we loved this hotel with extremely helpful staff and a fantastic location but selfishly loud drunks roam the streets of temple bar shouting and singing early into the morning with no air conditioning and unusually warm weather we needed to keep the windows open on our balcony room and had trouble sleeping even on the fourth floor if you want to take part in the fun in temple bar then this will not bother you the restaurant in the hotel unusual casual food which is very tasty so can be a good option for an early gym but you can exercise by walking to just about everything you need to see from here so do bother with the tour buses,1.0
honestly the stairs are mountains my kneecaps gave in on day had to get on my friends back and have him hoist me up and dump me into my bed that i assume was low budget as i almost snapped my spine in half as my back collided with what was supposed to be comfort on the bright side vincenzo was a friendly guy,0.0
very clean fab food the roof top only bad thing i can say is that it is situated up a dark street and would recommend walking alone to it the air con was that i would go back,1.0
great location and very helpful staff i return because the management and quality of the staff is consistent over the past years i do eat at the hotel but observe that other guests enjoy their breakfasts and drinks at the bar,1.0
visited for nights as a group of females in mid july the location of this hotel is absolutely excellent can not be faulted right in the heart of the gothic quarter with numerous cafés bars restaurants and shops all within a stones throw within walking distance of las ramblas the beach and we also walked to the sagrada familia the latter took about minutes but was a pleasant walk through barcelona the room was basic with single beds but was clean spacious had a large bathroom and a small balcony the safe is a night and is payable on staff on reception were extremely helpful when we struggled to check in for our flight online also a taxi to the airport from here is approx and takes minutes there is one downside to this hotel and that the noise if you sleep well like us then this will not be a problem but if not then remember your earplugs all in all a basic clean hotel in an excellent location with fab reception staff would highly recommend,1.0
i really likes this hotel the rooms were confortable the breakfast is is something i really did appreciate the lady at the check in counter wanted a deposit of problem is that my card is expired and she wanted it in cash i was on a duty trip for i paid the room and i mentionned that i will not use the mini bar or any other had only left for diner and taxis but she absolutely wanted the deposit of she clearly made me feel that i have to pay or get out so i had no choice i made the deposit and had left for was a very bad experience and i think that this hotel should review its policy because this deposit thing is a bit defenetly wo go back to the hotels of nh se to stay at hilton sheraton hyatt and they never require this deposit,0.0
first sheets are dirty second i found bugs on bed which made me stay up and not have a metro goes under the hotel so it like the sound or the shake of it can easily be felt till late at night and early morning i do not recommend this hotel you can have better for the same price and same area,0.0

the new hotel was a perfect spot for our family of for our three days in athens it was perfectly situated for us to walk to the plaka and acropolis as well as the shopping had one superior room and two connecting rooms with enough beds for my adult children to spread out and have their own space the bathrooms were nicely appointed and the rooms were very comfortable each room had a terrace which we did not use because it as during our stay but black out shades were great for keeping the room cool and dark desk staff and all hotel staff were very helpful and kind during our visit helping us with reservations as well as making sure all our needs were had drinks on the roof the bar and restaurant are pretty limited up there but we enjoyed the view we also enjoyed the lovely breakfast buffet each would highly recommend this hotel we had a great stay there,1.0
well even the taxi driver did not immediately find the hotel entrance they run kind organic luxury cotton shop and you access the hotel via the shop original rooms are zen basic products of good quality everything is rather basic but not cheap stuff and forget a room with a view you are in the middle of kifisias however they have a nice roof top terrace and there you have a nice view on the friendly staff basic but good breakfast and outside the hotel really nice bars and coffee places,1.0

we spent nights at this place one block south of diagonal the area is nice with bars and restaurants within walking distance the metro station is a short walk away max minutes the rooms are big and the beds a very comfortable even the sounds of the street are limited to an absolute minimum on our especially would like to mention me josep from the reception who was very helpful und friendly the only thing i would have expected wasthat the deposit box and coffee on the room with the coffeemaker would be included the prize for the nights nevertheless this little extra fee does not lower our experience made would stay there again,1.0
my family and i stayed at the spencer in june the hotel was nice but we had a very bad experience with parking and retrieving our rental car first of all the hotel is not set up for parking they have an underground garage two blocks away with no attendants after a few attempts i parked our rental and registered my license number and space with the front desk the day i was going to leave for the airport i went to move the car and found out i had a boot clamp attached here i was parked in a wrong space even though i was given instructions to park in this place and the garage was full someone decide to call the parking authority vs call the hotel because i had to catch a plane i had the hotel deal with hertz the clamp boot caused damaged to the wheel well euros later i find out my credit card does not cover ireland collision of course the hotel claims no responsibility and they gave me a hard time when i was trying to resolve lesson learned parking at ireland hotels is a challenge avoid a rental car in ireland and or check your credit card for ireland collision coverage chase visa is the only exception,0.0

we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite for one night as we were in transit we were greeted by name at the front desk without presenting ourselves and this level of service continued throughout our stay the family room was very modern and spacious note that the wall and door separating the bathroom from the bedroom was a smoked glass this made our teenage daughters uncomfortable when using the bathroom the breakfast was great and the location was adequately close to the plaka,1.0

you get what you pay for here although money doesn t go very far in central barcelona as a rule the family room and hotel in general appears recently refurbished and is clean comfortable and modern if and functional rather than inspirational the hotel location is reasonable it s a minute walk to the local metro station which is a relatively short ride to the more trendy and touristy parts of town and is very well located close to overground train station it s also a walk to the camp nou stadium for the breakfast is not included an extra per person i wouldn t return here for the experience but this is about as pleasant as cheap and cheerful gets,1.0
my family stayed at the novus city hotel during the last leg of our family mediterranean cruise vacation the hotel is in a great location with a subway stop nearby that takes you anywhere you would want to go in the city within a matter of minutes the view from the roof top bar and pool is just awesome as you can see a great portion of the city along with the acropolis the rooms are quaint and nicely appointed the hotel staff are friendly and quick to address any need that you may have there is a bar tender named jimmy hendricks who was the star of the hotel staff he made delicious hand crafted cocktails and always served them with a smile and a friendly gesture,1.0

we revisited this lovely gracious hotel after six years and it is every bit as good now as then you ca beat the location across the square from the gothic cathedral and down from the gate leading into the bari gothic or gothic quarter which is the most interesting part of barcelona the hotel has a nice elegant restaurant with great service and it less expensive than many trendy spots which are half as good this square is a far superior location to the huge plaza catalonia which is noisy and surrounded by busy streets with honking traffic you will not be disappointed in this hotel,1.0
visited dublin for a short family stay to go to an event at the aviva stadium from the moment we walked through the door of the hotel right up until we checked out the staff and facilities were fabulous every member of staff we encountered was polite and courteous and could not have done enough for us nothing was too much hassle even on returning from the stadium along with quite a few other guests quite late in the evening staff were fantastic and very helpful even though evidently very busy our room was spotless and very comfortable food was excellent and lots to choose from i will definitely be returning to clayton cardiff lane on my next visit to dublin my only complaint is i did stay for longer,1.0
arrived in a very hot barcelona on july for a weeks stay lovely reception area and one of the most helpful receptionist we ever come across did get his name but gentleman with glasses and grey hair booking in was easy and we were directed to our room really nice room with a balcony which over looked the road which did get busy at times but did really bother us the bed was huge and very comfortable the bathroom was tasteful with black marble shower over the bath toilet and sink with plenty of storage around it talking of storage the wardrobe was fine but not so many hangers but drawer space very limited we had bed and breakfast which was nice again the continental choices were better than the cooked items but plenty of fruit yoghurt cakes juices etc and the coffee was really good location of the hotel is good with metro only a couple of minutes stroll away buy a ticket very good value rides and people can use it it costs euros but we like walking so walked to places like sagrada familia mins and la rambla mins all in all a really good hotel would definitely return,1.0
location is perfect next to the train station and the rooms are very confortable the staff is very welcoming and shampoo is a bit strange but nothing impossible at this time the hostel is almost brand new and looks very modern and elegant,1.0
location excellent a ten minute walk away from the heart of the rld but secluded street the hotel exists in shields you from the more rowdy quaint little hotel with glitzy little touches the decor will not be to everyone taste i personallyprefer a more traditional approach to interior decoration but that is a minor my experience is that the hotel was extremely clean when i visited both the common areas as well as the rooms including the as coffee available in the iron and ironing board upon fantastic highly evident that judgement of the staff attitude has played its part during the recruitment process elena in particular requires a special mention her extremely pleasant attitude and readiness to help with minor queries and requests impressed me quite a bit both the morning staff did their bits as for money i am not exactly sure in terms of bang for your buck just a shade too expensive is my i return gladly the overall experience ensures it is worth i recommend the place based on everything but the of course,1.0

first of all the woman at the desk on check in was nice but after this we were met with a wave rudeness from the staff i asked for a taxi to go to our concert and the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and made me feel embarrassed in front of other guests checking in then when we went for breakfast the following morning that we already paid for at check in we were told we had to pay each when we stated we paid the charge for breakfast already the girl argued with us and would not accept that we paid we were told to sit down but we were given no apology for the mistake then during breakfast i went to the bathroom and while i was gone a member of staff tried to chat up my girlfriend i expect this behaviour from a drunken buffoon in a nightclub at in the morning but not from a member of staff at a four star hotel i would never stay in this hotel again it totally ruined our weekend and would not recommend it either,0.0

i can not say enough good things about this hotel my wife and i were recently honeymooning in ireland and had the privilege of staying at the westin dublin for nights not only was the hotel beautiful inside and out but so was the staff everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful the location does get any better either grafton street shopping and restaurants were just a few blocks away everything else was a short minute walk if possible request a room facing the alluring trinity college you could get used to waking up that view every morning lastly be sure to visit their bar downstairs the mint bar i still dreaming about those cocktails we will defiantly be back in the future,1.0
great stay at the radisson as usual the hotel is located in a fantastic location about minutes walk from the acropolis as a reference point this means that taxis will be very cheap tip use uber a lot soon as we arrived at the hotel late at night exhausted we were greeted with a room upgrade which had a beautiful view of the acropolis right in front the hotel is very clean neat and breakfast was delicious and the staff was generally would absolutely recommend this hotel great value for money,1.0
excellent apartments modern spacious and clean only a minute walk to the nearest tube and close by to the fountains we found clubs and bars close by but only a taxi drive from main area on evenings bargain prices would stay here again,1.0
overall a great place to stay good location some noise through the closed window but very little internet connection was good room was clean bed was very comfortable bedroom was nice and big good service at the counter,1.0
stayed here for nights and it was rail station in easy reach and always taxis on hand staff were generally pleasant and helpful my only real issue is that i was there for work and my room did not have a desk to work at i was told this was true of all the rooms so i had to balance my lap top on my lap to work not good,1.0
we stayed here on a family trip to amsterdam the hotel is situated right in the center of town minutes walk from central station the main sights tour boats many restaurants and shops are all close by within easy walking hotel looks a bit old fashioned from the outside but the lobby and our rooms were all very modern our rooms had large comfortable beds were well equipped clean with modern bathrooms with showers we did not try the breakfast but went to starbucks nearby instead was rather cumbersome and took a long time we needed to fill in our address again although they had it from our reservation and they needed copies of passports for each room the lady at reception was not particularly friendly maybe she was just stressed as she also had to help another less experienced the day of in the morning the cleaning crew just went into each of our rooms without knocking while we were still in the room in the shower etc we found this rather awkward surely they could communicate who has checked out and then clean the room lastly the concierge service was very friendly and summary we had a great stay right in the center of amsterdam,1.0
what a wonderful experience my travels take me to many countries and can say that this hotel is up there staff and service is of a high standard sundeck view is amazing with a great pool area drinks on a summers afternoon overlooking the acropolis is sensational will be back,1.0

do be fooled by the aging exterior the rooms are very modern with high quality finishes several offering magnificent views of the acropolis pluses include amazing pool phenomenal rooftop bar setting and first class spa despite the amazing setting however service at the rooftop bar is nearly abysmal and a negative incentive to go up there overall the service was very good it a good mile plus walk to plaka so plan accordingly especially in the hot months i would be happy to stay here again,1.0
the hotel is at a good location only minutes walk from the train station after a day in town it is quit to relax from the busy day rooms are very good an in the upper section with a great view nice bar and good service,1.0

since years i was staying in your hotel after opening it was really good value for money in a perfect location and really im the centre location is still great but despite of that everything else worsen neither the rooms or the hotel has undergone any renovation or replacement the walls are dirty and full of spots in the restaurant as well need some new paint the furniture is partly broken and need some paint or replacement as well the included breakfast is a great idea and used to be really nice but now the area for breakfast is dirty nothing is refilled flies everywhere the handle of the breadcontainer is broken etc why did you stop it that the guest select one pastry or sandwich from the bar why did you stop that the guest orders his coffee from the bar and serve now bad filter coffee in a thermos during our days stay the bed linen got changed only once probably because we asked the floor in the room and bathroom was not cleaned at all in those days the staff working at reception was not really helpful neither interested to make our stay and time in barcelona to a good experience also i booked a double room and we got a mini tiny room on the evacuation plan this room was asssinged as a single room but reception said it is a double room and showed again no effort to give any alternatives i am really disappointed,1.0
returned home from amsterdam early hours of this morning stayed at westcord art hotel adults and children my first impressions of the hotel were that it needs a little tlc on the outside the inside reception area was lovely and bright the staff were friendly polite and accommodating throughout our whole stay i felt our family room was a little dated and the pull down bed that the children slept on was damaged obviously not the hotels fault but the beds were comfortable and clean our other family members had more renovated rooms the pool at the back of the hotel not owned by the hotel but you can get free passes from reception was a huge bonus and my youngest son went there every day of our holiday there is a bus stop a small walk away and a bus that will take you to centraal station round the corner from the bus stop is a row of there are children parks and swings down nearly every street which is a huge bonus when travelling with a energetic year old we did eat in the restaurant but we often had coffee and drinks it looked clean and it was well staffed would we stay here again yes without a doubt we would love to go back,1.0
this hotel was excellent very clean room and the hotel itself is beautiful the breakfast is very very good and probably has the best view of acropolis overall i would definitely stay here again or recommend it to,1.0
out of what a beautiful hotel my husband and i had a room in the exchange building the staff were prompt and courteous the room was user friendly and had everything we needed the bed was very comfortable the pool in the vault of the bank building was spectacular lovely hot and cool plunging pools very nice sauna and a stunning pool everything down to the shampoo and conditioner was on point when i find myself back in amsterdam i will for sure be staying at this property again thank you w amsterdam for a perfect stay,1.0
location the view on the acropolis the view on the ancient ruins the staff is very nice and welcoming breakfast is nice the decoration of the rooms is nice rooms are small for the price even though the equipment is nice i think it a bit overpriced compared to the price in the surroundings nice hotel well located but a bit pricey for the room size,1.0
stayed at hotel recently in july high season in a club level room with king sized bed hotel located in safe area with great access to public transportation and many of the local tourist attractions for a reasonable cost the room was large and comfortable with good ac the bed was very comfortable and the best sleep we had while in greece montenegro italy and spain bathroom was good sized also with separate and toilet both of us were easily able to get ready without bumping into each other room had a safe that fit a laptop along with all our other valuables desk was spacious although chair not super comfy and a large flat screen tv the club had nice sitting area snacks drinks etc during the day they also had a good breakfast included each day with our room staying at the club level provided private check and concierge service in the club dangxia was very helpful and provided a wealth of info that made our time in barcelona the best possible have already recommended the hotel to a couple of colleagues who are traveling in oct and nov,1.0
we loved this hotel the staff was helpful and hotel is located in the middle of the city and right in front of the tram it was easy to get anywhere the restaurant in the hotel is four star and that includes the breakfast i would recommend this hotel watch out for the leaking shower though we used a towel against the bottom of the door to prevent it leaking out into the the entire bathroom is in a public lot and the hotel gives a slight discount,1.0
amazing experience excellent service very clean modern decoration so romantic the breakfast had many options the terrace offered the most amazing view i would definitely recommend it the only problem is that its a little far from the city centre but you can take the metro or a taxi and you get there in mins,1.0
the location was perfect just between syntegma square and plaka very easy to walk to everything in central athens room was small but comfortable and clean good sleep quality even during the day staff were nice expedited room cleaning so that we could check in early and loaned us an umbrella for the unseasonable rain only potential con to be aware of is that the shower is very small it was fine for us but my husband is and only just managed,1.0
we had a great stay at the harding the rooms were comfortable but oddly shaped we were on the fifth floor and had to maneuver around some angles in the ceiling it did get a bit noisy on saturday night with the pub below us but they close at it is centrally located and we could walk to most things,1.0
the location of this hotel is very good it very close to temple bar area and many other attractions the rooms are big and clean the beds are comfortable breakfast could have more options the thing that really bothered me was that i could hear a tram every few minutes and it really annoying in a whole if you are not sensitive to noises as i am i would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
multiple terasses swimming pools small but seems to be the case in a lot of other barcelona hotels very nice personnel decent food at decent prices and a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere rooftop terasse has nice views,1.0
stayed in late june for one night the room was modern clean and not cramped at all the staff is friendly and very helpful the lobby has lemon and cucumber water available at all times free of charge and a small relaxing lounge and bar as far as the location if you are going to the van gogh museum it s just down the street there are stops close as well to get to other parts of town vondle park is right across the street treat yourself and stroll through the park plud walking up trough the park is a great start of finish to walking into the main part of town my wife and i can not wait for our next trip to amsterdam and stay at hotel piet hein,1.0
we stayed here for one night perfect location really nice rooms clean and tidy the hotel staff were really friendly and a big shout out to the bar staff in vertigo bar ryan and ivan brilliant service really looked after us a really great atmosphere i would definitely recommend this bar,1.0
this was a good surprise very friendly and helpful staff nice and quiet rooms with a super comfortable bed the shower had the best water pressure ever very important when you have long hair and wash it the had a bit of a british private club feeling about it the only downside was the pool on the rooftop or lack thereof it was more a bassin i just want to write that in case you are going there and are expecting to be able to swim,1.0
this hotel exceeded my expectations after having read some not so great reviews before my trip i really ca understand them now that i have stayed here this hotel is beautiful and the decor is true athenian style if you looking for an ultra modern hotel then it is not for you but it is not without its modern amenities we stayed in an internal room and although we had no window the room did not feel claustrophobic because of the beautiful stained glass window that you were able to light up in an evening the air con is really cold which is great after walking miles in the hot athens summer staff are extremely helpful and polite and make sure the hotel runs smoothly nothing is too much to ask here the breakfast is lovely but gets busy around as it would in a hotel of this size the pool is great and beds are comfortable often it can be hard to get a sunbed in the afternoon but this is to be expected we had one evening meal here and although it was pricey it was one of the nicest meals i have ever had and really you pay for the view of the acropolis we loved this hotel and would definitely return during out next trip to athens,1.0
the hotel is located in plaze de can enjoy a wonderful view of barclona at the roof where the pool is located to the left of the hotel there is the arena shopping mall with food court and beside it located many restaurants and coffee shops to the right of the hotel there is shopping streets with also restaurants and coffee shops facing the hotel u can walk minutes to the magical fountain with the additional to the above the metro is far min from the entrance of the hotel the staff were friendly especially sabilla which gave us a specific details how to go and switch metros to sagrada familia breakfast was good the room was ok,1.0
loved the hoxton and was very much looking forward to our stay there very hip with all the amenities great staff and service and in a great part of town would highly recommend based on issues regarding check in though that wasted about mins on arrival trying to find our reservation and was only compensated with drink it was extremely stressful to go through that process and repeat ourselves to levels of top of that we came back to our room one day to find it open major concerns regarding security as anyone could walked in and stolen something,1.0
my wife i went to barcelona to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite the hotel is so well appointed and the rooftop bar is the perfect place to spend an staff were ever so helpful and accommodating i can not thank them enough it perfectly located on la rambla only a few minutes walk from the amazing la boqueria market indeed most of the interesting sights in barcelona were within walkable would give this hotel stars if i could,1.0
we stayed two nights at the temple bar hotel as part of our trip through ireland the staff was very friendly and helpful we were able to check in early and were even given an upgraded room we were at the back of the hotel which was good since it shielded is from the noise of this rowdy district the location is very convenient,1.0
stayed here with my partner for nights hotel room was nice good size and very clean the room was equip with everything we needed and it was cleaned every day the breakfast was nice with plenty to choose from location is very good as it is close to the city center less than minute walk and also it is far enough out that it is quiet for a city at night time staff were all very nice and very negative to add about this hotel we had a great stay and will be returning in the future,1.0
this was the second time my husband and i stayed at the hotel granvia nights in july and nights july we liked the hotel very much in but our time in barcelona was too short this year we decided to end our two week trip in northern spain and france at hotel granvia because it was our favorite hotel during our previous trip to spain hotel staff members were generally pleasant and professional i especially appreciated the young gentleman at the front desk who helped me get my laptop to connect with the hotel internet i will long remember the warm smiles of karen one of the staff at the breakfast and afternoon tea buffets she was very attentive to guests and i enjoyed talking with her briefly a couple of times when she was not too busy we enjoyed everything about this hotel very comfortable bed and room excellent breakfasts in a very nice area the terrace the computer and library area and the neighborhood the decor was very interesting and appropriate to the hotel history the location was ideal for us we could easily walk to many of the places we visited but the subway and airport bus were nearby when we needed them,1.0
my family and i came and got double rooms to stay for nights we absolutely loved this hotel and found that the location was perfect very close to many popular tourist attractions and to metro and bus stops the staff was extremely helpful in helping us make the most of our trip and providing information about the activities we wished to include in our trip we will definitely stay here again if we return to barcelona,1.0
stayed nights for wedding anniversary perfect location in city right on major tram lines so you walk out your day and can head anywhere in town you are right next to the museum district van gogh and riiks yet you are away from the some of the more crowded noisier seedier areas you are also literally adjacent to the lovely vondelpark beautiful for morning jog and midday stroll another street over has all the high end shopping hotel itself has excellent overlooking the main intersection club lounge had outstanding breakfast and dinner and staff was fantastic however gets a bit crowded hotel itself was fully modernized especially rooms which were super clean and contemporary beware beds are very very firm elevators a bit tricky with card readers not working so well but everyone managed very modern type hotel and i mean that as a sincere compliment will definitely stay here again when we return to amsterdam,1.0
we quite enjoyed this place good vibe great aesthetics from the funky art on the walls and hallways to the city map they give you that worth framing we enjoyed the first floor bar or zero floor bar in europe and the breakfast buffet which i thought was decent value at night the floor had a great open air patio that looked out over the city but we were chased back indoors by all the smokers rooms clean staff nice it a few minute walk to the center of town but the metro is close and efficient,1.0
we arrived in the early hours to be greeted by a very friendly member of the concierge who was efficient and helpful and quickly showed us to our room we slept very well and the bed was heavenly after we had attended a business meeting the following morning we spent the afternoon relaxing by the pool on the roof terrace with drink service to our sun beds simply stunning views over the city will not disappoint,1.0
this hotel had everything you need spa was great the rooms where nice with a lovely deep bath clean the food was little bit away from centre but a tram ride is all you need highly recommended i booking again for this year,1.0
very clean and spacious hotel with great facilities definitely try the spa rooms have great beds and are very well equipped and impressive the restaurant offers great food to suit most tastes we both enjoyed dinner and breakfast was a real treat this hotel is in a great location and is always good for celebrity spotting if that of interest great staff especially syeed and nicky logue gm a real pleasure to meet them both they make you feel very welcome,1.0
the hotel is a decent size building very clean and well presented the staff are unbelievably helpful nothing was any trouble all the staff went above and beyond but vassilis was a standout for us there were of us in total my family from america were unlucky enough to have a suitcase go missing from the airport but the hotel staff were non stop in trying to locate it for hotel is very well placed for the acropolis and syntagma square etc and most attractions were within walking distance the rooftop has a real wow factor when you first walk in there at night but the service seemed a bit slow for drinks as has been mentioned in previous reviews the breakfast is really good lots of variety to cater for all tastes from fruit various breads drinks etc it was a very nice experience the bedrooms were a little small but about right for a city hotel why only stars the lifts were very small hot and slow and there were only two in operation the kids were happy to use the stairs but it was a little frustrating sometimes waiting for the lifts all in all a very easy going and positive experience which i would recommend to anyone next time we are in athens i will certainly you for looking after us,1.0
a few minutes walk to glories station here are some from the airport take the metro zona university line to torrassa station then take the train to glories to picasso museum take metro llacuna to jaume walk about to park guell from glories take to catalunya then take green to vallcarca,1.0

was shocked at the state of the hotel compared to photos on site all furnishings are run down and broken elevator scary and not worth the wait was happy to climb the stairs there no bed spreads just one thin sheet and a paper thin mattress with a one inch pillow toilet disgusting has seen bleach in what looks like years shower basin too small for my partner to fit in water goes everywhere we where very rudely informed to pay an extra per night for air conditioning which is so loud it sounds like a helicopter landing all night long the cafe is permanently closed no fridge or toiletries no phone or kettle or any ammenities whatsoever in room when i politely asked if there was a share fridge to put drinks because it stinking hot was rudely told no i could sleep due to the noise outside very unsavoury area lots of homeless people and beggars outside all night long it also right next door to a betting venue for more noise in our room there are bed bugs and our view is of a burnt out building next door under no circumstances stay here,0.0

we stayed at volkshotel for two nights in a family room and totally loved the place great feeling friendly staff good rooms lovely view etc the pools and the sauna on the rooftop are awesome no need to bring towels great food both in the restaurant and in the lobby loved the breakfast do go to any of the nearby breakfast places the hotel is much better value for money worked great and the room was very quiet despite being on the floor below the the downsides are really strong perfume smell in the room way too much probably from cleaning products rather hard beds especially in the elevated area in the family rooms also note that if you staying in a family room and have smaller kids you probably wo like for them to sleep upstairs steep staircase not enough protection from falling down thanks for a great stay,1.0

i stayed at the dublin hilton twice on business for a total of three weeks it is a solid choice for business travelers to dublin and is next to the green line luas for easy transport out to the business parks and suburbs south of the has been quick and professional as was i had rooms on both the and floors and there is an important difference between the two even though the floor is ostensibly reserved for hhonors silver members i much preferred the floor room while both rooms were clean plenty big and offered a desk and chair and a comfortable bed my room on the floor while it had been recently remodeled per the front desk had usable power outlets on the headboard wall no place to plug in my phone to charge and use as an alarm or charge my watch the lights on either side of the bed were wired into the headboard behind the bed and whatever outlet they plugged into was had to call the front desk and get an extension cord sent up which i had to run all the way across the room next to the tv stand in order to get the power i needed on the nightstand shelf i stayed in a hotel of any class that did have power available at the head of the bed and i am astonished that a hotel would overlook this critical second issue i had with the floor bedroom was a complete,1.0
we stayed at hotel piet hein for nights and probably nights too long my partner surprised me with the trip to amsterdam for my birthday and i was really looking forward to it on the day as i had not known up until the night before when we arrived to the hotel i was happy with the lobby area as it was quite modern and nice the man on the desk gave us poor directions to our room he was very clear on exactly which way we must go when we get to the stairs once we found our room we was a little shocked at actually how small it was we knew it would be a snug double but it was very snug there was barely any room for our luggage and we struggled to get down the sides of the bed also the room was quite dated not all of it but the carpet was horrid it looked like they updated the rest of the hotel and then got the carpet out of the loft once i opened the door to the bathroom a wall of sewage stench hit our noses and we rushed to open the window in the bedroom where i found bird poo on the inside of the window and someone used plaster on the floor next to my side of the bed also in the bathroom the towel rack was above the toilet so over the course of our stay the towels kept falling,0.0
luckily for us we love it but it definitely quirky we returned to the palacete after staying here years ago it has not changed and is still as charming as it was then the hour complimentary snacks and drinks are a great bonus highly recommend the versailles suites this time we stayed in the suite on the left of the main lounge unfortunately the name escapes me which is much better in configuration to the suite on the right so try and request that one the only downside is you can hear the conversations of guests in the lounge next door and vice versa which for us with children was problematic trying to get our kids to speak quietly so as not to disturb the other guests eating and drinking in the lounge the location is excellent super convenient to la rambla and the cathedral an awesome bonus is the proximity to ciudad condal recommended by gemma at the hotel and an excellent tapas restaurant just minutes away in the next block when not snacking at the hotel we had every meal here for the entire duration of our stay in barcelona if you like small quirky hotels at a reasonable price you ca go wrong with this one we will continue to return,1.0

the decor of this hotel is charming we loved our room which was immaculate the breakfast buffet was delicious they gave us the option of ordering from a menu which we did the first day the next days we just ate from the buffet which was very large fresh and delicious this hotel is in the plaza catalunya which is one block from las ramblas we were able to walk to the barri gotic the tour bus stop was on the square right across the from the hotel the service at this hotel was great loved this place,1.0
we loved this hotel location in a more residential area where we could walk to the tram or to the museums and other busier areas of amsterdam the lovely park right in front the canal out back the adjacent neighboring shops restaurants etc are ideal the hotel itself is wonderful and the staff were very professional and nice this was a bit fancier than we were used to but they made us feel welcome and comfortable and we were grateful for that the restaurant out back on the canal is great we really enjoyed the executive breakfast dining on the rooftop it is a lovely layout with all one could want and a cappuccino machine to boot it was unfortunate that our bathtub did not drain properly we reported it and hope the next people to stay in will have a better experience,1.0
we booked a which was large the breakfast pancakes were staff is nice the house is situated a minute walk from the the was really disgusting everything looked clean,1.0
we had stayed at the movenpick hotel amsterdam city centre for a few days following a viking river cruise check in was fairly room was very large for a european hotel and our room had a large couch king bed a desk and closets one of the closets was taken by a safe and refrigerator so that we did not have as much space to unpack as we may have liked our room overlooked the harbor and gave impressive views of ships passing room had a flat screen tv with a huge variety of channels and the wifi was very good and bathroom was large withonly a shower but the shower had good hot water and the water pressure was did have problems with the in the room we could never get the room as cool as we would have liked and the lighting and was activated by having a room key in the slot so i think when we were out the room got warmed back ate at the bar area the first night service was very slow for the area not being busy the servers in the bar area did not seem to have assigned tables and when asked if we wanted an additional drink we said yes and were forgotten about the bitterballn appetizer and the pizza we had for the main course were good but expensive for what they were the breakfast buffet was huge but the immense selection made it a little chaotic with so,1.0

this lovely hotel is well worth it price they offered amazing breakfast in the morning and even packed us a breakfast box on our last morning as we were too early for the breakfast hours it is well located near syntagma square and about a minute walk from the acropolis it is located close to a train station about a uphill walk and has loads of restaurants and stores in the area,1.0
although the price of the hotel may seem cheap compared to others in the area and the pictures and description say it has been renovated do be fooled arrived at the hotel earlier than the standard check in time and were told that the room was not ready which was fine as we were early so went out and returned to the hotel about an hour and half later waited for another ten minutes and then received the keys to our room well the supposedly recently renovated rooms did seem to apply to ours the stench of smoke was disgusting the carpets were stained the shower which was supposed to be held over the bath was falling out the wall so you had to hold it and whenever you tried to have a shower the bath leaked all over the floor the air con may as well have been non existent and not to mention the bedbugs we found within hours of being in the room staff were extremely rude whenever asked for help the only thing half decent was the wifi a number of doors were left open to other rooms in the hotel all of which again did not look like they had been renovated at all how on earth other people have rated this hotel above a is beyond me i would avoid at all costs certainly do not recommend,0.0
really liked this hotel check in and out was quick the room and washroom were very clean and the location was excellent yes the rooms are small and washroom is separated by a frosted glass door there is also carpet on the walls lol staff was very helpful our friends stayed at a fancier hotel down the street which at the time of booking months prior was a lot more expensive but when in amsterdam was the same price as we paid for this hotel,1.0

we stayed at the fleet street hotel in dublin in july the location is really good right near temple bar and very close to the bus stop for galway the hotel is above the street level so you have to take the lift or walk the stairs and they have security at the door in the evening and at night to control access the decor is modern and the staff were very friendly my brother a smoker was pleased to learn that they had two outdoor terraces available for smokers,1.0
hotel located at a very convenient place down town old but refurbished building clean facilities with modern decoration in lobbies and restaurant my personal opinion is that the hotel is overpriced comparing its level of services and image with similar hotels in big european cities,1.0
this hotel is perfectly located within the heart of amsterdam and close to all of the is very slow and the whole hotel is showing its age but is still good value for money in an expensive city a general facelift would benefit the breakfast was all you could ask staff very helpful and went out of their way to make you feel welcome,1.0
simply put the shelbourne is perfect the staff are exemplary the rooms are extremely well appointed the breakfast is superb the bar is first class i have yet to find anything even slightly objectionable the concierge knows dublin like his own garden stephens green is directly across the street bank of ireland is very nearby as are excellent pubs and restaurants it is home in dublin,1.0
the hotel itself is quite nice and clean however when i arrived at my room was not ready and the staff took over an hour to get a room for me the staff clearly need training in customer service it is very expensive and in no way justifies the price i will not stay there again,0.0

the building site kicked off quite early just below my room i appreciate in a city centre hotel residual noise is always going to be an issue but i think being woken at is asking a little too much apart from that great location staff and facilities all excellent,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay at the staff is really friendly and gave us directions where to find everything the room is modern clean and spacious nothing can top the rooftop though the infinity pool was bigger than expected the only downsides to our room were the shower which is nice but the bathroom is very open so it kind of flooded one time the plug connection which is on the other side of the night table small detail and the hotel is located to a big busy street so it can be a little bit rumourous at night but totally did disturb us those are small details though i would definitely stay here again as the room was clean every day and the staff was always in a good mood it also located well next to shopping centre arenas and of course plaza espanya where you can take the metro to basically anywhere,1.0
well placed in a quiet area near the center the staff is really kind and helpful the breakfast is good very good even if it is necessary sometimes to wait a little because not enough tables the room was cosy a little bit but very quiet i slept with the window opened a good address,1.0

the reception staff were very laid back throughout our stay talking to each other and on their phones did give much attention to us but did bother our stay they were helpful if we had room was lovely the beds were comfy and most importantly the room was clean the air con was good view was nothing toilet continually flushed it sounded like the tap was left on full we did know if this was an amsterdam thing so we did speak to anyone about it very annoying is great do get a taxi from the airport get the bus it we paid for the train to amsterdam then for a taxi on the way hard rock and the irish pub across the street were both great,1.0

we stayed in the sandymount for the sunday night of the longitude festival first impression really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything there was a really relaxed feel in the hotel people were just sitting around chilling in various locations there are chairs and sofas around every corner so nice the people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to beatrice she went above and beyond about mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share saving us both money i thought it was a lovely touch she was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before silly maybe but we both agreed that beatrice kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend the beer garden is really lovely while we did get to eat at the hotel other than late night pizza but i think you could honestly go to the sandymount and not leave the grounds at one point i thought we would just forget longitude and stay in the garden we were driving so with regards to public transport i am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is with the aviva stadium i assume they are but not least a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception,1.0
great location close to temple bar the hotel is old and could use some updating the beds were very comfortable there is no mini refrigerator or microwave in rooms which would have been nice since the portions at the restuarants are soo big it would have been nice to be able to bring back the leftovers to reheat for a midnight snack the steps to the room are a little tricky especially coming down be sure to stay to the left of the steps when coming down as the the right side of the steps cut short on some steps causing one to fall would be nice to have a railing on the left side coming down the steps as well overall the hotel was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful i would stay here again for the location alone,1.0
the scenery here is stunning and the staff are incredibly kind we asked to switch rooms since ours smelled of smoke and they did without hesitation we got the room with beds it was a little cramped with our three big bags of luggage but it worked out fine the bathroom was very good too the hotel restaurant was simply delicious i highly,1.0

great staff good clean room excellent breakfast located if you want to explore plaka and monastiraki areas easy walking to restaurants with a mini mart next door and a large supermarket around the is approximately a minute walk from the hotel suggest wearing good walking shoes with rubber soles to avoid slipping on granite steps and pathways qheading up to and in the rooftop terrace gives you great views of the acropolis especially at definitely return to this hotel,1.0
this hotel is supposed to be a star hotel but i would give it more than stars it owned by spg but it worse than any spg hotel i have ever stayed at the location is close to the acropolis and its centrally located but the area is filled with homeless drunk people and you would feel safe walking at night couple of the staff were nice and friendly but some were not the rooms were really small and there was no space for suitcases we made a mistake of booking this hotel before going to the islands and after coming back i would go back to athens again but if i were to go back i would stay at this hotel again,0.0

spend nights in the holiday inn express in the dublin city center in hotel is very good neat and the room was clean and we were lucky enough to have a nice view on a clear day the bed was big and comfortable as well as the bathroom maybe the toilet was a bit too high nothing was missing and we felt very personnel of the hotel was very friendly and always up to some the location was almost perfect very close to the city center but also a bit outside so as to avoid masses of people everything was walking of the highlights that deserves its own paragraph was the breakfast not only did it include a very large variety and could serve as brunch i was hungry until the evening but it had the additional novelty of being able to pack it into paper bags and take it with you this proved extremely helpful on the next day where we had to leave for a tour very early we stuffed some paper bags with stuff and covered our entire day in the hotel was a bit too expensive for our budget so i will keep an eye for special offers the next time we visit dublin,1.0
fabulous location two blocks from the plaka at the base of the acropolis one block to the museum which you can not miss room was large clean and comfortable the staff was very accommodating the rooftop restaurant was tasty reasonable and the service was fabulous complimentary breakfast was amazing i would highly recommend this hotel to athens visitors,1.0

i was excited on arrival by the look and feel of this hotel but by the time i left the following day i was utterly disgusted by their utter disregard for their guests comfort and satisfaction i thin the following response to my agent complaint letter will tell you all you need to know about why you should choose any other hotel in dublin so disappointed goodness only knows just how appalling it might of been had i been a leisure traveller management response i sorry your client had a noise affected stay with us thanks for taking the time to flag this with us we do have big issues with noise on harcourt street we have some rooms that are but nothing we consider silent by a long stretch harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in for nightlife in general we completely surrounded by night venues although there is little we can do to control this we try to assign the rooms to corporate guests longer stays etc to minimize the impact on our guests i sorry if this was communicated on arrival i will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position as recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours we working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort in relation to the lights coffee machine and basin we,0.0

since my arrival at the hotel until my departure i had problems in this terrible place the receptionist who did my chek in was extremely cold rude and unfriendly he said that there was duplicity of reservation and that it was for me to choose which one i would use surprised i said that i had not made two reservations and that i would only use the one i had made from i asked him to cancel the other reservation which was in duplicity without thinking he said it would not be possible i found it absurd because i had made no other reservation i asked to speak to the manager and he did not want to talk to me the manager asked the receptionist to tell me that he could not do anything and that i would be charged for two rooms even using only one what i found this attitude of a hotel manager extremely reckless he definitely has no profile to be a manager what arrogance and lack of common sense due to my fatigue of the trip i decided to go to my room and then i would solve this when i got to my room it was another disappointment the room was super small hard bed unventilated bathroom broken light fixture and the worst i had paid for a room overlooking acropolis and the only thing i saw was the work of the neighboring front building i ended up i decided to staying just one,0.0

we found this a bit tricky to find during a recent weekend heatwave so you may pass by the front door before realising you actually in the right place look out for the red key sash on the room was very comfortable a wonderful oasis of cool from the athenian heat it in a fantastic location minutes from the plaka metro and the eating area of psiri the view from our balcony of the acropolis will not be forgotten we were not too sure how we felt about the bathroom it behind a glass door and the toilet hand wash basin and rainfall shower are all in one room so unless you on intimate terms with your room mate not all rooms are the same so this may have just been our room it did bother me as much as my significant other front of house staff are engaging and happy to assist with any of your needs during your stay and are interested to hear of your day when you return from your enjoy staying in smaller boutique style hotels where guest service is a core part of the business and this is certainly that,1.0
been there for nights with my wife we also stayed at the petit palace in malaga and madrid the one in barcelona is by far the worst in terms of facilities quite dirty and hotel is currently under renovation and there is dust around the reception area and other communal parts the path to the lift is poorly lit also reception the personnel is quite unfriendly albeit polite they distil relevant information slowly including on how to access the hotel with your hotel card compared to the other two petit palace they have a long way to connection simply embarrassing slow choppy and unreliable breakfast very expensive turn right and walk down one block then cross the street and keep walking down on your left you will find el fornet high quality breakfast for a very reasonable were also unlucky as the other guests were quite noisy and impolite our sleep was interrupted by abrupt noise in the middle of the obliged please stay away analysis very poor,0.0

i have just returned from a night stay at the north star with my boyfriend and it was amazing i had stayed here about years ago in a standard double room and even then it was good but since then the hotel has been refurbished to a sleek modern décor and this time i stayed in an executive club king room which was well worth the money the standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money they have upgraded the rooms with smart technology so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button there was also complimentary dairy milk chocolate in the fridge which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over we also had access to the rooftop lounge which was quite what i expected as well as that the hotel was just a high standard robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job i would definitely recommend this hotel if you looking for something more high end i absolutely loved my stay here and it really made my trip to dublin brilliant,1.0

i stayed nights in may at the waterloo house the house is quaint my room had a nice view and breakfast was delicious but my experience was tainted by electrical issues in a nutshell plugging my laptop adapter in a power outlet at this house killed the adapter here s how it happened when i first arrived in my room i noticed one of the lamps would not turn on i notified the clerk at the desk that the lightbulb was burnt but she said that this outlet did not work adding that the electrician could not figure out why fine i thought i ll use other outlets and i should have been more suspicious of the state of the electrical wiring because as soon as i plugged in my laptop to charge it in another outlet of course the power went out in the room and my charger had a burnt smell i notified the clerk again and while she was very nice she did not seem particularly surprised and suggested i talk to evelyn corcoran the owner evelyn nicely told me that this hardly ever happens indeed she said this had happened before but to other devices i understand this is an old house that s part of its charm but a faulty electrical system is not what i expected being in dublin for work i needed to be able to charge my laptop so i went to a computer store the employee said the frying of my,0.0
a bit of a wild duck definitely a tourist hotel lots of retired americans and people with kids floors are big so the elevators bring loads of people through the halls just use ear plugs and put a towel under the gap of the door and you will be fine rooms are either smaller or a bit greater club is great restaurant is bad bar is awesome concierge and staff are wonderful location is amazing price is good i say go but keep the things above in mind i stayed there on business for more than weeks,1.0
there was an error with our booking when we checked in and we were both a little confused nothing to do with the hotel though it was an outside booking agent and the staff went above an beyond to make sure it was taken care of we want to especially thank mariya the front desk agent who was amazing and so kind we would definitely come back just because of her excellent service the hotel is also very hip and modern and a fun place to unwind after the busy streets of temple bar start to get too busy could not rec,1.0
wagalis was the name of our server he was quiye friendly and made us feel very comfortable he suggested us some unique drinks and good experience i will not rate the view so much as the area did not seem to have a pleasant scenario,1.0
i stayed here last week as part of my honeymoon the hotel staff were amazing our first contact was with alba at reception and she was amazing she provided tonnes of information about barcelona that helped us decide how to spend our time thank you alba breakfast was absolutely fantastic the selection was great continental and british the breakfast staff were all room was clean and comfortable we booked a room with a sea view and i glad we made that decision there were blackout curtains so we slept really well the location is a little ways from the city centre my husband and i like to walk to that did matter to us there are also tonnes of transit stops or tourist bus stops within a short decision the hotel is a minute walk from the beach it a nice and quiet part of the beach the only complaint i have is that i do feel as though it was made clear that the hotel does actually have a pool there is a pool at the location but it owned by a separate company and guests have to pay for a bed the rate is apparently reduced for hotel guests but i was still disappointed with this drinks and food at the pool are expensive just go to the beach,1.0
this hotel could not have a better location it is within walking distance to everything you need but just far enough off the main drag to bring a little quiet to the room in dublin this is critical it is very loud in this city and all the way up until the room was spacious clean and the three beds were comfy it also had a great shower with plenty of room the breakfast was a great bonus and the food was really good we would stay here again,1.0
i highly recommend this hotel the place is spotlessly clean rooms are in good conditions the bed was especially comfortable to sleep on and the bed sheets were nice and cozy service was friendly and effective breakfast was really good location is convinient just outside the main train station amsterdam central this makes it easy to get in from the airport by train and back the hotel is right on the edge of the district i usually prefer to stay more south in the city but there were many advantages to this location we were a group of three couples who stayed at this hotel in late july checked in on a thursday late morning and checked out on sunday check out time is by default which is really nice because we had an evening flight out the rooms were not ready when we checked in but were made available as we got closer to the suitcases were stored in the storage this whole process was handled very nicely even though we were not easy customers repeatadly remembering that we left things in the suitacses that we wanted to retrieve we received two rooms on the floor one facing the canal and the other facing the inner court the room facing the canal had stairs in the room which is a little strange we also received a room on the room were very quiet and sleep quality was very good there is quality tea and coffee in the room the,1.0
we stayed at this hotel with our teenagers in the suites on the top floor with balconies and canal views this was the perfect location situated right on the canal with easy access to the utrechtsestraat where there were many shops and restaurants the location was quiet compared to other parts of the center of the city the beds were very comfy the staff was always helpful the breakfast had a large variety and was fresh each morning the hotel was clean and very well equipped for all of needs we will stay there agin for sure,1.0
the okura amsterdam is well though not totally centrally located in amsterdam this is not necessarily a bad thing because you are a bit away from the tourist crowds that the city and get the chance to explore quieter streets around the hotel in any event there are various small restaurants and stores within a hotel is modern well kept and clean it stands out a bit as it the tallest building in its neighborhood but that can also mean good views for are sized right certainly not too big but i did not feel constrained in any way either the nespresso machine with six daily capsules are a nice front desk was a bit slow for my taste but that may have to do with my checking in and out at peak times and receptionists taking their time to make detailed explanations to other guests maybe an automated process would be a good idea for those just wanting no further information,1.0
we have just spent nights at the sir albert and have to say it was much better than i expected we were upgraded to a superior double as there was a problem with the plug but the room more than made up for the inconvenience we did eat breakfast as it quite expensive unless you like to eat lots in the morning then it worth it location is superb a little on the outskirts of the centre but a very cool trendy area we ate in the restaurant the first night amazing food pricey super trendy bar with some beautiful people and staff i would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again,1.0
i stayed here on occassions it was perfect on both times rooms are spacious and very comfortable breakfast wonderful location excellent located within walking distance of the acropolis charming little restaurants nearby downside was tv had no english channels,1.0
nothing more exciting then staying in a brand new hotel everything was extra clean and new the location is great close to central station which was very helpful since this was my first time visiting from another country i was able to uber in a short distance the hotel was also walking distance to main points of the city the staff is very helpful and kind and helped me with plans and transportation and the breakfast was fresh the design is unique and tasteful i look forward to staying here again soon,1.0
hotel is beautiful and in great location staff was amazing we were robbed at airport while leaving barcelona and they worked with me to get room since i had no id but had police report even called to check on us,1.0
the service was decent the breakfast also decent people were helpful at the reception the best though is the location which is very accessible the only part i would compalint about is their lifts they are terribly small and can suffucate you especially with more than persons and when get in oh boy the plaka the acropolis the syntagma square etc are all walking distance so sourcing food and place to spend time walking is plenty and good even if you take a taxi the minimum fare is charged which eur please note the taxi people can be quite ecasive and demand much more so please be cautious,1.0
left here earlier today after days in amsterdam the staff are some of the best we have ever come across from the guys on reception to the morning waiters and the evening bar staff every single one of them deserves credit for their efforts in making me and my wife feel welcome we will be back next summer and will only come to this hotel the location is perfect aswell bang opposite the main station tip is we did need the cleaners coming times a day to sort our room tho this is much appreciatedawesome work,1.0
i stayed here not too long ago for my birthday trip to europe i loved this place i ca wait to go back at first i was concerned about the distance from the center but the train to the center is right in front of the hotel so we got day train passes which made it easy for us at the time i booked there was a race in town so this was my best option and i glad i chose this hotel the shower is like nothing i ever saw before although it was really neat to watch the light colors change we also pretty much controlled the tv blinds and lights via an ipad i was very pleased with my stay,1.0
arrived early this morning and we was able to check in early and the staff are excellent very accommodating got are room early which was great but we booked a deluxe room but they are very small clean and high standard just very small sky bar is boss lovely little vibe up there going back up tonight so looking forward to it the room issue is probably me being a snob ha but i like what i hope this helps,1.0
i have had the privilege to stay in some of the best hotels in the world i believe you judge them not necessarily by the initial impression but by how they rectify any issues we had a couple of problems with the room when we arrived but these were sorted quickly and very satisfactorily hence the stars staff are all very helpful and pleasant great to see so many irish people in senior positions special praise to shane in the brasserie and frida on the rooftop bar for superb service and matteo that probably means i forgotten someone but everyone was good hotel very clean bathroom facilities excellent top class hotels can be a bit pretentious which i hate but the marker is not would return and will do on my next dublin visit,1.0
absolutely perfect location for couple days stay prior to heading out to the islands can easily walk to sites esp landmarks plaka and acropolis acropolis tip get there before it euro uber to top of it and get tickets you can spend all day walking around and down to agora and then back to hotel fun rooftop pool and bar cigar bar was well appointed but we do not like smoke so did not have a drink the spa pool was also quieter if the rooftop was too crowded rsvp well in advance to dine at gb rooftop we were rewarded with the best table in the house room was spacious we were spg upgraded to butler level and romantic,1.0
i was happy with choosing this smaller sized hotel please let bono know it sits between temple bar on its back end and the liffey rover on the front my room was facing the river second floor this is the quieter side since the street behind is the main tourist strip so all of them have traditional irish music every night and has plenty of picturesque drunks of the local and tourist varieties the hotel itself is good friendly staff clean and good sized rooms in room wifi included although it can be spotty you can add breakfast but there are lots of coffee shops etc close by so go out and find something different,1.0
this is swanky modern trendy and has the best staff in amsterdam really enjoyed a night stay here and we were very well looked after the reception staff were brilliant and set the tone of the whole hotel friendly efficient and fun try the restaurant as well which is very good outstanding staff well done miguel,1.0
well placed property shopping mall diagonal mar with great shopping restaurants located just across from the hotel taxis available right outside the hotel entrance is a great plus staff really professional helpful alba helena at the front desk are an asset to the hotel sylvia at the lobby bar is awesome she provided great friendly service and much needed guidance for the day before we ventured out to the city rooms are getting an upgrade ours was already done to modern scale but lacks soundproofing you can hear most activites of room neighbours purobeach club runs the hotel area really up scale to be prepared to spend some if you intend to use the club housekeeping always on point great stay so far,1.0
we stayed at the olivia balmes hotel for the second time and liked it as much as we did the first time this time we stayed in a standard room with a small balcony on the courtyard side of the hotel we could even keep the balcony door open during the night it was so quiet again we were impressed with the high standard of the accommodation the extra friendly staff at reception and in the restaurant and the fantastic buffet breakfast on some mornings we were greeted with a glass of cava first thing what a nice touch,1.0

we stayed here for nights in july and everything was great it is a small atmospheric hotel with great facilities and a great location breakfast buffet each day was plentiful and reception staff were very helpful very easy to get around from the hotel and walking distance to a lot of shopping and metro station very close rooftop terrace and pool was a great bonus to relax after out explorinfg would definitely stay here again if in barcelona,1.0
the accommodation was exceptionally clean and the location is a centre as can be which is amazing for the low price of the accommodation the shared kitchen is great for travellers on a budget as it allows you to prepare your own meals staff are very helpful if you have any issues and security on the site seems tight the only drawback is the windows are single glazed and as the main roads are nearby it may not be great for those who are woken easily,1.0
the element amsterdam is a great place to stay i stayed there for close to two weeks while on business the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly and it is in a great location right next to the mall and many other,1.0

we stayed here for two nights although the second night we have to leave at in the morning for a flight it was clean comfortable and walking distance to the old town area and acropolis breakfast was simple but ok the only negative is the desk controls the air conditioning and will only turn down to a certain level not to your comfort level this part was not comfortable we had a view of an abandoned building but were in the room much anyway easy to find your way around from here,1.0
my husband and i live in phoenix arizona usa and frequently have massages here while staying at two by alex this hotels sister facility we took advantage of the urban spa to have relaxing and deep tissue massage we where able to have the massage together and we both agree the massage was the best we ever had any were richardo and william made us feel very comfortable and did an outstanding job we would both give the experience our highest recommendation,1.0

eight of us went to barca for my daughter birthday and my sister in laws birthday the staff were very friendly and welcoming the hotel was modern and clean rooms were spacious and beds very comfotable special mention should be made to hugo who organised a birthday treat in our rooms for both the birthday girls this was very much appreciated a really nice touch to the overall experience location wise the hotel is only a walk from the beach and la rambla would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again when we return,1.0
my friends and i had the most amazing experience with the lovely owner manager of this hotel we found out on arrival that our booking had been cancelled because of an expired credit card and were worried we would be turned away not only were we offered rooms instead of at the same price she was able to provide us with all the information we needed about transport laundry services and where to eat and drink she was able to organise a taxi for us for the following morning and extended check out so we could go straight to the airport we had such a great experience and she was incredibly warm and genuine with us the rooms were clean and spacious and the aircon worked well not a single complaint for this hotel,1.0
this hotel typically caters to business travelers although i was on an extended family vacation i wanted to try this property given its wonderful central location near the railroad station we had friends near rotterdam whom we visited using the speedy and comfortable trains available in the netherlands generally the hotel fully met my expectations the service was excellent and the hotel had a special room for its elite travelers that served a full delicious breakfast as well as snacks later in the day the room was somewhat problematic in one area we could not obtain a comfortably cool temperature during the first two days of our four day stay the temperature in amsterdam was unseasonably warm and humid during our stay when i brought the problem to the attention of the hotel staff their initial response was to give us a portable fan which helped somewhat but did not give us the level of comfort that we were hoping for finally on the third day after insisting that the room was still too warm we received a visit from a building engineer who fixed the problem and we enjoyed the room which had a very comfortable bed and an excellent shower during the remainder of our stay i would recommend this hotel although i would also suggest strongly advocating for quick action if you find the temperature of your hotel room not to your liking,1.0
the hotel is located in the east of amsterdam only minutes by public transport from downtown it is a pleasant area next to a large park and with lots of attractive places nearby for eating and having a good service was friendly and diligent we always felt very well attended with our needs and questions the room was well equipped and offered a pleasant atmosphere we felt absolutely our next trips to amsterdam and we will sure come back to this great city we will choose this hotel again and we will recommend it to our friends,1.0

stayed here for a week whilst working in dublin it about mins taxi ride from the city centre so usually a little cheaper than the large central hotels unless there is a big concert or gaelic football match on at the croke park stadium opposite when they get very busy reasonable cooked breakfast buffet helpful service comfortable room spacious bar not much around in the immediate vicinity so you need to get a taxi if you want to get out for a drink or dinner,1.0
check in was a breeze and extremely helpful the rooms were small but quirky everything worked perfectly in the room would certainly stay again when visiting amsterdam great drinks choice in the bar also,1.0

we enjoyed banks maison hospitality on two occasions recently conveniently located in the centre of the city overlooking one of the canals with easy access to public transport if required walking distance to restaurants shops and many of the main tourist attractions staff were welcoming efficient and always willing to assist the open bar in the was an added attraction which encouraged guests to relax and mingle creating a homely would certainly recommend banks mansion sue and brianaustralia,1.0

the room and bathroom were clean and the location was convenient to a served by the dublin airport express route the staff were very friendly and helpful and they were gracious enough to let us check in a few hours early to get a much needed nap the was thankfully has easy walking access to christchurch cathedral shopping and several restaurants it also not too far from trinity college and other major attractions in the breakfast menu was a little limited particularly from the perspective of my spouse who prefers lighter fare and ca eat wheat but i really enjoyed getting the full irish there they provide free tea instant coffee for the rooms but no only serious negative was the noise from their nextdoor neighbor the church for some archaic reason christchurch cathedral still thinks it appropriate to ring its bells every minutes all night bring earplugs,1.0
we booked two nights at this place which is located within amsterdam city centre room was small but cute and clean staff was very friendly no air condition but a fan was provided parking in the area is eur per hour,1.0
spent nights in athens after our mediterranean cruise at this centrally located hotel two blocks from monastiraki square a metro station the plaka district and within walking distance to many sites even though the area was depressed with almost every building front covered in graffiti and many homeless or those seeking money for trinkets the view of the acropolis from the hotel the convenient location and the friendly and hospitable staff made the stay worth while while i was concerned about pick pockets i never felt unsafe our room was basic but clean and had great ac which was needed after a long day in the heat sitting out on the balcony at night looking at the lit up acropolis was magical there are plenty of shops and eateries around the area so we did not utilized the breakfast option i would recommend this hotel,1.0

we booked our room at the hotel through secret rooms and were promised a star hotel in a central hotel is definitely not star the rooms are very dated and small and are desperately in need of refurbishment what was supposed to be a double bed was singles pushed are a few positives the staff at the hotel are very polite and friendly the location of the hotel is excellent within walking distance of the beach and most major attractions unfortunately this does compensate for the hotels faults our room was cheap for the nights we stayed i would stay here again,1.0

i really liked the environment and overall the atmosphere of the hotel the receptionist who welcomed us was very helpful and courteous one of the girls at the coffee shop was going her way to get my coffe right i really appreciated her efforts unfortunately i did not have the chance to try the restaurant but it looked busy all the time and again the atmosphere was cosy and welcoming the area is relatively easy to reach by transports and bike i loved the design of the hotel which reminded me a bit of a community place i will surely recommend casa hotel the room was a little small but clean and we had fresh towels every day i loved the terrace and its view with the style bar,1.0
we had stayed in barcelona before in an apartment and were very disappointed so we searched for a hotel in a quiet location but still within walking distance to most attractions musik boutique hotel was that and so much more our room was quiet clean nicely appointed with great nice bathroom toiletries the front desk staff was helpful and friendly we were so close to everything we wanted to revisit during our second trip to barcelona walked to each of them i will reserve here again if i ever return just a note i booked through expedia we had a bad experience going through,1.0

the marker is a modern hotel with staff that are exceptionally helpful the room was spacious although a bit light on space to store clothes for a multi day stay the buffet breakfasts were great order your eggs as you want them and do settle for the scrambled eggs that are the default both forms are included in the buffet pricing loved the honeycomb and fresh apricots each morning,1.0
our stay did not match what we expected for the hilton brand at euros a night clogged shower drains that did not get fixed even after three days mold and mildew in shower stalls electrical outlets that can not hold a plug shower water gets hot and cold randomly lights go off randomly toilet leaks so flushes automatically through the night making noise toe nails clippings found on carpet did not vacuum room in between guests or ever at all,0.0

the hotel has an excellent location it within walking distance to all tourist sites and there is high end shopping area just behind the hotel the hotel does feel dated but the room is comfortable it a business hotel and i could feel anything luxury about this hotel the wifi was really bad we could only receive internet at certain spots of the room and it was slow,1.0
beautiful hotel great staff and excellent rooms could do enough to help us and even managed to extend our stay when the hotel was fully booked the location of the hotel is unbeatable we had a ground floor room but didnt hear any noise from outside next to quiet street the air con unit is individually controlled and worked special note was the complimentary shoe shining service i placed my shoes outside the door at and they had been thoroughly cleaned and shined by the time i woke up at indicative of the great service available,1.0

truly one of the nicest and finest hotels we have stayed in can not find any negatives hotel staff and food all excellent highly recommend the herbert park for a relaxed and quiet stay and a very central location,1.0
the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,1.0

advised by my dutch chairman i decided to try this relatively new hotel in amsterdam located in the museum district near vodelpark it is an amazing place worth a visit to the lobby even if you are not a guest the lobby restaurant is amazing for light dinners and breakfast but the real gem is the gym incredibly equipped from technogym unica to trx and roller bring your swimming costume as the amazing deserted pool is worth it,1.0

dublin is a beautiful place but even more so during the christmas holidays we have stayed at jury inn parnell street the year before and was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the warm homely atmosphere so we decided to return but with breakfast included this time breakfast was amazing plenty of choice for fussy eaters just like my youngest son will be coming back again for christmas,1.0
great location very clean great service friendly staff very good value for the cost very close access to trams buses the hotel restaurant was expensive but the immediate area had so many restaurants it was never a concern we would certainly return to this hotel the next time we are in amsterdam,1.0
having reviewed several cities we chose barcelona as it appeared to cater for all our tastes age group early to early as we had experienced booking difficulties with an alternative spanish hotel prior to departure we chose this hotel mainly for the ease in booking the accommodation on the hotel website roof top pool and reasonable price we were made to feel very welcome lenin is a credit to the hotel nothing was too much trouble and on the whole all staff were very helpful we had a good breakfast in the hotel on two occasions however we preferred to eat out in order to soak up the atmosphere of the city although the pool was not large it was adequate for cooling down and also provided an alternative area to relax within the perimeter of the hotel my daughter and i shared a room on the sixth floor facing out towards the city street we benefited from a large window and a well proportioned room my son room being on the opposite side of the corridor which faced into an inner court yard was less big with a smaller window although it appeared to suit his needs three tips i would recommend for a short stay in barcelona because of the heat we found using the local city bus a good way to commute to different areas as a family we are use to walking but even minutes in the heat can be exhausting get a good guide book,1.0
excellent hotel with very friendly and careful stuff perfect rooms outstanding views and very good restaurants we stayed in club room and had a few priorities as a club reception free wi fi and special meal time times a day the only problem that spoiled our impression from hotel was problems with luggage we waited for it hours on check in and about minutes on check out and always check your bills mistakes could happened,1.0
we booked this hotel on short notice as it came up first on we thought it would be close to town and we could walk to the main attractions as we only had a short stay in athens this was not the case and it was very complicated to get anywhere without a taxi and most of the drivers do not understand english the hotel is situated near a district so that should be taken into consideration very difficult to cross the road as it is a four lane highway out the front with a fence in the midway the hotel is very new but very badly designed and finished off very small lifts to take you to the rooms so it takes two trips if you have a lot of luggage we ordered some food from the restaurant and bought it up to the room unfortunately my food had an eye lash in it generally the staff was very friendly though check in did take some time which i do not really appreciate the hotel finishes and location lets it down i would not recommend or stay here again,1.0
lovely night stay at this hotel situated a bit further away from the city centre across the street to the diagonal mar shopping centre and a walk to llevant beach stayed in an executive level room with access to the lounge food beverages were good quality in the lounge and service there was excellent went to purobeach for a few hours to lounge on the pool deck but did not use the pool or spa drinks were very expensive euros each and just ok nothing spectacular the gym was being renovated and the temporary gym that was set up was very small not conducive to a good workout,1.0

stayed here for three nights the hotel staff are friendly and welcoming amazing central location with a tram stop right rooms are small but have everything you need in and probably the softest and most comfortable bed i have ever slept in other reviews mention traffic noise but our room was very quiet it was at the back which probably helped i felt the breakfast could have done with more choice although the scrambled egg was really good i definitely recommend this amsterdam hotel,1.0

it in a very convenient location near van gogh museum rijksmuseum and the concert hall there are several other museums around it if you like art and museum it a great place to stay there are public transportation very nearby the room is spacious clean and the bed is comfortable the people are very nice and helpful gave us great recommendations for dinner and sight seeing tips nikki recommended the seafood bar it excellent and was crowded very early pm on a weekday and we had to wait for a table it within walking distance from hotel seafood was fresh and very reasonable for the value we took a taxi to the hotel from our docking location after our viking cruise but we used public transportation to go to the airport very convenient and it only costs each the breakfast was basic and sufficient but the pancakes were to die for so please asked for it there was a heat wave for the nights that we spent at the hotel there was no in our room but we opened the window and turned on the fan and it was every wednesday there are free concert at the nearby concert hall you have to wait in line to get the free ticket one ticket per person tickets will be passed out at am get there a little early to wait in line we really enjoyed it i like the location and the people running it,1.0
stayed here several times when it was the burlington hotel and owned by the hilton doubletree group never had any problems always a very comfortable stay our room was on the th floor which had air con which i am led to believe not all rooms have it so it probably only a major factor when the weather is hot only a min walk to town and walking through st stephens green is a very pleasant walk as the grounds are kept very well there are always taxis outside this property so great to hop into and buses from across the road go to town we get the air coach from dublin airport to right outside this property and from across the road to go back to the airport the breakfast is great enough to set you up for the day a good variety there is a bar which serves food snacks too check times did use it on this occasion but have used it in the past maybe be different since the clayton group taken over this property there is also a fitness room which i walked past swiftly,1.0
we had a fantastic stay at the shelbourne hotel this hotel is superb it is a beautiful building steeped in irish history room was where the irish constitution was drafted in under the leadership of michael collins many famous people such as charlie chaplin laurel and hardy james cagney the kennedys and elizabeth taylor to name a few stayed in the shelbourne right from its very humble beginnings the hotel is a short walk to all the major attractions shops and pubs while also overlooking the tranquillity of st stephens green directly opposite the saddle room boasts some top notch beautifully presented food and a buffet breakfast with loads of food to choose from and if that was enough you also have the options of relaxing in the bar area or lord mayors lounge for some afternoon tea you really and truely feel special from the moment you walk in the door best hotel iv stayed in by far,1.0
we are very picky travelers and prior to our arrival to athens we were very worry about staying at this hotel since it is not the peninsula or mandarin oriental or four seasons but we really wanted to go to athens and we booked the hotel late and did not have many choices we are so impressed by the outstanding service cleanness and comfort of this hotel great location i definitely will come back to athens and to this hotel,1.0

we stayed at the movenpick hotel for an overnight stay prior to taking a two week river cruise from amsterdam to budapest the cost for the stay was quite had no trouble in checking in mid afternoon and left our luggage in our room before going out to explore the city we returned to the hotel just after and went to our room which was located near the lift shafts on level it was then that we noticed the continuous noise coming from the lift shaft as the lifts went up and down we contacted reception and requested a room change to a quieter part of the building but were informed that this was not possible due to the usual response that one gets at hotels we are fully booked and there is nothing available were quite disappointed at the response unfortunately we did not get a good nights sleep due to the rather incessant do believe that we got value for money paid and find it hard to recommend this establishment based on our chalked it down to experience and will carefully vet further stays in hotels,0.0
my wife and i enjoyed a short day stay in athens on our way to mykonos and santorini and were very happy with having chosen the hotel grande bretagne as our place to stay it is a wonderful luxury hotel with a classic older european vibe it is located in the heart of athens and a short distance to the acropolis and other major places to visit the room was spacious the food was very good and the service outstanding,1.0

the location is the only thing lacking at this hotel the building rooms food pool and roof are all very nice you can take a walk to the beach and there is quite a bit of interesting street art nearby but all the tourist spots require a walk to the metro and longer metro ride,1.0
just got back stayed from travelled with other girls for a girly weekend away could not fault the hotel clean and tidy and very comfy beds ideal hotel for the city sights takes about mins to walk from the hotel to the bottom of la rambla and mins to the beach at port olympic if you do fancy the walk its less than euro in a taxi there were a couple of stags doo but they were fine just lads having a laugh the roof top bar and pool was a very big plus especially as it was reaching degrees we loved our time and did want to come home wish we booked for a few days longer,1.0
this was my second stay at the eden we enjoyed it so much last time we decided to return this time we just stayed in a standard room but to be honest there did seem to be much difference between that an the executive room the staff were all welcoming and helpful did not have breakfast this time as it was not included in the deal this was not a problem as due to the excellent location there was loads of cheap places near by to grab breakfast from only downside was that i did leave my top there and do hope they manage to find it planning on returning next month to the same hotel think i will be a lifetime customer from now on,1.0
first look at the hotel and its lobby leave you with a satisfying feeling but once you enter the rooms the illusion soon fades away the rooms are extremely small and unclean the housekeeping is poor to the next level had such a horrible experience staying here i strictly advise against choosing this place to stay the buffet too had very less choices of food to offer,0.0
we stayed here for six days our room was spacious and facilities were outstanding friendly staff were very helpful the tram terminus was outside the hotel one could get to street in ten minutes breakfast was above average with a wide spectrum of food on offer an excellent selection of fresh fruit on offer too we had one dinner during our stay which was appetising mdrink was reasonably priced hotel staff made our stay will definitely come again radiohead were quite magnificent too,1.0
do let the entrance to the hotel worry you from the outside set pretty much in a bustling market the hotel seems like it star but once you get to your room you realise you truly made a great choice by staying here we first got a room on the floor and had to ask to change rooms as the window was literally looking out directly onto another building just a stone throws away it was so claustrophobic we asked to change rooms and we were given the top floor room wow what a difference we were literally looking at the acropolis the bed is comfortable works well loved the laundry service where they do a whole bag of your laundry for a very small fee within hours the breakfast was excellent too varied on different days with extremely friendly staff the location is perfect so close to everything sensational local eateries right around the corner wine bars local shops coffee shops no tourists in sight i would definitely come back if i could be guaranteed a higher floor room the bar on the rooftop has wonderful views just feels like it can do with some more decorating,1.0
it was excellent service and nice staying at this wonderful welcome at the checking time with nice and friendly staff room is clean and comfortable even though the hotel does have any outside views as it located and almost surrounded by buildings and far from noisy streets we enjoyed the stay rooms are air breakfast is good with excellent helpful freindly and pleasant staff thank you for great service and highly recommend,1.0

spent a week in this hotel whilst attending a nearby conference it is a bit out from the main buzz of las ramblas but easily accessible by tram that stops outside the euros by hotel is outstanding rooms airy and very clean with good air conditioning the staff were all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was outstanding the beach is minutes walk away the rooftop pool ideal after a hard day and there were several good eating places a few minutes walk would definitely stay again,1.0

i enjoyed my stay at hotel moderno which is located perfectly at the intersection of la rambla and carrer de in central barcelona the welcome from staff was friendly and i found the room clean and comfortable the wifi signal was excellent it could get a little noisy at night but that is only because you are metres away from one of barcelona main thoroughfares the air con can take a while to cool the room on a hot day but once it gets going it does the job i did try the hotel breakfast,1.0

hotel is under renovation but did interfere with stay rooms are clean but on small side no but they did provide a fan as it was warm there is a shuttle from the airport but they charge euros for a round trip which was fine but it was advertised that there was a charge was first hard to find where shuttle picks you up and it is a short walk from the airport staff are friendly and very helpful and accommodating restaurant in the hotel is good the breakfast is an additional charge from the room there are no other restaurants or stores near the hotel as it is more of a residential area overall stay was comfortable and convenient for our purposes,1.0

we stayed here for a week during our visit to athens we had a car and valet service was good just drop the car off at the entrance of the carpark and the valet guy will park it for you the location of the hotel is okay there a train station across the road but you would have to be fit for steps down into the station and up when you return to the hotel there is a bread shop opposite the hotel hours in case you need some there is a swimming pool in the rooftop area but it always crowded we can see acropolis from the rooftop bar facilities in the rooms were good you get a coffee maker free capsules only and the usual fridge ironing board etc the usual beds were big and comfortable as well,1.0
this is a hotel that meets your needs it clean safe quiet and cool it simple so do expect frills but at the price point and location it totally worth it the neighborhood is gorgeous and the location is perfect,1.0
the hotel itself is good what you would expect from a mercure but please beware if you are staying while the building work is going on beside the hotel not there fault i know but we are just back from a night stay the work seems to only be during the week but it starts from and the hotel actually shakes there is no way you can sleep through this so unless you want a very early start best to double check if the work is still going on before you book,1.0

stayed july room was pleasant and comfortable however at our expectations were not met i passed on breakfast even though it was paid for looking unappetising and poor quality dining room is very outdated a good morning how are you when greeted would be nice upon arrival to the breakfast room check in was very poor phone calls and visit to the hotel and the parking situation was still not made clear as the parking facilities for this hotel is not straightforward make use of your website trips back to the desk to get the room keys to work correctly staff need serious basic training at reception we feel lastly staff were friendly however the guy the area on the needs a proper talking to how he treated and spoke to the staff was shockingly horrific the swearing the tone he took the body language pointing fingers and raising of hands and physically rushing past me that i nearly dropped my drink actually unsettled me to the point i had to leave he is in the wrong job if he gets that angry i felt so sorry for the waiter out of order i wo be returning,0.0
stayed for one night and enjoyed hotel lovely staff and room great rooftop pool and bar with view across athens towards acropolis close to metro stop although we strolled to centre in late afternoon immediate area looks gritty but typical of busy working area of metropolis we felt safe walking nearby not unlike union square delaney in nyc took taxi to hotel after evening out inexpensive about euro from outdoor cinema nearacropolis,1.0
first off the location is great as is close to everything but not in the middle of all the tourists at the end of a day of touring all you want is to escape from the masses stay away from the old quarter and enjoy a glass of wine by a pool ahh art gallery has both the location and the pool on its rooftop if you like art then you have a bonus as there is a gallery in the basement with exhibition as well as permanent collection throughout the hotel in fact each floor is named after an artist while all of that makes for a huge winner in barcelona there are a few areas that could use improvement the carpets are worn and the rooms at least ours had markings on the walls from wear and tear the pool is a great escape but be forewarned that it is shallow so no diving either way you love the view and you can order drinks and food to enjoy your rest there is a small training room next to the pool but we never used the exercise since we walked all day service is fine not over the top but you receive a welcome glass of cava champagne and cleaning is very good breakfast is a nice buffet and most people enjoy that enjoy,1.0
relatively unassuming from the outside but a joy to enter lovely traditional decor and artwork first class staff who without exception were a joy a very comfortable and well appointed room and not expensive what more could you ask,1.0
from the moment we arrived at the pembroke townhouse hotel we were made to feel as welcome as if we were staying with friends lovely touches like homemade elderflower cordial at reception and a kitchenette opposite reception where you can make tea and coffee and help yourself to gorgeous home baked cookies before flopping into the comfy sofa and armchairs in the lounge area the staff are all extremely helpful and seem happy to go beyond the call of duty to ensure their guests comfort we had asked for rooms next to each other and got rooms in their own little corridor which was lovely the rooms are not high spec but clean quiet and the double beds are huge and very comfortable good tv too breakfasts are really worth including in your booking really the best hotel breakfasts i had in a long time home baking with heavenly soda bread scones and cakes even homemade baked beans the waiting staff were lovely and made each morning a treat the location is perfect as it a minute walk away from the very busy centre so convenient but a lovely place to begin and end a busy day of sightseeing in dublin and in the evening if you want to stay close to home a few v good restaurants within a minute walk we will be back to dublin and definitely back to the pembroke townhouse hotel,1.0
what a great hotel this was we stayed here for about days and were amazed and so happy about the hospitality and services at this hotel very friendly staff a big shout out to nikos who helped me with translating some greek meds the breakfast is very very good filling hearty and good coffee we felt weird if our day did start with the breakfast it better than the hilton breakfast there a gym but we did use it as we were out a lot but when we stayed in room service was splendid the restaurant is also fantastic very good food and quit affordable there also a myriad of good restaurants nearby too better room service pizza than italy in this reviewer opinion mini bar was stocked though but we bought our own cheap but delicious greek wine i called down and they even sent up an opener other hotels did not do this we even asked to use an iron and ironing board metro is close walking distance to city squares convenience store mins away for snacks and such and the are amazing we wish we collected some more for the rest of our trip without a doubt we would stay here again,1.0

the location of this hotel is fantastic we walked most places but the metro was within a couple of blocks and when we did ride we could get everywhere we wanted to go easily the train station is right behind the hotel so trips outside of the city are convenient as well there is a bar onsite just for hotel guests and we had a lovely couple of hours there one night relaxing and drinking wonderful mojitos the room was maybe the largest hotel room i ever been in the shower could have fit four or five people and there was a separate tub as well the views were spectacular both during the day and at night,1.0

i really loved staying at this hyatt the vibe coming in was very up beat and inviting i do not typically go to hotel bars but the music and ambiance was enticing the rooms were fantastic with a living space dressing two tv and very comfortable bed the view was nice but a little obstructed by the trees it was somewhat removed from the center of town but easily accessible via metro or tram its even fine to walk to everything if you want to and have the time it was within walking distance to the zoo and to the windmill and brewery breakfast was full of many food choices from the buffet and nice selections from the menu,1.0
room rspecially the receptionist he was rude and not at all friendly just for him i would not recommend this place to anyone,0.0
wow kimpton and here i thought i already stayed in the best kimpton hotel as an inner circle member i love the kimpton family and do like to choose favorites but has managed to break out in quite a sprint and is leading the pack in my humble opinion the place is beautiful the location perfect the food delicious and the staff amazing each room is different i had one of each of my sons and one for myself and each was beautiful and unique i was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the penthouse suite and my god was it amazing no spoilers there and experience it i took the time to read the not so stellar reviews left here and sure there may have been a few kinks as is expected with any new establishment also the merger has created some reward program issues that i sure will require time to work through but through my many many kimpton stays over the past years i have never met a mediocre kimpton employee they all behave as though they have a personal investment in the kimpton establishment i find that both impressive and refreshing dewitt is indeed keeping with the kimpton tradition and putting a bit of extra flare on top thank you so much for a wonderful stay i shall return,1.0

i stayed here in the of july and was disappointed at the approach of the hotel my colleague and i used the hotel tonight app to book the hotel we paid usd to book the hotel on the same morning which i though was a good deal considering the lovely location of the hotel at the time of check in we had to pay an additional euros to get single beds instead of sharing a bed and were told that we were being upgraded room was small and not worth the additional money or upgrade check out time was noon and i had an evening flight the next day i therefore wanted to request for a late check out i asked if i could come back at pm from my meeting and change in the room and leave the hotel at pm the receptionist said she would check with her superiors and call me back response was that they wanted an additional euros for each extra hour they seemed extremely opportunistic at every stage and not the sort of experience that leaves a good taste bell boys were good,0.0

the hotel interior is very luxurious however the rooms did not meet the standards one would expect for such a hotel our first room had problems with air conditioning fine if you like sleeping in a sauna when mentioning this to the staff they did not seem surprised which makes me think they new it was faulty the second room was smarter but not exceptional our reservation included breakfast the restaurant was so small there was not enough room to accommodate the guests which meant long queues they then informed many people in the line that breakfast was not included by this time we decided to leave and have breakfast in the city centre would not stay there again,0.0

we stayed here for two nights in early july the location is very good you can walk to most of dublin attractions some reviews have mentioned you can get a bus from the airport but if you have much luggage or multiple passengers it might be worth getting a cab we paid about euro the hotel is very new with nice modern touches like usb ports on both sides of the bed the stall shower is nice and the there is sufficient bathroom counter space for those who like to do hair and makeup the air conditioning is good and cold the included breakfast is very good there are several hot options as well as plenty of pastries cereal and juices there is both brewed coffee and espresso the lobby was very busy during breakfast but the staff did an excellent job of keeping everything well stocked and clean if we return to dublin we will likely stay here again,1.0

the property is situated in an ideal location in the center of all the action of the plaka district we walked to all of athens main attractions including the acropolis ancient agora and acropolis museum the hotel is a solidly constructed building with lots of marble throughout and high ceilings our room was very large for european standards clean and equipped with a small kitchenette and modern bath fixtures facing off street our room was very quiet to traffic noise being a classic building some brief hallway noise from occasional passing guests in hallway can be expected they serve a freshly prepared plentiful breakfast meticulously setup and attended to by the pleasant pantry staff we appreciated the efficient and helpful front desk personnel whom offered many suggestions and recommendations it s a great choice of accommodations for downtown athens,1.0
my husband and i stayed at the divani acropolis for three nights and enjoyed it very much we could see the acropolis from our room esp impressive when it is lit at night it is close to walk to the acropolis and the museum we walked the few blocks from the metro station after taking the metro from the airport and had no difficulty finding the hotel the bed was a king size and comfortable the bathroom had a large tub with a shower our hallway and room was freshly painted did feel tired to us the air conditioner kept the room at a comfortable temp and we did hear outside noise there was an outdoor pool which we used every afternoon as it was over degrees the week we were in athens it is easy to use the metro to get to the other areas of the city the staff were very friendly and helpful and the lobby is large and impressive we saw many different restaurants nearby as we were walking around the staff told us where to catch the xpress bus to take to the port for the cruise we were taking we would definitely stay there again,1.0
we crossed path with emirates crew members at the ac marriott forum barcelona we asked them how their stay was they said that their stay was good worth we assume that our stay was good worth as long as they stay with us at same hotel emirates has good taste and right choice where crew members can enjoy and get good value we loved swimming pool and quiet bar on the rooftop of the hotel the hotel is located next to marbella beach and forum shopping mall including grocery store of course the hotel is ideal for families big minus is not reliable computer center where business center is located on ground floor at ac marriott forum barcelona there is forever problem with computers and internet however our stay was good worth anyway,1.0
hands down the worst value for money ever i paid euros for a night stay and the room could have been worth more than a night i stayed in a travelodge in london weeks ago that knocked spots off this place absolutely tiny room when we got the ironing board out we could get round the room we literally had to climb across the bed queen sized bed was more like a normal double toilet right next to the head of the bed not pleasant for the mrs the following morning after a night on the guinness staff unhelpful one in particular very rude,0.0
i absolutely loved this hotel the breakfast is just fantastic well cooked huge choices and set us up for the day we were also delighted by the bar the first night due to arriving late we ate in the bar so pleased we did as the food ambience and service was turned out to be one of the best and cheapest meals we had whilst in dublin it is unusual for a hotel restaurant to be so very reasonably priced we would have eaten there again if it had been our choice in a group as subsequent meals eaten elsewhere proved of lower or equal quality but far more expensive rooms were clean and spacious it was quiet the staff were polite and helpful i admit the initial impression was that it was a little in places but it turned out that the distressed glass near the bar is designed like that my fashion radar is obviously off kilter would absolutely recommend this hotel,1.0
its a very nice hotel very near central stops away from central by tram which one can just outside good staff and good breakfast hotel is in a quiet place and good neighbouhood,1.0
my wife and i had an enchanting time here despite her hip injury with regards to the latter the staff could not have been more kind and helpful the security manager christos even escorting us to the euro clinic and arranging taxis for us the clinic service was good and my wife was restored to health following an intramuscular injection and the prescription of painkillers never have i experienced such service from a hotel and the king george really relieved the tension and pain of hip strain while on vacation furthermore we loved our suite room with its bijou sitting room and ornate victorian depth bathtub our room was the epitome of comfort and a great base from which to explore athens the below ground floor gymnasium was also a good facility at which i whiled away many the final analysis it was not just christos who impressed all staff gave us superb attention,1.0
the service is excellent and there is a beautiful pool this is a good hotel for families with children the rooms are large and the staff is very attentive and courteous the neighborhood is a bit weird but it is not far from all the main attractions and is and easy to access,1.0
we stayed here for night in july the room was really small with a corridor for a bathroom no bath the shower leaked on the bathroom floor so we needed a towel to stop the floor getting wet small windows very small with a beautiful view of a drain pipe we had to shuffle things around and put things on the floor in order to use the kettle to make a drink on the up side the valet was really helpful allowing us to park on the front whilst checking in we complained about the room and were told that we would not be charged for the mini bar we had only had nuts and pringles but on arriving home they have been charged this was a special treat for my partner the room cost over which i was happy to pay but unfortunately just it did feel like a treat and also did feel like value for money also on the corridor we were on there was a funny smell but there was a sign saying apologies for building work staff were pleasant but overall for a star hotel was really disappointed,0.0
stayed here for nights with family members for my nieces birthday reception staff were friendly and helpful location was very dated and bedding ripped completely different to what is advertised on the website we had a mouse in our room on the first night spoke to reception and was moved to a room on the second floor the bedding in that room was more ripped than the first also found the following morning that also had mice and bedbugs i have taken photos of the bugs in the beds and the state of the room as we all ended up with bites and one of the girls in our group has ended up with very painful and infected bite i would defiantly not recommend this hotel and think the owners need to improve the standards i would not stay here again,1.0
quiet calm and clean and only place we could you for such great helping us out to stay and loved having your bus shuttle too even for am in thank you we enjoyed our stay,1.0
an awesome hotel and restaurant experience the hotel itself lives up to its promise of s unique boutique hotel with very friendly service and all possible amenities the restaurant was simply brilliant every dish a work of art,1.0
we had a great experience at hotel balmoral lovely spacious modern clean rooms no issues with anything great location in the city for us close to diagonal metro station hardly heard anything from other guests perhaps the roof terrace could benefit from allowing food drinks out there but honestly in a city with as much to do as barcelona it was no hardship would definitely stay here again,1.0
this place was wonderful it was clean and comfortable the location was very close to everything and the cab stop was right outside the door the front desk helped plan activities and ordered tours,1.0
had two nights at this hotel with my teen daughter to give her a taste of amsterdam it a okay value for money and minutes walk from the van gogh museum and minutes from most places of interest but no parking for the car,1.0
lovely hotel with wonderful staff this is the first time we stayed all family at grand hotel central the hotel was in great location close to every thing you need the roof top was a good place to chilled out and enjoyed the amazing view really we had fantastic time the more important at this hotel was the staff all of them were very helpful and friendly from the doorman until the managers but i would like to give extreme thanks to hicham for his hospitality and attention and the excellent service which gave us during our stay thank you recommend this lovely hotel and sure next year we come back,1.0
we had a fabulous water view from room upgraded us for booking online ate in the busy with yummy cocktails there was a young hip and also a business crowd hotel had valet parking a must great friendly service an outstanding breakfast highly recommend the marker hotel,1.0
i spent a delightful few days in this historic hotel that was completely updated about ten years ago and is now a marriott renaissance property the public rooms are beautiful and elegant the food and service were excellent at the restaurants the hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming my spacious floor room had high windows that looked out over stephen s green and beyond the bed was extremely comfortable the beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub shower and commode was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving the room had plenty of lighting a good work desk and plush comfortable reading chairs soundproofing was excellent and i never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly service the hotel has a great location two blocks from the natural history museum and the national gallery of ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and was disappointed when i had to leave the shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent dublin hotel the westbury a century property that does not have the same level of elegance warmth or beauty the combination of history comfort and grace makes the shelbourne an extraordinary place they clearly value their guests and make them feel special it was a wonderful introduction to dublin and really deserves six stars,1.0
a very modern and hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the service was everything was we would definitely recommend this hotel the staff was very helpful in booking tourist tickets,1.0
we tried this restaurant during our walk downtown athens we were surprised by the variety of the menu for a light dinner the salad with prosciutto was amazing we also tried the greek cheeses dish and it was also good the chef with the eyeglasses was very helpful and he was explaining with politeness and professionnalisme all the details of the dishes best choice for a light dinner downtown,1.0
our second time back at the royal and enjoyed it once again staff are helpful view of the acropolis over breakfast is sensational and the breakfast itself is great only a short walk to the plaka district and in a great spot,1.0
this hotel is in a wonderful location in barcelona rooms albeit small are extremely clean and the staff at reception are great with advice regarding transport and general enquiries the range of food at breakfast was good and very fresh and the rooftop bar is a great location to wind down after a lot of walking which barcelona lends itself only downside is that it takes a little while to get used to the rumblings from the underground however after a couple of days we barely noticed it at no time was the noise bad enough to affect our sleep,1.0
het hotel needs a renovation my room was dark noisy woke up several times a night and old people at the front desk were very unfriendly the breakfast is very expensive and in an unpleasant basement only the location and the pool are worth its money,0.0
we arrived in dublin at the end of a wonderful week holiday in ireland and the merrion was the perfect ending from the smiles and friendliness of the staff the care taken over every detail the simply beautiful accommodation the merrion truly manages to make you feel cosseted and privileged to stay there a real jewel,1.0
i stayed with my girlfriend during the august bank holiday very good service excellent spa services always open during the day also the bar is well furnished super location the financial area of dublin very close to city center,1.0
this is a good quality hotel offering good standards of service and accommodation at great just outside the city but only a few stops and a minute metro ride hotel casa is great for those wishing to avoid high city centre rates but still enjoy ease of access to all the attractions and sights it is remarkably easy to get quickly into the city centre the nearest metro station being only a very short walk good and efficient check in service was experienced from the reception staff and i was extremely happy to be welcomed particularly as we arrived early after our flight and it was nice to be greeted warmly with such pleasant service and be able to check into our room modern and bright the hotel has a nice vibrant feel our stay was only a short one and we did not have the opportunity to sample all of the facilities but the bar and coffee area looked great and the rooftop terrace was so nice and a relaxing place to spend time after a day in the room was a little on the small side but all very functional and ideal for the shorter stay the beds were particularly comfortable with really nice mattress toppers which made for a good nights sleep my only small criticism was the very small supply of tea and coffee making products that were available in the room i would have no hesitation in taking the chance to stay again at hotel,1.0
room very clean and airy well laid out all meals excellent staff attentive professional and friendly seems to come from the top was asked how was my visit and could he do anything to help more than once good location buses at front of hotel to centre city and other destinations lawns and trees very soothing after long trip,1.0
the only good thing about this hotel while using the term hotel very loosely is it close to everything and exactly where you want to bestayed for days and they did not clean our room change our sheets or change our towels once even after asking them every day and again assuring us it would be done it never got done,1.0
perfectly placed for the city our room was spacious and clean and even though we were at the front of the hotel there was no noise at all so our sleep was never disturbed the bed was wonderful a very good size and probably the most comfortable bed we ever slept in when away from home staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome would recommend this hotel without any hesitation,1.0
we have just come back from nights at the parliament hotel room were basic but could see what other people were moaning about i personally stayed in worser hotels rooms did what was sleep in no issues with the bed slept like a log all nights cuz of all the walking round the city staff were helpful everytime we asked something ventured down to the pub and one afternoon we had a quick snack food was lovely location was good right on the edge of temple bar will be visiting the hotel when we return again,1.0
this is a fantastic location and lovely hotel but we arrived at as we had a mad hatter afternoon tea organised i explained that we all had an over night bag with us that we needed to just needed to drop off as we could check in here yet he told me he could take small bags i told home we had stuff planned and we were taking the bags with us eventually he gave us a boardroom but told me we could leave them there all day we picked them up at and he gave us a lot of attitude again half of us got bags and while the other half held a table in the bar where we were buying drinks he told me he could leave the room open we only went to the bar and the other half went back and they got told to hurry up raphelz i think was his name he is a bad first impression all other staff were lovely mad hatter tea party was fantastic and we had dinner in the hotel that night it was great and the were very accommodating to the celiac in our group the rooms were lovely but very warm there was a fan in the table but one of the blades was loose so u could turn it on cos it was soooo loud and u could sleep with it on we also found last tenants boxers behide the curtain as we opened the window,0.0
what a fabulous hotel minutes from the central station and on the chic keizersgracht canal this boutique hotel has stars but should have more our room overlooked the canal and was spacious for a city hotel the décor was brilliant and nothing was too much trouble for the reception staff i had many visits planned on our itinerary and we managed them all plus some others due to the location of this hotel in fact we walked everywhere the furthest museum was sledelyk museum which was about minutes leisurely stroll watch out for the bikes anne franks house was no more than minutes and much the same for dam square so this hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but so peaceful we were there for just the four nights and because of our busy schedule we only had breakfast in the hotel on the last day we should have got up earlier because for the price of an orange juice coffee and croissant in a café we could have had a full continental breakfast including omelette in the hotel for the same price all of the staff were very helpful and if you stay here you really wo be disappointed when we go back to amsterdam again we will definitely book this hotel again,1.0
notes patric was extremely helpful you must pay in full upon check in warm reception area upstairs with treats since we arrived before service was impeccable be aware that the in our street view room could keep up possibly because it is controlled from the hotel they would bump it up but they brought us a very quiet portable room which worked great throughout our stay the hotel photos on this site show the top floor there are other balcony rooms and some have no windows at all so know what you booking location is amazing it like rodeo drive in beverly hills read the fine print about booking with breakfast included it is good but you do want to be locked into a euro breakfast every day as the selections would get stale after meal there and you must eat before also you can always eat there for euros daily and i understand you could order omelettes specially made for you the only complaint is the room was so modern and minimalistic that they did have major conveniences like drawers towel bars or counter space the nightstand has a large lamp so you can barely use the surface we had a street facing room and blackout shade was and windows blocked all noise two of gaudi works are within blocks of the hotel one is next door safe area taxis everywhere stupid humid all day in the summer terrace bar had views and great drink but food is sub,1.0
the hotel is in a good position some minute walk from the underground green line it reaches the main touristic area the room is clean with a big bathroom and a very big shower breakfast was very staff is very nice,1.0
great location a few mins away from the major trains and metro station very friendly and helpful staff rooms are clean and modern facing the main road but quiet we will definitely stay this hotel again,1.0
this is a great hotel all the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly they go out of there way to ensure a good stay the hotel itself is very pretty and spotlessly clean a very substantial and delicious breakfast is served at the rooftop restaurant which overlooks the temple of zeus and has a terrific view of the acropolis terrific value,1.0
room not ready on arrival staff rude charged twice for the room when i told them they said of course we preauthorized the card and refunded it they sent me a ticket that is not even mine so i finaly paid for a room like this ridiculous,0.0
ideal location for visiting dublin and enjoying the nocturnal joys of temple rooms kind staff and good restaurant and pub with live music every a few minutes walk from temple bar christ church and saint patrick cathedral,1.0
the facility was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful it was also in a very nice part of town not downtown but on the outskirts in a safe neighborhood i would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity,1.0
we stayed one night in june after a tour of ireland i have to say that we had the best sleep at this hotel than any of the others we encountered it is centrally located easy to get to the luas train and walking over to shopping areas do let the area fool you it is a great little hotel very clean friendly and helpful staff,1.0
small and basic rooms but we were out all day so all we needed was sleep and a shower between of us it was pretty tight staff were lovely and the hotel is in a great location close to the park and walking distance to many attractions we had a good night stay to start off our europe holiday,1.0
loved our suite with view of acropolis room was big spacious clean comfortable as was the rest of the hotel food was good at the roof top restaurant and we enjoyed breakfast although nothing out of the ordinary,1.0
i think americans need to temper their expectations when they travel to europe was the room small absolutely athens is a city that is literally thousands of years old and this hotel is in the heart of it we walked through the plaka and had a fabulous dinner there a rooftop hot tub and restaurant at the hotel too the breakfast was amazing it had anything you could think of the staff spoke you can basically walk anywhere from here we took the subway from the airport and walked from sygmata square here maybe minutes we had giant luggage and managed just fine the hotel is air and that worked really yes it is a small room,1.0
i went with my friends on a quiet warm weekday morning in july to have a swim even under heatwave tempeatures the water is chilly making the swim unpleasant the service is slow unfriendly and cold like the water never sorry,1.0
the staff is great very helpful with directions and printing tickets for attractions the location is perfect most everything within a min walk the only drawback is the wifi it works well during the day but it terrible in the evening on the floor,1.0
my husband and i spent a couple days in athens while on our honeymoon upon arrival after a very long flight the staff was extremely friendly offered us local food options and answered every question they even had a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us both times the rooms were clean and modern and the bed was so comfortable after a kong day of travel the breakfast in the morning was delicious and they had a constant supply of free snacks and drinks location was near so many restaurants shopping and history could be happier,1.0
we spent nights at the hotel nouvel the central location a block off las ramblas was excellent and the hotel itself was fine if a little tired our room was clean and quiet but small the staff left us underwhelmed however they seemed more interested in surfing the internet in the back room and acted bothered if you had a question when we arrived they also required a printed copy of my reservation i had made my reservations through trip advisor which had linked me to a site called hotelquickly i had even contacted the hotel directly prior to arriving to confirm my but despite all of this they demanded that i print out my confirmation for them i have made many on line hotel reservations and this is the only time i have ever been required to print out my confirmation i m pretty certain that i had reserved and paid for breakfast but they said i hadn t and i chose not to argue it this happened on a couple other reservations in so in the future i think i would just make room reservations and then decide on breakfast when i arrived at the location the breakfast at novel appeared to be quite overpriced and we found many cafes nearby that were open in the including el mos across the street that had the best café con leche we found in all of spain,1.0
i stayed at the morgan in april and came back to stay there in june simply because of the amazing treatment received it located smack in the city center amazing restaurants and bars simply stepping outside of the hotel got an upgrade due to overbooking and got the celebrity penthouse it got a huge terrace with camping van up there and is super cosy and got breathtaking views never ever stayed at such an amazing suite the next time i got back i got a regular double room and it was superb comfy beds all rooms have complimentary fruit in them and it fresh and has an almost gothic design highly recommended this place,1.0
i arrived here yesterday after canceling three other hotels in the center of athens while this cozy beautiful boutique hotel is centrally located but it quiet and away from crowd front desk ladies were most friendly and helpful in suggesting several tours breakfast is great the hotel is located in a residential posh area surrounded with high end stores but just minutes walk away from metro parliament national garden and many other activities i am enjoying my stay and will most definitely recommend and will return in future it feels like home thank you,1.0
element makes you at home straight away with friendly staff checking you in the ambience amenities and people make the difference the location adds to its appeal which is ideal for a restful night away from the noise and pollution of the city,1.0
the mercer barcelona is fantastic right in the centre of the gothic quarter within walking distance of the main attractions and yet within the hotel there is a sense of peace and calm that takes you away from where you actually are breakfast in the glazed courtyard was the perfect start to the day and the roof terrace was a relaxing place to go after a days exploring and also a lovely venue before an evening out all this could only be achieved with people who have a passion for what they do and all the mercer staff went out of there way to make our stay memorable,1.0
only great things to say about this place great location renovated hotel in the heart of the city rooms were excellent and very modern service was superb breakfast wow best one in europe on this adventure are room had a direct view of a busy canal,1.0
amazing hotel staff and location value for your money it is very quite and relaxing although located on the ramblas the bed and pillows were amazing and had the best night sleep in a hotel ever the staff is very friendly and speak perfect english facilities are great and they inform you about every possibility twice a day cleaning on arrival complimentary fruit basket only thing missing is a shower is the only minor point i can think of,1.0
location is perfect breakfast so satisfied clean helpfull staff just next to la pedrera el nacional and plaza catalunya is so touristic and business so good it own garden so big and at the top there is a terrace bar which is popular for local people too,1.0
great location the reception staff are awesome always smiling and ready to help i stayed for nights and on way back from santorini for another night on the second leg there was a mix up in their reservations and they acknowledged it were very hospitable and adjusted me in a presidential suite i forgot the gentleman name who marshalled it all but it was great their breakfast is good by european standards and the fact we eat only very near everything shops food outlets indian food etc great view of acropolis from top and right next to parliament house however they seriously need to improve their the ac control does not work from the room so no change can be brought about by the guest and it very hot in mattresses are lumpy and uncomfortable and no water bottles provided by house keeping all are charged difficult to fathom that it an old establishment and needs to work on their shortcomings would love to stay again if rooms are cool and beds provide a good sleep by the way i loved visiting athens,1.0
my family stayed at the toren for nights for the first leg of your day trip in europe the toren staff goes above and beyond to make guests feel welcome the rooms were beautifully decorated with large and modern bathrooms there is a refrigerator with snacks and an amazing coffee maker in the room we were unable to stay for breakfast the second day so they sent us off with coffee to go the locations is outstanding we were block away from the anne frank house i would definitely stay here when we return,1.0
we highly recommend this jewel of a hotel located in the poble sec region of barcelona staff was on recommendations for the surrounding area and immediate assistance with any request the pool is a welcome getaway from barcelona hustle and the restaurant puts out a delicious buffet if you can spring for one of the penthouse rooms you wo regret it,1.0
i was positively surprised with this hotel it not near the touristic attractions but there a subway station two blocks away it an efficient mean of transportation except for the stairs inside the stations a big advantage is the existence of a mall with stores like fnac carrefour h m etc the room had adequate space for a couple with a child wifi was good too there were not many options of tv channels a nice restaurant with activities for the children at diinner the terrace had a pool and fitness center during several evenings there were a musical programming for the guests,1.0
we stayed for nights at the arts hotel barcelona for a family vacation the hotel itself is big and busy initially at check in we were told that our room was ready and they ca guarantee a time of check in however another room was ready with partial sea this was at pm when asked again how long the wait would be for our requested room sea view again we were told that we could not be given a specific time since we were tired and were traveling with our year old daughter we took the room it was a big spacious room with beautiful views of the sea that made our visit much more pleasant housekeeping were very efficient the pool area was very crowded and noisy for a hotel that size the pool is extremely small however service is great and staff are all very helpful the lobby was very busy and chaotic overall it is a luxurious hotel staff are very kind and go out of their way to help we did face some wrong charges upon check out almost euros extra however that problem was fixed so i guess the hotel needs to work on the computer system that they currently use overall it a nice hotel with helpful staff and a great location and for sure would stay there again,1.0
not impressed rude reception staff extremely rude manager myself two friends stayed in blooms as we attended a concert in dublin when we arrived back at hotel after our night out it took the doorman about minutes to answer the door there was anyone on the reception desk or answering the we were three women in a part of town who did appreciate being locked out at that hour of the night approximately it is safe anywhere the breakfast was horrible and i had to ask times for some ice for the oj as it was just sitting out all morning this hotel is a pure tourist trap and they should be ashamed to be changing people to stay there never again i wrote a review on their facebook page and they did i noticed that they only replied to which there were many of,0.0
best location attentive and warm service we ad to leave very early to the airport so our kids got very nice breakfast boxes for the way small and personal atmosphere beautiful stylish very large equipped rooms excellent and very recommended hotel if you are in athens,1.0
this is an amazing boutique hotel located within a min walk to the acropolis min to plaka and to the syntagma metro station we were pleasantly surprised to have received complimentary breakfasts on our arrival leonidas was extremely friendly and helpful to us we booked a family room which was extremely spacious there was sufficient room for suitcases and the two adults and a and of us the bathroom was very clean with a big shower the breakfast was very good with a wide selection of cereals pastries cold meats cheese etc the complimentary nespresso in the room was a welcome treat although our room was close to the breakfast area we did not hear any noise will certainly go back to this hotel,1.0
hotel stay was very good with helpful staff the location is great mn walk from main attractions the room was cosy and nice breakfast was really good and will get you going for a good chunk of the day,1.0
this hotel was in a perfect location everything was within walking distance we were able to walk and see beautiful sites as well as spend a day at the acropolis great restaurants were nearby at sunset the hotel has a great rooftop view there is a restaurant that looked good but we had other plans the service was great and they even packed up a great bagged breakfast for us to take the morning we headed to the airport great hotel and excellent service,1.0
convenient location comfortable rooms clean and excellent service i love the rooftop bar it has beautiful view of the city the room is nice new and big but they only offer complimentary water on your day breakfast buffet is nice with great choices but the hot food comes out a little too late i think it starts at or which was too late if you have an a full day tour where you have to leave the hotel early,1.0
loved this hotel room was clean and functional with a nice bathroom our room was on the front second floor but was very quiet and had good air conditioning much appreciated during the hot weather very walkable area about minutes to placa catalunya and minutes to sagrada familia,1.0
i have stayed at this hotel twice in the past months early june and late july why did i return because i had a good experience in june because of the hotel location and because of its value for having said that the experience in late july was not as good why is that because the hotel is a victim of it neighborhood there is a sports bar right next door when folks leave there invariably drunk they are extraordinarily noisy they are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood then there the homeless in a churchyard across the street they have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter the police come remove them and they back within an hour then the trucks come to make deliveries around am with back up beepers and running engines the tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning the staff work extremely hard and they are terrific frankly they do deserve this constant barrage on their efforts my room was an adequate size it was spotless the bathroom and shower were very good daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere so should you stay here yes just get a room in the back of the hotel,1.0
i stayed at the hotel for days the rooms where clean along with basic toiletries provided however i would not class the hotel as a four star the breakfast was mediocre but the scenery of the coastline was a magnificent treat the street noise with the addition of cars driving past could heard at night as i am not a light sleeper it was much of an issue but you can request a room away from the main road coffee making facilities were provided as part of the stay one certain element which i was very impressed with was no clean tea drinking cups had been provided on two separate occasions i was left with dirty cups the main guest elevator broke down a few days into our stay noise can be heard from nearby rooms loud talking doors shutting and people pacing up and down the corridor on one occasion the kitchen associated with the hotel ran out of energy to supply the kitchen the cook was tad rude when explaining this the reception are happy to help with any queries our taxi requests were dealt with efficiently spare ice was provided for each floor as it was a warm it a clean hotel with a beautiful view hotel provides you with all the basic requirement to ironing fridge etch printing with no additional chargers you can access the nearby tram stop to make your way into the city centre the hotel is approx away from syntagma square on,0.0
great location and price easy to get to from syntagma square metro station re for airport small compact room and bathroom in case that is a concern i was travelling alone so all fine for me boutique hotel and decor lovely entrance to reception great for plaka for restaurants wandering around and shops reception staff friendly and great for any information fantastic restaurant about mins walk away called athinaikon mitropoleos street road parallel with the road the hotel is on recommend you go to the top floor and see the some of the acropolis from the roof top at night and in the day time i have added some photos from the roof top area they do serve breakfast but lots of places available within walking distance would stay here is no lift please be warned fortunately a lovely american guy came in just after me and very kindly offered to take my heavy suitcase up the flights of stairs to my room thanks again if you read this i managed to slowly carry my suitcase down and the young lady assisted me when she saw me descending once near the reception otherwise bring a strong man with you my room initially smelt of stale smoke,1.0
we were really happy with this apartment and also the staff we were arriving late and were worried that this may have been an issue as they do have a hours manned reception but there was a smiling young woman waiting for us outside the building the apartment is one of quite a few which is managed by mayerling and ours was very modern with ply timber walls not a large apartment but everything we needed including an efficient ac and kitchenette staff were so helpful we ca wait to go back also ca go wrong with a supermarket a few doors away,1.0
my sister and i arrived here after a long day of flying from the dublin airport it was an easy bus ride for a walk to this hotel i had requested a quiet room so we could get plenty of sleep and get over our jet lag as soon as possible we were given a room on the top floor facing the back which was perfect we had a nice view and occasionally heard church bells toll the hotel manager was charming and helpful in her suggestions for wonderful nearby restaurants staying there nights was a perfect amount of time to walk through the city and see the sights,1.0
we spended night at this wonderful place we really enjoyed our time there the hotel have a fantastic view of the hestorical barcelona cathedral have very nice was very nice and clean reception team was very helpful i loved the walk in the city will go back again,1.0

what a great find in the heart of downtown amsterdam this hotel is quite old but has been done up marvellously into a chic and hip building we stayed in the cheapest twin room which was affectionately called the shoebox room by the lady who checked us in yes it is small but we never felt cramped or like we needed more space the bathroom is actually really big with a good shower the beds were comfy and the tv was a good size with a range of channels to pick from the walk to the dam and red light district is about mins while a walk to centraal station is mins a cute little breakfast bag was delivered to our door each morning with a delicious granola yoghurt banana and orange juice the staff are super friendly and spoke perfect english we loved our stay here and would highly recommend,1.0
i had no idea the hotel would be so close to the beaches and public transit until we checked in and became familiar with our surroundings this hotel is perfect the staff guestrooms location and comfort are all exactly what you want when traveling we will definitely return to this hotel next year not necessary to shop around this is the place to stay,1.0
very good i did not know what to expect from the hotel but overall it was a pleasant experience for a first timer i recommend it to anyone who would like to be close to all sightseeing places and more,1.0
stayed at the westbury on the weekend of the concert while understandably busy a couple of relatively minor issues had the potential to cloud our judgement of the hotel amazing service from ashley on the concierge desk and eimar in guest services not only resolved the issues but ensured we return,1.0
i was not impressed at all with this hotel it is not somewhere you stay as a couple the rooms are tiny the bathrooms are dirty the internet does work unless you sit next to reception and not to mention i was not aware the only way up to any of the rooms is by climbing up ridiculously dangerous stairs the stairs were so steep and you had to go up sets i was never told this and if i had known i would not have stayed here as i have a bad knee this is something that should be advertised in bold and capital letters,0.0
absolutely lovely hotel rooms are great and very comfortable hairdryer iron ironing board in room and refreshments tea coffee biscuits bottles of water replenished daily food very nice drinks cost the same as in most of the bars location was perfect quiet as away from main area however the luas tram runs in front of the hotel and the bus station and train station are a minute walk over the road taxi also opposite distance to attractions such as kilmainham gaol guinness storehouse and dublin zoo there a smoking corner at the back of the hotel within the car parking area staff were all very warm and friendly nothing was too much trouble ate a couple of evenings in the bar area good quality food and there a restaurant too if you want a meal that a bit more upper park area opposite the front of hotel where it nice to sit by the water i highly recommend this hotel and will stay again when i return to dublin,1.0
we stayed nights in a room one large bathroom with access from both the entry hall and the master bedroom twin beds in the main room beds were comfortable both areas had tv there was a nice outdoor space but we were unable to use it as previous guests had made off with the key the door had to be locked or unlocked by an employee we just left it locked to avoid the quirk of the room while it was nice to have separate sleeping areas for parents and kids the kids part of the room which was also larger had a sitting area the patio entrance the coffee maker and the refrigerator not particularly convenient in the mornings when we wanted coffee etc and the kids wanted to sleep some lobby bar was nice for an drink reception was very helpful organizing taxis when we needed suited us as we do mind a nice walk temple bar took us about minutes at a leisurely pace,1.0
great hotel for the price right in the middle of las ramblas gentleman at reception really friendly made us feel really welcome we booked a twin room and there was a mistake so they upgraded us to a one bed appartment at no extra cost spotlessly clean would definitely recommend thank you for a lovely stay,1.0
i am staying in this hotel with my wife for our honeymoon the moment we arrived we were welcomed with great hospitality and the very nice and helpful nice ladies at the reception upgraded us to a deluxe room with a partial sea view the moment they knew we were on our honey the tourist help guide is a fantastically helpful person who highlighted the sights the transportation and the moment we entered the room we were greeted by complimentary hotel is a bit far from the city center but we prefer this to the crowded areas as the rooms are very calm although facing a main street and the room excellent service very highly recommended the staff really make this place more special thank you guys for making our honeymoon a better experience,1.0
it no wonder that the ambassade is a favorite of visitors to amsterdam the service is outstanding and the accommodations are superb i stayed in a suite at the ambassade perhaps ten years ago and although nice i was reluctant to stay in the summer because at that time the hotel did have air conditioning the hotel has within recent years undergone a massive renovation including ac and is a pure delight to stay at the entire lower level is now a bar reading rooms and the lobby the breakfast buffet is excellent and eggs can be ordered the cook at breakfast does need to learn how to make an omelette mine was as flat as a pancake niels and femke at check in were a delight to interface with and my friend and i were upgraded to a spacious apartment the ambassade is borderline luxury but what makes this hotel is the staff all are eager to please and without pretense i typically stay at ultra luxury hotels but i wanted my friend to have a casual but highly comfortable stay in a pure dutch hotel prior to checking in we had stayed the two previous nights at amsterdam most luxurious hotel highly recommend the ambassade i be back,1.0
hotel is located stops from the centraal station on the tram using the tram to get to museums etc was also very easy buy a pass for the trams and buses trams stop at midnight so get to know the bus schedule and drop offs if you plan to hit the clubs and bars room was nice typical size for amsterdam and the breakfast was very good,1.0
night stay although not the closest to the city the metro line literally mins walk away meant getting around was easy as it was a great line to be on add to that you are so close to the beach a great shopping center and convenient for driving north if you have a car missing the city traffic check in was delayed by hour and because of that they gave us access to exec lounge and spa for entire stay which made up for it pool is great a little cold but refreshing rooms are large and very dark so easy to sleep bed is comfortable the breakfast buffet is one of the best i have ever had for quality and choice it costs euro each so if you can get it cheaper by including it in package when you book i would recommend there are too many other breakfast options around the area staff very helpful,1.0
we stayed for nights in july big mistake really underwhelming and full of teenagers and early trust fund the entire hotel works around the teenagers and their party schedules it is literally just like a big glass youth club disco if you are a grown up and get up before midday and expect any staff to be doing anything you will be seriously disappointed during the morning the staff relax and have a break because the trust fund kids are still in bed we went to the pool at on the first morning the advertised pool opening time and found clubbers sitting there surrounded by empty champagne bottles smoking cigarettes there were cigarette ends in the pool we decided to go to the decor is cheap and nasty and the rooms are tacky i hope you dont mind going to the toilet in full sight and sound of your we had a corner suite tacky name for a tacky room and at per night faced a dirty old shipyard and the toilet was just a glass box about metres from the bed my wife was incidents occured during our stay which made us really question the running of the place the manager you will see his very defensive replies on trip advisor in fact he is known locally around barca as conor is never to be seen he is probably in his office writing defensive trip advisor place unless you are here to spend the trust fund on very expensive,0.0
i spent last weekend at the ink hotel with my partner and other we arrived i was impressed with the contemporary design of the hotel check in was relatively quick and as of the rooms were not ready then some of the party were given upgrades we decided not to pay for breakfast in the hotel because at per person per day we thought it expensive there are plenty of places nearby to get food in the morning the hotel is in an ideal location and is one of the main reasons we decided to book would say the rooms at the ink are on the small side but they have everything we needed and the bed was one of the comfiest i experienced in any hotel i stayed we went to check out on the sunday the hotel tried to charge the couples that were given an upgrade this was just a misunderstanding and was cleared up without any extra money being taken the check out time was another big of the staff were friendly and helpful and if i was to return to amsterdam then i would definitely consider staying here again,1.0
i could rate this hotel enough i booked our visit as a little romantic trip for me and my husband and i used a party online booking site to book our room contact was very courteous and helpful as on initial booking the site informed me that i would be getting a ground floor room i contacted the hotel to request an room on an upper level with a balcony to get a bit of a view and i had asked for a couple of extra little romantic decorations in the room and champagne to make arrival that little bit sweeter and they certainly from schiphol airport to centraal station was really easy on the train this took about half hour and we decided to walk to the hotel to get a bearing on the areas as we only had handluggage this took half an hour but there are buses and trams which will get you there faster centraal is busy and a little hectic but as we got nearer to the hotel it quietened down alot the hotel is situated in the area right on the outer canal ring and our room overlooked the street and waters edge through a little french balcony location wise it was great though we were on a semi busy road the area was tranquil and calm and very pretty garvey checked us in and one other staff member out both were really friendly and helpful he hinted that we had got an upper,1.0
the quality and service at the hotel in no way complies with the requested sum of money there is chaos and incompetence in the organization of services we arrived at the hotel before and asked at the reception whether we could be accommodated earlier although we knew that the at this hotel unlike most of the other ones is at sic which considering the demanded higher price for accommodation we find totally inappropriate the receptionists promised us access to our room hour after hour thanks to which we spent almost hours waiting for the olive suite which we had several months ahead first we were sent to the swimming pool bar where we spent hours hearing repeated promises of access to our room after our third inquiry whether the room was free as an answer we were given a card to the lounge and were told that the formalities would be settled there the previous guest had left the room later and therefore the room could not yet be prepared we waited another hours during which we were offered the possibility of paying an extra eur for a suite supposedly the only one ready which we refused our room wasn t even ready at but as late as of a possible tour of the town or a business meeting we pointlessly wasted hours a businessman and owner of a firm i can not comprehend how a hotel of this category which days before our arrival had takings of roughly million,0.0

my husband and i spent nights at the brooks hotel in late june i would say this is one of the best locations in dublin for sightseeing without a need for a car on one side of the hotel was a starbucks and the other side was a typical irish pub with great food and friendly staff we walked to most of the sights although several days is needed to see everything the weather was cool and wet but the room was very spacious nicely decorated and comfortable with and a pillow menu it is close to temple bar but far enough away to avoid the met barry the manager who was very friendly and helpful as were all the staff on any future trips to dublin i would certainly stay here again,1.0
we have visited amsterdam many times but this is by far the best hotel we have visited we will be staying here every time from now on rooms services and bar and amazing perfect location stay here,1.0

the hotel is a boutique hotel so it does have all the bells and whistles of a large hotel however the roof top swimming pool is spectacular the rooms were very modern with a large comfortable bed location is close to everything beach gothic quarter and service was excellent too but like i said the roof top is the selling spent the end of our travel days chilling in the swimming pool perfect way to end tapas bar also had very creative and delicious dishes,1.0
due to bad weather decided to have dinner in the hotel a bummer disappointing regarding service and portions euro for small tiny piece of salmon not recommended waiter may need to look for a new job,0.0
pretty disappointing my partner and i have stayed a few times and even though previously there were a couple of things that we considered not up to scratch we had relatively pleasant experiences after the last stay we wo be returning the first issue is the staff not true of all the staff members but most were generally rude entering and leaving the hotel was uncomfortable as some of the staff at reception did not make us feel welcome i do really appreciate being silently stared down as i walk to my room another issue was the relentless mini bar check while we occupied the room not a practice i expect from a four star hotel the problem with attitude among the staff became really evident when someone who came to check the mini bar while we were busy entered our room without making himself known there were a few times where someone entered our room without permission which was real invasion of privacy and then proceeded to move our belongings with his foot to gain access to the fridge all without saying much to either of us we made this incident known at the end of check out and they were obviously apologetic but during check out we were not asked how our stay was or if there were any issues and we were told we used an item of the mini bar when we had not which you think they know we did seeing as they checked so,0.0
this is a star hotel in terms of service and amenities the staff is exemplary the food is excellent with many locally sourced sections my only request is for windows that allow fresh air after a night stay i was craving fresh air in the room,1.0
kingfisher was right across from our hotel we went immediately after landing in dublin it happened to be national fish chips day too of all days fish chips were good but guinness was not on draft it seemed like a spot for both locals and tourists,1.0
we stayed at this hotel for our first and only night in dublin we were able to check in early as our flight arrived mid morning and we drove from the airport to the hotel while they do not have parking available at the property a very short walk is public parking we received a discount from the hotel for our parking as well and to our surprise it was a pretty decent discount nearly of the cost the room along with the entire hotel was modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and the was comparable to american standards ie water pressure one thing i did noticed and was a trend with every hotel and b b we stayed at in europe was the lack of face cloth so if you are traveling i and you are use to showering with a cloth remember to pack one otherwise the linens were ample breakfast was included and it was a lovely buffet style with lots of options definitely more than your average continental the hotel is located a short walk to many attractions shops and restaurants overall we had a great stay here and would definitely recommend the hotel to others and come back to visit,1.0

i can not tell about the hotel itself but i would strongly recommend visiting the sky lounge as far as i understand it is a venue for up to people should be quite ok and if you have some kind of event the sky is great especially the view that you can have from there really exciting and kind of competeng with the gravity bar at guinness storehouse,1.0

my title to this review sums up my stay for this hotel in athens my only critical aspects of this review has more to do with the room we stayed in the room was not overly spacious and the mattresses were firm to cleanliness of the room was staff at the front desk were very professional and helpful the cafeteria staff was also top notch as was the staff at the roof terrace bar the view from the roof terrace bar was spectacular and i would definitely book this hotel again in the future,1.0

i stayed at this hotel for a convention it was great as it was right next door to the convention center my room corner unit was very large and so was the bathroom the bed was very comfortable and blinds kept out all light from the room even though i was very jetlaged got to enjoy good night sleeps the breakfast buffet was worthy of a hotel a lot of choice and very good quality the only thing that was unfortunate was the distance to city center however it was right next to the beach very nice beach would go for a walk every day around pm and could walk for miles you see a lot of people jogging along that boardwalk the gym is quite small hence why i went outside rather than to the gym,1.0
enjoyed a few days here visiting with friends and family the room was quiet and very clean front desk personnel were extremely helpful our dinners were great they served breakfast until this was great as we are late sleepers,1.0
really enjoyed our stay at this hotel very modern and clean a bit of a walk away from the main attractions but if the weather is nice who cares we stayed when the at jean festival was on so we had a great view from the rooftop bar next time we stay i will be tempted to upgrade the room to one with the private balcony as they looked great,1.0
the hampshire american is an outstanding place to stay on the way to the hotel from the airport the cab driver said your hotel is in the center of everything well he was not kidding the great shopping and amazing restaurants surrounding the hotel really validated his assessment we were within walking distance to many of the main tourist attractions the area around the hotel was vibrant with activity everyday the front desk staff was spectacular claire especially stood out with her professionalism and helpfulness the room was fantastic i will definitely be returning to the hampshire american on my next trip to amsterdam,1.0
my husband and i stayed here for two nights prior to our grand european tour on viking with arrangements being made by viking i communicated with the hotel prior to our visit informing them that we would be celebrating our wedding anniversary while at the hotel upon arrival they did not disappoint and as we checked in we were wished a happy anniversary and told we were upgraded to a king bed and a room with a beautiful canal view the lobby was under chaotic construction which made for a less than desirable condition but the room was lovely with a delightfully fluffy comfortable bed the bathtub is very dangerous and slippery with no mats provided even when we requested them they did not arrive causing us to not use the facility at all while we were there the complimentary breakfast buffet was one of the best i have ever seen in a lovely light and airy room overlooking the canal the food was simply delicious and a great way to start the day the hotel is far from the center of town but accessible with a tram or taxi robert the concierge was the nicest friendliest and most helpful person to us and perfect for his job he is a great asset to the apollo since from to he is the first person to greet you as you step into the lobby his towering figure and huge smile make you feel right at home we are now proud to,1.0

eurostars monumental is a great choice for a stay in barcelona just a minutes walk from the monumental metro station and a minute walk from the sagrada familia there is a supermarket next door and many places to eat and drink are also a relatively short walk room was very spacious and comfortable beds were very comfy bathroom was a good size and shower was great breakfast is a buffet service which had plenty choice of both hot and cold food as well as drinks my only negative around this is the the breakfast room is very small and fills up quick so i can imagine this can be a problem at busy times,1.0
hotel staff was amazingly welcoming and helpful the rooms arnt overly big however in such a beautiful city you do want to spend much time inside the breakfast is reasonably priced and has a great selection room service is also fast and attentive we were lucky enough to have a massive balcony with city views rooms were clean and tidy and staff were very professional when cleaning our rooms location if perfect i suggest going to güell tapas on the same street as the hotel amazing food and beautiful staff the combination made our time in barcelona so memorable,1.0

we stayed at this hotel in july the it very clean but if you need a hard bed for your back these wo do as they are very soft breakfast is amazing the hotel is about a minute tram ride from the heart of the city but very easy to get there it is in the heart of the museum district though so if you are coming to the museums this is a perfect place,1.0
just came back from nights at the olivia balmes hotel we had a wonderful time the service was consistently excellent the staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay the room was large by european standards and nicely decorated the bed was big king size i think and very comfortable the air conditioning worked well and it was so nice to come back to our nice cool room after a day of wandering around barcelona our room had a small balcony with a chair small table and a drying rack for drying swimsuits we were expecting the balcony and it was a real pool and the rooftop terrace were what really sealed the deal for us the pool was huge but definitely big enough for several people to be hanging out in it it was metal rather than tiled and was lovely it had metal loungers under water so was great for cooling off while sunbathing there were many lounge chairs around the pool and we never had a problem finding one there were also tables and chairs in the shade the pool area had a bar that served drinks as well as light meals and tapas very nice on the opposite side of the roof terrace there were additional chairs and sofas and we hung out there at times as well great for watching the sun location is great only a block from la rambla with lots of great shopping and restaurants when,1.0
my wife and i stayed here for nights on a recent trip to barcelona we certainly could have asked for any better as centro sits right in the gothic quarter and is within walking distance to explore the lane ways and centre of barcelona our room was very comfortable and certainly neat and tidy whilst we were well looked after by the accommodating and friendly reception and staff in general a real treat is the buffet breakfast we would certainly stay here again,1.0
great hotel its located in the middle of the high end shopping distriict which is not my thing however there are some advantages you away from the hustle and bustle of things but yet a short walk from some gaudi building and nightlife staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel is well built highlight is rooftop which can get crowded quickly due to small size as well as an off the chain breakfast buffet would highly recommend,1.0

this hotel is about a walk from the amstel metro station in amsterdam slightly southeast of the center it is a very modern hotel and its strongest point is its staff they are friendly helpful and seem to truly enjoy what they room was large and clean with a refrigerator we did not use only stayed night the bathroom was large and very had two problems with water the shower drain was apparently clogged which produced a small flood we called and this was promptly attended to and the bathroom also the toilet started leaking and would not stop running at one point but again a call to the front desk and this was also taken care of and the bathroom we were also offered free breakfast because of our restaurant east attached to the hotel is excellent and the food breakfast was also excellent and the staff helpful and would definitely stay here again,1.0

hotel was fantastic the concierge was outstanding in there help to book train tickets or make hotel reservations i would strongly recommend this property truely in the heart of everything you want to recommend this hotel,1.0
the hotel is in an area of the city so seems a bit desolate if you are there at the weekend as everything is shut not a wealth of bars or restaurants in the immediate vicinity the positive of that was it was fairly felt safe at all times walking around the area the beach and marina are a minute walk and easy to find the metro station is minutes away taxi rank directly outside the room was very clean and comfortable good aircon all staff we encountered we friendly and helpful breakfast was euros and was a really good standard lots of choice free wifi was good all over the hotel the spa looked lovely did have time to use it,1.0
the rooms are really small but the hotel is on really good location you are in city center and you can walk form hotel to city center which is really nice the breakfast was ok but it is everything very small in this hotel so when you eat breakfast you sit less than away from other guest,1.0
we stayed here for days and it was a great choice wonderful location we could walk everywhere rented bikes from the hotel one day and it was a great value room was small but all that we needed since we did spend much time in it staff was friendly would recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again,1.0
i had a great pleasure to visit my favourite european city during nye celebrations more so by staying one of the nights at wonderful w barcelona this is undoubtedly a landmark of the city a place to be note that w is a bit different and it does have to fit everyone needs and desires as long as you know what to expect from this quirky brand you enjoy every single second at w barcelona everything was a highlight for me thus i not going to describe all the stunning services but i like to mention two of the best moments during our stay waking up in the bed while watching the open sea and sunrise views service quality of the food and beverages at the rooftop bar a bit of a pleasant walk from the closest metro station or las ramblas but taxis are also a great option very reasonably priced in comparison with other european cities if you are more of an explorer check the schedule of the public bus which stops wait to savour w barcelona and its services again during the summer season which is definitely the best time to enjoy everything what this stunning hotel has to offer,1.0
visited this excellent hotel for an overnight while attending a concert in trinity the hotel is a taxi drive from grafton street but worth the fare the hotel is smart and elegant with quality furnishings and lovely circulation areas the staff are welcoming and our executive room was spacious and very well stocked with robes slippers and fridge etc the bathroom was also very spacious and the extensive breakfast was delightful with a chef to cook etc do hesitate to visit the lovely hotel it a real gem it a bit like old money versus the flashy nouveau riche and the old money wins hands down every time ca wait to return,1.0
excellent service and position in the city amazing room and people who are always on fire for us my girlfiend and me had appreciated this trip in your hotel and i recommend it for everyone who wants to do a citytrip in amsterdam,1.0

we arrived very early after hours in the hands of singapore charming receptionist was wonderful and stored our luggage and hurried up room preparation he a unfortunately had been used by a convention of smokers disgusting smell bathroom excellent bed comfortable breakfast is varied fresh and delicious,1.0
from the start when ian checked us in to when we left the stay was perfect we were there for nights in july and i would definitely stay here again the rooms are beautiful and well are a lot of great pubs restaurants down the street also,1.0
everyone very helpful rooms clean and neat could be better only minor thing was i thought breakfast at hotel a bit overpriced for what we wanted a light breakfast there are several nearby options for this though if you want light breakfast would definitely stay at herbert park again,1.0
beautiful hotel and great staff the bar is awesome decor is great both pools are also really nice the breakfast is excellent many options and fresh food the rooms were great beautiful view down the road from the balcony location is away from the central plaza would return,1.0
higher rooms have great views all have a view of the plaza i think they upgraded us two room categories to the top floor for our honeymoon it was so nice and they also gave us a bottle of cava our first and last nights and we only stayed three nights there is an easy bus to and from the airport that is right outside the hotel the tour buses also pick up right outside and you can walk to many sights and endless bars and restaurants the doorman was so kind to us and even said a final goodbye to us a few hours early because he knew he would be working when returned to get our bags to leave for the airport they all really made a point to remember us and say hello and goodbye every time we entered and left the hotel it was by far the best service we had out of the three hotels we stayed in during our honeymoon,1.0
had such a great time staying at this gorgeous hotel the staff was so welcoming and helpful especially derek who entertained us through diner and drinks the food is great the staff is even better ca wait to stay again,1.0
i was in the hotel as a part of europamundo tour and this is one of the best hotels they use i had dinner at the restaurant and the food was incredible and very room is comfortable and clean the biggest disadvantage is tha it far from the city and there is no transport to downtown,1.0
the hotel is in an excellent location and is very well connected the entrance to the metro is across the street and bus stops with buses to major attractions are a short minute walk from the hotel las ramblas is a minute walk there lots of restaurants and cafes in the vicinity we ate out mostly in district which was a minute rooms are simple but clean bright and modern it looks like the rooms were recently refurbished there was a flat screen tv safe and air conditioning there no coffee making facilities or a fridge which would have been useful bed were very a lovely decked garden and seating area breakfast is available but from memory it was quite expensive we had coffee and pastries in the many cafes nearby instead the staff on reception were friendly and helpful i would definitely stay here again in the future,1.0
great location in christchurch walking distance to was good bedroom roomy and needs a total in copper ally restaurant was parking in near by car park,1.0
a very clean and comfortable hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel is in walking distance to the museums and one tram ride the away to dam square and you can stay on that same tram all the way up to central station we enjoyed being a little bit away from the madness of dam square so if you want some quiet that is easily accessible this is the place for you,1.0
my family and i stayed at the splendom suites for almost a week in june the location is outstanding situated near the center of the city in the beautiful eixample neighborhood basically everything we wanted to do was a short and inexpensive cab ride or short to moderate walk away the staff of the splendom suites were very friendly from the desk to the cleaning service to the nightly bed we stayed in a suite which easily housed four people the room was very well equipped including a washing machine kitchen appliances and wares and a private rear balcony the room also featured a second outer set of on the front to help noise from the streets which made it much easier to sleep i not only would gladly stay at the splendom suites again i would also look there first for available reservations if i were to return to barcelona,1.0
hotel sebastians is conveniently located near shopping restaurants and the train station it is a short walk to ann frank s house and many other popular sights in amsterdam our room for was spacious and had all the amenities one needs when traveling abroad the staff was one of the most helpful and conscientious that i have ever encountered i would definitely stay here again,1.0
we loved every minute of our stay the canal houses offer extreme authenticity a true gem perfectly situated and the staff are amazing friendly breakfast is very traditional and caters for everyone,1.0
me and my husband stayed here july and we booked after reading others reviews hotel is great exactly as per the pictures on the website good location very closr to the metro which will take you to la ramblas in mins and you can walk to some other attractions within minutes theres a few supermarkets nearby and restaurants to choose from staff were very helpful at the hotel especially paula,1.0
the experience was wonderful the people are excellent very helpful especially hotel management from derek and brian who always greeted us with kind hospitality and humour which we will always remember about the professionalism and a class service of this beautiful hotel and its staff many kind regards frank agnes david,1.0
this hotel has a very cool vibe even though it is located within extremely old buildings we stayed for just one night between the cruise ship and flying home our room was a shoebox room which turned out to be very spacious especially after being two weeks in a stateroom the bathroom was huge we had two meals in the restaurant downstairs and both were very good very friendly helpful staff being able to call the us free of charge from the room phone was an unexpected delight free continental breakfast and bottled water also an unexpected extra,1.0
just spent one night here but not a great place to stay putting it nicely it in a pretty sleazy neighborhood so we did feel totally safe arriving here late at night with that said it was quite easy to find a taxi immediately outside the hotel the room had crappy ac but eventually it did the trick weirdly the room only had one outlet in the morning there were tiny little bugs in the sink the elevators took forever to come the breakfast was actually really good and it was included in our stay but that probably the only redeeming quality also the hotel staff was nice one night was fine here but absolutely would recommend it for any longer,1.0
i came for a weekend with friends this hotel has been recently refurbished and extended we were staying in the new part and our rooms were lovely with lots of nice touches the air conditioning lights and curtains are all controlled by a panel beside the bed each room had a nespresso coffee machine safe and fridge with complimentary chocolate crisps and water our rooms also gave us access to the private club rooms with a lounge outside seating area newspapers and on tap tea coffee fruit and biscuits we had dinner in the hotel restaurant it offers a bistro style menu and all meals were very good they also have a nice bar area and a good cocktail was good we had the choice of a continental breakfast in the upstairs club room or a full cooked breakfast in the main breakfast room all staff were polite and helpful i would stay here again,1.0
it was an amazing hotel comfortable beds and silent staff members were kind and highly recommend this hotel even if it is not central it s closer to the underground,1.0
i have to start by saying this was a genuinely great hotel every inch of the hotel has been thoroughly thought through planned in great detail and made as comfortable as the little branding details which give a feel about the place to the helpful staff and a which has clearly been designed to give the sense of being in a big that visitors can feel at home rooms themselves are excellent and very space efficient but by far the biggest bed i ever seen in a hotel for a single traveller it fantastic although you want to be very close with your partner to share a room as the toilet and shower are part of the bedroom so there no hiding any intimate details one unexpectedly cool aspect is the smart room feature where everything from the music lighting and blinds is controlled from one single ipad very a thoroughly enjoyable stay and conveniently connected with train from the airport minutes and a tram going into the forward to staying again,1.0
wow the location could be better right near the acropolis about from the entrance lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel itself is suit old and dated and could do with a refurbish bieber it is clean and adequate the staff are what make it they are so friendly and helpful and nothing is s problem we also were able to store our luggage there whilst visiting the islands the breakfast was amazing,1.0
i actually quite baffled as to why this place is only classed as a hotel i stayed in places in the uk which were noticeably inferior to this the bedrooms are clean and spacious the breakfasts cater for pretty much all culinary preferences the bar is and operates whilst the owner christos goes out of his way to be helpful and accommodating to all his guests including solo travellers like myself not only that for seven nights is far better value than you find in most european capital cities including london i suppose that if i had to include one criticism it that the location is a little far from the city centre but it also close to the port of piraeus which makes it ideal for ferry trips to the surrounding islands and buses to syntagma square are frequent and very inexpensive,1.0
brand new hotel the room especially the shower was great you do get tons of street noise but just learned to turn it off i would suggest some type of guide in the room to explains things like that the lights outlets work after you put your key into the slot above the switches there are no ice or vending machines and that is apparently standard in europe that there are no washcloths you have to ask for one at the desk and there is no business center who knew great central location but suggestions for food etc should also be in the room guide would stay again staff was very helpful,1.0
the room bath and bed sheets were so dirty they had blood on it charged plus to my credit card than they suppost to charge and they didnt gave me any billi want a refund for my,0.0
this hotel was a very good choice for our stay in barcelona it centrally located the subway station is right in front of the hotel the staff was very friendly and the rooms were very well kept we could enjoy the pool so no review about it,1.0
nice little hotel in central amsterdam right next to the flower market and walking distance from all the central area is small and was regularly very busy no doubt because the hotel was fully booked while we were try the restaurant which was also very busy but it looked interesting,1.0
this was the first of several hotels we stayed at during our trip to greece and it was the perfect way to kick things off the room was so quaint and cozy and there is an amazing view of the acropolis from the room definitely book a room with an acropolis view if possible the rooftop garden restaurant is amazing for breakfast and and the location is perfect the acropolis is only a short walk i highly recommend this hotel,1.0
i found the gates hotel very nice and fancy but it lacks all the important details for a hotel to become confortable i arrived at in hotel and actually had to wait hour for room cleaning acceptable but not good after a couple of hours travelling as soon as i entered the room i found a chewing gum in the window shades that is really disgusting and disappointing almost a night just to find an old chewing gum in the room i could look at it anymore i could not believe that room service did not noticed it i have also noticed that the room lacks soom privacy it tall buildings next to it it is easy to see through the big windows unless you put the blackout all the way down the bathroom was good but a bit warm because of the window and lack of air conditioning there i have also found a roll of duct tape under the bed really this hotel has all it takes to be an amazing hotel but it fails in the smallest details,1.0
is the second time i stay at this hotel and i love it excellent ratio for amsterdam it s not central but in minute you can reach the the sloterdijk station from there in max miutes the train leaves you in amsterdam central wich is one station room and the bathroom are big and very breakfast is basic,1.0
brief description spacious rooms although the beds were extremely hard i would stay here again because of its location away from the crowded city center if i were traveling with children i would choose hilton diagonal mar over barcelona hilton because of its location near the beach two playgrounds the mall across the street with a food court for fussy eaters and larger hotel description of room spacious room with partial waterfront view twin beds black out curtains safe fridge with small space for personal items electric kettle with tea two bottles of water provided per stay ice cubes near elevators no slippers no robes no usb ports marble bathroom with bathtub with detachable showerhead shower stall telephone hairdryer with outlet in bathroom space for personal toiletries next to sink peterthomasroth lounge on floor amazing views of beach and barcelona pleasant variety of food items very friendly staff five minute walk to beach to taxi fare to most attractions small pool with music on weekends everyone even hilton guests must pay for sunbeds couches and suspended lounge chairs can be enjoyed for free however great cabana massage by get a business card with the hotel address there are two hiltons in barcelona both on diagonal avenue this hilton is closer to the beach buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue disappointment buy a ticket for the hop on hop off bus to get an overview of barcelona do one route take,1.0
i visited barcelona as a treat for my year old daughter melia sky was amazing arrived late at night and had minor leak in bathroom but were immediately moved and upgraded to the level which was amazing gorgeous views and pool area reception staff were really helpful we chose it because it was a little out of centre but metro was great and lovely restaurants and shops close by would definitely go again,1.0
the hotel is situated in a great location just off the ramblas the staff are very friendly very welcoming and went through everything we needed to know on check in the rooms are small and basic but are kept very clean and tidy what more do you need when you are in barcelona we certainly did spend much time in our room i would definitely stay here again it is a fab base for getting out and about and seeing everything that this beautiful city has to offer,1.0
my family i stayed here twice on our recent trip both times they were very accommodating to our elderly member and helpful to us all we had to arrange the rooms between in our party the staff was helpful in accommodating us all the location is very close to the hop off buses as well as the public bus walkable to most major sites in dublin city center directly across the street from christchurch,1.0
small and boutique hotel urban chic design mix of dark grey and exposed concrete walls subtle lighting modern furniture complete with a dummy of a tattooed woman in a yoga position in the reception to add to the boutique feel bedrooms are well equipped in the same dark wood urban style bathrooms are spacious with a good range of upmarket toiletries big walk in shower small gym in basement and a small pool not big enough for swimming and a few loungers on the roof terrace with bar facilities not manned excellent buffet breakfast good range and great quality highly recommended just a shame there are building works next door sound of drilling work me up though it was,1.0
a really disappointing hilton firstly the hotel shuttle did show up to the airport as per the schedule annoying in the height of summer but if the weather was bad or if it was the depths of winter i would be going was a chipped cup in the bedroom and there were marks on the splashback if the bathroom sink obviously not been cleaned properly after the last went out on saturday and when we got back late on saturday evening our room had been serviced which was really annoying especially as we supposed to be valued members of the hilton loyalty programme we had a late checkout booked as my partner is undergoing medical treatment and i knew he would be bright eyed and bushy tailed the next day yet despite having the do not disturb card on the door we still had housekeeping knocking on the door hours before we were due to check buffet breakfast was terrible lukewarm everything and dried out to within an inch of its work to be done here,0.0
stayed her for one night check in was quick but we were asked to pay on the arrival a bit unusual informed that breakfast was an additional ten euro which could be paid in the restaurant in the morning but this was wrong we had to go back to reception pay and get vouchers then go back to the restaurant also enquired at the main reception if the spa sold swimsuits and told no so went into dublin to buy one but i checked the next morning at the spa and they do indeed sell swimwear so could have bought one there you also have to pay deposits for towels and lockers and buy swimhats decided not to bother breakfast was awful very poor choice definately not worth ten euro each apple juice was like water no flavour at all very disappointed with looked out on a flat roof with lots of air con equipment supposed to be fifteen minutes walk from croke park more like thirty five,0.0
we are a family of we stayed at casa camper for nights and thoroughly enjoyed it we had a suite which has a double bed sofa bed and hammock which slept and then a standard room that had a double bed and a separate which had a single in it the buffet worked a treat the kids loved it there is a basement area with a bar seating and pool tables the roof terrace has an outdoor seating and honesty bar and a rainforest shower having never been to barcelona this waste perfect place to stay,1.0
my husband and i stayed very recently in clarence hotel we enjoyed our stay staff were very friendly bed very comfortable our room was to the front overlooking the river liffey not too noisy room very warm air conditioning was not inbuilt and we had to use small fan located on side table not the best position for fan television was small with a very limited range of channels tea making facilities were available but we only had cups and no saucers not a sign of a biscuit a little more attention to these small details would have added greatly to our opinion of this hotel,1.0
usual holiday inn clean quiet rooms and good customer service large car park and very close to the metro stops away from amsterdam central station which takes about minutes restaurant has ambience and the dutch beer was cold i can not fault this hotel in anyway,1.0
le meridien is right along la rambla the popular strip in barcelona it practically beside la boqueria a market with delicious eaterie and cheese and jamon shops it also right beside a supermarket carrefour it walking distance to plaza cataluna and passeig de gracia where major shops are located you can also walk around barrio gotica where you have small alleys with endless shops and restaurants despite being right smack in one of barcelona busiest sections the noise did reach our room even if we were only on the floor my only complaint was we got a triple room and it was a bit too small a king sized bed and a pull out bed we hardly had space to open our luggages when we checked in check in time was supposedly at but the room was ready at the third bed was not made yet and concierge told us it would be ready by when we got back at the bed was not yet made and i had to call reception again it took housekeeping mins to sort this out sadly the pull out bed had only a thin mattress and was not comfortable at all for the price we expected proper from this service at le meridien is excellent check in and check out were seamless and the staff is always at your service even the porters made sure your bags were attended to and kept safe during check in and check was delicious and had decent selections,1.0
this hotel was outstanding they gave us an early hector at the front desk was very helpful anytime we wanted to get a restaurant recommendation they knew exactly where to send us comfy and amazing breakfast yummy loved our experience,1.0
from the moment the door was opened for us at this beautiful hotel we had a great time our room was kept immaculate every day and bottled water supplied every staff in the bar and restaurant where courteous and we where early risers as we where staying because of the horse show so was able to talk to some cleaners again the staff where courteous and a credit to the the front of house staff where very polite and informative making sure we had everything we needed when booking in we where given cupcakes and a small shot of bailey such a nice gesture i thought the concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable overall the perfect hotel you most certainly get what you pay for here we have stayed here a few times before and most definitely will be back obviously we have a manager here at this hotel who certainly keeps finger on the pulse with an excellent team of people behind i must say also is all the staff here have a lovely smile on their face which says a lot keep up the good work and service,1.0
we came to dublin to see riverdance the fitzwilliam had the perfect location and was the utmost in style quality and calibre of staff first class hotel first class service wonderful all round from reception and porters who were friendly and exceptionally helpful to the stunning cuisine and marvellous surroundings the level of attention to detail and service turned a short break into a memorable experience we were treated with personal service as if we were the only guests and the food was of a level unsurpassed thank you to all the staff who were so warm and genuine we will be back,1.0
i appreciate the attention to detail and the welcoming feeling you receive when staying at the barcelona arts hotel when i left my passports in the safe and called from the airport to pick them up the staff had them waiting at the valet station when i arrived to expedite my returning to the airport in a timely manner,1.0
we travelled as two couples for a long simple and spacious deluxe rooms shower was a bit strange so got quite wet in the bathroom on the provided in the bedroom however no milk when we asked reception for milk they said no bed was huge and really comfortable so happy with our must admit we were all extremely disappointed with the service from the staff here did seem very happy to we arrived to the hotel we were advised we had to pay per room all together we knew to be aware of this after looking at previous reviews however we still find it shocking this is not made known to you at the point of booking locationwell after looking at some reviews and the name of the hotel i thought this was pretty much central but it about minute walk to dam square around minutes on a tram we had to get a tram travel ticket for the duration of our trip because the walking was too much for will not be staying here again and would really recommend this place to anyone booking to go amsterdam,1.0
andaz is beautiful modern hotel by the prinsengracht service here was exceptionally warm and you can only love the staff complimentary bikes are quite close to russian tanks heavy and can take small nuclear bomb but they work well and unless you are planning to have tour de france they are good enough sauna is also had a room with a canal view and it was simply fantastic mini bar could have been bit colder just my personal preferences,1.0
stayed here for two nights after a cruise from athens with princess cruises on royal took a taxi from the cruise port to the hotel which took about in was quick and easy by a very welcoming room was on the first floor room was a good size with plenty of storage space very good air conditioning in the room was very was very had breakfast on one morning which was good for is very near two metro only issue was on departure when the lift was out of order we were glad we were only on the first floor with two cases to carry down the would stay here again if visiting barcelona,1.0
great place to stay in barcelona very central location and the terrace with a beautiful view infinity pool and bar was an extremely nice place to relax and spend some time away from the busy city very professional and friendly staff as well,1.0
our room was clean and very well stocked with complimentary toiletries the hotel itself is really nice and the location is excellent the hotel is about a minute stroll to grafton street and there a dart station really close to the hotel also there are nice bars and restaurants quite close to the hotel also all in all a really pleasant stay,1.0
we had a wonderful two night stay prior to cruising clean and efficient hotel we took taxi from airport for euros from hotel it about minute walk to city center and we taken the tram system to museums from there note on public transportation americans should leave time to purchase tram tickets inside because you probably do have a pin and chip card back to hotel fitness room was basic but nice dinner in restaurant was excellent except for bar service was slow we ate their basic breakfast of coffee juice and croissant the ice cream was worth every calorie overall a little pricey but we would stay here again,1.0
stayed in the hotel for christmas and new year had a great time in amsterdam the hotel was very very nice it was a little bit further from the city centre than anticipated but the tram lines were right by the hotel and run every couple of minutes so it was good to see other parts of the area on the commute the hotel was excellent very fancy lovely room and facilities and i love amsterdam,1.0
very good hotel i would rate it stars if the wall wasnt so thin u can hear every single world happen next rooms and specially if you are in the ground floor in addition there is no refrigerator in rooms,0.0
the hotel is located only a few blocks walking distance from beaches although in a rather industrial aera no problem to walk the staff of the hotel was exceptionel very customer oriented and friendly this is true for the reception teams as well as the people servicing,1.0
great experience friendly staff excellent breakfast buffet with a wide variety in choice the rooms are clean and finally the hotel has an excellent location close by metro stations the rambla and the shops,1.0
beautifully appointed hotel located on the river just across from heuston station do let the outside fool you inside this hotel is a gem the extra friendly staff provided maps directions and tips to make our four day stay in dublin a delight in addition to walking to the city center we were able to catch the tram and the local bus both run right by the hotel to wherever we wanted to visit the full buffet breakfast served in the dining room every morning was an amazing value and a great way to start the day and we returned each evening to a soft clean bed in a quiet room to rest up for another adventure in dublin,1.0
no longer a doubletree hotel very disappointed with this hotel it is modern in design but lacks character we found the front desk staff to be rude others in the hotel ranged from pleasant to unpleasant charge daily for parking and breakfast is euro it is away from city centre so you will need to take transportation into the rest of dublin a bus stop is outside the hotel but the staff was not at all knowledgeable about the routes rooms were hot and had poor ventilation there was a portable air conditioner in the room but it did not perform well enough to cool the room even opening the windows would not bring in enough cool air,0.0
it outside of the central after the bus or train ride still need to walk about min to reach the hotel imagine after a full day of touring still need to walk quite far it also not wheelchair nor stroller accessible makes it very difficult to travel with luggages,1.0
business and pleasure trip to dublin with my wife her sister and our brother in law as we had planned to scatter the girls mothers ashes back in the fair city in which she was born i had a few messages backwards and forwards with the hotel before we left they were very helpful indeed greeted with excited smiles and real honest interest in our business and when we told them about mum the young irish lady shed a tear sorry the rooms were excellent the food was superb and overall we had the most amazing stay and a great experience it being a family run hotel makes all the difference staff more than helpful and genuinely concerned about our wellbeing throughout our stay i ca see us staying anywhere else next year being on business as well as pleasure i need fairly fast internet and the ashling hotel has fibre i was dow loading at around and uploading about which was a real bonus on top of everything else i do usually pick out members of staff however on this occasion i really do have to mention silvana erin they were magnificent and a real credit to the hotel i would have them in my team in a heart beat thanks to all the staff for an unforgettable stay sizzerals,1.0
we stayed here two nights while doing a whirlwind tour of barcelona this is a hotel but close enough to all the sights and public transportation to make a stay here worthwhile for the tourist as well chic decor,1.0
wonderful location dinner on the patio overlooking on of the canals was nice room was quite and comfortable morning breakfast was also very nice great selection the staff was top notch my wife forgot one of her prescriptions and the concierge arrange for her to see a physician who was able to prescribe what she needed we do keep pictures of our prescriptions on our phones,1.0
we stayed nights before our cruise at the grand hotel central barcelona the front desk staff was very efficient and helpful during our stay we were given a pocket wifi to use during our stay which was very helpful hotel is centrally located and close to all the sites we wanted to visit room has a mini refrigerator which is replenished every day with drinks at no extra charge a special thanks to alonso the front door bellman the day before our departure i requested to have a taxi available for transportation to the cruise port sure enough when we were checking out the taxi was outside and alonso confirmed our ride was ready whenever we were done great service all around at this hotel,1.0
we stayed in this hotel for nights in july the location was great right by the plasa de espania close to metro buses shopping barcelona city tour bus stops and many other attractions the design of the hotel is very modern and i would say urban our room was very spacious with multiple lighting options the view from the window was that great it looked at the back buildings but we did really care since we would come back late at night and go to sleep the bathroom was really stylish the best part of the hotel was the roof top infinity pool though the view is breathtaking you can see monjuic mountain and the whole plasa de espania the staff were very helpful and they all spoke very good english,1.0
brooks location is centrally located with a lovely breakfast included and a great bar too staff is helpful but was a bit surprised that they were friendlier since our trip was filled with so many lovely and friendly people this is a must stay if convenience is important starbucks and a yoga studio and hair salon next door,1.0
the hotel is located a ferry ride from centralstation which we took several times during our stay we loved breakfast buffet is well sorted and our room was in a modern industrial style which we loved bonus was the huge flee market on the weekend which is surrounding the hotel area,1.0
located near the ancient monuments the outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff constandina made our stay special with her recommendations on how to get around the city with her help we saw more than we would have thought possible,1.0
on a trip with my mom and sisters and we stayed here for nights because of the location and good reviews staff were friendly breakfast was good rooms were clean though a bit small price was good and the location really was fantastic walking distance to temple bar and other touristy areas and bus stops right outside the hotel my room had views of christchurch which was just lovely though a bit noisy at night from cars and people in the streets with a very clean room updated bathroom and a nice breeze through our window we were very comfortable the others in our group were in a triple but they felt very squished and thought their room was a bit stuffy overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
what a great location the front desk service was amazing and friendly the room service menu was lacking the concierge was busy doing her nails irritating the bartenders at the spa were a great source of information thank you we were upgraded to a larger room and it was impressive with the automatic blind light control giant shower closet and huge bar the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet my only complaint was when we went up to porter and sat at the bar i got the impression they really wanted us to leave so they could give the seats away the food was great though,1.0

we stayed here two nights the first night after arriving in athens for our honeymoon and the last night before we left anthens at the end of our first night we stayed in the acropolis view room on the floor this room was the worst room we stayed in during our honeymoon it was very very small did work no hot water and old bathroom not what you would expect from a star last night we stayed in a standard room on the fourth floor the room and bathroom were much more modern and front desk service was good however they obviously push restaurants they work with they charged us euros for a miniature pringles chip absurd we stayed in hotels in mykonos santorini crete and this hotel was disappointing compared to the breakfast offered was very limited and again the worst breakfast at a hotel we had while in the price i would recommend trying to a find a better hotel as in my opinion this hotel is not a star hotel,0.0
we stayed at the gallery hotel for our first few nights in spain this july traveling with my son daughter in law and three teenaged grandsons the location gave us easy access to the spots we wanted to visit for those places that were not walkable for me taxis were available and reasonable my room was small but cozy there was no view but the bedding was lovely and there was literally no noise the breakfast was fine and we loved the oppportunity to sit outside the staff was friendly and attentive,1.0

my sister and i stayed here for two nights and could not have been happier with the hotel the reception staff were so professional and pleasant especially jacqueline who is fantastic the room was very spacious and absolutely spotless there is a very good rainfall shower and some lovely products in the bathroom including shampoo conditioner showergel and body lotion the hairdryer is very poor with an extremely short lead so i would advise you to bring your own there is also a secure safe located in one of the presses in regards location it fantastic you take the train from schipol to centraal station it costs for a one way adult ticket and it takes about minutes once you get to centraal station take the exit towards the river turn and keep the water on your right hand side the hotel is no more than a to minute walk from centraal station you can get the hop off bus so from a point of view the hotel is ideal if you do get breakfast in the hotel there are or small eateries directly across the road no more than steps away from the hotel exit all in all a super hotel that i would highly recommend for your visit to amsterdam thank you to all room mate aitana,1.0
june june hotel is located in the docklands opposite the bord gais energy theatre do know if it been recently redecorated but everywhere looked and smelt new and fresh i visited dublin quite a few times and this has to be my favourite hotel due to its high standards and about a minute walk into the centre of dublin which was ideal for us as we did have to wait around for buses or taxi and it also means that you away from the hustle bustle during the evening ensuring a nice peaceful sleep after a busy day i found all of the staff to be friendly room was spotlessly clean the beds were very comfortable and there was ample storage room wardrobes etc also enjoyed the breakfast have to agree though with previous reviewers that the only downside was that there was no air conditioning so the room was hot stuffy i return here without up the excellent standards,1.0
my daughter and i really enjoyed our stay at the harding it is perfectly located in the christchurch area near many of the attractions you want to see the room was clean and comfortable and the staff thanks johnny was friendly and helpful if you driving the parking lot is nearby at a hotel discounted rate our only regret is that we could stay longer,1.0
once again we had the pleasure of staying at the metro and once again the staff was excellent our luggage did not arrive for three days and the front desk did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable they constantly helped us contact the luggage department and even brought us to the airport three times so we could check on our luggage the shuttle bus driver was fabulous and even let us borrow some of his sports equipment so we could enjoy a game of golf near the hotel our room was perfect and every effort was made to make sure we were content and comfortable back there again next year for sure,1.0

we always stay here when in barcelona and love it the beds are extremely comfortable and the room spotless our only problem was on monday july when the breakfast service was not up to the usual excellent standard we went down at and already there was no bacon or sausages and hardly any cold milk the waitress seemed more keen on rearranging the food already there and came into the dining room to make a hot drink for herself then walked out again another diner asked for the hot food to be refilled and when our son went for sausages they were ice cold as if straight from the fridge and had not been heated but were put into the warming tray which is a food safety issue,1.0
nh hôtel is wonderful location close to central station and the center of amsterdam friendly and professional people the room are confortable and very pretty i will come back with great pleasure for sure,1.0
we visited amsterdam for a weekend in were a little lost on arrival which ferry to take how to enter the hotel and then finding the actual reception desk once we sussed that it was a wonderful experience we were welcomed by friendly cheerful staff given a glass of bubbly and then shown to our had a corner city view room looking straight over the water i loved the decor the original quirks though i did use the record player or try out the guitar and my husband loved the concrete walls and ceiling the bed was perhaps the most comfortable i ever slept in and the rain shower was a delight some people have commented on the window in the shower stall but it not a problem at was also fascinating to think that not so many years ago our comfortable hotel used to be someone office someone people have commented that the rooms are small there were two of us staying two nights and it was perfect for our needs the bathroom was enormous but you just have to take it in turns to use it it really was an issue for ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant downstairs it was delicious i highly recommend the breakfast pancakes finding out how things worked where to order was not immediately clear straight away but it all went fine our first meal there was actually dinner on a busy saturday night so perhaps that would explain our initial hotel,1.0
nice hotel with very nice clean and clear rooms small but very practical which is not a little bit far from the gothic distric of the city walk i would recommend this hotel his great concept of the very good bakery at the ground floor,1.0
my husband and i stayed at ariel house twice in july and were very pleased the beautifully converted victorian building is conveniently located near restaurants laundry and dart station the bedroom was small but well furnished and we had access to a comfortable drawing room for reading and afternoon tea an ample and varied breakfast with table service was provided in an attractive setting what made this hotel truly outstanding though was the extraordinary concierge service anything we needed from advice to ice for a sprained ankle was immediately provided with courtesy but no fuss i have traveled extensively for five decades ariel house tops every other hotel staff experience,1.0

we really enjoyed our visit here pros include cleanliness comfort and convenient location near many attractions and hop on hop off tours we also liked that we could buy bottled can water for our day at the front desk cons include the cost of parking the rental car in the nearby lot view of the alley from some rooms,1.0
just come back after a lovely break in a lovely hotel the hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly and helpful the room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels were provided the bed was really comfy for a hotel room there was free wifi and a free safe in the room along with english tv channels on the tv bbc and and toiletries in the bathroom free of charge one thing that would have been nice was if there were tea and coffee facilities in the room we ate in the hotel a few times at night as the food was lovely and was badly priced compared all the restaurants in the centre there is a tram stop a few min walk away from the hotel where you can get the number and in to dam this was only a minute tram ride you can buy your tram tickets from the hotel reception we bought a hour ticket which was around euros all in all would defiantly stay at this hotel again,1.0

the floor is broke the toilet and shower room are together and there is only one for people this means if one is taking shower then nobody can use toilet what the worse the shower room is useless the water can not flow out so when you are taking shower you will sink in your dirty water how can people do that they call us to use the toilet in the reception,0.0
i ate at mama makan i was too hungry to complain they serve chicken that has still blood on bones i just ate the cooked part and never got an apology service was bad had to wait minutes for that chicken and had to remind them to serve my wine,0.0
the hotel is very quaint and on a beautiful quiet street easily walkable to canals van gogh museum rijksmuseum wondelpark and anne frank house staff is very friendly and accommodating the rooms were small as expected but clean and comfortable worked well the breakfast was delicious eggs bacon cold smoked meats and cheeses fruit cereal breads etc the bartender was very friendly and wines by the glass reasonably priced,1.0
the hotel is not a long drive to the cruise port and is within walking distance to the city a bus stop is tight outside the front door so it is in an excellent position the main dining room is huge so you are always guaranteed a seat a smaller area of the main dining room is set aside in the evening for light dining and the food was magnificent not a quaint hotel stay but it has wonderful staff and great service,1.0
i was disappointed of the hotel exept of the breakfast which was junior suite we book looked and smelled like it has not been used and cleaned for months quite dirty overall waterstains on the toilet and surfaces dusty cabin and very bad sink smell from the bathroom which did not go away for three days the drain plug was on the bathtub shelf and looked like it smelled in the whole room no possibility to open windows only interior looks like nothing has been updated since which would be okay if clean but not for the price the old flat tv had a problem on the pictures everything really looks i wanted to give three points rating here but i stayed in many many stars hotels and this is definetly not the average of them the location is great yes but thats not what should be rated here there are tons of hotels in the center mentioned the breakfast was surprisingly very good fresh fruits different breads and rolls cereal and so on nowadays it would be suitable to add and soy alternatives but overall it was very service is friendly and nice but it all does not make up for the room where you do not feel comfortable in like not wanting to take your shoes off and not feeling good using the dirty bathroom where you actually want to get clean where you as a paying guest need to buy hygiene wipes to clean the toilet before,0.0
the property is nice and it in a great neighborhood the rooms are exceptionally clean and the bed very comfortable unfortunately the hotel does not have parking so you need to park the car in the parking garage next door additional a day the staff did not really pay attention when we walked in or out the hotel even at we had to wait a while until someone noticed us overall i think this hotel is a little overpriced,1.0
we stayed with our family and they made sure we had rooms next to one another with a shared hallway perfect when traveling with younger children the staff was very friendly and helpful you have to visit the pool area as it gives you an amazing view of the acropolis and you need it to cool down if you are there in the summer months breakfast was a nice spread,1.0
we enjoyed our days stay at ilunion barcelona in the heart of poblenou the streets around the hotel have a quiet provincial atmosphere as the whole area its location is very convenient a minutes walk took us to the popular playa del bogatell on one side and to the lively rambla del poblenou on the other and it only blocks to llacuna metro station where we could easily reach the city centre we also found a taxi stand just opposite of the hotel to go to the is modern clean relatively recent with a design decor lobby is spacious and stylish amenities and services were suitable staff was efficient we used the business center but neither the gym nor the pool we ran away from the breakfast hall looking like a shopping mall cafeteria our room was large bright functional silent with comfy beds including the extra much it costs has varied from day to day one night was quite expensive,1.0
the location was perfect for me as it was a walk to barceloneta beach the room was clean staff were nice and efficient and the room was spacious enough the gym and pool was also a bonus i would stay in this hotel again,1.0
wife and i stayed here on the back end of our athens trip and we loved it the staff was friendly and helpful and the room was nice and clean killer views from the roof pool and bar and the bar is a nice place to sip a few the bartender made a new drink for me called a sweet summer and it was boozey watermelon delicious kid and family friendly place so just keep that in mind also had some bar snacks and they were tasty would definitely stay again,1.0

we had not stayed at any of the room mate hotels when in barcelona as we most often rent an apartment for a longer stay we were only there for a fly through and boy did we love carla the staff were all excellent accommodating knowledgeable etc the room funky but comfy and quiet with great amenities loved the bath products and breakfast in the morning was enough to keep us going all day before flying out again will return for sure,1.0
unbeatable location great staff small room and bathroom it was a pleasant stay overall the staff is very friendly and accommodating the bar area is very nice the restaurant serves pretty good breakfast,1.0
we stayed here for nights and the room was excellent very spacious very clean and comfortable with a queen bed the staff are very helpful and accommodating as well unfortunately the only issue we had was the noise room doors have no soundproofing at all and the walls between rooms are good but noise still comes through this meant that on our first night when the hotel was busy due to a conference we hardly got much sleep as we could hear the people walking down the corridor or talking in the corridor the elevator ping when doors etc our neighbouring room also had noise music and people talking which was exceptionally loud but due to the poor soundproofing it still kept us up and ear plugs did particularly help we called reception and they did talk to them after which point it was better but it still was great due to the other noises the second night when most people from the conference had left we managed to sleep better but the noise still travels through the room doors so i do think i will be staying there again soon i like my sleep too much,1.0
i loved the charm of this hotel it felt modern and up to date the room was very clean and comfortable i was very impressed with the breakfast and loved the donuts the staff was friendly and helpful ca wait to return on my next stay to barcelona,1.0

had a night getaway stay with my wife at the shelbourne and it might be the best hotel stay we have had and we have stayed at many similar class great iconic hotels in europe and the us the service was super friendly prompt and overall excellent from front desk to restaurants to housekeeping we never felt like we had to wait for anything and the staff came across as genuinely friendly and helpful breakfast was wonderful the public areas were elegant and perfectly maintained but not stuffy or ostentatious a pass to the very affiliated nice health club to freshen up after long overnight flight was much appreciated we arrived early morning so room was yet ready even though we booked one of the lowest category rooms it think it was called a small queen because unfortunately that was all that was available the room was a nice size pristine in terms of cleanliness and maintenance and nicely updated and it had all the little touches one might expect in a star european hotel twice daily service with turn down slippers beside bed bottled water we got back to the hotel late after seeing at croke park and we were starving they seated us and served us some great pub food in the same beautiful restaurant area they have high tea facing st stephen green great fish and chips club sandwich guinness etc and they were still seating people at am i got the impression that maybe they stayed,1.0
my husband and i made one booking and my friends made a separate booking both for the same type of room at the same time arriving and leaving on the same days we had completely different experiences checking in all of us arrived together as a group my friends did a in at the desk took about my husband were unable to do a pre check in because they could not find our booking when they did eventually find it they did not pre check us in and we had to come back and wait again later complete waste of time also the other couples bags were taken by staff for holding where as my husband and i had to walk down to the basement and do it ourselves why the other couple had service and we did i do on arrival the other couple had water robes chocolate and slippers we had none of these our towels were also not replaced on the second day and when i phoned down for replacements they did answer their phone twice but did tell me it was a service they also had a better view and a bath we had a crack which was glued back into our room door and a separate toilet area within the room we also had a cupboard area tucked into a corner with no light above it our desk light did work and bathroom doors needed you to push your body weight against them as they,0.0
we stayed here a few days after our cruise and thought the location could not have been better our room was spacious and had great views of barcelona we were in the center of everything we were right on the ramblas and loved the night life there lots of places to eat outside and people watch we were close to the hop on hop off bus which is a wonderful way to see barcelona you could also see a lot of things on foot we also did a lot of shopping we loved barcelona the architecture is so different,1.0
february stay for nights when we got to the hotel they charged us more for the room than what we had booked more which seemed quite a lot spoke to the manager and he blamed and said there was nothing they could do about it he said it happens all the time if this is happening all the time they really should have sorted this by now or at least expect customers to be annoyed when they charge you a lot more for your room when you booked a budget hotel could have paid the same money and stayed in temple bar hotel was or so minute walk from temple bar so good location rooms quite despite other reviews our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as i told them the rooms were nice their room was horrible only just enough room for a small double bed disgusting again when they complained they were told tough there no more rooms i rant up from the uk and spoke to reception about booking another room for the dates they were staying and was told there was lots available etc and what would i like to book told them the situation and the tone of the conversation immediately changed back to the hotel being really busy and no rooms available after they had just told me the hotel was dead would not stay here again as there are far better hotel in the,0.0
came to dublin as a treat after recovering from an illness our room was shabby with the formica peeling off the furniture stains on the lampshades and grouting around the bath discoloured the air con was outdated and noisy the shower was extremely low powered the room was at the back of the hotel on the ground floor with virtually no natural light getting in therefore had to have the light on all the time how depressing large blue bins for refuge collection were lined up right outside our window the breakfast was just ok the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and courteous as were the staff in mcgettican cookhouse the food here was very good and great value,1.0
we flew into amsterdam a few days early to have some additional time prior to our cruise the travel instructions on the element site were enough to get us on the right train to the nearest station not a terrible walk to the hotel the room was easily large enough for our comfort we did have to squeeze past each other constantly and the bed was comfortable as well we really appreciated the included breakfast and the free wine in the late afternoon we had worried about location but it was a short walk to the tram station that took us straight through the key part of the tourist area to the central station short walk to a very nice park and lastly it is located at a mall with a couple of good bakeries and a couple of good chocolate shops we would definitely stay at this hotel again,1.0
great hotel and so close to central station staff ca do enough for you and when i told them it was my bthdy treat they put a bottle of champs in our room lovely to have a free bar as personally think it should be a as the towels always seem to have holes in room with beautiful view of the canal exactly what we asked for,1.0
great hotel in athens very nice amenities that include several restaurants some small shops pool highly recommend a drink at the galaxy bar on the roof excellent views rooms are clean and modern if your a hilton honors member there is an executive lounge on the offering light breakfast in the morning along with light snacks in the evening,1.0

we loved our stay at the mercer hotel the staff were extremely helpful polite and informative we really felt like we stepped into a hotel that cared for it guests the hotel is in an ideal location in the heart of the gothic quarter and i ca recommend this hotel high enough,1.0
stayed here for a short city break having never been to barcelona before a great quieter location with fab rooms and a nice breakfast buffet staff are very attentive and knowledgeable about the city especially massive thank you to cristina for helping book tickets and giving lots of great suggestions for places to visit a wonderful hotel that can not be missed,1.0
stayed here for nights with my wife as part of a break for her birthday a beautifully appointed hotel in the gothic quarter the decor is stunning and our room was amazing enjoyed the roof terrace and pool every day of our stay breakfast was delicious and cocktails in the bar were fabulous reception staff and especially the charming concierge were incredibly helpful booking taxis and excursions i have only experienced this level of service once before and that was in bali as has been mentioned by others taxis have some difficulty accessing the hotel due to very narrow streets the driver who drove us here from the airport was not at all happy with our choice of hotel and insisted on dropping us off on a nearby street that said on the occasions that the mercer staff ordered at taxi for us they were very punctual and waited right outside the front door overall i can not recommend the mercer highly enough expensive but very much worth the cost for a brilliant short break,1.0
we booked this hotel for a overnight stay before we departed for our cruise at the port the hotel was reasonably priced under or which included breakfast in the price we paid we booked the room via their own website staff are great and friendly with a warm welcome when we arrived or returned when we went out so top marks for staff in this rooms are ok with wooden floors no luxury touches in the rooms but clean and the bed was nice and breakfast was good buffet style very busy thou bit disjointed on layout spread in different places not labelled well hence the chaos with guests trying to get their breakfast and pushing in location was out the way from the centre and late at night we did feel a little wary of the area and the drunks on the corners by the subway just down the for metro ticket for journeys so that came in handy to get you in the centre and back the ticket can be used by multiple persons at the same time but not to exceed the trips in total check out was good with email of invoice we asked the staff to order us a taxi to the port this cost us for the trip around,1.0
very nice decoration but expensive and location is not perfect as it is not very close to the shopping centers we went for shopping by taxi which took min to the center the weather was bad and we benefit from the swimming pool in the nice thing is that there is a view in the roof floor which allow to see a very beautiful view of athens,1.0
the is a little gem of a hotel in a lovely part of the city with easy access to the centre of town if you time from dart train well you be in the heart of temple bar within minutes very easy to get to from the airport i got the aircoach and got off at the ballsbridge hotel stop but you have to use bus stop close to the us embassy for your air coach journey back to the airport just remember to get your leapfrog visitor pass at the airport they do day days and days pass to use on all the public transport in bars and restaurants close by searson is a great bar with a good atmosphere and they do great food as well if you fancy a curry you should try ravi kitchen really friendly staff and fantastic food also for bits a piece you need for your days out there is a tesco metro next to hotel is victorian houses joined together looks fantastic from the outside and they tried to keep as much of the old victorian deco on the inside the rooms are a very good sizes as it is an old victorian building there is no air con i am sure if you asked the might be able to supply with an fan for the room i am only guessing they could supply a fan as the staff were very friendly and super helpful i found there was only spare socket,1.0
stayed in the edmund hillary room had a good bath shower bed and projector fun decor albeit a little dark and certainly no view it was disappointing that there were no tea or coffee making downstairs bar cafe was well priced very relaxed and is a restaurant on the top floor that we did position for public transport nearest underground approx available for euros for one of the days our room was not serviced by house keeping until by which time i was in the bath if you like friendly different relaxed then this maybe the place for you if you want to be pampered in luxurious surroundings i would probably give it a miss,1.0
staff were friendly and room was very nice had everything we needed and have a gym and saunas which are both open for long hours which is great and also ideal the location was brilliant there was a bus station and also some trams which stops within steps on the hotel also the train station amsterdam sloterdijk was the other side of the bus station which was no more then a min walk there is a spar a few minutes away from the hotel also there is a quite a few small food places in between the hotel and train station and in the train station,1.0
the staff was incredible they were helpful and courteous every step of the way the rooms were clean and comfortable very quiet and in a great location minute ride to city center thank you again,1.0
the staff at this hotel are the best they are consistently working to make sure that your stay is enjoyable the rooms are new and well appointed the location is overlooking the river liffy blocks from the custom house a comfortable hotel in the center of all activities in dublin,1.0
one gets the feeling this hotel has existed on the same basis for quite some time the service is very good and the place generally traditional with traditional facilities for a five star hotel rooms and in particular the bathrooms are in need of a face lift and for the price paid one would expect better the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring central athens which can be done on foot the roof top restaurant has spectacular views of the acropolis and it was a pleasure to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant every morning breakfast was the only meal we had at the hotel and it was good albeit extremely crowded and therefore not remotely peaceful there is also a small rooftop pool which is lovely to visit after a day sightseeing if you are lucky enough to secure a sun lounger everyone has the same idea about a dip sundowners at this location are good and service exceptional the only additional factor to consider about this hotel is that it seems to have an arrangement with cruise ships for us tourists and we had a huge influx from one of these ships,1.0
excellent location lovely bed and breakfast it was the perfect place for a short pitstop in dublin breakfast was delicious and everything was cute clean and cozy i would highly recommend they made an extra effort to help us with printing our plane tickets which was much appreciated,1.0
i was dismayed to see the huge set of stairs when i walked through the front door with my bad knee but the receptionists immediately rushed down to take my bags and they remained just as helpful for my whole stay the single room was tiny but clean and comfortable the house is well maintained the room on the back side was quiet i like the balcony just off the lobby a nice place to hang out and the location in the canal neighborhood is just perfect,1.0
this hotel is situated in a lane that leads to la ramlas our second floor room was spacious and accommodates it had a bar fridge and a lovely snack basket chips juice the bathroom was clean and spacious toiletries were provided the breakfast was excellent at the end of the lane you have access to taxis buses and the metro about minutes away is the tour buses it is cheaper to book for days we booked for days as there was so much to see and we still have not seen it all across the park was the airport shuttle the pedestrian walkway was always busy with tourists as there are many top brand and local shopshere also lots of restaurants we were spoilt for choice shops and restaurants are open till late many theatres in the area spanish dancing at the other end of la ramblas is the sea we would love to return and stay in the same area,1.0
the great and were outstanding excellent and accomodating and helpful in regards to children they had shown understanding that children will behave like treatment was children loved the stay over many other bad have something but not for this place,1.0
this hotel is a gem the staff is friendly helpful and welcoming ties my spelling is wrong greeted me with warmth after a very long and delayed flight i felt immediately comfortable the decor for hotel is reminiscent of louis frank lloyd wright styles it is understated on the outside but it is right on the canal and quite frankly everything i wanted to see was within a minute walk the staff made suggestions on where to eat within the area i had dinner at a recommended place that was superb my room was clean comfortable large the bathroom very roomy now on to the they mean all free mini bar liquor in room for your use a happy hour with wine soft drinks beer hard liquor cheese and crackers in their convivial lobby which has couches and comfortable chairs i was traveling alone and during this social drink time i met others and had a chance to share experiences the breakfast is excellent with a chef who has been making omelets for guests she said for years the food was varied and fresh again staff friendly and helpful does this sound as if i enjoyed my experience here i would not stay anywhere else in fact my sister and i are visiting amsterdam in the fall and our hotel will be this one,1.0
comfortable stay with all nearby walking distance on request the check out time was extended you will receive and free welcome drink during your stay the family rooms are very spacious and the sofa bed is perfect for kids,1.0
placed right off the river liffey tram station and near the guinness storehouse the location is ideal easy stroll down to the temple bar area as well rooms are great spacious and lovely reception greeted us well and although our room was not ready they were able to get us checked in so that when we returned from our first day full of jet lag we could just grab our keys and head to the room baggage storage available and safe,1.0
special occasion so we booked this hotel and we wrent disappointed would definitely reccomend the marker hotel thw breakfast was excellent rooms were fab and staff friendly and helpful the area is lovely day and night and close to all areas,1.0
near to airport shuttle bus available at certain times early morning and later in the taxi from airport approx euros good value compared to other hotels friendly staff local supermarket take away pizza nearby,1.0
the hotel offers a lot of services it not difficult to get to the centre by bus or by train it also interesting to take a ride along the sea shore at sandymount the rooms are comfortable and there is a big choice of food for breakfast,1.0
the hotel does not look like much from the outside and also the lobby feels quite bland however the rooms were comfy even if not huge and the bed a dream i love them cozy the modern modular transparent bath room worked well for us though a bit small great breakfast buffet loved the fresh berries that is constantly refilled very curteous service throughout even though it is a hotel we initially were given a former smoking room that smelled terrible but were traded into a propoer room no problem good location off rembrandt square get a room to the rear which have no view but are very quiet,1.0
stayed last saturday the reception was very friendly and the staff overall were great beds very comfortable and the breakfast the following morning was exceptional as a coeliac usually the selection isnt great but the roxford does it justice with the tasty delicious food served,1.0
my husband and i stayed for nights on a weekend in july we were impacted by the construction on weekdays the hotel was an easy euro taxi ride from the airport we arrived and they far exceeded my expectations by allowing us to check in to our room at that bonus points the room was spacious modern and totally clean the bathroom was also modern with a large there is which turned out to be more useful than i thought in ireland given the cool weather but they were our best nights of sleep because it was cool there is not a concierge but everyone at the front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations it was an easy walk to the city center and most attractions yet away from the bustle of the city each morning we needed a cab and ordered one the night before which worked out perfectly the cabbie even asks your room number to be sure it your restaurant was phenomenal for dinner did eat breakfast here and there is a small shop with any extras you need or there are grocery stores nearby the safe was big enough for a laptop i would stay again though hopefully could get a better price we were there weekend,1.0
stayed here for a surprise birthday weekend for my partner in early june booked the hotel through easy jet and had a great experience with it all ignore the star rating this place is fantastic this hotel is by no means the rooms are spacious with lovely clean bathrooms polite and respectful staff the lady at breakfast was ever so polite and attentive and ensured the buffet stayed topped up large selection of continental breakfast items on offer beautiful modern decor minute walk to the city centre but only for a taxi depending on the time of day,1.0
rooms are great but the airconditioning never worked properly the restaurant views are superb and the reception staff were exceptional and extremely helpful we had dinner one night the food was not great but the fried feta starter was superb,1.0
especially by the staff it always amazesme to find hotels which would not be bad but the staff ruins the stay is management too busy to see what is going on so the room was clean and nicely decorated even though i am in the netherlands and i am sure they could have found pictures of their country instead of hanging two pics of new york city in our room just me noticing breakfast area as everyone else said best part in the hotel front desk personal not thefriendliest bunch to say the least and some waiters and waitresses busy talking amongst themselves instead of noticing paying customers is in walking distance within museums and restaurants and such and located in a very quiet neighborhood,1.0
great location right off syntagma square within walking distance to bus and metro and many attractions the staff was friendly and personable especially appreciated leonidis and vasiliki at the front desk very helpful with bus and public transportation information always a friendly and personable greeting very adequate buffet breakfast every morning rooms are clean beds comfortable always clean towels the first impression of the room is that it is sparse looking like a college dorm room after getting over that first impression room was very adequate for our needs as visitors in athens enjoyed the hotel courtyard for food beverage and relaxation not a super luxury hotel but for the price a good value and very comfortable location we would stay here again when visiting athens the staff here is great,1.0
very convenient location near the central train station with excellent connectivity with trams buses and boats hotel was quite good with clean rooms and helpful staff breakfast was very good prices can be described as entry luxury level,1.0
we booked this hotel as we where attending a match in the aviva staduim which sandy mount says is a min walk its actually less i booked the hotel on bookings and before we paid i contacted the hotel and explain we where going to be travelling up and staying the friday night and wouldnt be getting there til later on in the evening and that we would be attending a match the saturday and would it be ok to leave the car there after check out the girl who i was in contact with had no problem with room was clean newly refurbished i think or it was just kept in good condition over time beds where comfortable reception staff upon check in out where friendly we had a few drinks in the bar that night and staff were lovely theres pubs recommend slatterys pub grocery shops and cafes about min walk away from hotel or in taxi download my taxi handy of match there was pop up tents outside the hotel on hotel grounds doing drinks and bbq for people for the match such a good idea we also got to see the football teams driving in by being here they also have a tent for people going to the match to check in there bags,1.0
after an initial problem finding the hotel we were warmly greeted at reception and after details completed provided with room keys to access room area you have to pass through a secure door which is activated by your room room was quite small however was very clean and supplied with plenty of towels and tea and coffee making facilities my daughters room was quite spacious for her and her daughter and problem with tv was quickly rectified all rooms have and our room which was a ground level had double glazing to reduce the sound from the street which was very hotel does not offer breakfast but you can obtain vouchers for a restaurant only yards away from the hotel is well placed and within a short distance from the train station and dam square as well as one of the main canals and boat hotel is kept clean and tidy and the staff are very quick to assist regarding any questions about travel or dining not the cheapest but a good standard and one to consider if visiting amsterdam,1.0
great location right in the heart of the action amazing front desk staff began with tania helping locate lost airport luggage before during and after my meltdown she was and kind and helpful ending with her blonde counter part sorry i did get your name recommending a great coffee shop the next morning quick to smile and ready to help thanks for all your help,1.0
well i would recommend the maldron hotel in smithfield certainly for the price that we paid for a room for four people sharing with breakfast convenient location away from the hustle and bustle of temple bar and its environs yet not too far away minutes walk from the centre of dublin of the dublin pass attractions is directly across the courtyard outside the hotel jamesons whisky distillery convenient fresh produce supermarket is situated next door to the hotel in case you need to stock up on fresh essentials for your day trips around the have no hesitation staying at this location again,1.0
celebrity chose a good property for us the hotel was located right next to the cruise terminal very near to the train station and the central tourist area the best part was the luggage service they took our bags from our cabin and delivered them directly to our hotel room without us even seeing them in the terminal the front desk assisted in acquiring taxi service to the airport very nice service the meals dinner and breakfast were very tasty and served with friendly waiters,1.0
grand old style hotel very atmospheric and great service rooms are a little outdated in terms of equipment but the atmosphere makes up for it the staff are excellent the top floor restaurant has spectacular views the breakfast is excellent though pricey great location the best place to stay in athens,1.0
we stayed at this hotel in june of this year the attention and service in general were excellent especially the dedication and attention of nuria geographically this is very close to emblematic places metro stations a few minutes walk from the city center and surrounded by good restaurants recomendamos este hotel we recommend this hotel no doubt it will be the place where we will sleep on our next trip to barcelona a toast to praktik vinoteca barcelona,1.0
we chanced upon this hotel after our original hotel failed to meet our expectations sharon the manager warmly greeted us and immediately went to work finding rooms for us for the week at a very resonable price we had the best stay in a fabulous area because of the hospitality of sharonville and richie they made our vist enjoyable of course having the pub downstairs was very convenient for food and drink mostly drink lol clean comfortable rooms with fans and windows that open for a nice dublin breeze we honestly did not experience noise from the pub downstairs at any time we were on the of floors they offered us umbrellas when it rained converter outlets so we did need to buy any which by the way they have in the lobby if you wish to buy along with lots of brochures so you can find many many things to do and they were always interested in your day when you came back such nice people bagel shop with great sandwiches and coffee on the corner as well as a marks and spencer wonderful food store across the street min walk to temple bar area min walk to street and the hop on hop off yellow bus stop everything was close by the best part about our stay was the staff we definitely be back thank you,1.0
our family room had two beds in it that slept four the room was ample sized and comfortable the bathroom was nice but small our first room did not have ac but we were moved to a room with ac when we inquired the breakfast was acceptable location is pretty good to reach major sites thought it was a little pricey but was happy to have a clean comfortable bed to sleep in when first arriving in dublin,1.0
i realised that i had lost my currency when i reached the airport for late flight home having spent most of the day around the them the next day and they had found it asked some questions about amount and sent it by courier within a was our visit and will be returning next year hotel could do with a bit of freshening up paint wise otherwise perfect,1.0
everything was seamless from checkin to concierge and checkout i stayed at dinkier place right after this and the juxtaposition highlighted what top notch hospitality is about my only regret is not having stayed here longer,1.0
from the moment you arrive get in the lift up to reception and receive a champagne reception you feel very special we were allocated a superb room and thought it was fantastic could not be faulted in any way whatsoever only two issues the pool is massively oversubscribed and because it is relatively small you feel it is over run by children also the service prices are astronomical for a burger really other than that this is a top class hotel go adults only guys this establishment is made for it,1.0
we booked the divani palace because of its close proximity to the acropolis and plaka all of which are within walking distance the hotel itself is very nice it very clean and modern staff were friendly there is a gift shop pool and it all so has a rooftop restaurant the restaurant has a direct view of the acropolis which is magnificent at night something you really do want to miss enjoyed our stay in all oh there are also ancient ruins on the lower level which they built around when the were constructing the hotel,1.0
a very nice and cozy hotel situated one tram ride away from city center situated right in the middle of the west shopping center which means close access to budget shopping decent restaurants albertine xl and a nice open area with fountain for some kid s fun there is a lake a few minutes walk away the staff is very friendly reception is open hours and you feel very welcome they run a nice small café in the ground floor since the reception is open hours you get access to stuff in this café rooms are named after cities of the world with a full wall view of that city in the hotel is entirely in first floor with lift from reception at one end of the hotel from there it is basically a loooong corridor with rooms on both sides if your room is at the other end you would have walked half way back to amsterdam by the time you reach your room rooms are extremely small actually our room was as wide as the cot or ft when you enter the room you have toilet on one side with a ground glass partition there is no way to lock the toilet door there is a shower room also in there after the toilet you have a nice washbasin behind the shower room the bed is next and as i said it takes of the room space the bed is extra comfy my room had a full width,1.0
not worth the cost does deserve stars probably not even faulty plumbing we had to change room faulty elevator one permanently out of order the other unpredictable noisy rooms you will hear and feel the trains passing every minutea and your neighbours coughing so imagine what else you will hear in the halls outdated rooms dirty carpets on the floors and broken floor tiles orange and brown seems to be the location ok central in dublin min walk to centre and temple bar but across the river however we had daily fights and drug deals taking place on the doorstep of the hotel so slightly dodgy hotel policy we do provide you a mini bar but please do eat any of your own food on our premises what,0.0
online booking at am the current day of my arrival when i arrived at the hotel at pm and the room were ready the room is a great room with larges windows on the corner of parnell square east and gardiner row large and very tidy room including an ensuite bathroom welcoming mattress anyway the main streets are quite noisy and busy and unfortunately the windows are only pane but it wo disturb me cause i a early riser and a night owl continental or full irish breakfast is available,1.0
overall the hotel is tremendous i did not give a for a couple of reasons the front desk staff is not very friendly and in particular francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out overall that did not affect our experience much but it is something they could work on none the less also the housekeeping staff was very pleasant but only of days did we have turndown service which again not a big deal but is part of the price also two of the days we returned from our long day outside the room and at it had not been made up this was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room all day everyday yet our room is last i tip the cleaning service everyday so it could not be that it probably explains our difficulty on the first day we got there at and asked if early checkin was possible the woman at the desk said the cleaning people are outside your room now so it should be an hour or less well we came back in an hour and a half still not done this was the time she reminded us in a teachy condescending way that time is uh we know you told us we could check in earlier so we left and came back at around still not done this is when francesc mansplained that the check in time was so we knew that,0.0
the service started out bumpy but they sure made up for it the hotel is right on the water close to the trolley and near the port for the river room is very clean and the beds were comfortable the bathroom had a weird door but it was clean and stocked with toiletries the breakfast was incredible and i was able to try all sorts of foods i would stay here again,1.0
i came to melia for a corporate event the was smooth and i was in my room about minutes after arrival first thing i requested was iron and ironing board it arrived quite quickly however the ironing board was about to fall apart and it was hard to iron on it corporate event rooms were for our arrival and were clean however there was not enough water provided lunchtime rather poor poor selection meals not tasty no tea provided just coffee toilets were dirty and unattended no toilet paper no soap i informed the reception about the problem it was later solved which i good selection as a tea drinker however i found that there was no hot water provided i had to ask staff separately that proved quite a challenge as some of the staff pretended not to hear me calling them and walked not impressed i would go back i would recommend,0.0
for the price and the pictures i expected more the overall feel of the hotel is that it lacks the gloss of its pictures it is average the bathroom was in need of maintenance glass on the bath to stop the splash was falling off and most disappointing of all was the air conditioning or lack thereof after a full hot day of sight seeing sadly the air conditioner on the room provided little to no relief the final straw for me was the toilet making weird running noises all night so i asked to be moved the hotel obliged the next night and i was moved to a bigger room and the air conditioner worked a little better however when turned on you could smell very strongly cigarette smoke you ca beat its location i agree with other reviews but to be frank i could not wait to leave,0.0
what a great old world style hotel we booked a room with a balcony and spent quite a bit of time watching the people pass below but when you closed the windows the sounds of the narrow street faded away we enjoyed the location easy walk to the beach with all of barrio gotic to explore in between the staff was perfectly helpful not necessary to get the included breakfast because there are so many options nearby we would love to return i hope we can someday,1.0
the hotel is located in a very good situation near the metro station it has a small lobby the rooms are neat and clean but they are small it has a very very small pool breakfast is very good and delicious the hotel is about to minutes to la rambla street and sea you can find lots of shop and food and cafe nearby,1.0
we have enjoyed the rooms were a a little smaller but enogh for our one night was possible to park our car near hotel for free the route to city centre via tram took about minutes without a need to chnge lines of the tram,1.0
the staff made us feel welcome there was no query they could not solve and they were very polite the room was very clean nice pool with rooftop view will be going back to stay at this hotel again hopefully when i book my next barca trip,1.0
we researched a lot of hotels on line and we found the morrison checked all our boxes an easy walk across the bridge over to the temple bar district the morrison is close enough to have fun yet far enough away for a quiet night sleep modern decor is fun and inviting staff was super worth the price,1.0
really did not enjoy my stay at this hotel the first hiccup was seeing leave my account days before our even though i was still inside my cancellation terms and could cancel up to before i had no communication from the hotel about the charge and so rang them up to confirm what this was placed on hold for minutes i had to ring up another times the hotel then confirmed with me that this was a authorisation charge and no money would leave my account no problem i put this experience down to me just missing something in the small print and the hotel being busy that day our experience was really really poor not told anything about the hotel about the shuttle service when check out was how to use the phone if we wanted breakfast did not acknowledge our anniversary i emailed ahead about nothing about the city and how to get there literally no information was given to us she handed us our key and said here you go i wonder if it was her first day on the job no personality at all the location of this hotel is not great it in the middle of nowhere and i had massively underestimated how expensive uber is out here it cost us about to get into the city with uber each way each time it soon became very expensive we did not use the shuttle as we expected it would take a long time that and,0.0
loved this quaint hotel at the very top of la rambla only two minutes from playa catalunya so getting aetobus to there from the airport was so handy hotel is in an older type building but that does deter from its warmth charm and friendliness staff always kind and helpful theyd left us a bottle of cava in room on arrival and given us a decent room overlooking the patio at the back as they had promised in emails our room was a good size had a lovely bathroom a free safe and air con plus s little fridge and micro were an added bonus free buffet was a lovely touch wine beer sift drinks tea and coffee breads yoghurt fruit and a small selection of hot foods at all times was very enjoyable good breakfast for a city hotel too would definitely go back great little hotel lovely staff in excellent location,1.0
we stayed at this greatly located hotel twice while doing viking river cruises in a day period the first stay we had really bad connections and arrived at amsterdam airport at pm without a hotel to stay our viking ship was due in the next day so got taxi to the aitana and was presently surprised the service desk found us room for the night just before my wife was ready to throw me in the harbor the hotel was a minute walk from where our viking ship docked the stay was when we returned on the viking ship and had a day to do downtown amsterdam min walk really nice rooms and amenities nice view of the city from our room on the floor this is a star hotel with star service second visit we got to hotel at am and just new we could probably not get a room until late that afternoon so what a fabulous surprise when their customer service desk got us a room right away so we could walk to the city they even have a wireless hot spot available to use as you do the city room mate hotels has now become my european choice,1.0
skip over this property and look somewhere else i start this review by saying we have traveled all over north america and this is our trip to europe we always travel to to countries for as many weeks so depending on location season and certainly our budget we have stayed in large small and star properties even in a hostel which was more superior to this hotel so in fairness we have experienced many levels of quality and service with each property in my view this is a star hotel at best the booking site agoda had completely dropped the ball by not communicating our special request that it was our anniversary and we would appreciate any special consideration upon checking in they had no record of it when we mentioned it no one even acknowledged or said congratulations i do recognize that we booked a standard room but what we got was the absolute worse room a hotel can offer this hotel and its parent company nn group should be ashamed to market a room like this to its guests the room had a small frosted window which you ca see through never seen that before it opened to a courtyard with full of construction junk and noise the room is small and dilapidated see pics after complaining the front desk person said oh i know i move you apparently it was a room with some history then they moved us one floor up to a room that had,0.0
i was here for two nights with my boyfriend our flight to amsterdam was delayed with hours so you can imagine how bad our mood was i thought that out city break will continue in the same way but i was so wrong this is by far the best place i ever stayed the staff at reception are amazing friendly chatty really helpful i did not check the name of the girl who checked us in she was a really nice girl with curly hair if you read million times thank you for the warm welcome and for making me feel so special after we checked in we went into the center and after that we had surprise in the room welcome card and some snacks the second day we stayed was my birthday and i had reaaallly nice surprise in our room champagne and sweets you really made my day than the fact that the staff are amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous clean modern perfect until the last detail the rooms are cosy with new furniture and nice location is perfect for sightseeing it right in the center and it a couple of minutes away from the central railway station thank you for making my birthday holiday perfect we will be back for sure,1.0
we stayed here in july we did know the hotel but given that we paid for a night we expected something very different this hotel is more of a hostal and charging that kind of rates is outrageous when asking the reception about this all we got was a cocky remark and a patronizing smile never again i can not recommend this place,1.0
we stayed at this hotel in second half of july the location is simply unbeatable it is right on the main ramblas street next to placa de catalunya metro station bus stops hop on hop off stops and dozens if not more places to eat and drink nearby however the room and bathroom were a bit small we expected bigger based on the photos on room was basic with a tv and wifi no mini bar and no coffee service the room was clean and the balcony facing the ramblas street was good to watch all the activity,1.0
prices are steep not unlike the rest of the city but the service was exceptional at every turn the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed convenient location to walk to local attractions and shopping area around the hotel is quiet so there is not a lively night life in the immediate area however it is a very short cab ride away,1.0
we took our teenager children to barcelona for days and decided to be brave by at this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor we can not be more pleased with our choice it is boutique and chic hotel to our like first of all its location offers us minutes of walk almost to everything that we wanted our children to see it shares the same block with casa mila but tucked in the back which makes it quiet the reception desk though a bit short staffed and minimal is friendly and efficient sebastian our concierge is exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly he helped us all the tickets to parks museums and boat rides so we did not have to wait in line all the restaurants he recommended for our lunch and dinner turned out to be exceptional we never had a disappointing meal throughout our stay our family are world travellers and we are all gourmet affectionados the though could be better with more choices makes up with its openness modern simplicity and friendly waitresses our two rooms although could be a bit bigger makes up its small size with high ceilings and large windows and views and gaudi casa mila bathrooms are well furbished lean lined but functional and with all the amenities we need the rain shower is one of the best we come across in many five star hotels we stayed if we have to pick on something we wish its pools would be bigger and more,1.0
we spent nights here with no disappointments friendly staff modern clean and comfortable accommodation brilliant breakfast and superb swimming pool and gym the location is fantastic well worth a try,1.0
great hotel the lobby a little bit messy and small but that it rooms very clean and comfortable if you are looking for a place near gaudi buildings and plaza catalunya this is the right place also the hotel smells like bread,1.0
you paying for the location here if you want five star luxury go somewhere else however if you looking for a clean comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff in the heart of the city at a very good price look no further the hotel is just off the ramblas right opposite the guell palace you ca get nearer to the beating heart of the city breakfast was indifferent but with good service the rooms are basic but very comfortable and despite us overlooking the main street surprisingly quiet this is a great hotel for exploring the finest that barcelona has to offer,1.0
the renaissance in amsterdam is incredibly well located and convenient for anything you might want to do in the city i recently stayed there with my wife and daughters for two days we were able to easily walk to all of the things we want to do and see this included the anne frank house the floating flower market the portuguese synagogue and the red light district we also were a very easy minute walk from the pizza canal cruise that we took the hotel is up to date with top notch amenities the main restaurant looks great although we did eat there we did enjoy drinks and snacks in the bar and the outdoor cafe our rooms were well appointed and fairly large the beds were quite comfortable the hotel staff was friendly attentive and incredibly helpful with directions and restaurant reservations highly recommend this hotel,1.0
typical european hotel very modern smaller but provided for our needs the bed was excellent probably the best bed we slept in very helpful staff who provided directions to the better places in dublin the breakfast buffet was well stocked and the food was excellent,1.0

i loved that the staff met us at the door to our room with cookies and ice cold water we had a great view of the acropolis from our swimming pool was nice and the surroundings were very roof top restaurant was very good but the soft drinks were over priced my husband ended up spending us on three diet cokes wine would have been morning buffet was very bar was open late and was willing to give me ice for my staff helped me find the roof top movie theater that does movies on saturday night there is nothing like sitting on a roof top and watching a movie and having the acropolis in the back ground,1.0
i enjoyed my stay at movenpick amsterdam great room friendly staff good transport links dam square is close by and trams are regular there a ship dock and a river nearby which adds to the would definitely stay here again,1.0
was very impressed from the moment we pulled up in the shuttle they had someone that greeted us at the curb took our bags in and they checked us into a concierge type of check in room around the way from the main area from there a person explained our room and every detail and susanna made sure that everything worked out for us she made sure that our stay was special i was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful i was able to book this on expedia with my flight and so i believe i got a very good rate i been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and i would say this is been one of the best hotels i been to and it walking distance to everywhere and i especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub if there was just one tiny thing that i would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made real dark strong coffee instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere i would surely stay there again and it made barcelona even nicer oh there was a man at the rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender he was quite arrogant and unfriendly yet marissa was a hostess up there on,1.0
the lobby room and amenities are what makes this hotel superb is the personnel who are some of the most competent efficient and courteous front desk staff i ever room was quiet very comfortable and had the most modern finishes the top was an unexpected plus the lower level spa was fun for the kids and adults just a great hotel in a great area of barcelona an equal to fine hotels anywhere in the world,1.0
the place is beautiful spacious and elegant the lobby is filled with amazing decor the staff are very nice and helpful the dining area is huge and has a great atmosphere the menu has a big variety to choose from the rooms are nice nothing special just plain and a little cramped there is a free shuttle bus to dublin airport every minutes which was very handy if you were in a rush you could just pop your hotel card into a box and they would come and check it out for you which in my eyes was a great idea considering the price and the standard of the room they lost one star but everything else was really good and i definitely recommend it,1.0
great hotel super friendly staff always at reception greeted on arrival with a glass of cava and then when we returned to our room that night a bottle had been left for us which was very nice room was clean and very nice small but as expected cleaned very well everyday pool was small but this was stated never tried the breakfast hotel location is fantastic easy to get everywhere via metro barcelona itself has so much to do city and beach what more could you ask for,1.0
we were guests at the andaz the first week in july the first thing we noticed is that there is no obvious front desk you instead find a comfortable couch and are greeted by one of the hosts and are checked in from where you are seated the property is very well taken care of and the rooms are spacious and modern the staff is most helpful friendly and do go out of their way to be sure your stay is as perfect as possible i recommend this lovely hotel,1.0
lovely hotel with very helpful staff especially xavia on front of desk bed was comfy and room was spotless only draw back no tea making facilities in hotel arrived at pm and had to pay euro for tea and each time i wanted a cuppa except when i had a paid breakfast so take a travel kettle if you like tea after days out and early morning,1.0
took bus from airport to about blocks from hotel hotel very nice very modern and comfortable some distance from the downtown commercial area however so wound up using taxis to get around got a two day bus pass which was very helpful in seeing the sights,1.0

beautiful ultra modern hotel very close access to all public transport tram bus and friendly reception staff are excellent and very quick to deal with requests and provide information on places to visit rooms are open plan with super comfortable beds,1.0
loved the hotel really cool and funky design room was immaculate very clean and well laid out good wardrobe space and nice bathroom with fab little funky toiletries nice to have a balcony although view was great would also have liked a proper door on the bathroom as a couple you do want to hear your partner on the toilet breakfast was ok adequate but could maybe be a little better good location easy to walk to most key attractions in barcelona all in all we had a great stay,1.0
the staff were extremely friendly and helpful the chef made some delicious greek treats the location ie minutes from monstraki is perfect to visit all of the sites the rooms were clean and newly stayed twice,1.0
we had a superb day stay at the jazz hotel the situation is perfect for being at the heart of things to see and do as it is so had breakfast in our rate and it was very good with a multitude of choice on what to eat and staff were all very polite and helpful and quick to clear also made use of the rooftop pool most days which was great and the bar was nice is a very vibrant and busy city but it was great to come back here just to chill we would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again if hopefully we return to barcelona,1.0
the is a beautiful hotel in kolonaki a great neighborhood in athens away from the congestion of the tourist areas the rooms are nice sized and have a modern fun design in addition to being incredibly rooftop is a great escape for a drink before heading out with views of the acropolis and the sea in the terms of location lots of accessible restaurants bars and shopping getting an uber to the acropolis and other historical sites is easy and recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a simple comfortable hotel to explore athens,1.0
my husband and i stayed at the divani acropolis for three nights and enjoyed it very much we could see the acropolis from our room esp impressive when it is lit at night it is close to walk to the acropolis and the museum we walked the few blocks from the metro station after taking the metro from the airport and had no difficulty finding the hotel the bed was a king size and comfortable the bathroom had a large tub with a shower our hallway and room was freshly painted did feel tired to us the air conditioner kept the room at a comfortable temp and we did hear outside noise there was an outdoor pool which we used every afternoon as it was over degrees the week we were in athens it is easy to use the metro to get to the other areas of the city the staff were very friendly and helpful and the lobby is large and impressive we saw many different restaurants nearby as we were walking around the staff told us where to catch the xpress bus to take to the port for the cruise we were taking we would definitely stay there again,1.0
in terms of value i would give this hotel mainly due to the service the cleanliness and the location the breakfast could be better for the price it is not included in the cost as the selection is minimal however as stated the service was good they offered a special irish dinner and show with the neighbouring my girlfriend even got asked to try irish dancing which she did to her dismay the experience was enjoyable and memorable however more so for me i think it is located in the centre of shops restaurants and attractions and i would definitely recommend getting the euro bus pass as it enabled us to go everywhere for the days we were so much easier than paying for a ticket each time i would also recommend going to the guinness factory and the hotel is very close to this attraction as it is in the centre we assumed it would be noisy however they provide ear plugs to help sleep overall it was a great trip and we enjoyed coming back to this hotel at the end of a busy day,1.0
hotel is not air conditioned the weather cooperated during our visit lucky room was large clean and everything worked as it should have great location for touring bed was comfortable,1.0
can highly recommend this hotel for the business person or tourist well appointed with stunning rooftop pool and bar location staff super friendly and helpful excellent taxis always available outside would definitely stay here again,1.0
we have been at this hotel for the third time now this is a clean hotel with friendly staff in walking distance to the centre sights and bus stops are also just a few minutes away to us it is the perfect accomodation for a city trip to dublin,1.0
my partner and i stayed nights in july both in our twenties from the exterior the hotel is great but disappoints slightly once inside see pictures we arrived in our room to find a used condom on the bathroom floor the women on reception morning shift was insincere and simply told me that the cleaner would move it no genuine apology we did make a fuss complain or ask to speak to management out all the things you do want to find on your bathroom floor a used condom would be up there if we were an elderly couple or made more of a fuss i think we would have been taken more seriously rather than brushed aside the hotel pool area is lovely however the pool itself looks very unclean the hotel seems to be a popular place for large stag groups if a group is in the pool you have not got a chance of relaxing in it they can also be quite intimidating a couple of times i witnessed two groups of females leaving the pool area after being pestered by groups of drunk men the room is lined with wooden panels all of which are chipped and worn the shower curtain is inadequate water leaks all over the floor and wooden door frame making it rot the temp is good cold and we understand that aircon units are loud but this one was the loudest we have ever experienced and rattles the two main roads at,0.0
overall our stay at room mate emma was great the was fantastic the room was big enough and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful especially carmen and i ca remember the guy name i think it started with g we were a bit put off when we first arrived though as we were told there were only rooms with two single beds left at the level we paid for as we were checking in later in the day but we could pay an extra euros for an upgrade our booking clearly stated a queen bed and there was no mention of conditions of availability we argued the point and after a few minutes were upgraded at no additional charge this was unfortunate as otherwise we had a great stay,1.0
this hotel is fantastic a great location with a beautiful park in its surroundings and a rooftop bar with stunning views of amsterdam rooms were clean and in great condition with very comfy beds bar was quite expensive but where is in amsterdam tram stops outside hotel and is a minute trip into dam square is a fantastic place hotel is the perfect base,1.0
as usual this is written as a wheelchair room was quite a good size although i did find it a little neat for my electric wheelchair there is a separate section of the car park for disabled badge holders and this is opened by asking the concierge or reception to unlock one of the bollards so if you are a sole disabled traveller it would be worth having the phone number in your mobile so you can phone in and ask rather than struggling out of the car and then back in bathroom is very well appointed with a shower which has a height adjustable seat and what i thought were sufficient hand rails the toilet itself is raised with handrails on either side the sink is lower so is convenient for a wheelchair user the bed is level with a wheelchair there is one pull cord to summon help and this is in the bathroom i think another cord at the side of the bed might be lifts beside reception are a wee bit on the small side but there is a bigger lift to the side of the breakfast area and i found that one much easier to food in the restaurant is lovely but there a few too many dishes with or olives which cut what i was wanting quite a bit but i had a steak one evening which was staff were helpful and on the whole our stay was very pleasant,1.0
my husband and i stayed at this hotel after our day tour of ireland first of all the location of this hotel is absolutely perfect so if you want to stay in the city center then this place is for you you can walk down o connell street and you are in the city center there are multiple shops restaurants coffee shops and everything that you need as you walk out from the hotel also the hop on hop off bus has a stop right outside the hotel the aircoach blue bus also has a stop just right outside of the hotel i can not say how impressed i am with this bus service that is offered between the airport and the city center you can just purchase the tickets from the bus driver it is either or euros i do recall roundtrip to airport and city center per person so you can not go wrong with that and it is much cheaper than a the hotel was decent and comfortable the front desk people are very helpful and friendly the room itself was very small enough to fit a queen size bed desk and two smaller chairs the bathroom was decently sized and it had a towel rack heater which was a nice surprise the one thing i did like about our room were the paper thin walls i could hear when someone was flushing the toilet at but i got over that i would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
the hotel is very good located in a central point where you can easy access every part of the city the breakfast menu is so wide and it is very good the hotel staf are friendly and provide help one comment though the cleaning of the room should occur more often in my days stay it was cleaned only once,1.0
great location so close to centraal station transport room clean roomy staff very helpful would stay here again bit disappointed our room rate did include breakfast but certainly would recommend,1.0
real luxury hotel with views of the acropolis and situated in the center the rooms are nicely furnished comfortable bed and pillows separate bath and shower no bidet in standard room plush robe and slippers decent toiletries very generous supply of towels adequate closet space modest sized desk for work could use a few more outlets for electronic gear as well as a brighter light over the desk for those who need to work tv is internet based rather slow fitness room is hours and well equipped for cardio spa closes at floor bar is good for meeting people and informal conversations buffet for breakfast is plentiful and high quality get there early for a seat on the terrace facing the acropolis for a memorable view service is excellent especially in the restaurant though to be fussy it took almost minutes for my cappuccino to arrive and out were flawless friendly and efficient,1.0
the hotel has very high standards when it comes to premises and service a special thanks goes to claire for helping us out with the bookings and check in even going the extra mile by supporting us with info related to dublin,1.0
outstanding really this is one of the best hotels we have ever been too since the check in we both felt really welcomed manuel and all the staff were very kind our room with canal view was more than we expected plus the garden and bar were also one of a kind the hotel is a complete experience i just hope i can be back again soon,1.0
stayed for nights excellent central location on main street for access to metro hop on hop off tours airport bus that came with downside of noise at night which did affect my sleep room was clean bathroom was very tight on space and i could see difficulties emerging for customers who may be obese as hard to close the door pass by the toilet to get into the shower breakfast room was clean also fresh fruit of bananas apples and oranges fruit juice water of cereals croissants and bread for toasting were available for guests never met staff members in breakfast room but staff on front desk were friendly and have no hesitation recommending this hotel for a city break just try and reserve a quieter room,1.0
we arrived about knowing we could not check in until we asked to store our bags which they accommodated straight away they also said they would make sure a room was available for room was ready as promised for all modern and refurbished everything clean with a great view on the was basic but good with the option of grab and go with a take out coffee and croissant were really accommodating offering maps directions and recommendationswould definitely stay here again,1.0
we had the pleasure of staying at the market during out three week european vacation the hotel is situated in a modern business area of dublin the hotel was gorgeous rooms were spacious amenities were first class the staff made us feel very special we were fortunate to experience the spa the rooftop bar and the fabulous dining the marker hotel stands out amongst the rest in all its offerings and a staff that was spectacular,1.0
recommended by a friend who is a frequent visitor to barcelona for work we were incredibly happy with this hotel the welcome and check in were great glass of cava as we checked in a gift of a bottle of red wine and some chocolates to welcome us to the hotel and a lovely room my wife loved the decor of the entire hotel and the room lots of mirrors nice bathroom with lovely toiletries provided we had a drink in the bar by the pool which was nice and relaxing breakfast was one of the best i have had anywhere great selection on the buffet and then the cooked options were delicious room was cleaned every day as you would expect and the toiletries and water replenished also used the laundry service which was good albeit hotel prices my only criticism is that the air conditioning would not get low enough for my wife and i which meant we spent most nights sleeping without even a sheet although it was not so uncomfortable that we could not sleep would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely look out for the brand again when in spain as the quality and service was better than others we had experienced to date,1.0
my company booked me small double room and i got a hostel type accommodation no mirror in the room for i understand the place is under construction but that is acceptable do get cheated as well,0.0
this was my first trip to the clayton hotel and i was very impressed from the moment i walked into the lobby i knew that i was going to have a great stay and i was right the bedroom was on the floor and was stunning comfortable and spacious the beds were comfy and big we ate in the vertigo bar the nights and the food was amazing the breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choices of fruit cereal fry bread juice and toast i had a very enjoyably stay and will definitely be back thanks to all the staff that took care of us from repection to leisure center and all in between especially erika who organized our stay i be back,1.0
we stayed at the emporikon last year and loved it we were nervous at first because there is no outside signage we were so surprised to find this completely renovated unique upscale boutique hotel the rooms we stayed in last year had high ceilings modern decor and great there is no room which is fine and almost preferred as there are restaurants bakeries so many options all around the hotel it is super convenient to the plaka area and the acropolis we loved it so much we went back this year with another family this year we stayed in room and had a and my kids thought it was the coolest the other family stayed on the top floor in this super cool family suite they were so happy and i was happy since i suggested the hotel this is now our place to stay in athens,1.0

we stayed at royal ramblas for three days in july and were more than happy with our experience here first the location is excellent right at the center with walking distance to gothic eixample beach and placa da catalunya very happening place we got around and our room was ready we got a suite on the floor room there were three of us the extra bed was already made up room was very specious with two sinks and a specious bathroom as well the staff was very friendly and cooperative we did not have a view of the rambla but rooms were very quiet considering the hustle bustle on the ramblas we also had breakfast in the hotel and it was great to have coffee in the morning watching the action on ramblas we will definitely be staying here again,1.0

dirty rooms and dirty bath towels unhelpful and rude reception staff with major attitude no mini bar in the rooms do not recommend it please note that this is the first time i bothered writing a review for a hotel,0.0
great central location the hotel is traditional european with small rooms they are clean but nothing special management said they will be redoing rooms fall of bathrooms already updated do not pay extra for room with a view as you have to be out on balcony and looking left but the view from the roof top terrace is fantastic with the acropolis in full view we spent nights after very long touring days on roof terrace with meals delivered to us from a local restaurant the staff recommenced the food was excellent and cheap great pork gyros hotel breakfast was good with hard boiled eggs meats little hot dogs breads fruits and pastries,1.0
as americans who had never been to greece we booked the hilton very efficient staff at the front desk beautiful spacious rooms including marble bathrooms we got an acropolis view and it was well worth the extra money the breakfast buffet is delicious with so many choices book it as part of your package the pool and pool bar were nice drinks at the rooftop galaxy bar were memorable and a great place to view the parthenon during the golden hour at sunset,1.0
this hotel is located right on stephen green with easy access to all the main attractions in dublin what made our visit extra special was the assistance of dane and patrick at the concierge desk from dinner reservations to walking directions to croke park to locating a driver for a trip up north at the last minute all was handled with humor and ease we received a super early check in after our overnight flight too small room but fine for a few days dublin is a fun city,1.0
the people at this hotel are amazing for example my husband camera broke and staff helped him find a repair shop at breakfast staff walk around answering any questions all of their advice was spot on we stayed there in an economy room for one night then went to crete returned and stayed in a more expensive room both rooms were clean and comfortable the hotel is close to the metro and has a wonderful roof terrace with a view of the acropolis we definitely would return,1.0
we stayed here last week hotel in general was nice but the staff are by far the most unfriendly non welcoming people i ever seen i work in the industry myself and could imagine treating people the way these staff breakfast is from till on week days it bein our holidays we did go to breakfast till about any morning we went only to be hassled and rushed by the waiter it was just us other tables got the same treatment and i heard them say that breakfast is over till which it does state the waiter then proceeded to argue with all the tables that they have to be gone by but most tables ignored then came to us and said u need to hurry up i have to clear up breakfast is finished at i checked the time it was all i had was toast and tea i went in the second morning and he was doing the same thing to every table in there i did bother having anything just went out for breakfast after paying just for breakfast and to get that treatment is crazy we tried the bar food one of the nights crazily over priced our bar tender was rude and very unfriendly i ordered a ham and cheese pizza and i asked if i could get french fries with that and the waiter said we do do french fries only with certain things on the menu and the tables across from us had,0.0
stayed at the kingfisher townhouse for one night as an added stay to our dublin trip we booked this late for a very good deal therefore our expectations were huge due to the cost of other hotels nearby we were pleasantly surprised though arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady called who explained that our room was yet ready but offered us a discount voucher for the cafe next door we took her up on the offer and enjoyed a fabulous full irish breakfast so much so we went back the following morning for another we returned we found that our luggage had been placed in our room which was hugely appreciated as it was up a number of flights of stairs with no lift the room was modern and the bathroom was lovely and had obviously been recently we were in the room the windows were open and there was a lot of traffic noise however once we shut the window you could hear anything the bed was comfy and the room had all the things you need including tea coffee water and biscuits and information about what to do and see in townhouse is only a minute walk from the aircoach stop on street and is perfectly placed for exploring would highly recommend this as a place to stay in dublin and we would definitely consider returning in the future,1.0
we booked the hotel at the last moment after having an issue with our flight from barcelona we chose it for it location predominantly but also needed and an safe when we tried to enter a code for the safe it did not work we called reception and someone immediately came to the room he checked the safe and said it needed a new battery which they could not change that day we explained our need for a safe and asked for another room but were told they could not change the room i called reception again and they offered us another room after changing rooms that safe readout again stated batt the same as the first room that we had i went down to reception again and was told by a person there a blond female reception staffer who informed me that the safe was not working because our computer was too large i told her that the safe easily accommodated the computer at which time she repetitively insisted that i was wrong another reception person came to the room and he confirmed that there was no issue with the computer size he was able to get the safe to lock the attitude of the blonde woman was certainly not what i would expect from any customer service person especially at a star hotel generally felt worn with scratches on the walls and doors in the hallways the room was small and dark but had good closet space the,0.0
my sister and i stayed a night here when visiting dublin to attend a concert in vicar st and were very impressed loved being able to walk out on the quays and temple bar and grafton st just a bridge away lovely room great breakfast and friendly helpful staff very enjoyable night away,1.0
we stayed at this hotel back in april for nights we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here our room had a sea view the room was reasonably sized and spotless the staff were welcoming attentive and helpful the restaurant was ideal to grab a bite to eat or even just to enjoy a drink with quite a good view of the city the pool and terrace area were absolutely stunning a really peaceful place to unwind and relax my only quibble about this hotel would be that it a little way from the centre however the metro stop is only a five minute walk away and the route stops at key places in the city including barceloneta and passeig de garcia all in all we really enjoyed our stay here,1.0
the marker is a star hotel from the minute you walk into the lobby the service is second to none the check in process delightful remembering you if you stay frequently the rooms are sizeable with very comfortable amenities bathrooms are modern updated with radiant flooring restaurant has great breakfast options and the bar has a nice whiskey selection no doubt this is my hands down favorite hotel in dublin,1.0
this hotel has a great location and should bar food is average and the service very slow it also is intentioned staff need better customer is my first experience with half a cup of coffee for the price of a full coffee top ups lot of work to is a reason why three sets of tourists walked out service needs serious improvement in this bar there are much better options in dublin,0.0

hotel banys orientals is an amazing boutique hotel in barcelona old town we have stayed here before and were very happy to come back the rooms are comfortable the staff are friendly and very helpful always willing to help with directions suggestions and hotel strong point is its location in the middle of the old town within walking distance of la rambla and the sea as well as being in the middle of bustling shopping streets art galleries and local restaurants and bars serving delicious breakfast is full of local delicacies and there are fridges full of free bottled water on each floor which are very welcome after a long day trekking around on a side note the amazing staff at the hotel saved our holiday for us when i dropped my phone with our pictures videos etc in the taxi on the way to the airport a quick call from my partner phone to the hotel they were able to find the taxi and get them to bring the phone back to us a big big big thank you to the hotel for this,1.0
myself and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel in june for nights and we are so glad that we chose this hotel is in a perfect location it is within a minute walk of different metro stations urquinaona passeig de garcia and catalunya meaning that it is easy to get to from the airport or train stations and that it is a short walk or metro ride to anywhere in the city it is also only a minute walk from placa de catalunya and the top of la rambla and a short walk from the barri gotic and el born areas being located a short walk from all these areas also means that it is in a quieter area than some hotels in barcelona and we found it very peaceful each night and easy to get a good nights room itself was spacious enough for people and had a comfortable bed a nice bathroom with a very large shower shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer a safe and a lovely little area which had a couple of seats and was a lovely place to sit and have a snack and overlooked a quiet courtyard type area the room also had a minibar which was just a small fridge which we used to put our own in and was incredibly useful the air conditioning in the room worked perfectly making the room a lovely cool temperature to retreat in to when it was nearly degrees outside the staff at the,1.0
we where here a short week in the end of july two adults and one tiny baby the staff was very friendly and helpful super clean rooms and nice cleaning staff too a few negative things though our room was very tiny and with no view at all and it was pretty thin walls between the rooms so we could very well hear other people in the other rooms on top of the hotel there is an area with a very small swimming pool and some sunbeds and a bar nice place to relax in the afternoon sun astoria is located a little distance away from la rambla it in a walking distance but easier to take the metro a couple of stops all in all we are very happy with our stay,1.0
we loved our large room with wonderfully comfortable bed with cotton sheets and a nice canal view the front staff bellmen concierge desk at this hotel is wonderful and very well trained the restaurant staff needs a lot of work and training there seemed to be no training or supervision at all when we were there and it seemed the food was sent out of the kitchen without a chef checking it out for example three people at our table ordered the same dish and the inconsistency was remarkable but not in a good way the location of this hotel is fantastic right in the heart of everything and so much fun walking or biking around any time of day or night the pool and steam room were a nice treat during all our travels as well it would have been even nicer had there been a spray bottle of eucalyptus in the steam room maybe next time hope to stay here again,1.0
the rooms were clean and the size was pretty good our rooms were on the floor with a good view of the city though we did get time to use the open air bar we did have a look at it it was beautifully lit at night and gave a wonderful view of the city the bathrooms were neat and had enough space the breakfast had a wide variety of food overall a good stay,1.0
we had a two night stay in barcelona with two boys aged and and this apartment worked well for us we were able to do a load of washing and there was washing machine capsule and dishwasher capsule in the apartment on arrival apartment was serviced and there is a large well priced supermarket just around the corner there are nice bakeries nearby the apartment is extremely convenient for a visit to the sagrada and we booked our morning visit for the first tour of the day which is at whilst the apartment is a way from some other attractions there are plenty of transport options park guell is also relatively nearby the choice of a supper venue takes a little bit of research as at first glance there do not seem to be too many restaurants overall the apartment was clean and spacious and works well if you would like to be able to have light meals or snacks in the apartment there is a fridge and microwave there is some street noise but not too bad the concierge booked a taxi for our early morning trip to the airport,1.0
we had prebooked a taxi from the airport online before we travelled this was a little trickier than first thought as the airport is vast and we found ourselves wandering around for a while looking for the wtc world trade centre pick up point the wtc is located behind the sheraton which you can see when leaving the airport and not really visible from the airport also no signs however this was not arranged by the hotel but thought its worth mentioning for anyone else who pre books a taxi and are given the same we arrived at the hotel check in was quick and easy and off we went to our room i enjoyed the fact there were fresh apples on reception for you to have whenever you liked yes the rooms are small but when in a city knowing we were going to spend much time in the room itself it did not bother us at all nice room coffee making facilities hairdryer aircon perfect my only gripe is that the bed was a little hard and it did need a lick of paint in places but it was did drink or have breakfast in the hotel so can not comment on prices there are so many nearby shops to pick up a hotel is situated on the outskirts of the which is where we always prefer to be as we always discover lots of things on the walk into the centre dam square it is right next,1.0
aside from a beautiful hotel they could do enough for you i never actually experienced anything like that before someone grabbed me out of line at check in to bring me to their computer they have someone at the elevator to press the button for you or answer a question if you ask where something is they escort you most of the staff are adorable young students from all over the world working at the hotel while studying in barcelona talking to them all and finding out what country they were from made it very interesting breakfast buffet was amazing location on the beach was good pool are was nice wish they had their own private area on the beach as being in a public area was annoying because it was non stop vendors walking around you chanting what they were selling as in water beer was very nice view was amazing with a corner view beds were amazing,1.0

not far from nearest metro line overamstel arrived early evening very informal check in straight forward and given info of area maps and recommended restaurants and activities etc asked for a water view which is on the back of the hotel and this was sorted the room was on the end of the floor very nice comfortable bed no bath but that did bother us nicely laid out room was lovely and quiet at night with cold air blower which was welcome breakfast was good and varied i thought at the time it was a little on the expensive side but after travelling into the city was competitive with town centre price all staff very pleasant,1.0
casa camper barcelona is a lovely hotel it is centrally located the rooms are very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and ca do enough for you the breakfast is varied and you can help yourself to soft drinks and snacks at any time during the day on the roof terrace they have an honesty bar which works very well we only stayed three nights but would happily have stayed only criticism is that there are only two of these hotels the other being in berlin and there is definitely room for many more of them,1.0

nice clean hotel staff always smiling and ready to help any time of the day or night i had a problem operating the air con controls however the reception send someone who replaced the controls and everything was we had a kettle on the room to boil water for coffee and tea i would have preferred the room service staff to have given us more tea bags than the customary ration of bags a day although this was not a problem as we could always get extra supply from coffee shop located on the ground floor the breakfast at this hotel is excellent they cater for all hotel is very centrally located within easy reach of all the archaeological sites restaurants and shopping hotel also gave us packed lunch for our early am departure for will be using the same hotel on return from mykonos,1.0
i have already mentioned the interest of this hotel for the outstanding sightseeing over the acropolis and the entire city of athens that you may enjoy at breakfast or for a drink at sunset on the terrace near the pool the staff is very friendly and helpful but i recommend climbing to the top of mount lycabetus nearby for the lazy there is a funicular mn from the hotel and up altough there is often a queue of tourists so count mn but it is better to walk up by the road and the partially staired path min from the hotel for normal people if you are trained at mountain climbing the terrace of the monastry is the ideal place to observe the sunset if you are lucky and observe carefully you will see the green light at the last second,1.0
good place to stay not too far from the city center modern hotel for not tried the restaurant only return if i ever come back to to the rugby stadium so may be crowded if a game is on check the match program,1.0
this is a hotel that really worths your money though is a bit heavy in style and furniture according to our taste we really did enjoy it located in the heart of the city we were expecting it noisy but on the contrary we experienced a tranquil sleep and stay rooms on the upper floors provide the best view indeed,1.0

amazing hotel over looking the marina great distance to everywhere and there is also a hop on hop off bus tour that stops outside would highly recommend rooms are fabulous with amazing little tiny details that make the room staff are very friendly also,1.0
i have found that any big company are only as good as the staff as the service they supply reflects on that company i have to say that i was so impressed from the moment we walked into the reception and was warmly greeted by adrian that straight away i knew that i was going to be satisfied with our stay my wife has a mobility problem and his help and understanding was exemplary after parking the car we were booked in by wheed and again can not praise her enough for her help the room was spotless and the beds very comfortable although we were above a busy street the windows kept out any noise and the air conditioning was effective enough to keep them closed even on the hottest days in barcelona breakfast was a buffet of hot or cold and was regularly kept fresh by the efficient waiting staff as stated earlier everyone was more than helpful and on our departure day we even had the duty manager talk to us over breakfast he advised us that this particular hotel was in the group on current form all i can say is the above him have to be outstanding when we left we felt like royalty with the staff almost lining up to wish us a happy onward you travelodge barcelona and if we ever return to barcelona we will not hesitate to stay with you again,1.0
we were two friends who stayed nights at this hotel it is a great hotel we had a room that did not have the lounge across the hall and it was fantastic to have a separate toilet and huge bench space in the bathroom it offers breakfast which is fantastic and snacks all day not having to search out breakfast every morning was a wonderful benefit the room was quite large clean and the beds comfortable the location was perfect off la rambla and within walking distance of all the tourist sites we walked all over barcelona the staff were friendly and helpful when we had questions we also loved the rooftop area it was peaceful and so lovely first thing in the morning we would definitely return to this hotel again it was lovely to stay in a hotel that was not overridden with guests and you had to wait for perfect,1.0
chose this as an accor member and based on location and reviews just wonderful experience we had a free upgrade some gifts for my toddler discounted breakfast buffet and wonderful staff room modern comfy was upgraded for free with a magnificent view of downtown barcelona sagrada etc breakfast was outstanding,1.0
i have just concluded my stay at amalia hotel it has been quite a good experience for my friend and i who are traveling through the athens area it is in the plaka district which is a safe area in athens close to restaurants and shops and within a minute walk to many of the historical sites the rooms were very clean and the service has been impeccable the front desk is always at the ready to pull out a map and trace your directions to your destination their breakfast buffet was stacked with all types of goodies for those who are watching their waistline to the fellow gourmand there is a pretty good and tasty spread for all with some greek goodies that can add to the cultural experience lastly something that stood out to me was that the hotel provides breakfast boxes for travelers who have to depart the hotel prior to the breakfast buffet opening up i really appreciated this type of hospitality as it made our transition to our next destination that much easier if i am ever able to come back to the area amalia hotel will certainly be a place where i is my only con the mattress was a little hard that it,1.0
the hotel was terrible there was a hole in the shower and an unknown stain in the tent the only positive things were the really kind staff and the position however i pretty sure that you could find a better place to stay at the same price avoid marnix,0.0
we stayed here for nights prior to flying onto crete for a further week our room was nicely proportioned for a city hotel and the bathroom was really good walk in shower spa bath for and plenty of had breakfast only once as a discount was offered when we checked in and it was fine although the service was not great and i had to go and look for someone to request crowning glory is their roof top bar and restaurant although we did not eat here we did have a couple of drinks whilst admiring the view of the lit up had read reviews prior to arriving that the hotel was not very central however we did not find this to be true it is a couple of minutes walk from hop on hop off bus stops minutes from the archaeological museum and about minutes from the monastiraki square and flea market hercules library and the ancient agora,1.0
i wish i had nothing bad to say about the dean as is a gorgeous quirky hotel with great deco but the absurd amount of noise that comes from the night club on the ground floor is horrendous and a massive disruption for the night sleep even if my night sleep only started at am is ridiculous loud and not acceptable it outweighs any other good feedback about this place is a shame and i actually feel sorry for the staff as they do a great job but at the end the noise from the night club kills any effort and positive feedback,1.0
overall a great stay although we did encounter some issues in the beginning of it but i can only recommend to open your mouth and address your issues to staff and management they did listen to us and our problems and came with solutions and answers the only thing i can hope now is that they use our feedback for their continuous improvement processes special warm thank you to joost at the breakfast at mr porter his service is super top notch a good example to all associates there if all associates would tend that direction i sure the hotel staff attentiveness will land on the level the property merits btw rooms are very nice breakfast super i think it at least at same level of w barcelona if not even beyond anyway it great great selection of juices and also bubbles in the morning if you into heavier breakfast try the one at mr porter and have a minute steak in the morning ps try the spa as well a divine place in the middle of amsterdam if there would be any point of attention towards visitors than would it be the use of swimming gear in both spa as ont he wet deck we seen guests in and externals going with their underwear in the pools maybe a stricter policy would be welcome there in order to maintain overall hygiene for the other guests,1.0
i foolishly and paid for a room here in advance and tried to cancel at late notice but over a busy summer weekend i tried to recoup some or part of the high price i had paid but it was a flat no referring me to the fine print in their t c typical big chain approach here i ca comment on the hotel or amenities as i did actually stay here but i certainly wo be back,0.0
we stayed at this hotel nights the room was very clean and has a beautiful design the staff was helpful and friendly they always ask if u need anything the view from the rooftop was would definitely stay here again,1.0
we stayed here the night before our mediterranean cruise it a beautiful hotel great views and near restaurants and a huge mall we enjoyed the executive lounge level immensely for cocktails and snacks and breakfast easy to get a taxi from airport and also taxied to port rooms are huge clean and at the high end of hilton standard great lobby bar too with comfy seats to watch a soccer match on tvs,1.0
a last minute booking and a flight delay saw us arrive at stylish and contemporary level melia sky at about on a wednesday morning so unfortunately missed the opportunity of checking in at the bespoke level reception desk albeit the standard melia sky reception on the ground floor was perfectly agreeable and the reception team we were allocated a room on the lowest of level floors with a bed comfortable enough to accommodate a great night sleep beyond the curtains was a lovely morning view with a distant sea outlook and an urban landscape below the room was of average floor space with a rarely used sofa and occasional table taking up useful space but looking good on the room spec room cleanliness was good but on two of the three full days housekeeping omitted to clear used coffee cups milk cartons and to me replenish the nespresso coffee capsules which was disappointing calling to ask for some in my boxers was on the agenda the location of the melia sky was debatable having previously stayed in the heart of les ramblas hotel bagues it is in a far more remote residential location meaning if you looking for sightseeing this is a good bet but for a great selection of local bars and restaurants and a adventure it fits the bill nicely a taxi rank is outside the door and gets you to les ramblas in minutes a taxi from the airport at to melia sky and a midday return,1.0
my travel agent recommended this hotel and i was sure what to expect because it was right in central amsterdam but i loved it clean modern hotel with friendly helpful staff room was very comfortable and had a fantastic view of the only a short min walk to central city and close to central station the breakfast buffet was out of this world would definitely recommend this hotel,1.0
stayed here for convenience to as i was going to a concert if i was just coming to visit dublin i would stay here it out of town although a taxi is only feels very isolated no restaurants pubs etc next to it the hotel itself is a very modern design nice enough executive rooms with a balcony are very disappointing overlook a construction site noisy too superior double rooms feel a bit claustrophobic windows do open i had a family room which was very nice with opening windows overlooking inner courtyard so very quiet would definitely recommend this rather than balcony rooms or river view rooms the river view is rubbish bed was comfortable good hairdryer iron etc complimentary which was a bit disappointing the dull lacks atmosphere and boring background music played the same it seems each night strange menu mix of asian food etc after the concert the public bar closed by we were told to move to residents bar again very dull boring at over per night i ca recommend this hotel,1.0
we went for a birthday weekend away last weekend the hotel is fantastic decor size of rooms location and to top it all off the staff and service was exceptional they made sure we were well looked after we hired their bikes they booked restaurants for us they surprised us with birthday cake the breakfast was good they have on tap snacks and drinks all day long we had intended to go to the gym but did have enough time and there was too much equipment in the gym but it way more fun to cycle all round the city down to the can not say enough good things about this hotel highly recommend staying here,1.0
the academy plaza hotel is a perfect location that is in walking distance to a lot of places to see in dublin the rooms are all ok and clean the only thing to comment is the shower not so mych pressure in that one but all in all recommended,1.0
i arrived in athens on a whim and did not have a reservation when i landed i boarded the train to downtown and booked this hotel online on the way into town i was drawn to it because of a wonderful experience i had a similarly themed hotel in florence see my review what drew me was the description that the hotel had been conceived with an architectural theme of the old hotel had been gutted and this new hotel was put together with all of the elements from the hotel including the furnishings the hotel was easy to get to i took a taxi from the central station but it was so close i walked to the station upon my departure there is really a when you enter the hotel i think the staff were influenced and inspired by the concept they were very knowledgeable about the hotel the was quick and i was asked then if i wanted to extend my stay at that time i said i wait for a day or two to make up my mind she told me the hotel fills quickly and sure enough when it came time to check out they were already fully booked i was upset not at them but at me because i really enjoyed the hotel it is immaculate it is safe it is and it is a smart hotel there is a lot of technology managing the lights the locks the internet and the energy conservation bonus,1.0
we stayed at the central athens hotel for nights at the end of march the hotel was in a great location perfect for sightseeing we booked bed and breakfast and requested a acropolis view the room was really nice not huge but perfectly adequate for what we wanted the room was lovely and clean with clean towels daily the breakfast was lovely with a really good choice of hot and cold reception desk staff were really helpful and knowledgable,1.0

stayed two nights at the end of a long river cruise and loved it centrally located and within easy walking distance to great restaurants the spui tram stop is a min walk depending on how many time you must stop to dodge bicycles making the museumplein a cinch to reach our room on floor level was beautifully appointed and faced the canal the bed and linens were first rate and the bathroom was extraordinary lots of nice touches like candies and cookies available all day in the lobby the staff was uniformly charming and helpful staying here is the perfect antidote to mediocre tourist hotels do yourself a favor and give it a try,1.0
fantastic service great location and excellent facilities the breakfast is delicious and the beds and bathrooms are fantastic staff are so lovely and helpful in booking transport etc would definitely stay here again,1.0
i do think we ever had a better check in before at any hotel even at fancier hotels at check in the attendant offered tips on his favorite restaurants in town the cool spots to he marked a map for us that we used all weekend even though we been to amsterdam many times before but the leads gave us great intel into the city as it is at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the entire weekend and to top it off they left a note and dutch cookies in our son room welcoming him back to his birth city i must have mentioned it over the phone because i was trying to get a specific set of rooms and online they were sold vibe of the hotel is very cool and reminds us of the ace hotel from our home town style and amenities are on point hour mini bar at the front desk free calls overseas wifi bagged breakfast to go hanging outside your room in the morning they had a dj both nights we were there and the bar was a great place to be however the sound did carry at all so sleeping was would absolutely recommend staying at the hoxton and will plan to stay there when we fly through amsterdam again in a few months,1.0
the hotel is abit far from town but it very accessible the front desk hotel staff is very friendly it very quiet and nice neighbourhood near to park guelle and it about mins walking distance to the park,1.0

we stayed here for nights and were satisfied with the place good staff helpful and friendly the hotel is situated about a minute journey from the centre of barcelona we made the mistake of using the service through the hotel which was so bad pizzas were terrible the hotel is quiet and just what we needed for our stay here the aircon could be cooler with the rooms being a bit warm at night would come back thanks,1.0
we stayed two nights en route to croatia and it was a marvelous experience the toren sits canal side in an easily accessible and central location walkable and trammable and right around the corner from the anne frank house the style is a sort of eddie izzard meets the dutch east india company but in the best possible way our room was in the nearby annex and was gorgeous well appointed and unique the bar is cozy and frankly fabulous for quiet time as a couple the bartender was skilled the negroni ranks among the best i had anywhere in the world and my wife signature gin and tonic i told was delicious the staff is very pleasant and very helpful we definitely stay again of course it is expensive but with boutique hotels you nearly always get what you pay for,1.0
fantastic location if travelling by train close to luas also room was amazing overlooking the city staff friendly and available to fulfil all requests luggage can be stored and collected at a later time after checkout time,1.0
stayed here one night for a business trip the service was top notch and the room was nice but not over the top a little small but typical for europe the rooms were clean and well appointed and while i did hear some noise from other rooms it was reasonable the hotel is in a nice restaurant and bar district so you can walk outside and find pretty much any type of food or bar you are interested in i did not get to try any of the food service as my stay was short the price is a bit high but this might be typical for downtown dublin so if price is not a factor this is a nice place to stay,1.0
i can honestly say we had wonderful service rooms were larger than i expected the terrace bar is very nice although small and if pool is what you want it is but still quite nice drinks and food is a little pricier than on the street but consider the accommodations i had a message at the spa wonderful experience complaint was it got hot in our room by late morning and did really cool off til room next door was fine but at night it was perfectly cool i would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel,1.0
the room was ready for our early at found the room to be quiet clean and superbly were friendly and the receptionist brought the towels and shower gels midnight upon the request as the room cleaning was not done on the day due to the reason that we were sleeping during the day when the cleaner tried to come to the and tastefull breakfast with lot of options and hot food never tried the dinner and the ice was very near to the centraal station and the views are superb from the only difficult thing experienced was that our room cards were expired after the first day but the receptionist was asking for the before she gave us the new keys luckily i had a passport copy in my and showed it to is the the extra security measure from the hotel side but it would have been a trouble if there was no in my,1.0
this hotel is stunning and i loved the location it situated very close to the metro and many tourist attractions are a short walk from the hotel the rooms were clean and the customer service was a all the employees were very helpful,1.0
on our arrival sunday evening the of aug we dealt with a blonde foreign lady who was very ignorant and did make us feel one bit welcome i also did understand what she was saying even when i said sorry could you say that again she would repeat what she said we were also told we would have to pay for parking for the two nights a bit ridiculous considering we paid for the two nights with just a bed the breakfast was also robbery for a fry and for a bowl of coco pops a bit crazy if you ask me there was no electricity in our room from about half monday night until we were leaving tuesday morning had to use a light on our phone to shower and go to the toilet we were woken up to building out the back too tuesday morning and you could also hear everything happening out in the hall as the doors do seem too sound proof poor stay overall,0.0
booked at this hotel early for my stay arrived and found this hotel just great in the middle for everything close to shopping bars etc the rooms was great and clean good bar with shows you can buy breakfast at the hotel recommended,1.0
andronis athens is not really a hotel per se it consists of only rooms which i was completely aware of at the time of booking we booked an acropolis view room which i not sure was the best room for us the acropolis view suite is on the top floor and consists of levels with the bedroom being on the top level accessible by a very steep spiral staircase even though my husband and i are both very fit and work out all the time the stairs were a pain not to mention pretty dangerous if needing to get up in the middle of the night or if one had had one too many cocktails the top floor location also made cooling it very difficult granted the temperatures in athens were in the but we had to close the curtains and keep the air on all day to ensure it was cool enough at the end of the day the staff was wonderful and the lack of lobby was fine given there was a charming cafe on the ground floor that was open all the time breakfast was included and customizable and was a highlight of our stay,1.0
the ibis was in a perfect location close to everything trains canal ferries eateries and red light district and busy with bike and tourists hotel we had a view of the canals on the amsterdam side and bikes bikes everywhere which was gorgeous gave the room a really amsterdam feel the room was a good size the bathroom was a little small but clean so that all that mattered to recommend this hotel easy to get anyway,1.0
the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,0.0
the hotel itself has a good centralized location and is within walking distance of anything you want to see in downtown barcelona the rooms were clean and very modern the front desk staff were truly the best lucia and marc were both incredibly helpful and gave fantastic recommendations for things to do and places to eat,1.0
rooms are great but the airconditioning never worked properly the restaurant views are superb and the reception staff were exceptional and extremely helpful we had dinner one night the food was not great but the fried feta starter was superb,1.0
stayed here for nights at beginning of july check was quick and efficient and staff were lovely you get handed a discount voucher for tea and coffee at the bar as there is the facilities in the room the garden is lovely and very calm we found it nice to just sit down in the garden and relax after a day of exploring hotel is in a great location walked everywhere from the hotel and is definitely reasonable distance to everything however if you struggle to walk for periods of time then the tram is outside the hotel which is great for getting back to central and then the aiport rooms were a decent size all it needed for is sleep as we were out all day so was perfect for us would definitely recommend and stay again in the future,1.0
i have stayed at this hotel twice in the past months early june and late july why did i return because i had a good experience in june because of the hotel location and because of its value for having said that the experience in late july was not as good why is that because the hotel is a victim of it neighborhood there is a sports bar right next door when folks leave there invariably drunk they are extraordinarily noisy they are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood then there the homeless in a churchyard across the street they have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter the police come remove them and they back within an hour then the trucks come to make deliveries around am with back up beepers and running engines the tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning the staff work extremely hard and they are terrific frankly they do deserve this constant barrage on their efforts my room was an adequate size it was spotless the bathroom and shower were very good daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere so should you stay here yes just get a room in the back of the hotel,1.0
we spent two nights here at the beginning of july after flying in from the usa the location is close enough to the center of dublin which can be reached by about a minute walk along the river or by taking the light rail system luas which takes you along the north side of the river to many sights a great staff and modern hotel facility i would stay here again when back in dublin it is a great value for the euro,1.0
roof top bar is a must fantastic breakfast and rooms are stunning views are best in athens i would think location is pretty central and staff and very helpful additional drinks and food are expensive,1.0
we are marriott people so for our first visit to amsterdam it was going to be a marriott hotel we could decide between the marriott in the city center or the renaissance i read all the trip advisor reviews finally we chose the renaissance and i am so glad we did the location is just great we walked to the anne frank house and to the canal boat ride the management and staff were just top notch we were celebrating a wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a wonderful suite the royal suite i think it was room ask for it the club lounge was great the restaurant for breakfast was great ca say enough about how we enjoyed this marriott property,1.0

i stayed here again while on a business trip it did disappoint nice large clean room and extensive menus bar and reception staff most helpful will be back for sure ideally located close to bus routes and city center,1.0
a gem in one of athens best neighborhoods on a quiet street a great location on the foot of mount lycabettus with breath taking views of athens the acropolis the city all the way to the agean minutes away from kolonaki square and great shopping less than minutes from syntagma square and within walking distance to monastiraki and the heart of athens a boutique hotel that i would say caters to the eclectic customers who want it all but without the hustle and bustle of the noisy city sights the staff is most pleasant and accommodating the restaurant lovely as is the pool area on the roof top,1.0
the muse amsterdam is well located it is on a quiet street but close to many museums and the rest of amsterdam is easily accessible via the nearby tram routes we had two rooms during our five night stay and the comfort double was quite adequate in terms of size if you plan to be out and about most of the day the hotel service was outstanding they helped with many questions regarding museum tickets and arranged a rental car for us we also enjoyed the availability of coffee tea and cold drinks at no charge hours per day we would stay there again,1.0
we stayed here for just nights at the tail end of our holiday the hotel is in a superb location within easy walking distance of most of the major sites and in the lovely plaka district fantastic view of the acropolis from the rooftop pool it a bit more luxurious than we used to but we chose it mainly for the location and with the idea of treating ourselves before going building is very nice and quite understated with a lovely garden area for breakfast complete with marauding turtle doves an interesting change from the usual pigeons our floor room was fine with a great view from the balcony and for the sunset breakfast was very good with something for everyone service was universally excellent and the staff were very friendly and extremely we arrived our fridge was working but was replaced first thing the next day i was surprised that the bed was more comfortable far too soft for my liking and probably could do with replacing the bathroom was very nice though the decor a bit over the in all a fine choice for a short stay and in the nicest part of the city i think it quite expensive for what it is but one probably paying for the location,1.0
after reading other reviews we decided that ariel house would be a good place for our night stay upon arrival in ireland it was a bit longer walk into dublin town center than expected about minutes and we are not slow walkers however we enjoyed the stroll on several occasions light outside until pm in june and the quiet stay away from the noise and activity of downtown our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean despite the older bedroom carpet and decor a highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room traditional eggs benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads muffins fruit juice cereals coffee and tea we also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee tea with china cups saucers and mini cake bites there was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at dublin airport we did not use the car while in dublin but did not want to spend time obtaining it before starting our ireland road trip on day there is a steep staircase to reach the front door so do pack light,1.0
my husband and i have just returned from nights at this hotel is in a perfect location right in the centre but rooms really quiet so a peaceful oasis staff were excellent efficient but available a special mention to camile at the front desk sorry if i have spelt that wrong he helped a scottish woman with boarding passes the housekeeping was excellent rooms were spotless the rooftop chill out area was lovely breakfast was fabulous with a great selection to suit everyone and the service was great was not a cheap break for us but flying from scotland never is but we felt it was worth every penny should be proud of their staff,1.0

this hotel is in the middle of downtown just above the action that means that if you go in a weekend night you wo get to sleep unless you wear the earplugs that the hotel provides for you but honestly they do not serve much the view from our room was to the air condition machinery another noise to add when we checkin we were offer a room with air conditioning even that in dublin does go over the with an over price of euros so we said no that s what we got staff is friendly and the room was clean the location is very good you only have to put to the noise level at weekend nights,0.0
this hotel met our expectations and more from check and an orientation conversation with noah to the niceties of sangria bottled water and chocolates in the rooms we just loved this hotel we joined the hotel chain club because if this is how they all are we are definitely staying we had beverages and snacks when we checked in and they were always there when we came back from exploring it is a great location for shopping touring and hopping on and off the tour buses we will definitely go back,1.0
very mediocre hotel with a location carpet in the rooms reeks of old cigarettes and vommit the only person was the receptionist ala carte menu was a total disaster the worst food we ever experienced i greece disgusting house red wine we looked forward to a quiet night at the roof garden wich was ok with some food and a caraffel house wine and ended up speechless over the lack of quality and service,0.0
we stayed here on monday check in was friendly and professional and our executive room was clean bright spacious and super were heading on to galway the next day so we did want to venture far and decided on drinks at the hotel bar there was a nice selection of beer however cocktails are seriously overpriced for the standard they come i ordered a raspberry mojito was was nearly with barely any raspberry muddled through it and just tasted of rum and soda you can get drinks far better and much cheaper in the city we also realised there was no music playing which made for a really strange atmosphere as there was many people in the lounge so we could all hear each other decision was head to head over to the bridge bar across the road and it was great good drinks and good fun came back and we ordered a room service beef lasagne which was served really hot and tasted great the night porter was really helpful that the herbert served its purpose for us as a stop off point i would really recommend it to couples although i would to families and business user,1.0
was very pleasantly surprised at this beautiful hotel it so spacious and rooms are very generous in size the staff were just lovely and very welcoming breakfast was included in our stay and there was plenty of it will definitely stay here again and on the plus side you are within walking distance to shops temple bar etc highly recommend it,1.0
stayed in this hotel before flying out the next morning it was convenient to the airport and had a shuttle service we took advantage of the shuttle by returning our rental that evening and taking the free shuttle back to the hotel the ride to the airport the next morning was euro per person so well worth the convenience the room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast in the morning was pretty good no complaints and would stay here again,1.0
four weary travelers walked into the marker and somehow in an instant we perked up while the complimentary coffee in the lobby helped it was the exceptional service and friendly staff that made the first impression our group arrived early and barry the concierge invited us to a tour of the area the director of sales roisin and director of revenue catriona took time out of their busy day showed us around shared the area history and dropped us off at the ferryman pub as we kindly requested just had to start off our trip with a guinness we are extra thankful to them other things about the marker they have an afternoon candy bar a eucalyptus steam room comfortable beds a rooftop bar and they are if i could i would live there,1.0
this was my first trip to barcelona the hotel is right about on diagnol ave so the location is phenomenal it within walking distance to a lot of restaurants nightlife near the train rail etc the front desk staff were very helpful and found them to be more helpful than the concierge throughout my stay the rooms are nice clean and modern especially the bathroom the only confusing part for me is that there are two hiltons the hilton barcelona and the hilton diagnol so if you do speak spanish like me very well make sure you show your taxi driver the address of the hotel so they take you to the right one,1.0
had a fantastic stay here the hotel was plush and had very high standards we ate out mostly but had breakfast and room service and were very happy with quality would have no hesitation in returning or recommending great night life,1.0
we wanted a hotel with a pool and by the time we booked within about a month before we arrived there was many but we got a fairly cheap deal for such a nice hotel it very minimalistic and spacey as soon as you walk in the room was so lovely and we had a cracking view from the wee balcony iv seen reviews complain about the balcony size that you ca get a chair out but there is the rooftop bar so it not even a problem bathroom is big and plenty room to unpack and put suitcases the beds were changed everyday extremely comfy great duvets and pillows the rooftop views were amazing the pool was small but fine enough to cool down in the only thing i would say is more sun loungers i do know if it a health and safety thing tho the pool opens at and if you want a spot all day on a lounger get there at folk were lying on the patios the bar food is fine not much choice the underground and main rail station literally across the road a minute walk would definitely stay here again if i came back to barca,1.0
stayed long weekend wit my wife nice tidy clean hotel reception staff very helpful and pleasant situated just out the way so nice and quiet but within easy reach of everything used taxis as opposed to public transport very cheap there is a opposite the hotel which is great value and the staff are brilliant very spanish full of locals try it only complaint we had a ground floor room which was quite claustrophobic and dark no view other than a brick wall from the window otherwise the room was fine but if i was there any longer i would have asked to move all in all well worth the money and i would stay there again,1.0

being a mandarin it is typically very pretty great service clean and very high end it is located in a great area rooms are very nice and large for europe breakfast is worth the price rooftop bar is very nice dipping pool is pretty but really should be a real pool instead of what it is view in the back of hotel is nice at all service very good and food choices good as well overall a very nice high end hotel but i would say a better business hotel rather than a vacation type hotel but if you can afford it it is very nice,1.0
we stayed at divani caravel during our stay in athens this is a star hotel and had all the amenities you would expect from a star hotel the customer service was great they helped us with all of our requests the hotel is a minute walk to metro also there are lots of cabs parked outside the hotel mount lycabetus is an minute drive from the hotel and the acropolis is metro stops away we did try the food at the restaurants so i ca comment on that,1.0

my mother and i stayed at your hotel last week and overall it was a dreadful it was described on as a quiet haven it is not for a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet we arrived tired and hungry at later than planned due to travel delays we were told the restaurant was closing even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until the receptionist who greeted us in a rather cold and manner called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open so we rushed through to the restaurant the waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley but he did start the conversation by saying oh the chef is gon na be pissed off grab a table and order quickly the food was not good we had booked a twin room that according to the photos on had two small double beds on arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite however the suite was a room on the ground floor at the front of the hotel next to the busy car park it was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed it was noisy and depressing my mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking i went back to reception to query the,0.0

literally just returned from my stay here it was a lovely experience with polite staff good service stunning food and a decent room the wet rooms were lovely i genuinely enjoyed my stay a few minor issues which took away the star rating for me cleaning was certainly a bit of an issue there was a great deal of dust on the floors and behind the beds furthermore the room was cleaned at various times of day all very inconsistently which meant that the room was ready when necessarily wanted my last niggle comes from the prices the rooms are certainly a little over priced and the spirit prices were extortionate nevertheless it was a thoroughly enjoyed stay,1.0

we spent two nights at the o b athens boutique hotel upon arriving in athens and then one more night before heading back home both times we were contacted by email before our arrival asking if they could help organize our transfers from the airport we said yes and we had a taxi driver waiting for us at the airport with the name of our party on a sign the hotel also arranged our transfers from the hotel to the airport note that it about a minutes ride to get to and from the airport upon leaving after our second stay the taxi showed up late and the hotel apologized and said that the euros transfer fee would be on them this was much arrival staff quickly brought each and everyone of us a large glass of cold water we also received a plate of hors and drinks in our room right after our luggage was brought up the hotel itself is clean breakfast is tasty and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable we had a room for four and it was quite large the bathroom was also very large and impeccably clean the hotel is conveniently located close enough to the major attractions that you can walk there in minutes depending on where you are going but at the same time just far enough to be out of the tourist zone it location on the edge of the psirri neighborhood makes it a perfect place to be within,1.0

brand new hotel the room especially the shower was great you do get tons of street noise but just learned to turn it off i would suggest some type of guide in the room to explains things like that the lights outlets work after you put your key into the slot above the switches there are no ice or vending machines and that is apparently standard in europe that there are no washcloths you have to ask for one at the desk and there is no business center who knew great central location but suggestions for food etc should also be in the room guide would stay again staff was very helpful,1.0

i traveled with my mother to amsterdam for a long weekend to visit keukenhof as an early mother day gift and decided to stay at the ic for it large rooms indoor pool and waterfront location no other luxury hotel in amsterdam offers that combination service is impeccable we arrived before time on a flight from chicago and were warmly welcomed by the manager and staff they apologized for not having a canal view room for us but made sure to accommodate my preferences of high floor away from elevator indeed we were assigned a top floor room at the corner of the building and in the wing that was not covered in scaffolding our room was incredibly spacious for a standard room in a european hotel the decor is very old fashioned but well maintained and luxurious there were spacious closets windows that could be opened and plenty of space for my mother and i to relax although we were on the courtyard side of the hotel we could still see a canal from our windows so that was a nice surprise the bathroom was also old fashioned but undeniably luxurious having a separated wc was essential in choosing the ic the separate shower in our bathroom had natural light also despite the age of the hotel i was impressed by the condition and features especially the rain shower the only disappointment was the lack of handy electric we first got to our room we noticed that one of,1.0
the best thing about this hotel was the location just a few blocks from la sagrada familia and one block from saint pau hospital a lot of cafes bakeries restaurants and mini markets around the hotel itself is just ok but not very comfortable and extremely noisy possible to hear people talking flushing toilets and having a shower in the other rooms at all hours beds and pillows could be better too no places to put the suitcases at all lights are really weak in the room shower has good pressure but it not well built the bathroom completely floods after a shower as there no door also the bathroom ceiling was moldy and the exhaust fan had a lot of lint and dust which flew around while it was on the staff at the reception was polite not very friendly but one of the ladies was very helpful,1.0
we had a quad room which was a good size considering there were of us shower could be improved attention to detail needed in rooms as we had coffee milk and sugar but no tea one of the cups was cracked which we then threw away as it got washed up and put back breakfast was do think the morning chef was well trained restaurant staff also need training when you refill a dish you do put a dirty spoon back in good selection also had dinner in the hotel which was good and we thoroughly enjoyed the irish night we went to,1.0

this is a very nice hotel in the price epicenter of amsterdam we relocated here from another hotel so we could be in the center of the city a relative value compared to other us style hotels at the same week we traveled only thing holding back rating was internet app for booking simply did not work once on phone in europe had we not physically walked into hotel we could not have booked once inside people were very friendly but check in desk was very disorganized no clear lines lead to people cutting ahead of one another at busy time not a huge issue but something we did not expexect at a luxury hotel still highly recommend it,1.0

positives are the hotel is very close to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum a minute walk will also take you to the temple of zeus and the stadium the plaka is a min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of athens at the end if the plaka you will find the ancient agora the acropolis metro is only a min walk that will take you to other parts of athens the beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to deg we had this for three days there is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee you have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so breakfast is rather tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm now fermenting the fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice coffee was via a nescafé vending machine tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from at least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you wo get a good night rest the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in athens you might want to,1.0

down a side street off the la rambla this hotel is in the middle of everything the port is min walk away the gothic quarter another minutes in the opposite direction lots of restaurants around it is noisy at night but that the price you pay for staying in such a central area the staff were quite brusque we were not told about needing to use the room key to activate the lift or about needing to show your room card with the room number on at breakfast in the morning but we did discover a sign in the lift telling us about it half way through our stay the hotel itself is clean the room was a decent size with a balcony air conditioning safe the bed was comfortable the only thing was there was one very thin pillow for each person the bathroom was another matter again very clean but there is no door to the shower which means the floor gets soaking wet each time and you end up using the towels to soak up the water breakfast selection was average cold ham and cheese bacon and frankfurter sausages the usual pastries,1.0
what a wonderful location in athens the room was fine the breakfast was outstanding and the hotel staff is top notch our room was with no view the bathroom was very nice the air conditioner cooled our room down quickly athens was really hot and we need the cool room the top deck view can not be out done,1.0

the hotel is based in a good location near some great local coffee shops cafe and food restaurants a little bit of a travel from the main areas in amsterdam but cabs are too expensive the staff were a little poor to accommodate certain needs such as rooms together with extra bed etc as it was a group of people however great hotel and rooms were nice clean,1.0
this hotel is located in an up and coming area that will be really busy in a couple years the hotel just got here first and is located outside central dublin hotel is ultra modern and meticulously clean we arrived here early prior to a structured tour we are not sorry we stayed here despite other reviews we did not notice any construction noise they have a bar and restaurant which have items moderately priced the good point is that the dublin light rail system literally is at the front door this makes it easy to go into central dublin for meals and attractions rooms are especially large with lots of room to spread out and not trip over everything,1.0
we stayed at divani caravel during our stay in athens this is a star hotel and had all the amenities you would expect from a star hotel the customer service was great they helped us with all of our requests the hotel is a minute walk to metro also there are lots of cabs parked outside the hotel mount lycabetus is an minute drive from the hotel and the acropolis is metro stops away we did try the food at the restaurants so i ca comment on that,1.0

we were at this hotel for nights the outside is clean and tidy but may put you off seeing the building like an office block or an old block of flats but inside this hotel was very modern lovely place to stay the beds were very comfy if you do want to be anywhere noisy this is a great location right outside the hotel is a tram stop and you can go all the way to central station passing a lot of good places if you want to go another direction there is another tram just the other side of the tropen museum next door to the hotel and that takes you to all of the other good places buying a travel pass is definatly a must to save money on travel,1.0
this excellent hotel has a great location and a very helpful staff the swimming pool has an amazing view i wrote down my when i made the booking and the very friendly man who checked me in made a successful effort to make me happy someone else whose service stood out was the doorman alonso who gave me some good suggestions for exploring the area by foot on the night all the taxis in barcelona striked one suggestion for improvement i was not impressed by the quality of the food and coffee at the breakfast buffet,1.0

we did enjoyed the stay and we felt as home the staf is indeed first class they are worm and nice people and make you feel good and welkomed the hotel is indeed stars but only the bathrooms need an update in the days we stayed at blue sea hotel we started to love it and feel the pleasure of being well treated the site is good and quiet and away from noisy trafic the naiborhood is nice and cleen it has the beach close bolivar beach is amazing a must see i would have wanted more traditional products on feta cheez or original sweets or patiserie products i definetly recomend this place and for shure our next vacation will be at blue sea alimos,1.0
sure it been said before but it bears repeating hera hotel offers comfort friendly staff and attractive rooms but the overwhelming advantage is its location upon leaving the hotel you are within a minute walk to the acropolis museum not to be missed and minutes further to the acropolis itself this means of course that you can be at those attractions at any time of day and avoid crowds should you choose we were at the museum before and had the place virtually to ourselves also the hotel proximity to the plaka area is fortunate there are plenty of interesting shops cafés and restaurants nearby we hail from a big city so we know the value in convenience and ease in a neighborhood for us as residents and for our guests and the hera hotel offers that in spades i would stay there again in a heartbeat,1.0
perfect location for exploring barcelona and enjoying the gay nightlife staff were at every interaction room was clean and modern and there was a fabulous rooftop bar and pool the price was surprisingly fair for the experience our only complaint was too few electrical outlets in our room and none by the bed for phone charging,1.0
i totally agree with all the comments made by my friend sally we were three ladies who came to dublin to celebrate another friend special birthday the dergvale hotel made our visit to dublin even more special breakfast every morning was plentiful and my friend described the scrambled eggs as looking like soft yellow pillows would definitely recommend the dergvale hotel and would love to return,1.0

this is obviously not a cheap hotel but it is definitely worth the money the location of the hotel is great you are within walking distance of all the main city attractions the hotel rooms are modern and luxurious the grounds are beautiful and well kept and the staff was extremely helpful and welcoming the reception manager juan is an asset to this hotel it was almost am when we and we were very beyond hungry juan took the time to help us find a restaurant close by that was still open on a week night when we came back from dinner he offered us a free bottle of cava and desert to take to our room we would definitely stay here again and will continue to tell anyone we know to stay here,1.0

location the best thing with this hotel is the location walking distance to la rambla we also walked to the beach which took us about there are several restaurants close to the hotel the room big bright and comfortable a bit different design but we liked it big bed so we could all three sleep in it without a problem breakfast the only downside with this hotel the breakfast is simple and not worth the money there are cafes and restaurants nearby that you can easily go to even if the kids are so hungry that they ca wait pool small but great love the sunseats inside the pool they also give you a towel and it close to the gym the pool area also have an bar our old loved it and so did we unfortunately there is no view here what so greaaaaat helpful personal that speaks great english they will help you with everything you need and do it with a smile,1.0
the westbury hotel is a luxury hotel in the heart of dublin close to great restaurants pubs and tours the perfect location the beds were comfortable and the service a treat especially the delicious chocolate left on our pillows,1.0
myself and teenage daughter stayed for nights i can honestly say it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in and i travel with work so have stayed in many across europe the staff were polite attentive and helpful with every concern so much so that we were truly able to relax my daughter has a life threatening allergy so the reassurances at the restaurant were food at wyers was great and the breakfast was varied and perfectly cooked there is a lovely wine reception in the evenings and an outside courtyard with relaxing swing chairs that we staff had advice for making the most of the holiday and able to supply tickets van gogh museum and gvb transport in our case and they were genuinely interested in what you have enjoyed in amsterdam for example we were advised to take care from pickpockets in the built up tourist areas we were also given an umbrella on the one rainy day given it is a hotel most guests respected this both myself and my daughter were so sad to leave this wonderful home from home we hope to return,1.0

spent nights here in august most aspects were good the room and bathroom were clean and tidy the staff were welcoming the breakfast we ordered to our room was fantastic couple of things could have been better the room was not ready until despite check in being at and after a very early start this was frustrating the shower in the room could maintain its temperature and kept giving flashes of hot and cold this was at all times of the day as well on the plus side i asked the front desk for flowers for my fiancée birthday when i let them know they had not arrived they were good enough to bring them up straight away with complimentary champagne all in all good quality and a lovely stay,1.0
i stayed here in july and although the weather was kind the hotel was just perfect we arrived early and were able to check in with no problem what a delight considering the long flight we had the bed was extremely comfy and the curtains blacked out any light we had drinks in the craft beer bar which was a delight and the cocktails in lemeuls where amazing there was an australian chap on reception who was always cheerful and the tall young concierge i think was always there to help perfect location for a nice quiet sleep but close enough to some decent pubs and restaurants would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again,1.0
everything about this hotel exceeded my expectations the location is ideal for exploring walking distance to the gothic area the medieval synagogue in the jewish quarter markets las ramblas gaudi casa batlo fabulous restaurants cafes the big plaza and shopping on passeig de gracia the building beautifully renovated and chic breakfast superb and the room had all the comforts of home plus what really makes it special however is the amazing staff everyone from the front desk doormen bell hop and waiters to the manager went out of their way to be beyond helpful and genuinely kind during our four night stay if i am lucky enough to be in barcelona again i will definitely stay at the grand hotel central,1.0
i found the hotel to be beautiful and pretty and in a great location it was very clean and the room was quiet the staff were friendly and helpful i would definitely stay at the hotel again and highly recommend it,1.0
we stayed at this hotel for two nights with only one day to explore the hotel it was on first appearances very large and quite impersonal however the staff are very friendly and professional and the room was exceptionally well equipped large and cool we were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room you quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual smoked salmon freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals if you want a traditional english breakfast the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the where to eat at night if you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again you will see a sign for vassilios taverna it is worth a visit do be put off by the area the food there was very good and very reasonable rest on your first night if you are not sure where to exploring from the hotel we had a taxi to the acropolis at and it cost if you hold a student discount card nus extra use it most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about which was some saving we also used the tram back to the hotel and then back into,1.0

i stayed there for few days of a business meeting all in all i can say that i had a really good time in the hilton hotel athens i liked the pool area and the amazing view of the rooftop bar the price for a drink are not acceptable in my point of view rooms and floors are clean and quiet breakfast for an international hotel very good,1.0
we would recommend this hotel for the following location walking distance from the acropolis and the plaka the breakfast both rich and tasty plus the magnificent views of the the friendly the amenities of the room and its the we think it is reasonable priced as well,1.0
very close to very thing rooms are ok bathroom a little small breakfast was better than i though i would stay there again loved athens service was good and very freindly and helpful to good restaurants and shops,1.0
i spent two nights in this small hotel with my wife the location is good and bus stops to the city center very close as well as some shops and restaurants the room was ok but not more for example the air did change too well and the door had to be closed in order to prevent the fire alarm optic i guess from going on the breakfast was good enough but nothing special the carpets in the corridors were worn out and quite shabby parking provided for no extra fee no working in our room and the next building about meters from our window no view,0.0
hubby and l stayed here nights location is superb staff were friendly and quite helpful dealing with our missed baggage breakfast is on the rooftop with views of the acropolis decent selection of food choices cereals cold cuts fruit yoghurt eggs bacon and potatoes and sweet pastry good enough for us had the rooms been modernised we would have rated it higher but l know other cruise travellers stayed at much higher rated hotels and were not in such a great location and felt less inclined to wander out at night we hsd no problem with that being so central a short walk to hop bus shopping cafes and restaurants the plaka district etc,1.0
stunning hotel very friendly staff and really accommodating had a standard room which was cleaned daily with fresh bedding and refill of coffee great location away from the busy centre but not to far to just jump a bus into central station amsterdam i have fell in love with i will return and back to this beautiful hotel,1.0
i just returned from a stay at the el palace hotel i was most impressed with the staff who truly tried their best to make our stay enjoyable my favorite was amal from guest who went out of her way each and every day she worked during our stay to ensure our stay was perfect and that all of our needs were met she was so very welcoming and warm and helpful amal helped to make our trip extra special i also so enjoyed guiseppe who works in the winter garden restaurant he was so friendly and enjoyable and made our dining experience fun,1.0
front desk a guy and a gal super hosts size of room incredible you could order strawberries or cordon blue chicken at no problem truly a nice experience breakfast was more than we expected very nice can not add or subtract from this fine property i dare you to try it,1.0
i am sorry i was unable to write a proper review on this hotel as i was ill when i was due to travel after advising reception staff i sent several e mails apologising for the disruption i had caused and suggested re booking later in the year however i never received any reply or response my booking organiser advised me that the hotel stated that my payment was non refundable and that was had not asked for a refund instead a rescheduling however the hotel has felt that it is perfectly acceptable to collect over euros and provide no service whatsoever feel hotels are supposed to be hospitable and friendly i feel this one has shown neither and i would strongly recommend that you check all terms and conditions if considering a visit,0.0
this is a beautiful hotel in a unique canal house in amsterdam the room was gorgeously appointed and luxurious and perfect to treat myself to location was perfect and there are plenty of excellent restaurants within walking to the best part the staff were wonderful and unfailingly enthusiastic and friendly if you are not the blessed of the population to have your own butler and household staff and you would like to see what it feels like book a stay in the toren i never had to tell anyone my room number after the first day because everyone from the front desk to the barman to the housekeeping staff seemed to know who i was service was impeccable and always delivered with a smile book for the building stay for the service,1.0
we were a family of four spending one night in amsterdam before moving elsewhere the hotel was perfect for our needs when we arrived at around the hotel let us check in early which was most welcome as we had an early flight the room was a total hit with us and the kids comfortable spacious impeccably clean and different from your average hotel we used the top floor hot tub twice and were surprised that there was no one else availing of the facility the top floor has a fabulous vista over the city the hotel is so convenient for the underground which is just outside the hotel door there are reasonable places to eat close by the only slight downside we had was the hotel food which was overpriced for the quality of food received the continental breakfast was for two adults and two kids for a fairly basic buffet after coming back from a day the food offering is limited and expensive that said i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for its location and brilliant for a short stopover in the but eat elsewhere,1.0
our family only had nights in ireland and the clontarf castle was a great choice the rooms were great the atmosphere was stunning and the food in the restaurant was awesome even our kids who are picky eaters found food they liked,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay here only regret was we did spend enough time relaxing by the pool as we were so busy exploring barcelona the room was very clean and comfortable great bed and it had a good size bathroom with excellent shower we caught the aerobus from the airport to the place de catalonia and then took a five minute walk across the square to the hotel the hotel is situated slightly away from the square so when you enter you escape the hustle and bustle of barcelona into a little oasis even the pool area feels quieter and calmer even when it busy personally i would have liked a bigger pool but it was fine for a gentle relaxing swim we had breakfast across the road at a great spanish cafe as we only wanted coffee and croissants so we did eat in the hotel overall a very enjoyable stay,1.0
stayed here for one night with my dad the hotel is really quirky and fun since we stayed there was any noise from partying or anything the club i the seventh floor was actually quite nice for a drink and enjoying the view the location is not bad four stops on the metro to the central station or a nice walk along the river the beds are on a raised platform so you sort of have to climb in there was only one stool and it was a twin room so there should have been two my only real grievance is that the breakfast is far too expensive if you walk one block towards city centre you find the breakfast club which serves a great breakfast for a better price after paying good money for your room it feels strange to pay more for the hotel breakfast than you would at a restaurant,1.0
very stylish hotel in the heart of the city of dublin the different attached buildings are a little confusing and distracting rooms very nice and roomy staff was a little mixed up at times which shocked me for a high end hotel,1.0
we stayed for nights in july staff are very helpful gave great advice about where to eat and allowed us to store our baggage after we had checked out easy walking distance of the acropolis markets and restaurants breakfast served on a rooftop terrace with top views of the parthenon and you can take food and drink up there during the day rooms are small but clean and well appointed if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs to block out the local church bells at night overall great value,1.0
excellent hotel in an excellent central location in dublin professional polite and welcoming staff both on reception and in the dining area very clean room comfortable bed and high standard furnishings probably the best breakfast i have enjoyed in a hotel the full irish breakfast was hearty and set me up for the day,1.0
if you want to hear music loudly until early hours of every morning temple bar inn hotel is the place for you i am not that kind of music fan so i was really disappointed about the noise that came to the room from bars in this building and around the fleet street i have to say that the location of this hotel is great near shopping areas and hotel staff is doing good work but those are all the positive sides of staying room where we stayed nights was really basic and small it even lacked elements like soap tray in the shower and hangers for jackets that we had to ask separetly there were no ventillation so you had to open windows for fresh air to come in and after opening the rhythm of bass drums was even louder until or of this can be experienced in budget style hotels but not in hotels that cost over euros per night my advice is to go somewhere else if you are not wealthy bass drum rhythm lover,1.0
top quality hotel within walking distance or uber of main sights but in a pleasant quiet upscale neighborhood fantastic restaurants nearby frequented by locals hotel has gorgeous city views and is perched on a canal beautiful peaceful patio restaurant and bar right on the canal you can take a vacation from your vacation perfect place to relax after being around the tourist hustle and bustle exec package provides full breakfast and city view lounge with open bar and canapés in evening perfect,1.0
the hotel is decent but it definitely does meet the hotel is pretty close to the lesseps metro station but you need to be aware that you need to climb a pretty steep hill from the station to the staff is friendly and the rooms are clean although the furniture is quite old and totally did like the fact that the hotel canceled my reservation with just hours before i arrived because they were unable to book the reservation payment from my credit card they sent me a message while i was traveling in the plane but i only found out about it when i arrived at the hotel i was lucky that nobody else booked the room before i arrived,1.0
we had a suite or club room facing the city which was superb the staff were excellent and the choc chip cookie on arrival was a nice touch the hotel is in a fantastic spot within easy walking to everything my only criticism was that our toilet was unclean and obviously had not been touched when the room was cleaned from the previous resident all in all a great stay,1.0
being greeted by a computer rather than a person was something new for me and i have to say that i did really like it particularly when i came to and i found that computer had charged me for four breakfasts instead of two something to do with single occupancy of a double room i gather or at least that was what i was told by a friendly human who had to sort out the muddle the computer had caused other thing was the this was not working when i arrived at the hotel which was pretty irritating as i had work to do i called down to reception no answer after calling twice and allowing to ring for in excess of minutes each time i went down to reception to find one poor member of staff trying to deal with about no etc feeling it was a bit unfair to burden her with more issues i asked to speak to the manager and was told that there was no manager available furthermore the hotel had no idea when the would be working again and apparently the service was nothing to do with the hotel anyway as it was provided by a and was a service that the hotel could choose whether to provide or not which i disputed as the hotel advertises free and i would have stayed there if it did have it above rather marred my visit which was a shame as otherwise the hotel and staff,0.0
loved our trip to greece and staying at the grand polis hotel we did get to eat at the rooftop restaurant but wish we had the rooms were tidy and clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful when we needed tips on how to get around the hotel is centrally located to so many things and not to far from the acropolis i hope you enjoy it as we did,1.0
the staff was friendly and very helpful our room was clean elegantly decorated and we loved having a big window overlooking the street and canal getting free bikes the first day was lots of fun we definitely come back,1.0
the hotel is ideal for using the metro we found it very easy to get around one complaint was a stain on the carpet which was a little off putting but i am very fussy and the rest of the hotel was immaculate the staff are so friendly we arrived at the hotel over hours before check in but they allowed us into our room early which literally made my day i would hesitate to stay again,1.0
we had a wonderful time at the ohla eixample the service was outstanding our room was spacious the bed was super comfortable the bathroom was large and the shower was awesome we loved the rooftop pool and how peaceful it was great location would definitely return,1.0
we loved our nights in athens at airotel alexandros the room was comfortable ac worked very well unlike some european hotels breakfast was amazing walking distance to metro we felt like we were coming home to our athens family each night the front staff in the were not only accommodating but so fun to chat with if we are ever fortunate enough to come to athens again we will be staying here,1.0
room is ok but restroom is worst no words to describe total nasty and no shower head and water in every experiance and not worthy at all for what we at any cost to check single rooms somewhere,0.0
stay was great close to everything wish you guys had onsite parking however i understand that not always possible reception staff outstanding reception staff deal with some incredibly rude patrons while i was staying at the hotel i witnessed some very unreasonable patrons your staff members have the patience of a saint always trying to accommodate the most unreasonable demands thank you,1.0
when u enter the hotel u greeted by the most friendly reception team with the glass of cava what a treat the room was lovely and the was really really nice thank u i think the hotel only been open recently when we did visit back in october last year the pool on the top floor with the view was very very nice,1.0
the hotel is located a bit north of athens in a nice residential area you are located far away of the touristic center so you get more i touch with the area seemed us very safe in the center of nea erithtrea some min by feet you find both local taverns and sophisticated restaurants by taxi it takes about to go to kifissià about min later you are downtown athens the advantage staying a bit outside is that the place is located a bit higher and so it is much fresher than in the lower you are sensitive to noise you should consider that the hotel is near to a street with plenty of traffic so you can not sleep with open windows but the noise is drasticly reduced with closed windows,1.0
the location is non descript but near to the station which was easy to get into amsterdam central über is great in amsterdam also the room was bit of charm with decorations but also strange shape it was a little stuffy and i did sleep well the front desk staff were friendly enough the gym is useless do bother unless you like to work out in a small basement i paid around without breakfast and would not consider it amazing value,1.0

we had such fine memories from this hotel with its location and lovely staffs with their excellent helps for sightseeing easy access for many sightseein like red light maddam tousu museum royal palace rabrant square with a short walk and bus stop is next to the hotel racheal is one of the staff in reception who accepts guest with her nice smile it is really more than a star hotel for its safety because we should use key card and just residents of the hotel can enter the hotel the hotel is very clean u can drink complimentary tasty water in lobby which refresh u after coming back to hotel a full breakfast in its restaurant makes ur day the view of our room was perfect the glassy chairs coordinate the room and u feel a bigger room the wash room was very clean and suitable about months ago we had reserved de roode amsterdam hotel for this trip but weeks before the trip i checked trip advisor about this hotel and i read the views of guests who were dissatisfied of de roode hotel because of its renovation without information to their guests and they had too many trouble with their stay in de roode hotel as we were walking in the street suddenly we saw this hotel which was in rebuild and just lamp were lights on and they had opened a small door for their probable guests i think the views of guests in each hotel can,1.0
we did a tour of the uk along with edinburgh and london and stayed at hiex in all three locations this was our favorite centrally located clean great staff large room with room to move around loved the fact that not only was there ample room at the end of our beds to move around there was a little alcove with a narrow closet a safe and a table for things or your suitcase some reviews have complained about lack of space for putting things but our room had a that ran all along the window wall that we found was great for nearly everything we had we folded our clothes into neat piles and put our purchases there as well and used it to sit we are not travelers who need drawers in fact we prefer to not use drawers as things may be left behind easier to see it and pack it hooks on two walls for coats bathroom was huge the only complaint there was we could not figure out how to let the water out of the sink as we could not find a lever to open the drain took five minutes to understand one simply had to push on it to open or shut it eating area is clean and spacious options pretty much uk holiday inn ex standard eggs bacon beans cereals breads fruit beverages good enough to start the day area also clean and the whole place is modern desk staff are wonderful,1.0
currently staying in one of the the rooms and very impressed excellent value pool is just right and bar food and drinks are good standard staff are all very good and professional and friendly too beach is literally two mins away seconds if you run min walk to the town with some really nice places to eat tram is about min away which is great although the buses seem quicker greek driving i think breakfast is really very good value good selection of hot and cold and all sorts cleanest hotel i been to for a while and i been to a few with work there a bus stop outside the front of the hotel worth looking into for the airport run otherwise expect to pay over for a taxi we did felt robbed although on a main road the hotel is accessed via a quiet side road and the beach is out the back over another not too busy road really it fine out of town about min on a tram but if you want out of town then book it,1.0

possibly one of my favourite hotels to date i could compare this to a boutique hotel only for the staff and knowledge of the concierge are second to none breakfast although for some was inadequate was for us perfect not over love the al a carte aspect of this and could not yes it but what you get for your money is justified in the area if you are willing to pay for a star hotel then expect nothing less than the service and facilities you receive for relatively new hotel the experience is seamless and well worth its star the rooms are beautiful the linen immaculate and cleanliness superb if you like the finer things in life please stay here location is fantastic and staff are helpful to say the least,1.0
we loved every minute at the corner hotel the staff was amazing friendly attentive and willing to help vanessa from the bar and breakfast area was very sweet the front desk staff was very helpful and made a reservation for us for dinner at a really great spot restaurant the decor is stunning the pool area is lovely but they really need umbrellas the drinks and breakfast were delicious everything is so stylish and clean i would recommend this hotel to everyone,1.0
extremely noisy unable to sleep in the new part of the hotel due to a bar that stays open until that the hotel do not own staff very polite service exceptional shame you just can not sleep in the building no decent water pressure in shower towels are not like the thin type dinner old part of hotel do seem star and were the extension that seems to be poor the shame is the staff seem to know of the issues and so were unreservedly apologetic the cab drivers know about this place problems the senior management should not be selling rooms near the bar unless warning people or heavily should not be charging for these rooms,0.0
what a great hotel the room was incredibly clean with a very nice and modern bathroom the service at the bar was great darren was a great laugh and made sure we were well taken care of all night we were thrilled to see him in the dining room the next morning taking care of breakfast the location is spot on close to everything and anything you would want to see in the city,1.0
great revamped hotel in good location and excellent value for money room was huge with seperate lounge nice sized bathroom but just a shower and no bath room was quiet free wifi decent breakfast well worth a visit,1.0

my boyfriend and i stayed here on july the for nights we arrived at the hotel around after getting a taxi from the airport as the shuttle bus was available for another hour or so it was only a minute drive from schipol and only a minute tram ride into the centre so the location was were aware that check in time was so we were expecting a room straight away however when we arrived the receptionist offered us a change of room to one that was already ready but it was a twin instead of a double we thought this was the best option so we took her advice the room was very spacious and modern and the beds were very big and so comfortable they were also pushed together and it was a lovely room to come back to after a long day of walking around the centre of staff were very friendly and keen to meet the needs of their customers they also offer bikes to their customers to rent which was a fantastic idea and cheap for what it was therefore i would definitely recommend to anyone staying to spend the day in rembrandt park just outside of the hotel on these also offer a euro drink voucher to spend in the skybar in exchange for having your room tidied we were interested in having a drink on floor so we were definitely for this offer the bar was very relaxing and they had lots of,1.0
this hotel was located in a perfect place on the main street of laietana near the waterfront one block and you are in the heart of the gothic district and across the street is the area for best restaurants where local dine the front desk staff were particularly helpful for a first time visitor to barcelona the room was quiet with comfortable beds,1.0
a great place to stay in a fantastic location staff are really helpful special mention for christina at reception who was very helpful and patient in sorting out some tickets and giving lots of useful advice for places to visit and routes around the city breakfast was excellent and well worth paying for as an extra when you arrive cheaper to pay at the were only small niggles with the rooms the twin room had loads of space and a fantastic wet room but there was no light reported to reception but not fixed during our stay the second room was on the floor and was a double but was noticeably smaller there was a very strong smell of drains or something similar in the room which was made worse when the air conditioning was on the smell was present on the last couple of days on the floor in general and not just in the room the smell was less noticeable with the off and the window left open the shower was over the bath which was very slow to drain away and the cleaner started leaving the plug out of the bath spotlessly clean room everyday neither issue would stop us returning as the staff are great the building is really funky and it is in a great location with some good local bars within minutes walk for great food and hotel has a luggage room which we were able to use on our last day which was,1.0
needed a for coldplay concert and saw leeson inn on for just under for night the fotos looked good and felt that for the price it must be good the reality was a dirty hole damp walls black spot all over curtains dirty brown carpet with car mats strategically covering stains badly broken glass in front window that permanently rattled noise from street all night the beds never seen a bed arrangement like it i could go on but could give the place any more airtime i would say that if you had a big smelly dog and needed to stay in an inn this would be the one as it has the ambiance of a dog kennel,0.0
my boyfriend and i stayed at the cotton house for two nights at the end of our trip to spain not only is it decorated impeccably but the building itself is a work of art and i really appreciate how the hotel focused the design around the architecture instead of trying to change the building to fit their intended design the bar area on the patio is lovely and a welcome reprieve from the busy city as is the roof top pool i loved this hotel and hope to stay here again the next time i in barcelona,1.0
the staff were all great especially the barman who helped us organise a drinks party for our daughter he could have been more helpful he chilled the wine we brought with us in his fridge and provided glasses and ice buckets we would also recommend the breakfast,1.0
this is not an easy review because there are pros about this place although i would choose to stay here again it is dated but clean it is in a very convenient area where you can walk to most everything with the farthest location being minutes guinness tour st stephens zoo graftin street trinity college etc i felt like it was too expensive for the room we had a triple room two adults and two kids and it was small a bit hot and right above the bar the tram goes by on abbey st which was too bad but in the end it is worth what we paid,1.0
i booked this hotel as an early birthday present for my boyfriend and was really worried because of the reviews we arrived at the hotel early and was able to keep our luggage there until our room was ready the staff were very lovely and helpful we was amazed with the room we got it was very clean and was a lovely spacious room we was on the top floor and had two balconies could fault the hotel at all we had the best trip and the hotel and room we had made it even better,1.0
this hotel is in a brilliany location for accessing and the main shopping square where you can easily pick up the tour bus and you be at the main sights in about mins the architecture of the hotel is beautiful and has a very gothic vibe but with a comfy modern bedroom the shower was heavenly and the little garden patio is incredibly peaceful and quaint i stayed for days and the staff were very friendly and efficient they organised my taxi to the airport which was about overall i would definitely stay here again just so convienient to everywhere but with a traditional barcelona vibe,1.0
i liked the style of the hotel modern and quirky i loved the possibility to personalise the room light intensity and colour of the light curtains and blinds from the ipad in the room which also had a good choice of tv channels radio station and recently released movies the really big bed was also a plus and the fact that there is food available really made the difference as i arrived at and very hungry i also liked the presence in the hall of a nice and quite area with apple computers wonderful addition for people like me who need a quiet corner to work not fully recommended if you looking for a hotel near the centre of the city or if you like spacious rooms,1.0
one night spent in dublin on business and in all respects the fitzwilliam hotel met expectations nothing would have been too much trouble to the helpful and friendly team if i had any suggestion for improvement it would be to provide a slightly less exclusive dining experience without the need to spoon cereal into breakfast bowls using silver the arrival experience could be tweaked as the desk is tucked away in the corner of the lobby while a tourist information desk is most prominent in the hotel entrance,1.0
we went there for a short break for my partners birthday there was a great communication from the airport to the hotel and to any other part of dublin via public service breakfast was amazing with a great variety of both cold and hot food staff were very helpful and would be always there to assist our room was spotless throughout our visit the only thing that could be improved was outside noise as we have had a front view room and we could hear outside noises overall i highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to visit dublin but does want to be right in the city centre,1.0

we spent four nights at hotel claris late february the property and the employees were wonderful the inside of the hotel and the rooms are all updated and modern the beds were extremely comfortable and with the roll down shutters you will find yourself sleeping later than you want we were able to walk everywhere including the sagrada familia the market and casa battlo there are coffee shops and restaurants very close by there is a rooftop bar and restaurant that is very nice we would stay there again if we return to barcelona,1.0

a very good hotel in an excellent location just off la rambla less than minutes from plaça de catalunya where the airport shuttle bus runs from the room we had was a reasonable size clean breakfast was a typical continental buffet with cold meats cheese bread cereal yoghurts excellent coffee a great way to start the day english language tv limited was limited to bbc world news but at least we got weather attractions including the beach zoo la pedrera barcelona gaudi la sagrada familia cathedrals are within reasonable walking distance if you enjoy walking park güell is a short bus journey from plaça de catalunya,1.0
classy full service hotel in athens greece clean rooms excellent service workout room spa rooftop bar and pool rooms are solid with comfy beds and nice and well functioning bathroom and appliances it appears all rooms have hardwoods or faux hardwood floors and no carpet to hid the nasties also all rooms appeared to me have a balcony and can support fresh air it reminded me of the classic and the which are among the two finest hotels i ever stayed,1.0
a lovely boutique hotel in a great location great service and a nice lower ground bar with a terrace onto the canal unfortunately one can not take drinks onto the room was small and up a steep traditional winding staircase but with very high end and modern fixtures and fittings,1.0
but right now a little dicey so the hotel is great the room classy and beautiful the staff professional and helpful this is going to be a real winner if it is like its sister hotels nearby but for now bar was dicey no real food options available and the car park was too far and too difficult now there was a great pub across the street and they did send me next door to their sister hotel bar which was very nice so it really is their fault just check to make sure the construction is done if you want things to be easier,1.0

a very good hotel with a quirky and quite hipster feel to it friendly staff and within a couple of hundred yards to the nearest metro which takes you to the city centre within a few minutes never tried the food in the hotel but had a drink at the bar which was ok hot tubs on the roof looked good but did go in as weather was a bit cold best part of the hotel for me was the chilled feel to it and our room although small was cosy and well worth the price would recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam and would visit again,1.0
we selected the electra metroplis based on the view on the website a stunning picture of the acropolis and wondered whether the reality would match the online pic so we were delighted when it did this hotel was spectacular from beginning to end a warm actually crisply welcome a spacious modern room and friendly service the rooftop bar and restaurant offered warm service and the spectacular view we did have reservations for dinner but were able to get a railside table on short notice the food at dinner was good but was light on vegetarian options the breakfast which was included in our rate was also erved on the rooftop we worried that it would be crowded but it never was the buffet offered something for everyone and omelettes were available on request the hotel is in the middle of the action close to the agora and other attractions we walked from the hotel to the parthenon easily and there are lots of cafes nearby word to wise the outside area is fertile territory for young thieves we had an iphone and wallet liberated as we dined but that has nothing to do with this beautiful hotel i loved it,1.0
tried this hotel when i amsterdam for a conference it happened to be my birthday when i checked in so they gave me a complimentary dinner which i though was a really nice gesture and nothing that i expected comfortable rooms the lounge is a bit small and breakfast in the lounge is basic not like in german hyatt where you can order hot food still quality was good despite not much choice evening hors were good restaurant was fusion location was is a quiet area not right in the centre but definitely walking distance would stay here again,1.0
what a star way to launch a trip to ireland beautiful hotel only outshadowed by their staff and customer service treat yourself to a stay and experience this wonderful property sit on the front patio and watch dubliners go by with a cold guiness or glass of wine or indulge and toast the town from the roof top bar with a spectacular view of the miss the marker already,1.0

there are two things i look for when picking a hotel location and bathroom cleanliness and then there is the worthiness of the price i would have to pay for that i say pol grace hit the it not in the center of town but the metro station is right on the same block have had visited barcelona already i was very happy with this location as it is situated in a cute residential area where i could walk with locals pet their dogs and just see the everyday unembellished shops restaurants and small parks but you are not in any way missing out of the goods there are quite a few restaurants near by that are really well rated and fully packed at night even with the metro near by we walked home from plaça de catalunya anyway on many occasions for staff were all very friendly the kind of friendliness you get from a friend who is hosting a dinner party so you feel welcomed as you walked size of the room and bathroom was in the goldilock zone and furnishing was well maintained we were very comfortable bedding was great towels were in great condition bathroom cleanliness was as expected really no complaints i just upload some pictures to reflect my words,1.0

we stayed for nights and from the moment we arrived we felt at home staff were wonderful rooms were comfortable yes it a bit dated but for the price you pay and for city hotel you vast complain location next to plaka and in walking distance to the acropolis and museums what more can you ask for will definitely be returning we stayed on the floor with views of the acropolis from our balcony,1.0
i loved the hotel i felt comfortable i wish the price was so high it just one night i mean i not staying forever i liked the people at reception they were efficient and nice they really cared about what i needed i paid cash and had to leave a euro deposit which i did enjoy i think it too much unnecessary since i prepaying the room,1.0
we stayed for a week in a floor superior room overlooking the temple of zeus the room was modern clean and spacious with a mini bar fridge and balcony the ensuite had a walk in shower with complimentary toiletries and slippers it was very hot while we were in athens so we were very grateful for the air conditioning the bed was comfortable but the road outside was very busy with the main noise from horns and motorbikes it did occasionally affect our sleep but in my opinion was worth it for the hotel is in an excellent central location within easy walking distance of all the main rooftop has excellent views of the acropolis on the restaurant side and the temple of zeus on the bar side breakfast was a wide choice of hot and cold buffet food which was delicious on the last evening we had dinner in the restaurant with an excellent view of the sun setting over the acropolis the course meal was of a much higher quality than anywhere else we ate in athens and was delicious all the staff from the bar restaurant front desk maids and doorman were without exception friendly polite efficient and helpful thank you for making our stay so our final morning we had an early start and were able to arrange a breakfast bag to take to the airport with us,1.0

not impressed with the condition of the hotel we checked in with and had rooms reserved the lobby is misleading in making you believe that the rooms are updated and nice upon arriving to our room we found that the room was stuffy as if the air was not working we tried to turn the ac up but it was operating at full blast our beds are rock hard and in the floor as if were kids camping in the wilderness the bathrooms are old outdated and have cracked tiles and mold in the grout this was only in one room and it didnt get any better for the other rooms some of our party has already tried to switch rooms only to get placed in rooms that are worst i would never refer this hotel to anyone and i shocked that its a wyndham hotel it definitely like a motel,0.0

we have stayed at the brooks hotel twice so far and feel that it is one of the best places to stay while in dublin the rooms we stayed in a deluxe are decent sized for a european hotel they are also spotless and comfortable the bathroom had a nice tub but i would have preferred a better hair dryer ours was of cheap tube kind attached to the wall it is close to george arcade which was interesting the gaiety theatre is a minute walk away in case you feel the need for an extra layer there is also a good patagonia outlet shop nearby within walking is grafton stephen green and a store good deal on visitor sims to use in your unlocked phone i made a birthday video for a friend and asked many people to say happy birthday to my friend stuck in the states the front desk staff played along and were delightful the chocolate brownie in the bar is worth a stop also,1.0

i had avoided staying at new hotel due to price for a few athens visits but after a rather dismal experience at another hotel in athens i decided to return to the new hotel for my most recent rooms were as good as always but slightly enlivened by a new art collection of young art basically a collection of enhanced stick figures in various forms of undress cavorting around your room on the mirror on the wall quite a staff were as efficient as ever even when the hotel was inundated by a slightly obnoxious american tourist group the food was good and the bar a brilliant end to a busy day well worth a few more euros,1.0
i stayed in the marker at the weekend for the first time and from the moment i was greeted at the door until i left the following day it was first class five star service the doorman was so polite and welcoming and the same was true of the check in staff i arrived mid morning and my room was not ready which i expected as it was early and i was more than happy to leave my bag and head to the shops i was told that i would receive a call when the room was ready and sure enough a matter of around an hour and a half later that is exactly what happened when i arrived back my bag had been taken to my room the room itself was immaculately clean with modern decor the bathroom was beautiful and had a spacious shower i could fault the room at all we had a late dinner in the bar as we were attending a concert and the food was lovely a particular highlight was the chocolate mousse for dessert a must have it was gorgeous we were fortunate to have beautiful weather which allowed us to enjoy a drink on the rooftop bar before the concert later that night we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar our server recommended a great gin which did enjoyed breakfast the following morning which was a self service buffet with hot and cold options could fault hotel was very busy but,1.0
good things good location ner subway and la rambla quite cheap hotel bathroom quite fresh and they cleaned the room everyday friendly staff cons our specific room had a not so modern design with old furnitures and had not been renovated for many years also very noicy from the streets outside and the other hotel rooms not soundproof at all but this mainly bothered us during the weekend and not the weekdays when you use the bathroom there is zero soundproof for the rest of the hotel get what you pay for and we think it worked quite well since we wanted something cheap and central,1.0

came here for days in july hotel is central but is a minute walk away from tram you can buy a gvb ticket for all transport was for hours does all buses trams metro and train which is great because taxis are not an option so expensive there is a night bus aswell if you stay out late an hour we got a deal with the hotel that was off all food and drink in the hotel it brand new and it felt like no one in the hotel knew about it so that was a hassle apart from that hotel was great cleaned daily has fridge safe kettle ironing broad tv hair dryer ect massive beds that were really comfortable would definitely go back amsterdam has so much to offer for everyone,1.0

the croke park hotel is outside of the city center of dublin it is about a minute walk to attractions in the city the neighborhood is a mix of residential and small businesses auto repair plumbing and it felt safe during the day and early evening so we walked to and from the hotel each day as far as the hotel itself the rooms were very comfortable and have air conditioning the staff was exemplary and the food on the breakfast buffet was above average the hotel does appear to cater to tour groups there was a tour bus in front of the hotel each night we stayed but there was never any delay at breakfast or at the front desk in spite of this all in all i was extremely pleased with my stay at the croke park hotel,1.0
this hotel is well located very well equipped with beautiful interiors but what sets it apart is its staff from the front desk to the housekeeping every single member of staff we encountered with our three young children was absolutely charming and went out of their way to help us and make us feel welcome they dealt with nosebleeds and a marauding toddler and when i got tonsillitis they ensured that my husband survived the remaining trip on his own the concierge spent lots of time making sure everything we did went well even came running down the street after us at one point to tell us a particular museum was closed for refurbishment i would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again ourselves it is small and the pool is only good for a short dip but that really does matter the food in the restaurant is also fantastic one of the best breakfasts we have had anywhere if you are considering it do hesitate you wo be disappointed,1.0
we loved the grand hotel krasnapolsky the hotel stafff from the concierge to the breakfas stafft and room cleaners were very friendly and could not do enough for winter room where breakfast was served was stunning and the choice and quality of food was location was brilliant and only a short walk from central room was very stylish and good value for money a bit on the small size and not much of a view which is what you expect from city hotels unless you pay extra for a larger room with a would thoroughly recommend this hotel,1.0

right next to the metro welcome cookie was thoughtful and delicious you also get a map of the city when you a day for bike worth it a day for breakfast cheaper to eat at a local place the rooms have energy savers so use key for lights and air spacious room beautiful decor no mini fridge free waters use room key to open doors for safety restaurant attached good for a quick drink desperados is like corona with tequila it sweet i would definitely stay here if we come back to amsterdam,1.0
i spent three nights at the albus hotel my overall experience was quite good what i did like was the fact that the wifi on my floor was terrible i could stay online for more than a minute it was better in the lobby and the restaurant but not as good as it should be rooms are quite nice although could be better for that price thin walls laminat flooring on the other hand the location is perfect staff nice and breakfast rich,1.0
we have just had a super restful weekend at the staff are amazing esp the desk staff and at the roof bar nacho in particular is always happy to helpthe breakfast is great although euros each is a large amount starbucks next door seems very popular as does the supermarket the restaurant was delicious for sunday night steak and excellent steak it a location on las ramblas five minute walk to the plaza de son age and myself mid fifties would definitely stay again although would not choose the hotel for the roof pool very few deckchairs and no cover however the spa pool and facilities make up for this enjoyed by both thank you,1.0
we are a family with two small babies we stayed here for five nights end of our month in europe i have to admit that when i saw the room it looked too small to stay with two baby cribs and luggage pieces and it was large in bcn you do stay in the room too much and the lounge of the hotel gave us extra space to eat the take away sushi we staff are fantastic juanjo made my so easy and he went out to search in the streets nearby for a big taxi for us took all our luggage and put it on the taxi and doing all this while giving you the feeling he is there to help you and not because it is his recommend this hotel mainly for location and the fantastic staff,1.0
good location easy walk to main area of temple bar comfortable room reception staff were very helpful has a great little pub attached with good meals and live irish bands every night only downside was the noise from the church bell across the road ringing on the hour but okay with ear plugs,1.0
we had a fantastic stay at the gibson the location is great because there is a tram stop right outside the hotel which takes you right into dublin city centre or many other stops the room was beautiful and the staff were always willing to help out with any of my questions about dublin i highly recommend this hotel,1.0
we stayed for a week in july for a part business holiday the hotel is located in eixample which is a great district for eating out and pottering around in or sitting and in the various bars cafes and restaurants as well as being central so easy to get to the beach airport and tourist stuff the hotel is very well presented contemporary very clean and comfortable there a roof top pool which is small but perfectly sized for a quick dip after a busy day sightseeing or working i think the best thing about the hotel is the awesome staff everyone working on the reception desk was super friendly and helpful they totally made our stay,1.0
a solid choice the location of the divani palace ca be beat it a two block walk to the base of the acropolis and we had a great view of the parthenon from our balcony it also only about a minute walk to the plaka district the hotel itself is older and a bit dated but the room was comfortable and clean the staff was great and very helpful when we had questions the rooftop restaurant was a bit on the small side but again you ca beat the view the food was also excellent the grilled lamb chops and the valrhona chocolate filled with crème brulée were fantastic breakfast was good with a wide variety of offerings and while the hotel itself does not have an airport shuttle service they were more than happy to arrange that for us all in all a great choice for us,1.0
we got dropped off at street from the air coach and the hotel was pretty simple to find from here it around a minute walk from the spire in the already had a good idea of what the hotel looked like from the entrance so we just walked along talbot street and it was straight forward to find only a short walk meant the hotel was in good location the rooms were in good for value with the location breakfast was lovely good selection with the buffet also the carvery was good value for only,1.0

i have to say the location is excellent close to las ramblas seafront and old town apart from this it is not worth the money it is a four stars hotel quite expensive and you pay for the location we booked for just one night so we were going to stay much in the hotel anyway but we arrived at and the rooms were not ready yet they told us to wait for about one hour i asked what was the allowed check in time and they said we wanted to have lunch as we had eaten yet and i even asked to have two rooms who were next to each other that we did mind but they said it was not possible as they would be different price rooms etc so we left and came back about two hours later for the bathroom they only give you three little sachets of shower per person not conditioner body lotion or any other thing you can think of not enough for four stars in my opinion horrible window view to interior patio there was a safe but instead of a code there was a key lock but no key the next day we went for breakfast and the lady asked us to go back to the room to get the room number paper and honestly it could not be worse chistorra and sausages were cold we came down at as we had to catch a train and bad albondigas looked like,0.0

great hotel in the docklands ideally situated for attending the theatre in gand canal square the convention centre lansdowne road sorry the aviva and the arena short walk into the city centre and also on the direct bus routes to the breakfast each morning buffet style also noted gluten free options and rooms were all very clean and everyone seemed to have pride in the hotel all staff were exceptionally friendly in particular the bar staff during the day at first floor and also the older maitre d at breakfast who all treated our daughter like an floor bar was ok for a few drinks but perhaps the best facility is the large swimming pool sauna and steam rooms never really used these type of facilities on other short holidays previously but made good use of them we go back yes we would,1.0
this was our second stay this time we traveled with our children and had connecting rooms which were perfect very clean quiet and luxurious i never have allergy problems here since they have wood floors and not carpet the location is really convenient to all of the walking areas and historical sights the staff is always very helpful with any questions and the bellman have both stays come right to our taxi driver to make sure we were getting charged the appropriate rate which is fixed to and from the airport,1.0

great location beautiful design and friendly staff makes we can definitely recommend krimpton de witt for a stay in amsterdam there are two downsides the first do not take breakfast a breakfast costs euro and exists of only croissant some fruit and some yoghurt there are a lot of breakfast spots nearby second downside double rooms have very small beds it is actually something in between a single and a double bed overall we really enjoyed our stay and we would mind choosing the same hotel next time in amsterdam,1.0
we stayed for two nights while visiting amsterdam and felt the hotel was very good good size modern rooms and all very clean and efficient the rooftop bar weather permitting was lovely to relax in at the end of the day the metro meant we could be in central amsterdam in about mins from leaving the hotel while we did make use of the restaurant it looked and had a good menu if you want you use the fridge for fresh milk and breakfast will certainly use this hotel again,1.0

this hotel is in a perfect location with a a very modern stylish the rooms are small claustrophobic made all the more difficult by very poor lighting this occasion our refrigerator did not function our air conditioning was below par management offered no solution except by sending a supervisor up to see us who could not speak were evident on the lip of the bath suggesting a poor level of to not having a functioning refrigerator we requested an ice bucket for our wine hotel does not have an ice one should have the capacity to communicate in spanish in order to make any level of communication ie complaint successful all in all one had the impression that guests were secondary to managements expectations other words the guests did not all the places that we have stayed in around the world this was the very disappointing end to our holiday in spain leaving a bad taste in our memory john e,0.0

let me start by saying we booked this hotel through a service and had heard wonderful things about it we were disappointed in the reception the manager was not very helpful the main restaurant of this hotel was not open on sundays for guest which was is problem as there were no restaurants close by the lounge though was open and so crowded you could not get a seat but the staff in the lounge especially maria were outstanding the food was good as was the service i do understand how the food could be so good in the lounge but the restaurant was very bland and everything tasted the same no matter what you ordered the room staff left a lot to be desired also the bed was made but that was all they did we stayed here a week but was tempted to change hotels we were book here again,0.0

we recently stayed at the herbert park hotel for vacation the hotel is lovely modern very clean and easily found by far the best thing about this place is the staff they were unbelievably attentive and accommodating we did not sleep on our over night flight and they immediately got our rooms ready early so we could nap the concierge service at the front desk helped our group with all of our tourist needs and sent us off with a wave and a smile the morning breakfast was a lovely mix of fresh food with fruit and hot dishes to take care of every preference the honey was particularly great the hotel is on a park and it is just perfect for a quick walk to cure the jet lag we ca wait to go back,1.0

you paying for the location here if you want five star luxury go somewhere else however if you looking for a clean comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff in the heart of the city at a very good price look no further the hotel is just off the ramblas right opposite the guell palace you ca get nearer to the beating heart of the city breakfast was indifferent but with good service the rooms are basic but very comfortable and despite us overlooking the main street surprisingly quiet this is a great hotel for exploring the finest that barcelona has to offer,1.0
although the location is good this hotel is not any good for those who need sleep there is a bar downstairs that has music until late and the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything when people walk past the room the obvious drug dealing that happens right outside the hotel entrance just makes you feel unsafe not a pleasant place to stay and relax,1.0

stayed nights for the last weekend of june as a couple the hotel is modern with a coral and the sea theme running throughout in furnishings etc the style is attractive and quirky upon entering reception is also in the communal area which is where breakfast is also served i found reception to be friendly and very accommodating we arrived very late and were assigned a ground floor room which i was told could not be changed that night unfortunately we slept very badly due to pavement noise and dustbin lorries etc asked at reception early the next morning and were given a floor room facing away from roads etc roomsthe room was comfortable with a large bed complete with a very thick mattress topper so sleep was excellent the room was fairly basic but modern with all that you need good power shower air con etc breakfastbreakfast was very busy but we chose to sit in the outside courtyard with sofas tables and was cool and quiet food was fairly standard with a nod to spain with tasty spanish tortilla and also tomato pulp to spread on your toast bikes we hired two bikes at a cost of per bike per day and a refundable deposit from the hotel it was a great way to pedal the cycle lanes along the coast and through the quieter parts of the city area the area is away from the city but fairly near mins walk to the hive of activity which,1.0
breathtaking views from both the pool and the breakfast room over the acropolis and whole city of athens makes this property a great choice we liked the fact that it was out of the crazy of athens and set in the upmarket kolonaki district but it did mean taxis as walking in the soaring heat of july was just not an option it was a minute walk down hill to syntagma square which was a surprise as the hotel blurb states but that said taxis in and around athens are well priced so a taxi to the plaka was euros the rooms are not big but have all you need including a little balcony the beds are huge and comfortable but without question the highlight is breakfast because to be able to sit outside and enjoy a great feed with the best view ever was unbeatable,1.0
i a little torn i visited the the blanc restaurant to meet a friend who was staying in the hotel it was a beautiful setting and the staff were friendly and provided excellent service however although the food was well cooked i had the ox burger it was quite bland and a little too sweet for my liking i felt it was overpriced for what it was that said the overall experience was enjoyable so i would certainly still consider staying there myself and checking out their other restaurants,1.0
this hotel was located in a perfect place on the main street of laietana near the waterfront one block and you are in the heart of the gothic district and across the street is the area for best restaurants where local dine the front desk staff were particularly helpful for a first time visitor to barcelona the room was quiet with comfortable beds,1.0
i have just returned from a night stay at the north star with my boyfriend and it was amazing i had stayed here about years ago in a standard double room and even then it was good but since then the hotel has been refurbished to a sleek modern décor and this time i stayed in an executive club king room which was well worth the money the standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money they have upgraded the rooms with smart technology so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button there was also complimentary dairy milk chocolate in the fridge which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over we also had access to the rooftop lounge which was quite what i expected as well as that the hotel was just a high standard robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job i would definitely recommend this hotel if you looking for something more high end i absolutely loved my stay here and it really made my trip to dublin brilliant,1.0

we stayed two nights in amsterdam and one night was at this fantastic hotel we had a large room overlooking a canal we stayed with our daughter and although the room was spacious she had a bed in the living room but she said it was comfortable our room had a kitchenette with a lovely selection of complimentary teas and coffee breakfast was served in the jansz restaurant and highly recommended with a great selection of hot and cold breakfast choices our evening meal was also in the jansz and again a good selection was on offer there is a lovely courtyard to sit in and some adult swings too highly recommended is the boat trip run from outside the hotel on the tourist our captain tony was highly knowledgeable and a very funny tour guide,1.0
i stayed at the hotel for nights the room was not ready when we arrived but they held our luggage directed us to a cafe up the street when we returned the room was ready we had a room that faced the street of the front of the hotel the room was clean the beds were comfortable the room was small but we were only in there to sleep so it was a major issue i loved the location of the hotel it was accessible to major metro stations restaurants shopping we took a bus from bcn airport to the hotel that was only euros per person the hotel is within minutes walking from the bus hotel staff spoke very good english worked with us when we tried to speak spanish with them they were all friendly helped us with the map routes to our many excursions overall it was an enjoyable stay a solid choice for our needs while in beautiful barcelona,1.0

i booked this hotel when i saw colplay we going to be at croke park the location is really good the airlink stops right outside the hotel opposite side of the road temple bar is only a minute walk away it only took us around minutes to walk to croke park you can get the bus right outside too which would take out most of the way but the roads were closed for the concert so it was quicker to walk there back the hop on hop off bus stop is also directly opposite the we entered i was impressed with the decor it has a very luxurious boutique feel about the arrived at about to check in staff on check in we waited around minutes were given our room keys for floor there was a wedding going on in the hotel so we had to walk through all the guests to get to the lift we struggled to open the lift area door with our keys someone else opened the door for us we found our room our keys would work my husband went back to check in by this time reception was chaos with lots more people checking in finally got our room keys sorted into our size no view very dirty windows i aware construction work was taking place on the upper levels lighting in the room was fine during the day but impossible to apply make up in the evening as there just one lamp by,1.0
very nice clean and comfortable rooms we stayed for nights and has easy access to the but also a short minute walk to the old kerk and red light this is a very popular and large hotel check in and check out does take a little while so be prepared for some crowds,1.0
olympia film festival authority booked the hotel for me i stayed only one night here before joining the festival at pyrgos i had very little time but i could use my time seeing the museum that was at a walking distance the neighborhood was quite and peaceful and the streets were full of ripe oranges they served a very good breakfast and i must say my short stay was wonderful,1.0
used this hotel for a week while attending a conference good location close to centre and main railway station but far enough away to avoid traffic and noise friendly and helpful staff nice bright rooms with free wifi and tea making facilities breakfast is as good as one would expect for a tourist hotel of this quality good without being may be access to guard against flooding the entrance is raised above street level and accessible only via a set of fairly steep steps not sure about access,1.0
my family booked the room for four the room was great a queen bed and two small singles the hotel has which was great on our visit because it was hot location is great easy walk to many sites the airlink bus drops up just in front of the hotel we had the breakfast the second day for euros and it was good,1.0
we had a fabulous time at electra palace in athens it is a reasonably priced glamour style hotel in plaka we stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our trip and on our last night in greece the service was outstanding rooms were clean and the breakfast was excellent we also enjoyed sitting on the rooftop bar in the evenings with a beautiful view of the acropolis the friendly staff really went above and beyond to make our stay extra special the first night we received a bottle of wine and a plate of fruit during the last night of our vacation the hotel upgraded us to the presidential suite we felt incredibly lucky and could not have thought of a better way to relax in style before the long journey home the presidential suite was it had two plush rooms a balcony with a view of the acropolis and a private pool my favorite part of the presidential suite was the steam room hammam what a luxurious way to spend our last night in athens we already miss it so much and will definitely stay here again as for room choices i would recommend staying in an upper level room away from the street noise this is a great hotel for both couples and families,1.0
we reserved a table in stir restaurant prior to attending angela ashes in the bord gáis energy theatre there was a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant and the service and food offering was excellent for our main course we had the roast chicken haddock both were delicious see photos attached we ordered eton mess for dessert and it too was divine would definitely recommend will be back,1.0
i travel a lot and normally stay at airport hotels the night before i leave for an early morning flight and this one met my expectations this trip i was with family it was a basic airport hotel nothing fancy but fit the bill we did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel though there were other hotels closer i did not want to hear airplane noise the shuttle ride was short just make sure you book it early to get a choice of departure times,1.0
stayed here for three nights and enjoyed our stay with one exception being that the air conditioning in our room did not work parking costs a night which is a little steep when you are paying a lot of money for the anyway but compensation is that you can easily walk into town thus saving parking fees there great breakfast choice with lots of coffee options nice breads and pastries yoghurts and cereal no fresh fruit salad canned does not hit the spot in august but great start to the day bedrooms of a reasonable size dearth of plugs comfortable bed ok bathroom shower curtain great toiletries all the staff were helpful and friendly and made the hotel a very welcoming oasis highly recommended,1.0
we arrived after sailing the greek island for a week excellent location for the acropolis museum shopping and the old town all are convenient walking first to note was the hotel was tastefully decorated and the staff went out of their way for us i have back issues and tried touring the acropolis the next day in quite a bit of pain mark at the hotel desk found a cane for me to use and was very helpful in suggestions on where to visit and did a double ck on the taxi we were to have on departure to the airport the lower bar was perfect quiet getaway after a hot day of sightseeing for a drink and or read quietly with a nice view of a garden area in the back the rooms were spotless very important to a retired flight attendant loved the deep tub our beds were turned down at night and we were nicely surprised they brought up extra luggage racks for our oversized luggage i read on a review that someone did like the dark hallways in some of the better hotels they use that as a signal to keep the noise down for people that may be resting very effective the biltmore uses that technique for the staff the rooftop restaurant was atmospheric and lovely the food delicious my husband at times can be hard to please since he travels for his job but he was a happy man with every single meal you,1.0
i stayed here for two nights last weekend over all it was a very good experience location is excellent pubs shops etc within a minute walk very safe to go for a stroll room was spotless great amenities comfortable bed etc ate in the bar it was absolutely excellent service in the bar was also top notch breakfast was ok i did find the quality great but it was ok service for breakfast is excellent though reception were very efficient and helpful especially a young man i think his name is stephen i could thank him enough so friendly efficient and sooooo helpful no matter what he always gave a service with a smile i would definitely recommend this hotel i will certainly be back,1.0
i have enjoyed hilton hotels for business travel and decided to book the alexander doubletree in barcelona expecting the same standards i experienced in the past this hotel was extremely disappointing first i received an email that they would not be able to accommodate their standard time as the hotel was in full capacity and my room may not be ready in time luckily my train was arriving late to barcelona so that did not present an issue for this second upon entering my hotel room a terrible stench permeated the room i opened the window to air out the room but the smell would not dissipate third the bathtub did not drain properly and water filled up the tub as i showered i had arrived late to the hotel because of my delayed train so waited until the next morning to let the front desk know about these issues the next morning i called the front desk and asked for both items to be checked upon returning to the hotel in the evening neither of those items had been fixed my stay at the barcelona was short so i did not call again and mentioned it to the front desk during the person at the front desk questioned whether i had made a mistake about the room not being checked i was extremely disappointed as a hilton honors member of the room and the lack of service provided the only positive to this hotel is that it is close,0.0
excellent location friendly and helpful staff the room was luxurious and the afternoon chocolate was a lovely treat pool and roof terrace were hidden treasures that we thoroughly enjoyed would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning on my next visit to barcelona,1.0
this hotel is not at the centre of barcelona but if you are confident on the metro the stop is just across the road and is good value and easy to is the beach a short stroll away beautiful beach cafes with delicious food cocktails go down a were upgraded to use the floor which was very nice snacks and a drink late afternoon before heading out laterfor the evening looking out to sea was very did have the hotel buffet breakfast at we chose instead to use the small cafe just across the road great staff good of the staff at the hotel were exceptional the man who took our luggage to the cupboard until needed was so helpful as were the reception disappointment was the bar we decided to have an evening testing it out a great shame poor staff several disgruntled guests we waited so long for our drinks we got our money back and moved this would not deter me from returning to this hotel the room was excellent we had a superb break,1.0
stayed here one night for business purpose the hotel is quite big with a nice entrance the room was big situated on the ground floor very clean also the bathroom i did not have time to have breakfast but the staff was friendly enough to offer silverware in the middle of the night i ordered late night kebab it is a min walk from sloterdijk train station where you can be in min in amsterdam central station the hotel has a tram stop right in front of the entrance so very easy to reach by public transport even though it was a very brief visit i can recommended this hotel to anyone for a comfortable sleep,1.0
i travelled with friends for a short trip to amsterdam and we were delighted with hotel casa the tastefully furnished lobby immediately conveying a relaxed inviting atmosphere with reliable wifi and helpful service who were very patient with two bedraggled exhausted international travellers who needed to have everything repeated twice to make sure they had it right our room albeit a shoebox met our needs perfectly and the beds provided restorative sleep after our excursions the restaurant was a godsend if slightly expensive and their breakfast buffet has something for everyone,1.0
due to mistakes made with an original booking at a different hotel in barcelona we found ourselves desperately searching for a place to stay i so glad we found akos suite hotel we booked online at turned up at and the staff went out of their way to get a family room available for us as quickly as possible the rooms are big beds are really comfortable theirs a little cooker and fridge we could hear any of the rooms next door or above our twins preferred the little swimming pool on the floor to swimming in the mediterranean i absolutely recommend this hotel,1.0
i have needs many times at this wonderful hotel yet i like the good position to get everywhere quick with metro or by walk very comfy the only minus is that at the moment there are some reconstructions but anyway i would high recommend,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay here positives food cleanliness location staff a bit disorganised but the hotel is still very newly opened staff forgot drinks at pool after we ordered on quite a few occasions i received some skewer when i sat by the pool thinking they were complimentary as is usual in this calibre of hotel i then realised no one else had them i pointed this out to the staff who snatched them away quickly wrong person whoops we visited the spa to book treatments times but no one was at the desk there no where near enough beds on the terrace we had to sit on chairs while others took more than one there should be a reservation system or list as when one comes free everyone rushes to get one,1.0
we have stayed in the hotel for nights the location is very convenient the metro is in minutes walk station to the central station the breakfast is very good and we had also one dinner at the hotel place has vital we had a plesent rooms are quite comfy and the lobby areas are huge eith alot of sitting areas ping pong and bilirad i want to mention jiska she was so adorable and supportive in every request that we also helped us with our rental children enjoyed alot off ice cream on her behalf here are some pictures from the lobby i forgot to take some from the room,1.0
this was everything you expect being in the middle of barcelona it was close to all the action of la ramblas restaurants and street vendors the hotel itself was comfortable and of the old style tall ceilings tiled floors but modern bathroom the staff bent over backwards to help you out ie storing luggage since we were very early for our reservation offering suggestions on dining and providing info on area attractions i would definitely consider staying here again if i returned we attempted to speak in spanish but they returned in english very helpful,1.0
booked this hotel after a friend walked past it and said it looked nice wow is that an understatement gorgeous renovation of connecting canal houses with clever and inspiring interior design would love to spend a rainy day just enjoying interiors luxurious beds and linens plenty of room in the basic king rooms king room bathroom was a stand up shower not much storage space in bathroom but fine interiors a bit dark if you have vision problems but was a problem for in fact every waiter and bartender in amsterdam were personable and fun did not eat at restaurant but thoroughly enjoyed peaceful quiet garden boat tour was only drawback was the concierge nice but so busy they could use concierges service was great in all other areas would stay here every time and wish they had partner hotels in other cities,1.0
the room was great and the staff was more than helpful they had recommendations for tours places to eat and so much more the hotel had an elevator the breakfast was good and had both hot and cold choices i would definitely use this hotel again,1.0

was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and service of this centrally located hotel the staff was very courteous and was always willing to help very clean and comfortable room good breakfast and other amenities,1.0
easily accessible clean friendly staff fantastic food would stay there again watching the bakers at work at after getting back from the gothic quarter was i not spend on the breakfast which is limited in choice merely order your food directly from the bakery counter and give your change to the poor hungry guy sat on the pavement outside had a great time in barca largely due to this hotel,1.0
what a wonderful experience my travels take me to many countries and can say that this hotel is up there staff and service is of a high standard sundeck view is amazing with a great pool area drinks on a summers afternoon overlooking the acropolis is sensational will be back,1.0
not valuable complimentary water is free only first day of stay despite you stay here for take you key card from your room despite you not allow they do clean your bed and change bed cover only pretend to do it terrible marriot experience here,0.0
we chose this hotel for the pool so our yr old can have some fun it made a difference as we could do the touristy things and then enjoy playing with her in the pool getting into town was quite easy depending on the weather we walked or caught a train the airport bus was right outside the hotel extremely friendly staff fantastic,1.0
really good hotel staff very helpful room and facilities excellent lunch buffet could offer more varied options but overall excellent hotel good location but taxi needed bar exclellent facilities for gym although i did not partake,1.0
stayed here for nights and must say what a lovely hotel this is our room was huge and airy beds just slightly hard but managed a good sleep i definitely recommend eating in the hotel too its really reasonably priced compared to the rest of dublin would definitely stay here again,1.0
hotel was clean and modern staff were friendly minute walk to train station less than a minute walk to dam square and to great restaurants in the jordaan loved the location quiet new a little bit away from the hustle and bustle but not too far away good coffee place across the street we really enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again,1.0
the people working at this hotel could be more friendly they love families the breakfast is really good good healthy vegan options the rooms are really clean and modern the location is very good as well and the metro is really nearby they have a really small outdoor swimming pool which is great for small children or a refreshing break i love this hotel,1.0
great location accessible to major hubs buses metros as well walking distance to the heart of barcelona city centre hotel room was nice spacious and quiet front desk staffs were really cheerful knowledgeable and helpful restaurant menus breakfasts were adequately convenient an upgrade to coffee maker is recommended as our coffees cappuccino expresso tasted rather horrid we recommend overall,1.0
me and my family were not expecing that the hotell was so nice for a day trip in barcelona the hotell felt very nice the people behind the desk was friendly and helpfull the room se had was larger than expected from the pictures and the view for me was gorgeous would go the when i take a trip back,1.0
it a great location for all the sites temple bar district is right outside the backdoor the front faces the river liffey nicely done rooms and amazingly quite rooms with all the noise outside our second time to dublin and have stayed here both times we would recommend the clarence to our family and friends,1.0
probably the nicest room i ever stayed in the canal view was really quite impressive but the high point is the breakfast i never had better incredible variety of choices and every single one outstanding the la carte options were prepared to highest seems inconceivable that a place like this misses the mark on mundane things like wifi terrible laggy slow and strangely setup ssids choose the best one a better connection was available at the heineken experience the air conditioner was broken and so we kept our windows open which forced us to enjoy the second hand smoke from the people on the terrace below for the canal view and the stellar breakfast these quibbles can be overlooked but with a little extra investment the place could truly be outstanding,1.0
i stayed at melia sky for one night and it was completely worth it the room was very spacious and comfortable with an amazing view over the city the service was impeccable from the front desk to the restaurant i am allergic to gluten and at the time that i wanted to eat the full menu was not available when the waiters learned about my allergy they made an exception and i was available to enjoy my grilled vegetables which were great the pool club is great with many sun chairs and cabanas it is the only place where the service was however as the ladies seem to be completely lost my only drawback and it quite a big one is that the room door is not and same goes with the walls meaning that housekeeping woke me up in the morning and above all i was woken up by my neighbors during their midnight tryst so not optimal the hotel is located away from the city centre close to the beach and close to public transport it is a new building and public areas are i would definitely come back but would ask for a quiet room,1.0
nice pool at the last floor staff very nice but not worth the price you payis not possible to smoke at night in the rooftop because it became restauant they gaved me the room before check in time so i appreciate it,0.0
people may choose the athen gate hotel because of the wonderful views but the location and the service is why i would choose to stay again the view from our room and from the roof top restaurant where you eat your complimentary breakfast is stunning you can view the acropolis from one side and the temple of zeus from the opposite side we walked to several of our tours and every evening for dinner because the hotel was centrally located if we needed to go to piraeus port the hotel staff secured a taxi for us every staff member we had contact with was courteous professional and helpful,1.0
location gives access to many dublin entertainment venues accommodation is very good evening menu choice could be more varied comfortable rooms and friendly staff a bit pricey though we stayed at high season,1.0
it was my third hotel in athens in under months and by far my favourite the staff are friendly and courteous i arrived early and they were able to check me in earlier the room was spotless and the house keeping staff were bending over to ensure that i was satisfied the floor words fail me about the beauty and ambience that surrounds it having breakfast this morning and looking at the acropolis was beyond all expectations location is brilliant minutes away from quality shops and a short and easy stroll to the fashionable kolonaki the spa centre also does not fail indulgent and luxurious ca rate this hotel highly enough,1.0
we stayed for nights at metropolitan hotel in july hotel is undergoing renovation and that is needed it old dirty and not in a good condition right now if i had no other information i would rate it a star hotel one time when i tried to open the door to our room from the inside the door handle fell off the renovation was noisy the eggs in the morning buffet were rotten and the dinner on the roof top restaurant made my boyfriend and one of his kids complained about the noise and they moved is to a room a couple of floors up so they did try to help but it was still the this description you might wonder why we gave it two stars they are for the well equipt gym and the nice lifeguard by the pool one of the kids forgot her go pro camera by the pool and he saved it for her for the next day,0.0
modern chic and centrally located friendly staff our rooms did not have any windows but the rooftop pool bar more than made up for it with nice views of acropolis and athens they also serve an excellent complimentary breakfast up there they let us eat and play in pool area after check out with access to spa changerooms and showers an all around pleasant experience,1.0
this hotel was a great stay we were welcomed on arrival at reception and asked if there was anything we needed to know and given all the local information we needed and directed to the soverigner shop for a tram pass the tram is directly outside the hotel which takes you into the centre in just minutes i do know where people are getting the minutes ect from on these reviews it really is not that far and i made an effort to check if this was correct this service really made the difference between being able to get to the centre one night we stayed out after and was surprise that a taxi cost just about euro so between that was bad at all the hotel was clean well maintained tastefully decorated and the rooms were likewise the staff were great they were friendly and helpful when needed and at the right times and would give you enough space and privacy to enjoy your particularly loved the rooftop bar spectacular views over amsterdam and so nice to relax and chill with a drink and would definitely return and recommend this hotel to you ramada we had a great time and i can honestly say i most of the time can find one small complaint but not in this case it was all fantastic we will hopefully see you in the future,1.0
lovely hotel with a balcony very clean and spacious hotel staff were very friendly and could do enough for you hotel had special touches like fruit on the table near lifts bon bond available as you check out handy maps so we could walk to croke park for concert there is a few eating places near by and cafes the lias is right out side the front door which was a bonus if you wanted to save your legs big car park right on the door step too dependant what side you stay our view was of the train line and a building site which was fine for us as it was the weekend and very quiet however in the week could be louder overall happy with our stay and an ideal location,1.0
my dad and i stayed here in june for the phil collins concert in the aviva both of us were very impressed by the hotel the lobby was clean modern and inviting upon arrival was speedy and the reception staff were friendly and courteous our request of a twin room was met and the room was very spacious clean and well appointed all round if i had one niggle it would be that the bathroom was a little tired in comparison to the room itself i can not comment on the gas works bar my dad and i headed down with the intention of having a there but it was so busy we just could be facilitated breakfast the next morning was very good and is certainly one of the better breakfasts i had in a dublin hotel overall i would certainly stay here again when in dublin and if you have a in the aviva this is the place to stay as it can not be beaten,1.0
titania hotel is ideally situated in the heart of athens and is only a short walk away from syntagma square and the shopping centre my husband and i only stayed for two nights before and after our trip to syros but we ll definitely choose titania for a longer stay next time we visit rooms are spacious functional and beautifully decorated cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city we were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the parthenon as we had to catch the ferry to syros very early in the morning we greatly appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet consisting of a wide variety of jams bread rolls croissants cheeses delicatessen fruit cereals and sweets normal breakfast includes hot dishes as well such as eggs omelette bacon baked should not leave titania hotel without having a drink or dinner at olive graden situated on the floor and offering a superb view to the pathenon by night although the restaurant is a bit pricey it s well worth the experience the food is excellent and the service is impeccable all the staff are very polite and helpful for all these reasons i strongly recommend titania hotel for couples families or business,1.0
we started our irish holiday with clontarf in dublin am glad contarf is away from the hustle bustle of the typical touristy haunts clontarf castle is in a nice neighborhood and most of the old castle is preserved the rooms are modern and you will not miss a conventional hotel what makes it super special are the people who manage it we were welcomed and upgraded into a family room so we could have more space the chef even made a custom kids meal of buttered rice veggies for the kids one late night after our city trip kiddos were also treated to extra ice cream by the team at knights bar the knight bar serves hearty irish meals so go on and enjoy their lamb stew fresh haddock and even light eats you would find local families dining out here on weekends so its always buzzing with people breakfast is a good spread and the breakfast rooms are nice sunny the rooms are spotless and the housekeeping fantastic there a gym for diehards taxis are just one call away airport or train station about euros max if you hiring a car there free parking we would love to come back on our next trip to dublin tip hire your car straight from the airport or online before u arrive saves you a few hours of back n forth use a taxi or bus for travel within dublin,1.0
great hotel perfect location had disappointing experience with bar staff wanting to leave early and rushing our meals and not making what we ordered after a long day of travelling and work this was definitely not needed simon introduced himself the following evening and a chance to redeem themselves with food and drinks and a surprise bottle of wine in my room simon was a great and will be back to this hotel only because of simon i travel to amsterdam times a year and will be checking in again on monday,1.0
my husband and i stayed for nights we got upgraded so we had quite a spacious room with two twin beds and a loft with a double bed it my second stay with volkshotel and i will probably return next time i in amsterdam we rented bikes one day as this is the perfect way to get around the city it takes about minutes to cycle to the city centre the hotel has a very cool bar with burgers and really nice volks pils beer they also have rooftop tubs and sauna everything is down to the details in this hotel and it all done with humor,1.0
where to start it was my first time in amsterdam and my partners so i had no idea what to expect but from the airport to the hotel was a pretty seamless an express train from the airport to amsterdam centraal which took about mins then a metro three stops to weesperplein which was another mins then a short walk to the hotel another mins and we greeted by the lady at the front desk and swiftly checked in our room was only a standard king size room but it was pretty spacious with lots of closet space bathroom with a rainforest shower and a also a normal shower head with different pressures lovely smelling citrus were so tired the first night that we decided to just order room service and as it was not too pricey it was the best decision we made on the holiday as we had the most delicious burger order it and you see what i mean and really really good chips also try the sticky rice dessert with mango and coconut cream as it delectable cocktails also very good and i had the pineapple worth mentioning also is that room service comes on the normal table but within the table there a hot box to keep your food hot if you want to eat it later brilliant so brilliant in fact that we ordered steak frites the next night too the guy on room service is the best did get his name unfortunately as,1.0
we had a nice stay at praktik bakery everyone who worked there is very friendly and helpful the rooms are small but cozy and clean the location is perfect for visiting the main attractions of barcelona the only downfall was surprisingly the breakfast which despite being in a bakery has limited choices oh and the parking is very expensive but this is the case for everywhere in barcelona,1.0
stayed nights in july and had a very comfortable stay the staff were very helpful rooms were large with a well equipped kitchenette and a nice far as i know all room have a small balcony with the ones on the front enjoying a view of the acropolis well located a very short stroll from all the restaurants of definitely stay here again,1.0
the alma is a gem leave the hot city behind as you enter the dark and cool lobby and you are quickly invited to complimentary refreshment something that continues in your room as free and offered the fingerprint room access method by very patient and caring to the rooms which are comfortable and classy minimalist with very nice touches and mine overlooked the tranquil private square to the north rear of the cant say enough about the kind staff and will return the razor sharp table that lacerated my calf on the roof top view was an exceptional blip and unless this is more common than i believe will not temper by enthusiastic was pain free and courteous the lifts are utterly ridiculous and slow,1.0
i do usually write reviews on this but i had to after the fantastic treatment we got at the market check in to leaving the hotel the staff were out of this world they honestly could do anymore for room was perfect we stayed in room we had a corner suite overlooking the docklands just food was fabulous we eat from the bar menu and could fault that had a treatment on the sunday morning i got the sunday package and honestly the best massage i had in a long time and what made the experience even better was the lady that i had her name was amanda she was polite friendly and just made the whole stay perfect for me also the food and beverage manager sandra was fantastic too myself and my friends will definitely be back,1.0

wanted a change from the usual hilton type hotel and chose the morgan because of ta reviews and location this is a small boutique style hotel with luxe fittings and furnishings however all is not what it seems if you look closely the place is starting to look tired the phone in my room was of the euro variety and the carpet in my bedroom is beginning to look grubby amongst a whole host of small things this place needs a little time and attention spent on it by the owners complete with a new lick of paint otherwise they will kill off what is essentially a lovely funky place to stay oh and one final thing the buffet breakfast needs to improve frequently running out of sausages and bacon an omelette stations would also not go amiss,1.0
we had a great visit at the emporikon we requested an acropolis view and it did disappoint the hotel was easy walking from the train station and very central to many sights would stay there again,1.0
we love this hotel the room is beautiful spacious and cozy the staff is incredible kind and accommodating the morning breakfast is served for a good chunk of time in the and is absolutely delicious the room service food was also very good we would book this place over and over again,1.0

after a month of hotels eight in all hermes might be the very best in part the staff eva oana push my rating over the limit of stars this will be my first choice for my next trip to athens the location is perfect it is just outside the crazy plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets it takes minutes to walk to the acropolis ancient agora or the fabulous national archeological museum the rooms are solid and silent i never heard any noise from other rooms or the street the finishing is beautiful if you like polished marble bathrooms floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet breakfast food selection is great everything from the basic toasts different breads with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats there are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections the finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time for example eva knew after the first day that we had daughters she readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and i look for a table in none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four lastly someone on tripadvisor said the walk to the national museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea oana told us,1.0
this is a great location if you want to stay in the temple bar area staff was very helpful breakfast was delicious no air conditioning so can be noisy at night if you have your window open depending on the time of year it may not matter we really enjoyed our stay,1.0
stayed at the morrison found it to be very central for shops restaurants and bars the hotel is located very close to bridge and across the river from temple bar it was very clean and modern the staff were all excellent and really helpful especially darren at reception we received cookies on checking in which is apparently a doubletree thing though i stayed at other doubletrees and never received them and they were amazing the breakfasts were also really good would definitely stay at this hotel again when back in dublin,1.0
room was clean and quiet and i especially appreciated the tall shower an issue for me at or meters the staff was super friendly and helpful and the location is right in the heart of amsterdam hard to imagine how it could be any better,1.0
wife and i stayed here three nights the room was spacious and the bathroom was large as well great location right next to the canal with walking trails service was also exceptional free access to business center was great for us to print tickets to attractions and boarding passes the hotel also set up our taxi ride to the airport for a flat rate of euros if i ever back in dublin i stay here again,1.0
stay in dublin on business frequently have not stayed here before very central and easy to find rooms slightly dated however very comfortable and clean had dinner in their restaurant food and service were fantastic great breakfast and to put the icing on the cake great value for money compared to other big chain hotels would highly recommend will definitely stay there again,1.0
our family group of eight people stayed at this hotel for two nights four rooms we used our visa cards to get a free breakfast which was wonderful the front desk staff was so friendly especially rebecca i accidentally left my sport coat in the closet of my room as we went on a cruise ship rebecca found it and saved it for me to pick up two weeks later when the ship came back to barcelona i ran in on the way to the airport and she had it ready for me outstanding service the hotel only has about rooms and is reasonably priced compared to other barcelona hotels but with the service expected in a marriott hotel great service by the english speaking staff it is only a few blocks from the bus and you can get your tickets at the hotel front desk they have internet enhanced internet is free for marriott gold members even if you are not a gold marriott member this is a great hotel it is a couple of blocks from a nice park great for the morning run or in my case a place to relax and smoke a cigar i highly recommend this hotel when in barcelona,1.0
the hotel is close to the centre of dublin walk on a wonderful street very clean and nice ambience sounded from the beautiful park and water quiet for a good sleep we enjoyed the breakfast and the discreet attention of the personal,1.0
the location ca be beat directly behind the palace at dam square made getting around amsterdam very easy for first time visitors the staff from front desk to concierge could have been more helpful and went out of their way to explain the city to stayed on the bank side not knowing the difference in their two buildings that make up the hotel next time we will try the exchange as per the suggestion of several staff members my wife and i like to experience new things but the decor and style of the rooms were a little too modern for us shower in middle of room was unique room was quite large considering we were in do much of anything in hotel as we were constantly on the go but would definitely recommend hotel for its location and service,1.0
the hotel reception staff were courteous and kind the room was clean and decent my only complaint was that you had to go up and down several steps to get to the elevator this was difficult when you had to to carry your own was good since it was close to the temple bar area where there were lots of restaurants,1.0
we booked a double standard room for our honeymoon and were obviously given a single room did look anything like the photos and we were given a single bed to share it was horrible uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all we could have about the room size but really who wants to do that on their honeymoon take a dip in the upstairs jacuzzi if you dare it filled with cloudy murky water be prepared to hear the train go past underneath the hotel and your neighbour go to the toilet there no sound proofing at stay here again,0.0
i visited during the mwc confrence but even taking that into account chatging the price the hotel charged was than the nice location near the segrada familia and the truly pleasent staff the hotel is not a reccomended are tiny built in a way that makes them extra uncomfortable lacking in some basic elements you expact not even a looks feels and is old as if time froze in the early and breakfast tastes as if it was made bad nice team and in hotel that leaves much to br only reccomend if the price was very low and in mwc it was not,1.0
the temperature outside is and there is a tiny window in a room for four if one person takes a shower the room is too warm if two take a shower it a sauna for the rest of the night i have encounter the little window phenomenon throughout ireland but his huge monster of a hotel is hot throughout sleeping happens after he room has cooled down around stick to airbnb most homes and flats have actual portals to the outside air,1.0
we stayed here for two nights at the end of our circle ireland bus tour the hotel is very nice lots of services great bars and restaurant the location is absolutely fantastic and ca be beat you are right in the heart of the action and all kinds of eateries pubs shops are adjacent easy to walk to all from here the rooms here are large great wifi nice beds and comfortable only problem we had was air conditioning is poor or was functioning in our room the lowest we get the room temp was and it sounded like it was working but never cooled properly not really an issue though as there were there large windows that fully open so it was cool enough there are two pubs that are top notch within steps of the hotel madigans is right next door went here fro drinks twice nice place murrays just up the street a half block was an outstanding place we dined here on our last night with others awesome food service and live irish music there is lots of shopping near this hotel great stores for everything you need we thought this hotel was great and would stay here again without a doubt,1.0
very good value rooms are nice and clean staff is helpful breakfast is nice and with variety they also have a bar i definitely stay again in this hotel if we come back to amsterdam city center is min away and it is a nice walk,1.0
we really enjoyed our stay here only regret was we did spend enough time relaxing by the pool as we were so busy exploring barcelona the room was very clean and comfortable great bed and it had a good size bathroom with excellent shower we caught the aerobus from the airport to the place de catalonia and then took a five minute walk across the square to the hotel the hotel is situated slightly away from the square so when you enter you escape the hustle and bustle of barcelona into a little oasis even the pool area feels quieter and calmer even when it busy personally i would have liked a bigger pool but it was fine for a gentle relaxing swim we had breakfast across the road at a great spanish cafe as we only wanted coffee and croissants so we did eat in the hotel overall a very enjoyable stay,1.0
our stay at the praktik bakery could not have been better the rooms are nicely appointed and while smaller work perfectly for anyone who is out and about in a great city like barcelona sitting on top of a bakery made it easy to have breakfast snacks and quicker meals as we were trying to get out to see the city the neighborhood has lots of local restaurants to get away from the packs of tourists,1.0
stayed days prior to boarding our cruise loved the location friendly staff who spoke english concierge assisted us to choose great dinner location options luggage is stored safely with quick easy access if need be,1.0
we visited the gran hotel barcino early july for three nights the location is fantastic right in the middle of the gothic quarter we had a room on the second floor it was simple and clean and had floor to ceiling windows that opened to a small balcony gorgeous we did not pay for breakfast as there are so many local cafe the staff were really friendly and the safe only costs euros a night to hire other reviews mention the noise yes it is noisy at night especially friday and saturday night but after a few estrella and mojito i was flat out so it was an issue i would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be going back,1.0
this is my second stay at the property in the last couple years the experience it is always the best upon arrival the welcome is a great smile from all the staff the common areas had been updated and the restaurant in property is just lovely with great service the skybar it is a highlight for every sunset to witness the beauty of the city the rooms were totally renovated and absolutely beautiful thank you everyone in particular andre to make me feel welcome at axel hotel barcelona,1.0
said it was four star hotel got given key went to room was cleaned from previous people beds not made breakfast stuff still there went to reception got given another room sat on bed went through the bottom of it as slat was broken went down again to reception got moved again to the most disgusting place i have ever had to sleep they said they had know other room available we asked for a double and got twin room even the first room was a twin when we got the the room there was a kettle bathroom was dirty the carpets we dirty and air conditioning did work the male receptionist could not give a hoot and was put out by the fact we had been down down to the pool got lunch at the restaurant by the pool side which was expensive and the very last straw was in the middle of the meal the waiter stopped us eating as he wanted us to unprofessional hotel who does put the of their customers,0.0
upgraded on arrival due to our length of stay nights smallish but functional rooms not the smallest we had in europe though very helpful and friendly staff excellent value for money considering the quality of the hotel and its location close to metro station and numerous bus stops would definitely stay here again,1.0
it truly felt like coming home when we came through the doors of casa camper we were just a wee bit afraid that things might have changed since the marvelous susanna martin had left the helm but she had trained the staff well and our beloved georgina was there to welcome us and show us that casa camper was just as fantabulous as ever having been in the air forever with layovers all i wanted was food and protein and georgina led me right to their clever where i scarfed down a yummy sandwich wrap etc feeling revived we headed up to our lovely room and then out the door to get our first glimpse of las ramblas which is so close casa camper is beautifully located and the staff goes out of its way to give you info on wherever to want to go and whatever you want to see and the chef well words ca even begin to describe the breakfasts but if you go away hungry then there is something seriously wrong with you all i can say is that if there was a casa camper in every city where we travelled and georgina could clone herself then i would never have to research our hotel choices again this is a in my book,1.0
very good overall but getting access to the rooftop bar was made very difficult and we were told to wait up to mins for access which was excessive and resulted in us going elsewhere this was disappointing as the rooftop bar was a big draw when choosing the marker the hotel itself is lovely and staff were very helpful,1.0

we had a lovely stay at the sandymount hotel the rooms are very modern spotless and cozy breakfast buffet was very nice too staff very friendly and stops with the train to the city centre and sandymount centre with shops and restaurants a minute walk away,1.0
there is nothing negative to say the rooms are very modern clean and we were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to a larger room that had a sofa bed in it so kudos to the front staff free breakfast was exquisite lots of variety fresh and tasty and finally this hotel is located near all the action you can not beat the location overall recommended ideal for businesspeople but suitable to families and couples as well,1.0
i used to go to this hotel since it was crown plaza but now as kimpton de witt it became an excellent choice for my wife and myself excellent location super clean rooms and friendly staff i enjoyed my last stay and surely we will get back there,1.0
ripley court is in a great location super close to oconnell street and across the street from many bus stops including the airlock busses helpful staff rooms are spacious and have good decor however it is a bit dated linen and facilities are clean but some work could be done tiles were off in our bathroom behind the door and there was some water damage in the vanity no fridge in our room which was a shame as purchased cold could be kept in the room we had a good double bed a bit firm but ok desk table and chairs side tables safe luggage rack ironing board and iron facilites bathroom amenities were a pump of shower gel on the shower wall and hand wash no shampoo soap etc room serviced daily and pretty quiet breakfast was included in our rate and really good full english breakfast or continental included bacon eggs toast cereal pastries juice etc hotel also had facilities to pack you up a take away lunch but had no evening meal service overall we would stay again and recommend this hotel,1.0
i have been here before so my obvious choice was this hotel inside the citythe rooms are very immaculately maintained and the shower is amazing breakfast was one of the most lavish ones i have seen in europe and i enjoyed it each morning only dissapointing factor was the spa the message was very dissapointing for the price which they charged do not use their spa it is a waste of good moneyapart from this the hotel is fantastic will come again,1.0
we stayed nights in barça with our boys had the family room and a double actually had separate rooms which were very nice staff super location close to everything and the bakery is would go back,1.0
well what to say it was our first time staying at the group and it was amazing from the moment we arrived all the team where so nice and would do anything to help room we had was perfect so clean and such a beautiful room we had a jacuzzi too which was choose not to eat in the hotel but on the last day we did decided to have breakfast in the hotel wish we had breakfast there every day it was soooo good should have had it every you to everyone at the real was a super visit we came to see the concert and you guys just made it even better,1.0
if you are looking into a good option for hotel while staying in athens the radisson blue is worth considering very good rooms friendly staff and a very good system in the summer time very important in my opinion good return from your money the only issue is that there are not that many restaurants within minutes overall very good experience,1.0
standard mercure hotel nothing special the location is good tucked away in the center of amsterdam near the canals the room is quite small but that is not unusual for typical hotels in amsterdam worth a visit,1.0
just wow was to sure what i was going to expect booking a ibis as plenty of mix reviews i guess staying at a ibis style added that little more for a two star we stayed for nights mid july to find and was well located in the centre of barcelona in fact couple of minutes walk from metro and mins to the luxury in was fast and efficient and while this was being done greeted with cold water and a chocolate croissant which i never had from some four stars hotels nice touch after travelling in and higher on the direct on their site and ask for top floor which we were given room that had a lovely street view did hear any street noise what so ever and i am a light was small which you would except from ibis anyone moaning on here saying rooms are to small it a two star hotel get a grip the room bright very clean bed was again more comfy then some stars hotels bathroom had breakfast which was included in the price the area was bright and clean it was continental breakfast which did us fine normal type food and was always topped management team have done a excellent will stay here again and ibis styles in the if on a budget and want a great few days in barcelona then this hotel is the one for you,1.0
they did give me enough info when i checked in so i did know that cleaning was once every two days so i had to go to the reception to get amenities since there no phone in the room no hair driers in the room could stop the air conditioner and could turn off the lights completely at night to i had to take out the room key from the pocket i do think this hotel was a good choice in terms of the cost effectiveness wo come back,0.0
stayed in this hotel at the end of july for nights the hotel was clean bed was extremely comfortable and staff were very accommodating everything we asked the staff for we got breakfast was included in our stay and was very tasty and suited all dietary needs,1.0
very nice hotel w friendly front desk staff hip and modern although the hallways may be a bit morbid dark and grey nice location although some of the surrounding streets were not exactly posh rooms were bright elevator kinda slow,1.0
my partner i stayed at the clayton for one night and could fault a thing the reception checking in was faultless all the staff on reception were extremely helpful and friendly our room was lovely big with a comfy bed nice bathroom good shower the location is great a min walk into the centre along the river the airport bus drops off picks up right outside the hotel as well as the hop on hop on bus does which is ideal we did have a meal in the vertigo bar which was very good although the service was a bit slow it was particularly busy but we still had to wait for over minutes for our food which came within minutes of complaining how long we had to wait but all in all it was no great hardship the breakfast was very good good choice something for everyone nice hot,1.0
my husband daughter son in law year old grandson and myself stayed for nights in march the hotel was a short walk from the central metro stop which was very convenient as we were using the metro to get around the city the rooms were not huge but big enough and they gave us rooms with an adjoining door so our grandson could wander in and out as he pleased which was great the staff were very helpful there was a buffet breakfast available but we chose not to have that i would happily go back there as it was comfortable clean welcoming well situated for getting out and about and ideal for a short stay,1.0
we were able to stay at the conrad on a recent trip to dublin the hotel is very nice and the rooms are well appointed generally we like to stay in smaller hotels or b bs when traveling in europe but opted for the conrad because we were able to use hilton honors points very nice high end hotel but located a bit outside of the main tourist areas but the walk through and near the park was very nice,1.0
a very cosy nice hotel breakfast nice and satisfying you can sort get to may of the key sites in athens from this hotel the staff were helpful especially helping with how to get around around town and excellent recommendation on local restaurants,1.0
leaving a review the day we depart because my partner and myself are both gutted to be leaving this fabulous hotel as soon as we arrived on our first day we were greeted and told our reservation had been upgraded as we were their guest of the day the start of our stay was made even greater when we saw the room and the size of the bed my partner is pretty large but he was swallowed up in it haha i was sceptical of hotels in the centre of amsterdam as i has been told they could be rather noisy but we did hear a peep our view from the room was spectacular but i not complaining all you have to do is walk outside the hotel to see a beautiful view the location is also fabulous right next to restaurants bars and shops we found our favourite coffee shops right behind the hotel the bulldog coffee shops cater for all types of weed smoker depending on which mood my partner and myself were in there was a corresponding shop all in all the hotel is pretty amazing oh i forgot the breakfast beautiful i would recommend anyone who is looking to feel papered and relaxed while staying in such a beautiful city thank you to the staff for making our first holiday away absolutely amazing,1.0
my friend and i stayed here for two nights at the end of june and really enjoyed our stay we booked the junior suite for a good price but would call it a suite it a nice room with two single beds pushed together and a separate sofa bed there is a lovely balcony with plenty of chairs and a table the room was that spacious but the wardrobe and storage space made up for it there was a safe mini fridge and good air con but unfortunately no kettle bathroom was a good size with a nice shower which proved vital as it was so hot while we were there the hotel was in a good location with plenty of shops and restaurants within metres of the hotel we were able to walk to the beach within or a taxi for only a few euros it only took to get to the airport in a taxi all the staff at the hotel were friendly and approachable i would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again,1.0
booked as central for sightseeing beaches and nightlife unaware it was a gay hotel this turned out to be an added bonus as the atmosphere and ambience was one of great inclusiveness and acceptance for everyone in our mixed party super friendly and attentive staff especially sergi overseeing the great breakfast buffet the subterranean spa was scrupulously clean and quiet during the day when we used it facilities i recommend a massage from juan if you get chance very relaxing and a real were a good size by european standards beds are comfortable showers are large and powerful and room servicing and hygiene could be faulted we definitely return not least as the rooftop bar is open until and has themed entertainment most nights,1.0
went to spain on a family vacation overall had a fantastic time and a wonderful experience in the country everything was great except for this hotel it was the only negative experience of my entire trip were we not so exhausted from our international flight upon arrival we would certainly gone elsewhere we paid extra to have a triple room and there was nothing triple about it with the extra bed put in the room it was nearly impossible to open the closet door which was by the way the only place to put our clothes which was ridiculously insufficient the barely functioned blowing out almost no cold air when we complained about this they tried to convince us that it worked perfectly which was a terrible way to handle the situation and a total shame located a few feet from our room was a cart of cleaning supplies this made the entire hallway smell terrible which was disgusting for any hotel let alone one of this supposed caliber and for the icing on the cake our room was filled with construction noise from some construction project which they supposedly did not know the origin of nobody got a good nights sleep while we were there we wrote an email to management with no reply clearly they do not care there are plenty of other hotels in barcelona all of our friends who went to barcelona stayed at other hotels that were at the same price point and had completely,0.0
i always try and stay at ritz carlton hotels but partly due to the comments of the other reviewers i only stay in club rooms with access to the lounge previous reviews are totally correct this hotel needs to invest some of its income on new carpets and a deep clean of the sofa the decor is fine actually typically rc and there are some nice touches such as sweets for the children the pool area is a joke and not in a good way far too small and unless you get up to save beds at which i was forced to do having had nowhere to sit on the first day you can forget about finding anywhere to sit it was only because the sea was too dirty to let the children swim and beaches no better that we put up with the hotel pool but it such a shame the hotel does spend some money on improving this situation there is the space for a separate club level pool in the garden was very expensive but i do mind this as it keeps certain clientele at bay i have been to more ritz carlton hotels before and it totally ruins the experience at least most fellow guests did have a bit of class and knew how to behave the hotel overall or rather the club rescued our trip after the disappointment of the beach and we were very impressed at the consistency of staff whoever is responsible from,1.0
this hotel is amazing location in centre barelona room is comfortable and reliable price is not bad friendly staff it on the la rambla everything is easy to reach the environment is a bit noisy but a place where barselona is a place to live,1.0
one of the best accommodations i have experienced good staff good food excellent view on the city from the room window pleasant stay and comfortable beds the position in the city could be better for this brand of hotel but it might be the only flaw which is not really big since it is approx euros and mins to city center,1.0
rooms are old and barely clean but guess what this is no the problem i am a very frequent traveler and i have never seen such an impolite staff i mean all staff from housekeeper till hotel owner manager are way above rude except one guy in the reception they think they are managing a prison they shout at guests and lifeguard scare kids i was booking for nights but i had to leave on the back of a fight with super rude hotel owner i thought it was better to cancel the vacation and not to live with the stress of a bad room managed by impolite people btw pictures on the rooms on website have nothing to do with reality take my word avoid at all cost,0.0
an overnight stay whilst in dublin in this very clean and welcoming hotel the rooms comfortable and clean and although basic that is reflected in the very reasonable price the hotel is situated just outside the city but within easy access with good transport in also not too far from the ferry terminal and has a small car park to the rear of the hotel,1.0
clontarf castle staff made this visit a lifetime experience this was my first time back in ireland in years special thanks to marta who was originally from poland and took a special genuine interest in our brief visit over to kraków and then when we returned to clontarf castle where karen the irish waitress was also just as kind my apologies to all the other wonderful staff whose names i ca remember they made this trip wonderful clearly whoever does the hiring around here is a genius because i never seen such a group of and dedicated staff who genuinely take pride in providing their guests with a truly remarkable experience thanks so much,1.0
the night before we were supposed to go to a wedding a large party was happening on the ground floor we were on floor at midnight the music started it was so loud our room was vibrating we called down to reception times but nothing was done at we went down to reception and finally managed to get moved to a higher floor it did help much when checking out we requested a discount the reception staff were rude and point blank refused saying it was there fault they then threatened to call the police if we did pay i do understand why this hotel thought it would be a good idea to put families and people who had a wedding the next day right above a party that does end until from the other side of the hotel the party could be heard the refurbished rooms are grubby at best and most of the hotel has tired carpets plaster hanging off the walls and looks a bit old and well used only saving grace the pool was nice but the chairs are grubby,0.0
the odeon is a small but nice hotel my room was small but clean the hotel has a good buffet breakfast included and a reasonably priced bar on the ground floor i stayed for nights my room was very quiet except for a am fire alarm which was evidently a false alarm and only stayed on for a minute or so despite the fact that the neighborhood is festooned with graffiti i never felt uncomfortable on the streets the hotel is close to omonia square a short walk from excellent dining and the ancient agora of athens and a medium walk to the archeological museum staff is friendly and rates are reasonable,1.0
if i am back to barcelona i will visit this hotel again definitely i recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit barcelona but the noise of subway train was little bit annoying when i tried to sleep because i can feel and hear when the subway train comes near,1.0
my husband and i stayed at the sandymount hotel for one night in july we were in dublin for the concert at croke park and it was also my husband birthday i booked the hotel direct it was really easy and we booked a classic room and late we chose this hotel based on the great reviews and the fact that it was near the coast which my husband was really keen to visit we were not disappointed with our choice we travelled by taxi from the airport to the hotel the journey took around minutes and cost few days before we travelled i contacted the hotel to confirm our reservation and to ask if there was anything they could recommend in the immediate area of the hotel that i could arrange for my husband to do on the sunday as we were seeing on the saturday evening i got a very fast and very friendly response from iamina who also provided me with website links to the recommended places so that i could get more information fab on arrival we were impressed first impressions were really great the hotel looks really impressive and the reception area was spotless with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere the receptionist was and she gave us loads of information about the area and as we were travelling to croke park she told us where to find the dart station about a minute walk and how many stops we needed to get near to the stadium,1.0
i went to clontarf castle hotel for afternoon tea was a treat for my friend and me all i can say is wow it was beautiful we were in work this morning and travelled by bus from the city centre perfect location our servers were erika and michelle such professionalism from both girls the setting our table was impeccable the servers were attentive without being intrusive the food was lovely and although it looked like small portions we could actually finish all the desserts we were told that this would be the case but we did believe them however what was left was beautifully packaged and given to us as we left we had purchased a voucher on and even at full price this would be a real treat i would highly recommend,1.0
perfect stay for a city trip the hotel is just next to the metro traveltime to about rooms are small but nice and clean located in the hotel nice and friendly staff the only thing we missed are some facilities in the room no safe etc,1.0
hotel arts is dated expensive chaotic and has a transient lobby full of wealthy overweight not chic guests better go to soho house or mandarin we booked via amex plat and were told we had an upgraded room after going to the room this was not the case and when i followed up with the staff she acknowledged this was not the case why did she lie there was no turn down service in the room carpet fraying interior decorating style of airport hotel rationing of nespresso pods per day per room a food and beverage credit that excluded alcoholic beverages why bother broken ac in gym no availability of lounge chairs by pool until we complained and begged this is why we had booked hotel incidentally pool was overrun with screaming children the second day they upgraded our room which was better and had sea view checkout was chaotic bill was incorrect generally over priced for luxury puts ritz carlton to shame,0.0
a high quality hotel with very helpful friendly staff great if visiting barcelona not too big with a lovely roof top bar pool over looking the surrounding area excellent location for most sights shops restaurants,1.0
very good location near to the diagonal avenue and near the best stores of barcelona rooms are very confortables and the attention was very good maybe the breakfast need more options very clean and all the people working in the hotel are very kindle,1.0
chose to stay here as a special treat to end our tour of ireland we opted for the dinner package which turned out to mean we were able to choose anything off the al a carte menu and the food was fantastic the staff were all really friendly and welcoming and overall the hotel did make you feel you come somewhere special our only criticism is with the room the dinner package came with a deluxe room this has been refurbished but it small details which slightly disappointed us in the bathroom the stem on the shower head was quite loose so the shower head could easily swing right over the shower screen it was clear that although there were new wall tiles and shower screen they had left the old bath in would have been so much better to have taken this out and had walk in shower instead especially as the baths are quite narrow the bathroom sink although a new modern basin had a crack in it in the room the bed was very comfy i can see that pillows could be a bit flat for some people but ok for us again just little details let the room down paint marks on the side of the mirror frame because someone had wiped it off when they painted round it poor workmanship overall though the food and the staff make this place and we would recommend for anyone staying in dublin,1.0
lovely room lovely decorated hotel even though it is not right in the city centre the public transport is really good there is a tram stop and train station across the road and you can even get a night back late at night the price of this hotel is so good in comparison to other hotels in amsterdam i have booked back here for september this year as it is a weekend i was having a really hard time trying to find something reasonably priced and when i found out this hotel could fit me in i was so pleased it defiantly worth paying less and doing the minute tram ride into the city and staying somewhere that very clean and comfortable for the price also the staff are very helpful and helped with all the tram numbers we needed to get highly recommend,1.0
beautiful hotel for two night stay in dublin with friends our person room was comfortable with all the amenities the service was great in both the hotel and their restaurants the wifi worked great my only complaint is the location is not ideal it is close to heuston train station but we were really using it it is a long walk or a euro cab ride to get to many places of interest if it was just a little closer to downtown it would be perfect,1.0
i was visiting barcelona for nights for a hotel was down from approx a night to approx a night so i went with that despite it being a bit further from my conference than i have arrival i was pretty pleased i had paid a night there is nothing wrong with the hotel inside etc but it certainly would have been worth that staff member on reception was friendly dropped my bags off an popped out for food i returned around hoping to get some sleep ready for day of the am i was still trying the hotel is based on the corner of a busy road with junctions and a set of traffic city is very busy with mopeds which are of course fairly loud and with the lights you get them pulling off with the noise of the nights of this and upon my conference finishing i decided there was no point staying for another bad nights sleep before flying home the next day at additional cost to the wasted nights cost of around and the additional to change my flights i was left out of pocket it found be fair to say the lack of sleep impacted my a little bit narked that when i went downstairs to tell the reception lad i was leaving a night early because of the noise from the road he just nodded and said like leaving bad reviews but given the location alongside the road this hotel would be worth avoiding,0.0

i stayed here with a friend for nights this summer i have previously stayed at the serras which is also an exceptional hotel nearer the marina but i would say the ohla in eixample is very much in the same league the property service and location are all the hotel is modern clean and the room design excellent the pool on the top floor is also a great never feeling too crowded and again attentive service the concierge assisted us with etc with ease the location is great far enough away from the bottom end of las ramblas but instead situated at the top of the more chic shopping district i would recommend this hotel without exception,1.0

i have already reviewed this hotel but having stayed in many other hotels during our mediterrraneam holiday i would rate philippos hotel as one of the best we class price but top class all rooms were spotless and the breakfast was class service and the rooftop nighttime view of the acropolis was breathtaking central location gust below the acropolis,1.0
the grand sofitel is truly regal very nicely maintained in that era that many of us can not find anywhere other than in these preserved hotel classic rooms are too tiny and do cause discomfort if used for double mention the excellent service of mr luca at the bridges fine dinning efficient front desk and tarnish is a public open defecating loo right outside the grand entrance of the hotel the council should remove it it sends a stink all around that area and the excreta is sometimes visible from the street it is a shame on the amsterdam council for having left is unattended and open it looks so very ugly,1.0

the hotel is located in one of the few monumental buildings on o connell street was easy front desk staff was friendly and helpful although some were difficult to understand because of their spanish speaking background my room was on the street side overlooking o connell street the room was not big but clean and comfortable and well isolated i did not hear street noise an excellent breakfast was included in the rate i paid most of the city sights were on walking distance there is stop of the aircoach to the airport in front of the hotel,1.0
the hotel is very central to the nightlife got there early and our room was ready which was a bonus the room was basic but clean unfortunately outside there was an air con unit which went off at regular intervals which did disturb our sleep it was better with the window shut but it was hot weather and we were melting no air con in the room what also did help was the amount of construction going on in the area but that was the hotels fault and it was very noisy the bar attached was nice and the food looked nice although we did partake only breakfast which was a buffet and was plentiful and tasty all in all the staff were polite and helpful and i would more than likely stay here again,1.0
probably the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip around greece not only was the entrance of the hotel hard to find but the rooms shown in the pictures look absolutely nothing like what a standard room at the stanley looks like the management informed us that those are only the specialty suites it was outdated small and not renovated but thankfully after enough complaining we were upgraded to a bigger room but with the same outdated features the pool and rooftop bar are also highly exaggerated based on the photos and even with a discount card for your first drinks everyone gets as a guest you are paying more for beers than at any of the surrounding restaurants the bed was pleasant and it was convenient to get to the city center with a metro station out front avoid the taxis if you can they are quite expensive and the drivers are very rude the star rating is not justified with this hotel it is closer to a hotel,0.0
the location was an easy min walk to anne franks house there was a hop on hop off canal stop right outside the hotel tons of coffee and food shops beautiful room overlooking the canal with excellent amenities i would definitely book here again,1.0

the hotel and our room were lovely but we had an annoying noise coming from the bathroom after the manager and maintenance personnel could figure it out kaylie from guest relations was gracious enough to move us to another room because of the inconvenience kaylie found us a larger room that faced the dam and made it extra special for me an my husband with rose petals and balloons in the room she even arranged for our luggage to be moved while we were out touring the city excellent customer service thanks kaylie,1.0

first impressions are good really nice lobby friendly reception staff but no doorman as a hilton gold member i was upgraded to a room on the higher floors the room was a reasonable size immaculate and tastefully decorated with a feel the property next door is undergoing building works but did hear any noise during my stay the bar is also nicely decorated and has a good selection of service was variable initially attentive but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it was busy and staff lacked knowledge on the menu having requested a swedish whisky which i was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu the staff member had to go and check with another on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an arran a scottish island whisky off the back bar and suggested it hardly the same the hotel has a couple of restaurants alfie and coberg the first has pub food including a number of veggie options the second which is also where breakfast is served has very limited veggie options pasta and salad with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish i did dine in either given so many options nearby in town breakfast was a disappointment no orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte such as toast vs self service on being seated and it not being particularly busy it took minutes from ordering to get a cup of,0.0
the hotel is perfectly located in a quiet location but near to loads of shops bars and restaurants the lobby is spacious and inviting and the reception staff friendly room service is quick and has a tray charge half of other dublin hotels the menu a little limited but they do say that if they got it in their kitchen they will make it for you which i successfully tested they do have a gym onsite but guests have access to a nearby mins walk gym with a pool and couple a minor niggles the iron is part of a trouser press which ca be removed from the wardrobe only pulled out they may have freestanding irons i did have time to check but this does make ironing anything difficult also check out is painfully slow i know the receptionists are being friendly and thorough but if you in a rush it just always takes forever,1.0
the rooms staff and service were star hands down houses a michelin star restaurant staff gave us a tour of the room and went through everything including how to work the shower would stay there again in a heartbeat parking was i think this should be a courtesty to their guests especially since its such a small hotel,1.0

we visit amsterdam at least once a year we had visited the restaurant in the hotel on a previous trip so selected the hotel as we felt we knew what to arrival our room was ready nor was it ready over an hour later when we been told it would had paid for a deluxe room this is not the basic level at the hotel on check in i was told that the room did have a city view even though it was on the first floor on entering the room it became very clear that not only did the room not have a city view but it did have a very unattractive view of the bins and yards of the opposite apartments i will attach a photo the room lights did not respond to the remote controls and the room was very i raised this with reception i was told that if i wanted a city view i should have asked for one even though it is part of the room description described on the hotel website we were moved on our second night to a room of the standard we had booked however that hardly a good start to a vacation the room we moved to was great had lots of light and a view we expected but no apology or recognition of the issue with our initial in all we felt that we were not valued customers and that quality of service and ensuring that we had,0.0
we stayed at the divani palace in early july the room was clean not that large for two and a kid and a bit outdated the staff was helpful and friendly but very little english the rooftop restaurant was ok but street restaurant there much better a very short walk to the acropolis and the plaka the area seemed very safe and friendly overall we really liked the divani palace and would definitely stay there again,1.0

we came to athens for a long weekend and chose this hotel for main reasons its central location and its views of the acropolis we were not disappointed by either the hotel is next door to the acropolis museum on the edge of the plaka district and has a metro stop minutes away every member of staff we encountered during our stay were friendly and helpful and the rooms were very nice the air conditioning worked perfectly which is not always the case when you stay in hotels and is very important in athens were it is still very warm even during the evening and said we chose this hotel for two reasons which brings me to the star of the herodion the roof top bar a lovely relaxing bar with attentive bar staff and a stunning view of the acropolis beautifully illuminated at night,1.0

barcelona is full of nice hotels but the corner hotel definitely worth to stop by nice decoration and very welcoming staff room are clean and good size i asked for a quiet one which i got only thing is quiet sad view but in that case i prefer my sleep was our anniversary and i mentioned it in my booking a bottle of wine was there for us and i want to thank the hotel for that very kind and generous really appreciated what i really liked is the terrace and the swimming pool the waitress serena is really nice and she is very patient despite the group that were next to us almost rude and noisy the swimming pool is good to refresh yourself but not big enough for a real swimmer who likes to do length only thing that i found a shame is that you ca order food for meal before in the it was saturday around we ordered breakfast formulas juice coffee and sandwiches friends joined us and ordered juice coffee and took sandwiches as well when we went to pay the waiter charged my friend for each order one coffee one juice one sandwich because our friend did not mentioned the breakfast formula despite the fact that they had exactly the same as us we tried to explained that it is not very goodwill but he ignored us overall it was a nice stay and except this waiter the rest of the staff is nice,1.0

we have just returned from a a two day stay at this hotel this is the first hotel where staff do greet you and say hello no contact at all through the whole check in very clinical staff in the restaurant clearly had been trained in the same manner where is the warm irish charm the service was slow in the restaurant and the service was very disjointed the second night it was quicker especially when we asked for bill the bathroom was small the bedroom was clean and comfortable we had breakfast in the coffee bar in reception and it was fine sorry staff again ca take orders correctly and no interaction with guests would not be going back,1.0

my wife and i had the most wonderful experience at the hoxton had a cozy room which was plenty big for the two of us and our huge suitcases had just come from paris and the hoxton room was much bigger in comparison the hotel itself was also very cool great music and drink scene at the bar downstairs and the breakfast and lunch offerings were some of the best food we had in amsterdam everyone at the front desk bar and restaurant were very helpful offering recommendations and were generally incredibly friendly location is also a huge plus right on the canals and plenty quiet at night but walking distance from all the restaurants and the city center the breakfast goodie bags they deliver to you each morning is a really nice touch will be returning to amsterdam in large part to our amazing experience at this hotel and we could imagine staying anywhere for such a great weekend,1.0
i stayed here for one night to attend a concert in dublin we had a package that included valet parking no other parking on site and breakfast the hotel is lovely located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance i love this part of dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre we were greeted at the door and check in was friendly efficient and exemplary the valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when i realized i had left them in the car great service the hotel itself is not overlarge but is welcoming with cool décor every staff member we passed greeted us the room was big with superking bed king for us travelers style interior design quiet and sumptuous the bed was really comfy so much so that i checked out the brand of mattress so i can buy one for home we had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles we also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience the breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites it was great i will definitely check out his hotel every time i get back to dublin and hope i get to stay,1.0
we had a very pleasant stay a comfortable and very large room for europe standards shower was excellent and modernized with a rain shower head and additionally i think the breakfast could be enhanced from just coffee and croissants but it was very tasty the rooms should also have ice buckets in the room i had to request them for all of us and retrieve them an ice freezer is available for all guests on floor so this was a nice bonus for guests the outdoor patio and indoor sitting are lovely and have nice furniture the staff was very friendly and helpful we will stay there again without hesitation,1.0

we stayed at the stanley for nights it made us hate athens to be honest the location of the hotel and the rooms are not as they seem on the website we stayed in the executive room with double bed the bathroom was disgusting with old white shower curtains and you could hear everything going on in the next room while you in the bathroom there no ventilation and it just feels like you in a cheap hotel i did like it at all to be honest and felt it was unclean upon booking i thought that the hotel was in the centre and it not it mins away by car from the main streets in the centre syntagma square and monastiraki and you ca walk there because the streets around the hotel do look in addition to all this we were charged for a bill after we had checked out from the hotel and left for drinks at the pool bar where neither myself or my husband even checked out during our stay let alone stayed for drinks and when we requested to see the receipt it just had our room number on the top without even our family name or my husbands signature we told the hotel that this was not us and that we did even visit the pool and until now one week later the money had not been refunded never visiting this hotel again and i advise anyone going on a fun romantic trip to,0.0
this hotel is a great option for a short stay in amsterdam we were there nights and were impressed by price hotel staff and easy acres to central amsterdam either by short walk to tram or complimentary airport shuttle for schiopol train very clean and well priced,1.0
stayed in room own balcony clean and comfortable quiet hotel location is perfect good tapas etc restaurants just steps away friendly staff breakfast buffet was terrific gym and rooftop pool sufficient enough,1.0
the clontarf is a jewel my family and i stayed for one night while traveling to dublin from the us the attention to detail made us feel we were all royalty the castle itself is incredible and i would recommend anyone traveling to dublin at least go for a meal there it is an amazing experience to just walk in however if you have the time to spend a night or longer i highly recommend doing so the location and convince of touring dublin are worth the stay alone the talented and kind staff are beyond compare i so glad we found this hidden gem,1.0
first i would like to say the staff at this hotel is superb they upgraded us to a room because it was our honeymoon and let me tell you this room had the most beautiful views of barcelona and the beach estelle went above and beyond to make our honeymoon special thank you so much,1.0
not long back from this hotel pleasantly surprised as it was very central right in the heart of the bars and restaurants the hotel room was really small but receptionist said we had booked a small room ive fortunately been in cabins bigger but to be fair it was clean and well maintained breakfast can be purchased on the streets close by i would go back,1.0
the hotel was in a perfect location he is walkable from central rail station took the train from airport and was in the hotel within great location for everything skybar on top floor had amazing views of great timothy at guest services made our trip he set us up for our two day visit he organized everything and made every dinner reservations for us he was patience kind and had a great sense of you will love the hotel and we took uber and it came right to the door of hotel great days,1.0
clontarf castle was better than i even hoped and my expectations were high it like staying in a lovely dream the building and grounds are stunning the food is delicious and the staff is wonderful marcello is a great concierge he worked with my friends and me on what exactly we wanted to do on our trip and every suggestion he gave us was hotel is located within easy access of the city center but it far enough away that it feels peaceful and serene book this hotel now you wo regret it,1.0
this hotel is not in the really busy gothic and las ramblas area but is a short cab ride away it is in a bit quieter section of the city the beach is a five minute walk away and there is a giant shopping mall and several restaurants across the street several other restaurants are near as us a beautiful city park our room and the bed were comfortable the pool area is nice but a bit pricey by the time you rent chairs buy food or drink etc the hotel overall is a good value relative to others in the busier areas we will stay here again when we return in september,1.0
lovely hotel big modern room but small bathroom it was very warm at night ths lack of air con and a busy street outside meant we could not leave the window open as a regular swimmer i found the pool far too warm the warmest i have experianced,1.0
this hotel was a long way from the airport via the metro nearly at the end of the line it is relatively close to the station with the diagonal mar shopping mall in between there is a supermarket in the mall the beach is a few blocks away i enjoyed a smoothie and sun at purobeach the service on the pool deck was friendly and attentive the room was comfortable but the coffee was expected more from this property hilton allows guests to check in to rooms prior to arrival i used the app and was surprised upon check in that i was given a different room on a lower floor further from the ocean view also the honors breakfast amenity was not available and the promised points were not added to my account overall this property seemed to be more of a convention hotel and i was not their preferred clientele given so many wonderful hotels in barcelona i will not return,1.0
we stayed here our last night of our night trip to ireland and wished we had stayed here more nights convenient location easy parking comfortable beds clean rooms and bathrooms and friendly helpful staff,1.0
the whole experience was disappointing we were made to wait for minutes before our room was ready and this is after the check in time of there was a line of people waiting and we had to queue three times before our room was finally ready we entered a warm stuffy room where the air conditioning has not been switched on it is definitely not what i had expected based on the review i will definitely not be coming back be ready to be disappointed,0.0
the hotel was excellent and surprisingly quiet with a big wedding going on room was as expected we did have to wait for the shuttle for minutes upon arrival but it was a busy time especially with a large group arriving along with us shuttle ride was about on shuttle so missed breakfast was told there would be a breakfast takeaway for us but i did see one nor was offered at given a voucher for free drinks at bar due to slight mixup with shuttles etc but the drinks appeared on our bill at checkout but were quickly hotel call for cab and they asked cash or credit i said credit but when cab showed up they had us as cash not sure whose mistake but left us scrambling a bit to find atm in the city for the return info euro cab ride to airport euro cab ride to dublin city i say this hotel is halfway between airport and city so i have to say if we had a later flight i probably would preferred staying in the city and taking the bus back and forth to airport not a slight to hotel just whether or not you want to walk home or cab home after a late night out,1.0
my first compliment goes to daniel the gm his high level of focus permeates the entire hotel in all departments the hotel is pristine it a hip and central location close to subway the guest composition is diverse in every sense of the word the employees are multilingual and always eager to help you get bank for your buck great value,1.0
staff amazing very very very clean great breakfast lovely atmosphere perfect location nothing to fault the staff clearly have great pride in their hotel just a note re the stairs they are steep and if on the floor its a great free workout probably not for the elderly but do not let the stairs put you off as this hotal is absolutely perfect there was one lady who ran around doing breakfast and cleaning rooms she was fantastic i would go back if i revisit amsterdam in fact i would go anywhere else now loved it,1.0
if you are coming to dublin and if you rather escape the touristic area select the pembroke townhouse this family hotel is located in an up scale area of dublin with embassies near by the area is quiet and refreshing easy to go to the city center of dublin with buses passing by minutes walk get the dublin pass grocery stores and restaurants are within minutes enjoyed my stay there it is really like a british style house the breakfast is very good with buffet and a la carte tea and coffee and biscuits in the foyer you can bring your own food and eat the foyer the hotel staffs even coming from all over europe are very knowledgeable about dublin places to visit transportation and eating out this hotel is a joy and i will come back for sure,1.0
rooms are modern spotlessly clean and bed was very comfy breakfast selection is adequate with a cooked selection yoghurts bread and jams etc staff are really friendly there is a mini shop with crisps sweets juices nuts sandwiches smoothies plus vending machines with toiletries and some guests must be blind to have missed this as a recent review stated no ability to get snacks the hotel offers snacks at the bar also and this ibis bar had great ambience which is quite unusual in this style of hotel overall excellent,1.0
stayed here nights concert weekend in a standard room facing the the hotel is located a bit outside dublin center but the tendering due to the was limited and prices were high taxi to center is train station nearby to center per room was a bit old stylish but beds were quite good there were some noise from the neighbor room and the buffet service was rating is low due price value consideration we payed per room and for that we expect more but maybe that what to expect during dates,1.0
stayed here for a long weekend hotel itself was clean and staff were very friendly even had security a short walk from the beach minutes lots of lovely shops and cafes on the way to the beach however central to the bars restaurants beaches and on buses absolutely no concerns and would return to this hotel,1.0
i stayed at this hotel in early july and again in late july everything was fantastic hotel staff went above and beyond throughout the stay kudos to the front desk team executive lounge staff and the bar team in the lobby everyone was a delight ca wait to come back,1.0
nice hotel good service comfortable beds very centrally located to many attractions in within walking distance of many we are seniors and it was a perfect spot for us we recommend it and would stay there again,1.0
quiet clean comfortable boutique hotel located in neighborhood very friendly and helpful staff close to underground metro lots of restaurants and coffee bars near by safe and walkable area of barcelona good value for the money,1.0
this time i invested in a deluxe room which is value for money in a city where space and fresh air is rare great bathroom the best bed lovely breakfast where else do you find a balcony this size in the center of athens got the same room as last summer more perfect when they remove the carpet and change some of the faded curtains,1.0
i have spent a great time there with my family but i have one complaint about the room service i asked for a iced coffee twice in the day but i did get anything the rest of the hotel was pretty fantastic,1.0
went as two couples for my birthday weekend good location with most attractions in walking distance got to the hotel early and was allowed to leave bags whilst waiting for room there leaflets at reception with discounts off activities there is lifts to all three through when it came to paying we ended up paying for because of the exchange rate or something to better to to avoid paying euros more than in a double room with bath the room itself was spacious but the bathroom was cramped could have a poo brush your teeth and have a shower at the same time ran water for a bath and it came out dirty for about a minute few stains etc on furniture outdated furniture and accessories such as hairdryer was poor or like the steam press just did work beds were singles put together but thankfully was a poor to average experience basically paying for the location,0.0
the hotel was very basic with only few amenities being provided they did keep any bottle of water and no dental kits were provided since plug points are different as compared to india we had asked for an adaptor to which the reception asked to come down and collect ourselves there was no hospitality in this hotel since we only needed to sleep for one night we adjusted through not at all recommending this hotel to anyone instead there are very good budget hotels in the main city which should be explored the area in which the hotel is situated is also not convenient,0.0
we had a day city break chose the onix liceo hotel its position just off the ramblas is perfect the hotel itself is spotlessly clean beautifully cool as in cool breakfast is buffet endless well worth the stayed in room which was exceptionally clean well staff genuinely want to help you have an enjoyable stay i would have no reservations in recommending this hotel will without doubt use it again,1.0
perfect hotel even for person in person room quiet room great and friendly staff great location maybe a little bit too full breakfast room and maybe a little too soft pillow on bed terrible we been many times in so called star hotels but i think this star hotel is one of the best where we have ever been we are absolutely coming again,1.0
we came for dinner here in the plaça reial for what was by a mile the best meal we had during our holiday the steak was wonderful and the area provided a great atmosphere all came for a bit of a price but nothing too much more than we paid elsewhere in barcelona we would highly recommend a visit,1.0
wonderful experience the registration was effortless the front desk was friendly and efficient the rooms was delightful our room had one wall of eyes all rooms are different and well thought out optimum use was made of space we had breakfast at the hotel and it was well prepared and presented there was also a large buffet style breakfast to satisfy all the hotel is very close to the old town plaka and very close to the system that goes to the airport as well i can recommend this hotel to all that is interested,1.0
we arrived in athens on one of the hottest days our room was on the floor there is no lift but the walk was worth it as our room was a cool oasis a door by our room lead to the roof terrace with a view of the acropolis the air conditioning worked brilliantly and enabled perfect sleep the hotel is a short walk from a variety of places to eat and within walking distance of the major sites the room was spacious and clean and the staff friendly,1.0
on a recent visit to amsterdam my husband and i booked a room for nights here and we were so happy with our stay the staff were so friendly to us we had booked a very early flight from cork and arrived before our room was available i know it common practice for a hotel to store their guests bags prior to check in if needed but i felt the staff were super friendly about must have visited amsterdam on some of the hottest days of the year as i near amsterdam is not too unlike ireland and the day after we checked in portable fans were delivered to the rooms to combat the heat nice touch the surrounding area is gorgeous also so eateries and a park right next door ideal for children or if you want to get a bit of exercise in on your hotel is very near the and trams to take you to the city centre areas and i would recommend the hour depending on your length of stay for the trams and this will save you a small fortune in the long was really impressed with this hotel i believe it a star rating but it should be more,1.0
stayed here for a long weekend break breakfast and restaurant staff are the only saving grace of the hotel inexperienced and poorly trained staff no concierge service no maintenance staff over the weekend and we were told no senior staff over the weekend if something was to go wrong like it did in our case i am not sure how they assessed this hotel to be star there are better places to stay in barcelona for the price we paid i would not recommend this hotel,0.0
can not rate this hotel enough rooms are immaculate beds are amazing location is central with trendy restaurants and cafes on your doorstep service is excellent and breakfast quality and variety is exceptional rooftop view whilst enjoying a glass of local wine is spectacular have travelled extensively through europe and this is clearly a top rated hotel you will not be disappointed,1.0
breakfast ok however too many guests which meant that we had to eat it in a conference room on plastic foldable chairs since no tables were available pool and rooftop is nice allthough small and over crowded restaurant overpriced the staff in the restaurant and by the pool were the most rude i have ever encountered apart from a man called dimitrios that was very service minded not interested to take orders when instead walking to the bar to order i was told to sit down and wait for a colleague that never came the last day we were asked to pay to use the pool since we were not allowed to be in the hotel after our check out even though we arrived late and planned to leave late the hotel in general needs an update and the room was old and smelled like mold,0.0
i a light sleeper so this was a perfect location for me to stay in dublin for a couple of nights located away from busy roads pubs and restaurants this was an ideal and quiet location for a light sleeper the decor is a bit dated but the staff and breakfast were fantastic,1.0
we stayed for nights and really liked the hotel small boutique feeling with personal service the rooms are big and the breakfast is excellent can really recommend this hotel the small pool is ok with a wonderful herbgarden on the side,1.0
first time staying at an autograph collection hotel we loved the personal attention and luxurious hospitality hotel is within walking distance of both the neighborhood gothic quarter and born neighborhoods easy walking distance to great shopping hotel is very comfortable super luxury bed and bath concierge and staff friendly and helpful,1.0
the westcord fashion hotel was lovely the staff were very helpful and approachable the room was really comfortable and well appointed the only downside of the hotel was the music from the floor i was travelling with my year old daughter and we were put on the floor we arrived quite late on the saturday night and the music was very loud from the sky bar above i did consider asking to move but as we were so tired we decided to stay the music was much quieter on the sunday and monday evening the only big downside was the shuttle bus transfer from and to the airport the outward journey did turn up at all and we had to pay extra for a private taxi the driver who picked us up for the return journey was very rude and reluctant to take us even though we had confirmation information with us,1.0
beautiful comfortable hotel lovely restaurant and friendly staff in all areas for me however the star of the show is philip d on concierge who is possibly the kindest person i have ever met i hope i have the opportunity to revisit dublin and if i do i will be back thank you philip,1.0
we were pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hotel late one night after our flight was delayed from paris we were even more surprised when we walked into our room and what a treat after our mediocre hotel experience in paris this hotel is really clean and gorgeous the rooms are cozy but that pretty standard in europe and other big cities the breakfast is also really good the selection is amazing and we really enjoyed everything about our stay here if we return to barcelona anytime soon i would consider this hotel again it was booked through costco,1.0
location is excellent for both the beach and the city use the metro which is only about mins walk away to explore the city the beach is approx mins walk away on the doorstep to the hotel is a street full of restaurants and shops which leads down towards the beach the staff were excellent when helping us with directions etc breakfast was included in our stay and this was great would recommend and stay here again,1.0
just came back from a days stay at this hotel with my husband and year old it was everything we were looking for and subway was less then min walk la rambla also rooms were clean and the daily service was excellent everyone at the front desk especially marc were not only very nice but very helpful with any questions we had only thing missing was a mini fridge but beside that we would definitely go back again,1.0
love the boutique feel of this hotel great location and room was great stayed i stay nights per week in amsterdam and the staff here far outweigh all the other hotels i stayed in attentive friendly and very efficient breakfast was outstanding really enjoyed the change from the usual buffet style the eggs benedict i can highly recommend,1.0
everything was perfect from the beginning the place is awesome the staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are really nice if i have to say something negative it would be that it is a bit far from the centre but there is public transport just opposite the hotel,1.0
great location new and clean rooms great hospitality lovely and caring employees just a little bit small rooms but it did bother us very good restaurants around you could walk lots of places,1.0
great location nice decor terrible cleanliness sloppy housekeeping this hotel has the potential to be so much better not sure how they can claim its star rating especially as the advertised swimming pool is actually down the road in a school,0.0
ca say enough about the great team at this hotel they offer helpful advice and impeccable service as always the room was spotless and comfortable great value for starpoints too the location is outside of the main attractions but is an easy walk or taxi,1.0
my husband i stayed here last august for our day vacation we loved the location the staff were so accommodating the uniqueness of this hotel was so nice from the decor to the layout it was almost as if it were a maze as it seems to be made up of a bunch of buildings that have been made into the rooms were clean not fancy but comfortable we were looking for luxury on this trip as we were out and about all day long breakfast here was awesome it was included in our room rate we especially loved to go to the vault downstairs for some entertainment or for a pint of guinness after our day of exploring we fully intend to visit ireland again and we would definitely stay here at this location,1.0
would recommend not too far from nearest metro our room came with a beautiful view which could also be found on their gorgeous rooftop bar breakfast was lovely and staff were very helpful the complementary hat and fan was a great touch all around brilliant base for your barcelona trip,1.0
this really is a gem of a hotel to stay in and a brilliant base for sightseeing in dublin or travelling further afield to other areas straight off the and easy access to main routes as well as a great and regular bus service which takes you right from outside the hotel into dublin city staff were welcoming friendly and helpful they are happy to please and nothing is too much trouble there is a lovely feel here with locals enjoying the meals and entertainment too business couples families whatever the purpose of your trip it the perfect place to cater for your had some delicious meals which were plentiful and cooked to our liking highly recommend the popular carvery which they serve daily the bar staff were amazing worked very hard and are very busy at times yet always clock when you ready for another it does matter what time of day it is there is always an offering of food and drink of some description you would never go hungry breakfasts were also yummy and plentiful and you can have whatever you ask for if you do want everything on the set menu i usually steer clear of meals such as curries and lasagnes in places that serve a bit of everything not an indian or italian but these dishes were also lovely not forgetting the steak which came with sautéed onions a refreshing change to soggy onion rings you can not fault the food here just to,1.0
i enjoyed my stay at hotel sant antoni while visiting barcelona the room was comfortable and accommodated the three of us nicely we very much enjoyed their breakfast each morning and the staff was friendly and helpful,1.0

lovely hotel a bit further out from the hustle and bustle of the city but within travel distance of all the main attractions some cute surrounding it and walking distance to camp nou rooftop pool is nice and quiet,1.0
the hotel restaurant cafe and room was incredible we arrived well before our reservation and our room was ready and they let us up perfect for a quick nap before exploring we recommend if you are exploring a lot of dublin get the dublin pass we saved a lot of money and time this way,1.0
very nice decoration but expensive and location is not perfect as it is not very close to the shopping centers we went for shopping by taxi which took min to the center the weather was bad and we benefit from the swimming pool in the nice thing is that there is a view in the roof floor which allow to see a very beautiful view of athens,1.0
excellent great location and amenities rooftop pool is a huge bonus especially for the area would not hesitate to recommend and will return in the future service was better than other locations price was extremely competitive,1.0
we stayed at the radisson blu royal hotel on a recent family trip to dublin the hotel is very nice and the staff is very friendly and accommodating the rooms are a bit small but the hotel convenient location is within to many of dublin popular attractions and restaurants,1.0
went there for a week vacation with my family the hotel staff was very nice and helpful at all times cleanliness was good and rooftop bar and pool made the hotel experience awesome for the hole family,1.0
the best thing about this hotel is the location we did not use a taxi besides when we arrived from the airport and left to go back to the airport we walked everywhere we shopped alot too considering being in the heart of the city the hotel was perfect for our needs clean nice not too small we found it quiet at night unlike the reviews i had read before booking this hotel i suppose we were on the side of the building and not the front which mea no balcony but we truly did not need it the was perfect and the wifi is very speedy no complaints here we will be back if we are ever in barcelona again,1.0
location location location and the best mojito in town close to the best barcelona has to offer next door to el born recommend hiring a as the cycle tracks are awesome and the quickest way to get around town though the clime to park guell is a bit steep,1.0
this hotel exceeded my expectations unbelievable location walking distance from quite a few important sites as well as the plaka shopping district very well maintained public areas as well as clean rooms also surprisingly quiet considering the fact that it on a main street i go back in a heartbeat,1.0
what a beautiful city hotel and people dublin is just the best city in the world we have visited to date from the moment we got of the plane the friendly irishman at the bus depot could not have been more helpful from then on everything followed suit our bus driver showed us the way to this perfectly located hotel the hotel staff got us checked in immediately and nothing was too much for anyone amazing food great drink friendly happy people all mingling in this busy bustling city the hotel itself we were amazed at the star rating as it is absolutely lovely does great food and could not be situated in a better location for the whole city extremely child friendly free food free milk and they just adore the children book this place it wo disappoint you,1.0
this is a nice hotel mere steps from the metro and abundant shopping and a short walk to markets and the monastraiki neighborhood the hotel staff is efficient and friendly do miss the free breakfast i usually do care much for breakfast buffets but this one is full of fresh fruit bread pastries eggs meats yogurt the options are plentiful and the staff keeps the food very fresh the rooms are clean and the hotel is very quiet,1.0
we stayed two nights at the end of our vacation through italy and greece it was great to know that we had comfortable and safe accommodations lined up for the end of our trip and the hilton and it staff did an excellent job the rooms were clean quiet and comfortable the breakfast was extensive and fresh and the indoor pool has some fantastic features to help relax we highly recommend this hotel if you are in the athens area,1.0
the nh caransa is a very centrally located hotel with excellent transport links to get pretty much anywhere in amsterdam the rooms were a good size and very clean being on rembrandtplein there are a large selection of bars and restaurants very close by a short walk when exploring the city would definitely stay again,1.0
i had a very pleasant short stay at dorian inn on my way back to rome the room was clean comfortable and the staff was polite and helpful this is centrally located only a few minutes walk to omonia metro station the rooftop restaurant of this hotel was possibly the most remarkable place to be mentioned one may enjoy degree view of athens city from the top wonderful view of acropolis specially at night was excellent i could manage time to use the rooftop pool but enjoyed the breakfast they served would love to stay once more here if i come to athens for any reason,1.0
did a little research but still largely flying blind because had not been to athens and unfamiliar with plaka but a real find great location in relation to plaka the gardens across the street the metro etc staff were very accommodating and the rooms and breakfast were very definitely stay there again,1.0
we knew when we booked that we were a tram ride away from the centre of amsterdam but the hotel was easily accessible from schiphol airport in the west of the city this suited us for our few days stay as we had a pleasant walk through the vondelpark to the museum quarter or could take the or tram only mins from the hotel which ran frequently a charming quirky hotel mannequins greet you in the foyer and breakfast which was included was good and varied very happy with our choice of hotel and a truly memorable stay,1.0
a nice hotel for a break it has an excellent location with access to the beach and shops and good access to public transport customer service was very good with polite and helpful staff throughout tv choice is quite limited for a hotel of this standard only downside to the place is the pool area at time of booking it looked as if the pool area was part of the hotel but it is run separately from the hotel as a sort of franchise music blasts out around the pool so it not the most restful of places,1.0
we wanted a light lunch and found just the thing in the merrion lobby bar we had the number each which consisted of a small bowl of delicious soup a small assortment of crust less sandwiches and a small chocolate dessert it just hit the spot the surroundings are beautiful with some excellent decor and art just sit and de stress after a days shopping on grafton street,1.0
it is a shame as the staff work so hard to assist and make your stay enjoyable but the constant construction works and noise is off putting from early in the morning into the evening hammering drilling workmen shouting and banging of doors it is near impossible even to take a restful hour in your room during the day as it is located on a very busy main street with bars and clubs and an outdoor concert venue just down the street people party literally to the crack of dawn so expect to not have a decent of the works the rooms was too warm as the ac is not functioning all making for an exhausting stay on a good note the breakfast is plentiful and fresh,1.0
this hotel was a great find in athens it located in a great area in close proximity to lots of nice bars and restaurants away from many tourist traps the room itself is nice modern and has everything you need in it plus the amazing bed and pillow menu it easy to walk to all the main sights from there and then in the evening enjoy the views from there cosy roof terrace which provides a great vantage point to enjoy a few glasses of their own wine if in athens again we stay here without a doubt,1.0
after travelling around europe we expected a city hotel to have small rooms especially when this is rated stars what a shock this hotel is terrific value for money the room we had was large and clean the staff are fantastic and helpful the is great wifi worked well great location hop on hop off bus just around corner,1.0
although the price seemed expensive it was peace of mind when booking ahead from canada it a hotel chain that we have used in other places in the past and know what standards to expect the building was safe secure and well maintained our room was small but had all the amenities needed for our few days in dublin it was conveniently located to the downtown area with all of the hop on bus tours just a minute walk out the front door the staff were courteous and helpful,1.0
we had a rough start to our stay as we arrived early in the morning on east coast time were hoping to get into our room early and didn t ultimately get to check in until late afternoon the prior occupants of our room were delayed in getting out the hotel staff was very accommodating however and gave us another room to lay down in also a chilled bottle of champagne was in our room that night which was a nice touch other than that experience the stay was fabulous we got a triple room for the two of us as we like space to spread out the room was quiet dark and cool which made sleeping wonderful we loved the nextespresso machine and large the location is excellent close to all the action but in quiet part of town there are lots of restaurants close by the owners prepare a list of recommendations to choose from we felt like we were in someone s home and would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers if you want a view of the canal ask for a room in the front of the hotel there may be some street noise we stayed in the back of the property which was extremely quiet,1.0
wonderful hotel highly recommend the entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home even learning your names great location in the gothic quarter walking distance or a short taxi to most of the great spots,1.0
i stayed at this hotel twice and i ca say about word about it the staff are great location is marvellous and the rooms are superb last time i visited i left my passport in the room and the staff got it in a taxi and got it to the airport in time for me to catch my flight amazing hotel,1.0
