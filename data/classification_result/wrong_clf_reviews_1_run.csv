0,1,0,54,room was excellent cleaners were meticulous and reception staff spoke excellent english and had great local knowledge restaurant food was ok but rather bland however excellent and cheap local tapas bars just around the corner i am a nice bloke and normally give i am easily pleased so why halfway through our holiday we were attacked in our hotel room by a huge muscly naked man who was off his face on drugs we went and got security who manged to get him out of our room and back to his room when we went back in the room there was blood and water all over the floor we had to throw away our towels toothbrushes cosmetics and shower stuff as they were covered in his blood reception moved us to a different room for obvious reasons we had a great room overlooking the pool and with a view of the famous familia cathedral our new room was next to the main road looking at the hotel bins nice reception staff were nice and said sorry and that the following day management would speech to us and offer compensation nothing was ever said did they call the police we were just left in the dark i got the feeling this had happened before and the hotel wanted to hush it up was the naked man a manager we spent the rest of the holiday wondering if we would be sat next to him at breakfast not a nice feeling,VADER
1,0,1,72,well what can i say the reviews of this hotel dont lie its great from start to finish ahhh be warned the taxi from el prat airport to the ohla is about eur however the taxi drivers add on a eur to eur tip or charge on top be warned factor in ok back to the hotel we stayed in a junior suite however it was effortless the reception staff are excellent on the ball when entering the room is clean spacious and the bed was ernomous however be warned there is a huge bit of glass separating the room from the bathroom so if you not comfortable in being erhum in the nude in front of your loved one then this hotel might not be the one for you in the bathroom you have a walking in wet room shower and a bath the toilet its behind or adjacent to the front door took me minutes to find it i thought we been burgled and some strange weirdo had nicked the karzee it had everything be warned the air con is fresh it works really well flat screen tv is temperamental but the late night bed fold down service is great too my girlfriend loved the chocolates they popped on the pillow as we returned from our night out overall you be hard pushed to find a better hotel the pool area on the floor get there early to avoid disappointment there are only bean bag sun loungers which,VADER
2,0,1,78,very nice hotel with rooftop pool wish there were more seats by the pool can be use the restaurant so ca tell you how it was but the seating outside was not available for food service only drinks we woke up in the middle of the night because the staff was clearing dishes not a good time to do that but mostly very good and convenient to sights bus taxi etc,VADER
3,1,0,82,we stayed at this hotel before our cruise guests with rooms for two nights a significant investment we went hotel directly from our international flight we knew check in was til later afternoon but hoped for a place to freshen up a bit it was like for us we returned to the hotel at and for our family with rooms we only had ready at we were late for our pm reservations to sagrada familia and no one seemed to care others were waiting for rooms also by sleeping in the lobby i not sure how difficult it would be to have enough staff to get rooms turned around more quickly especially for that first night after international travel the hotel is beautiful loved it and the rooftop area i wish i had felt more cared for in the check in process,VADER
4,1,0,87,the team have a serious communication the service at the restaurant it terrible night a random person enter our room at it was another guest that mistook the door the explanation of the hotel was that an error in the system allowed for a few minutes any card access to any door other day when i closed the room door a piece of roof ventilation whole felt down thanks good i closed door from inside otherwise it would break my head when you have any issue that you want to report to the manager it really dificultades to reach him not serious for a star hotel,VADER
5,1,0,88,location is good rooms are clean although on the small size however the beds are not too comfortable and the noise from the pub downstairs is unbearable in other countries this place would just not get a licence as a hotel we would recommend travellers to keep off this noisy place,VADER
6,1,0,105,i had a transportation issue that stranded me in togo africa for two days causing me to not be present to stay in the room i booked i was in africa as part of my studies assisting members of the peace corps i booked through and i did not choose the option to get a refund i acknowledge this fact i contacted the hotel to let them know the situation thinking that they might be customer service oriented and have compassion for a student budget i completely understand them charging me for two nights of three because i was going to arrive there on the third day but they gave zero leniency and basically told me that if i had booked through the hotel website that they would helped me and that i should contact which i did response was that they could refund me but the hotel could if they saw fit to do so when i finally arrived they had deleted my reservation entirely likely so that they could book out the room in my absence i had to wait almost an hour to have my reservation reinstated in the computer system the young lady that completed the reinstatement of my reservation was the only staff member that was in anyway helpful or kind i have worked in the hospitality industry including resort hotels and this experience in my opinion deserves a zero rating this pretentious frat house that calls itself a hotel is the worst i suggest,VADER
7,1,0,131,if you request a standard deluxe room newly updated you will love the balcony hotel pere iv has no bellman to assist with luggage and taxi it is very hard catching a taxi at this location especially with no staff assistance yes of course free wifi but the connection is extremely front desk staff is nice but they are not trained correctly especially planning reservations for brunch dinner etc with the wifi hardly working the front desk staff wifi works just as slow beware,VADER
8,1,0,143,first impressions are good really nice lobby friendly reception staff but no doorman as a hilton gold member i was upgraded to a room on the higher floors the room was a reasonable size immaculate and tastefully decorated with a feel the property next door is undergoing building works but did hear any noise during my stay the bar is also nicely decorated and has a good selection of service was variable initially attentive but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it was busy and staff lacked knowledge on the menu having requested a swedish whisky which i was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu the staff member had to go and check with another on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an arran a scottish island whisky off the back bar and suggested it hardly the same the hotel has a couple of restaurants alfie and coberg the first has pub food including a number of veggie options the second which is also where breakfast is served has very limited veggie options pasta and salad with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish i did dine in either given so many options nearby in town breakfast was a disappointment no orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte such as toast vs self service on being seated and it not being particularly busy it took minutes from ordering to get a cup of,VADER
9,1,0,145,the only reason to stay at this hotel is its proximity to the conference center next door the hallway outside our hallway smelled of a dead rat housekeeping never came unless called and requested the swimming pool is a joke for a family it is more like a hip hangout with people smoking shisha and behaving poorly we were concerned an escort service was being run out of the pool area just avoid this hotel there are so many other hotels which are much nicer,VADER
10,1,0,186,when the best thing you can say about the hotel is that you liked the front desk staff know it not great truly the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional we booked an eight day greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through italy for weeks through an aegean travel agency we had two nights in athens before heading to sifnos and serifos islands and then one night in athens again before ending our trip we were picked up at the airport and transferred to hotel economy by a great taxi driver i guess we should have known by the hotel name what kind of place it would be first of all it basically in the red light district as i would call it there are therese two minutes in any direction the hotel is very dated the beds are hard and the pillows are harder the bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind they could use plastic shower curtains you flood the bathroom when you shower thank goodness for drains in the floor you have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs actually sort of handy the refrigerator does work when you leave the room it connected to the key so there no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour it very noisy outside as well as above you the continental breakfast starts ta that late if you from the us it a pretty,VADER
11,1,0,217,the hotel itself is quite nice and clean however when i arrived at my room was not ready and the staff took over an hour to get a room for me the staff clearly need training in customer service it is very expensive and in no way justifies the price i will not stay there again,VADER
12,1,0,223,the hotel is very old like a bit of a haunted house the staff is very friendly helpful the rooms are very nice but big problem we saw a baby rat in our room the vibe of the hotel is amazing old type hotel i wouldnt stay there again,VADER
13,1,0,241,first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,VADER
14,1,0,263,this was the biggest mistake i have made on my trip to ireland please learn from my mistake this place must make money on the bar only it did not look like they put any money into the hotel itself the sour smell in the room was horrible the twin beds leaned to one side had to use a pillow to stop from rolling off the bed cramped small the bathroom was so small you had to turn sideways to get into the shower that did not have hot water the music and young kids started lining up at for a night of fun do worry but they were leaving but then again the staff would start putting the empty kegs on the street at sooo enjoy the hours of sleep food was not hot or tasty the dining room was a makeshift coat check at night made sure it still had a wonderful aroma in the morning for breakfast please note pay the extra few dollars and find a better only plus side walking distance to down town,VADER
15,1,0,268,i paid approx for a room for one night breakfast not included as my partner and i were down to dublin to watch coldplay i will admit it was close to croke park upon arrival the guy on reception assumed my partner and i would want single beds being guys when i corrected him and said the double was fine he smirked and went ahead with checking us in the hotel must of been grand and luxurious at one stage but it is dated and old now a bit of reinvestment by the owners would do wonders for the business the bedroom had old creaky furniture which was too big in a small room the bathroom was tiny but did have a nice selection of soaps and products a wet room would be much better here the room was spotless and there was a kettle and coffee but no tea also in the room is an iron plus board and a hairdryer there was no air conditioning unit and the room was roasting would have been ok with windows there but we could open them more than a crack although we were there on a saturday the area did have much happening and seems to be pretty quiet the hotel has a pool and leisure facility which we did have time to but you do need a code from reception to get into it a carvery was offered in the and upon inspection we decided it would be better to,VADER
16,1,0,274,dont stay in this hotel if you need an extra bed in your room my son could not sleep in his and we had to stay tried night but got sore back after having the metal springs in the matress hurt his spine and do not expect to get any help to get better bed either you will only hear lots of even i booked the extra bed week upfront they prefered to give the good extrabed to someone arriving same day who had not booked this in desk manager told me they were a big group arriving bit earlier than really dissapointing,VADER
17,0,1,317,the student hotel at amsterdam city was overall just what we needed at the end of our week backpacking trip we stayed nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with people so we really appreciated the privacy cleanliness and an actual quiet and comfy bed however i do have two criticisms that i believe can be easily fixed firstly our room was never cleaned even though we put up the please clean our room sign not a big deal but just letting you know secondly when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city we accidentally biked all the way to the student hotel amsterdam west when we tried to return the bikes we were sure why our bikes did match the bikes there i checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at my boyfriend and i did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel when i was about to check my email receipt my phone died but we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel we started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when i saw that our bikes said amsterdam city and the other student hotel bikes said amsterdam west this was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place it turns out we were,VADER
18,1,0,323,i seldom post an unfavourable review preferring to deal directly with the restaurant or hotel reference saturday we had occasion to overnight in dublin checked my favourite websites and for last minute price and location hotel seemed to fit the bill central and at very cheap indeed for dublin in july arrival our reservation made and paid for a few hours earlier was confirmed but we were asked for euros cash as a deposit for any room damage well travelled at years of age we were astonished at this request indicating that we were reluctant to stay at an establishment where the guests obviously trashed or ransacked the were advised that it was unusual for the charge to be levied but it was the managers idea and the reception staff could not get the policy were however advised that had we used an alternative website to book there would have been no charge which mystified us were given vouchers for a free drink at the bar at at check inwhen we looked at them later they expired at the room was adequate but when i dropped an earring on the bathroom floor i gave up the search early on as the discovery of a less than clean floor left me feeling a little illthe final insult came at checkout when we were advised that there was a chargeof two euros per bag if we wishedtoleave our small overnight bag with them for a few hours we felt sorry for all,VADER
19,1,0,330,the night before we were supposed to go to a wedding a large party was happening on the ground floor we were on floor at midnight the music started it was so loud our room was vibrating we called down to reception times but nothing was done at we went down to reception and finally managed to get moved to a higher floor it did help much when checking out we requested a discount the reception staff were rude and point blank refused saying it was there fault they then threatened to call the police if we did pay i do understand why this hotel thought it would be a good idea to put families and people who had a wedding the next day right above a party that does end until from the other side of the hotel the party could be heard the refurbished rooms are grubby at best and most of the hotel has tired carpets plaster hanging off the walls and looks a bit old and well used only saving grace the pool was nice but the chairs are grubby,VADER
20,1,0,350,unless you in town for a quick overnight you should find another option rooms totally outdated no air conditioning bad wifi connection no channel options on tv no ventilation in bathrooms worse coupled with hot week and no air expensive breakfast that is much better than a free continental breakfast no fridge in rooms front desk staff is friendly but did not get the same impression from the staff in the dubliner restaurant attached large amount of inviting seating space in the great because it much cooler than the rooms when it hot excellent concierge staff who help with the usual tourist stuff info about airport trips and getting taxis excessive bar smoke in the evenings if you staying in rooms with windows open above the restaurant,VADER
21,1,0,364,we booked our stay with and somewhere the information got lost we booked standard room with breakfast i need my coffee in the morning but the lady in the reception was telling us no she looked down at us the breakfast is keep that in mind even if you book it may not register and off course that not her fault but there is no need to make costumers feel ridiculous really what is when you pay a night so it not about the price but the way they carrying themself the room is clean but definitely not the room was well made and good condition but if the staff can not understand basic communication with customers then you are in great loss,VADER
22,1,0,366,picked as a relatively inexpensive option for one night prior to flying out of dublin so just looking for a basic place to sleep in a convenient location expected it to be noisy given the busy street did meet these expectations however a fresh coat of paint everywhere and a new mattress and pillows with even a bit of fluff to them would greatly improve the quality of the stay mattress was so saggy and lumpy that we could only sleep on the edges of the bed and pillows might as well have been folded blankets stuck in pillow case triple glazing on windows would also help,VADER
23,1,0,375,this hotel is located well outside the city center of amsterdam so that was a big draw back additionally the staff was incredibly unhelpful we accidentally booked this location and contacted the hotel immediately after booking to indicate our booking was a mistake they refused to issue us a refund or even allow us to transfer to one of the other nh hotels closer to the city center we offered to pay the difference in cost we just really did want to stay out there once we arrived and got in to our room there were peanut shells all over the floor and dark hairs on the chair and floor so the room had been poorly cleaned again the hotel staff at this point refused to help us by issuing a refund or allowing us to switch locations pretty awful experience the only good thing was the bike rental which we could have done at almost any hotel in amsterdam,VADER
24,1,0,422,being someone who travels extensively for work i can say i experience my fair share of dump hotels this place however tops them by a good way it pure nasty so where do i begin i start with minor grievance of only towel in a bed room i had towels in a no star hotel in lobito the front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless could not offer alternative room when i complained at the rooms allocated small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it a little on the snug side our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get was the sympathetic front desk reply the all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day the photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of guinness would i be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online to top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of in what way was that even remotely possible the only way i can get my head around that if if the catagory was the,VADER
25,1,0,442,we stayed at the stanley for nights it made us hate athens to be honest the location of the hotel and the rooms are not as they seem on the website we stayed in the executive room with double bed the bathroom was disgusting with old white shower curtains and you could hear everything going on in the next room while you in the bathroom there no ventilation and it just feels like you in a cheap hotel i did like it at all to be honest and felt it was unclean upon booking i thought that the hotel was in the centre and it not it mins away by car from the main streets in the centre syntagma square and monastiraki and you ca walk there because the streets around the hotel do look in addition to all this we were charged for a bill after we had checked out from the hotel and left for drinks at the pool bar where neither myself or my husband even checked out during our stay let alone stayed for drinks and when we requested to see the receipt it just had our room number on the top without even our family name or my husbands signature we told the hotel that this was not us and that we did even visit the pool and until now one week later the money had not been refunded never visiting this hotel again and i advise anyone going on a fun romantic trip to,VADER
26,1,0,449,the floor boards in the room were broken there was a bit of a funny smell there was free wifi it is located by public transport so getting in to the main part of town is easy the breakfast was not like you would get in canada or the usa ie it not like a continental breakfast i stayed here as part of a tour if i go back to amsterdam i will not stay here,VADER

28,1,0,536,on arrival at the hotel we felt we were inappropriately greeted at the front desk with an unwelcoming attitude in comparison to other guests checking in parallel to us who were provided with maps and received a friendly welcome on the first evening what should have been a relaxing bar experience after our journey was another disappointment the bar man focused his attention solely on mature american guests and ignored us when it was quite clear that we had empty glasses on our table and required service there was certainly no excuse for this as the bar was not busy in addition our bar dining experience was yet another disappointment having ordered and received our steaks they were both not done as requested in fact they were medium rare no service check was provided to enable us to easily rectify the situation one would expect this to be a natural part of the food service in a hotel of this standard worse was to come we attempted to order desert only to be told that the kitchen was closed again guests would expect to be warned of the impending kitchen closure whilst finishing ones meal so that any final orders could be fulfilled staff attitude and communication left a lot to be desired in this instance after receiving a lack of information at check in we approached a member of staff in the coffee area to enquire about hotel facilities however before he could ask him a question he stated,VADER
29,1,0,542,my mother and i chose this hotel for the end of our athens trip due to the price the hotel itself was fine very courteous and helpful staff moderately comfortable mattresses clean room the room was very much no frills with tile floor throughout and a miniature bathroom this being said location of this hotel is in a very unsafe block of town it is fairly close to a main street but i would never walk down those streets in the night and was uncomfortable in the day the closest underground metro station omonia is the most dangerous in athens we did know this about the area talking to many locals in restaurants and uber drivers confirmed how unsafe this area is if this hotel were transplanted to a safer street it would be the perfect basic affordable hotel however based on the location we do not recommend,VADER
30,1,0,546,i was taking my daughter and two granddaughters on their first trip to europe cruise on mediterranean to italy decided to spend days in lovely barcelona first chose and reserved two rooms beds bathrooms and sea view a year in advance all confirmed and then reconfirmed upon arrival one room ready exactly what i wanted adjoining room was then given away while we waited for luggage offered apologies and then a suite suite had no sea view only beds only full bathroom i was supposed to sleep on a sofa bed and rollaway we let my granddaughters use the suite i went back to original room offered free cocktails with dinner and that was it by the way is near hospital so sirens all night service at meals was excellent but would never use hotel again,VADER
31,1,0,549,we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,VADER

40,0,1,709,love staying here when i visit dublin great staff comfortable hotel rooms and great location i did notice that toiletries were very sparce this time shampoo and soap but call to reception if you need shower caps surely cut backs should result in lower prices not so i afraid breakfast has improved i think fresh bread and hot food even for latecomers what really disappointed me this time was the bar food we were in a hurry and just asked for sandwich and some chicken wings the sandwich was smothered with mustard and arrived in a box with no garnish whatsoever the chicken wings were inedible i afraid no taste at all so pale i wondered if they were cooked right through the batter they used had no seasoning and tasted of taste on chicken either blue cheese dip was not pleasant very expensive too not a very good impression for our tourists really ought to step up and offer a bit more great hotel otherwise,VADER
41,0,1,767,the hotel met our needs it located close to the dam square the red light district and the central breakfast was very reception staff was took a room in the fifth floor it was basic room and very small but it did bother us because we spent all our time outside but if you plan to stay more time in the hotel room you should ask for bigger room,VADER
42,1,0,799,motel one is far from the city centre and top attractions the central station is very far top attractions and canals will take you around minutes by the public transportation staff were rude no bath available just shower no iron or british electricity adaptors were given rooms were too small keep your passport and money in safe place as no deposit safe was there it is simply a motel not hotel i misunderstood the motel facilities due to reviewers comments and i made a wrong decision if i will be going to amsterdam again i will go for another option,VADER
43,1,0,814,the whole experience was disappointing we were made to wait for minutes before our room was ready and this is after the check in time of there was a line of people waiting and we had to queue three times before our room was finally ready we entered a warm stuffy room where the air conditioning has not been switched on it is definitely not what i had expected based on the review i will definitely not be coming back be ready to be disappointed,VADER

45,1,0,827,i can under stand when hotels get busy that you need to wait but when people who are booked in advance at least groups by my count are told to wait some over an hour while off the street are checked in well that is clearly all their rooms became available at once so clearly there is no coordination between and front desk they could have avoided the problem by having housekeeping release the rooms for check in one by their systems are more important than the a pleasant stay,VADER
46,0,1,836,i booked this hotel mostly based on price and location we were in dublin for the concert and visiting the city for the first time so i wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis the hotel was great there are four of us two tall teen boys in tow and i wanted to be sure we were stacked on top of each other i read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations it did and then some upon arrival we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready fine since it was well before scheduled check in i pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the us that flights arrive in the morning but the hotels are always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation americans have of being arrogant travelers we saw this again upon arrival at this hotel americans angry that no room is available at am checkin is clearly noted as pm if your flight arrives at am and you want to be in your hotel at am you need to book it for the night prior if you can not do that then do,VADER

50,1,0,874,i bought this trip through travel republic as a surprise for my husbands birthday i emailed ahead and asked for a nice room with a view as it was a surprise i had booked transfers arrived and there was no one waiting for us we waited for half an hour but nothing we walked minutes through the terminals and we came across the transfer office they did not apologise just made a phone call and said minutes minutes later still nothing so i went back to the desk and they made another call and said minutes we were completely fed up by this arrived at the hotel and the lady on reception told us to check in at and took our bags and gave some information about catching buses etc she was the only helpful person i came across we collected our luggage and went to the room yes we had a sea view and the window opened wide which was nice and that is the only good thing i can say about this hotel the room is in dire need of updating walls are badly marked and when u pull back the curtain there was mould the bed was hard and the only plug socket you could use was if you unplugged the lamp or fridge trying to get ready was a big issue as a woman the hairdryer was in the bathroom but getting ready in there was impossible no air con in bathroom gets too hot to,VADER
51,0,1,875,the hotel was reasonable the rooms on higher floors have a nice view on the sea the rooms were shabby but properly cleaned the breakfast was not wow a small hotel located at walking distance from glyfada center,VADER
52,1,0,902,the temperature outside is and there is a tiny window in a room for four if one person takes a shower the room is too warm if two take a shower it a sauna for the rest of the night i have encounter the little window phenomenon throughout ireland but his huge monster of a hotel is hot throughout sleeping happens after he room has cooled down around stick to airbnb most homes and flats have actual portals to the outside air,VADER
53,1,0,947,this would have been good for a hotel but not for hilton top of the line we stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room the concierge service ranged from outstanding to i ca be bothered but the front desk was outstanding two out of three breakfasts were terrible the buffet items were outstanding but after seating and the initial coffee the wait staff had to be called they never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet i felt they may have been shunning staff at lemuel bar and lounge generally did a good job,VADER
54,0,1,977,the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,VADER

56,1,0,1016,stay of nights there as hhonors diamond you should be treated fairly unfortunately not at all no welcome for breakfast the hotel do a segregation of hhonors member on the underground with a limited food and untasteful moreover the staff is far to be professional and spend more time to chat and joke than take care of customer this hotel is not at all as hilton level and should be removed from hilton group,VADER
57,1,0,1029,good location with easy access to metro all staff were very friendly and helpful from start to there was only flat pillow per bed we stayed four nights and old towels and rubbish was taken out or toilet roll renewed for the whole time we stayed i had to go downstairs to reception twice to ask the receptionist to get us towels and toilet very basic things in my seemed annoyed when i went down the first day that it had been done by accommodation staff yet it happened again the following day again nice clean basic rooms great power in the work nearby acted as alarm clocks at most mornings and people coming in an out of other rooms on the corridor could be heard,VADER
58,0,1,1030,strategic place to stay the hotel is in amsterdam city near to station shopping center clubbing etc just walk a step you find everything you need the services is excellence but unfortunately there is no lobby are for parking a car,VADER
59,1,0,1046,very tired looking hotel which desperately needs some love first room offered was in the basement and was really noisy moved to the top and was still really noisey due to the seedy all night clubs over the road room walls were heavily stained and the room had an unpleasant musty odour like most hotels in dublin it is overpriced but if you going to pay over the odds you may as well pay a tenner more and go somewhere nice,VADER
60,1,0,1105,very expensive for such an old fashioned place after paying as much money as we did you would expect a little more comfort quite disapointed on the plus side the staff were as accomodating as they could been,VADER
61,1,0,1111,the beds were decent the bathroom was worn with rust and discolored tile grout but it was all functional and very important for us well working ac the wifi however was painfully slow a limit of only devices was certainly an issue for us as we had to take turns getting on it,VADER
62,1,0,1125,it a below average dingy hotel with better alternatives for the same rates at nearby locations it very outdated hotel with outdated furniture that have stood the test time but their time has come reception staff were just fine but nothing to write home about location was good but i had stayed in a nearby hotel slightly better location for the same price but that was very modern and fully refurbished i think it was called definitely would stay here nor recommend i would highly advise a full refurbishment to the furniture and dirty carpets,VADER
63,1,0,1142,this was a short break for myself and daughter booked through secret escapes the hotel was very central just a five minute walk from last rambla the receptionist was very friendly and informative our room was small but clean we followed instructions for the safety deposit box but could get it to work we see told it would be done the next day not ideal to carry your valuables around the city complimentary wine and glasses after use were left in the room for our entire stay despite housekeeping every day the lights in the bedroom stopped working after the first day we were advised to play around with them until they worked did then the bathroom ceiling leaked water from the upstairs room breakfast was varied and acceptable but food remnants remained under the tables after tables were wiped on our checkout surprisingly we were asked if we enjoyed our stay,VADER
64,1,0,1146,not normally something i do as i believe that people have off days but i just had to comment on my recent stay at w hotels as i found the following to be causes of checked into the hotel from another hotel in the city as we changed our flights and wanted something a bit more in keeping with what we re used to and decided to book at the hotel at and went directly to the floor for check in we were advised that the room would be ready shortly and that they could take our bags and would be returned to us upon to the room and that they would contact us directly by text to advise the room s availability it came to and we had still not been contacts so we went through to reception where they d my payment card even though i had already provided full for recommendations of lunch and was given a suggestion of the focaccia dip and the spicy tomatoes the tomatoes were lovely but the focaccia was burnt and then asked about the spa facilities in the hotel and were advised that they were indeed closed for the day due to unforeseen being a guest at hotel de lerope in amsterdam i decided to visit w as it was a more modern hotel and thought that it would have a younger and more feel to it but this did not live up to the calling reception times over the period,VADER
65,1,0,1154,the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,VADER
66,1,0,1157,i travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels that carry stars unfortunately in my opinion herbert park is at most when i moved into my there was silicone falling off in pieces above the mirror in the bathroom the wooden panel that covered the bottom of the tub was splitting and paint was chipping the pillows smelled in one of the hallways the wall phone was hanging by the wires etc i was moved immediately to a different which was little better but still faced the same issues i do have to give some credit to the staff everyone was friendly and the cleaning staff was superb all rooms need a face lift or a star needs to go,VADER
67,1,0,1171,one to avoid and i do say that lightly stayed here as it was adjacent to the iveagh gardens and a dropkick murphy gig we were attending with good friends on the face of it a half decent hotel but let down very badly once you scratch the surface no aircon the rooms are melting at best but if you manage to negotiate the safety clasp on the window you can get some air into the room but then the million seagulls keep you awake from the crack of dawn which in july is obviously early just as the brain is beginning to accept the squeaking seagulls the hotel offers a new alarm call tap tap tap on the door so i open the door to a sheepish eastern european girl who is already walking away down the corridor sorry i just checking rooms forgive me but that cheap cheap cheap check out is actually noon so why are you waking us up never ever again disgraceful city centre hotel,VADER
68,1,0,1172,i booked and paid in advance for a superior room which was rather more expensive than the standard room however on check in we were given a standard room these rooms do not have windows and i was aware of this which is why i booked the more expensive room on alerting the reception staff we were given another room next the lift on another floor the hotel is not well sound proofed and we heard people coming and going in and out of the lift all night for nights the hotel had allowed a large group of british men to book a large number of rooms at the hotel they took over the pool and bar area and had no respect for other guests and some were staying on our floor and very loud this was the last stop for us after an week trip and we were looking forward to sitting by the pool which we were not comfortable in doing we were required to pay a euro bond on our debit card which we were told would be refunded on check out at checkout we were told this refund would take days we stayed in hotels throughout europe and this was the only hotel that took a security bond reception staff were condensing and not very approachable on the positive the breakfast was very good and the location very central,VADER
69,0,1,1202,the hotel is very well situated the room was nice and simple with a big smart tv and the staff was great however i was disappointed with my poor late night dinner ordered some pasta with tomato sauce but they tasted really bad,VADER
70,1,0,1225,i expected much more from this hotel having seen the photos and in light of the price i paid the room is ok size but beds very uncomfortable the hotel seem to have no proper walls between the rooms and awful sound insulation you can hear the person next door sneezing the blinds made such noise that each evening and morning it was disturbing as guests would put them up or down the roof terrace is nice but the pool is expect to have a proper swim although it does serve the purpose to cool down in a hot weather all in all disappointing experience having said this the staff is really nice welcoming and friendly,VADER
71,1,0,1247,whilst rooms were breakfast excellent our holiday was ruined because on out of nights our sleep was constantly disturbed by revelers on our floor doors banging people running in the corridor and loud shouting when reception was approached both during the night first thing in the morning they showed little concern and even appeared to be amused no apology was given ironically a card is left in each room with a quote from the dalai lama sleep is the best meditation what a joke,VADER
72,1,0,1259,when i got to the hotel i was amazed by the beautiful modern and clean smell of the lobby that image was destroyed when i got into the room the carpet was filthy full of stains and the humidity smell was awful the ac did work which made the humidity worst i was changed twice to different rooms but the problems were the same at midnight one of the front desk guys came and advised me they did have any ac i finally quit and tried to enjoy the stay peter from the front desk was very helpful and nice to even gave us good recommendations to enjoy the city which we loved despite the hotel rooms breakfast is varied and good restaurant food is delicious expensive though,VADER
73,1,0,1280,the staff could not have been nicer but this hotel needs work our thermostat in our room and for our shower did not work the thermostat might have been fixed by a battery but the staff were not given the ability to execute any repairs we were given a fan and moved to a new room the next day the new room worked but it had a moldy smell the grout in the bathroom needed a good scrubbing there are no top sheets and only one outlet for charging the breakfast were included and very good i felt that the staff had their fingers in the dike trying to keep the hotel together,VADER
74,1,0,1297,the staff was very friendly and the breakfast choices were great that where it ends the rooms were run down with stains on the carpets cracked tiles in the bathroom old and stained sink and beds absolutely disgusting the price per night was crazy at per night we shortened our stay from to night and checked into a local marriott hotel instead at half the cost,VADER

80,1,0,1492,we stayed for our first short break as a couple the room was clean and nice not one english channel on the tv to have on while in the room the pool area was lovely as for the hotel reception staff we found them rather rude as we booked our booking on booking com and booked it at and had to pay as they put on street tax wen we got there and we were not informed of this via email there was also a taxi strike wen we were there and the hotel did inform any of the guests about the situation it would have hurt to put a notice up in the reception area the hotel is miles away from any amenities and barcelona we found was very expensive as it was euro in a taxi to most places,VADER
81,1,0,1531,first sheets are dirty second i found bugs on bed which made me stay up and not have a metro goes under the hotel so it like the sound or the shake of it can easily be felt till late at night and early morning i do not recommend this hotel you can have better for the same price and same area,VADER
82,1,0,1564,my wife and i were booked for five days at this hotel because it was the conference venue for an event at which i was speaking we were also sponsors of this event well our visit was a farce from start to finish largely due to this incredibly inept we booked months in advance and were relegated to a tiny room on the outside of the sixth floor as we were on the outside perimeter of the building the walls were slanted just under the roof as such it was very difficult for two people to move around in this small room and we had to do this for five nights even worse the bed was simply too small for two people i measured it to under cm my wife and i were constantly pushing each other over the side during the night we asked to be moved but the hotel apparently had no other rooms curiously a colleague booked a room at a remarkably better rate about a month before the conference and had a spacious room on the third floor with a big bed and two chairs she arrived a day later than we did i had to send some documents to the united states and needed a fedex envelope the reception said there was no business center but i should talk to the concierge the concierge referred me to the business center one flight down the business center said the fedex envelopes could be obtained from the,VADER

85,1,0,1598,i think this hotel is too pricey for what it offers it is placed in a very dirty and crowded zone the rooms look old and need updating the room assigned to me smelled like someone had smoke in and it is a was extremely noisy the hotel and outside super noisy all the time i do understand the prices we pay compared to the quality of the experience it speciallymakes me wonder who works there and if they can be trusted as they do not have respect for the comfort of guests the sheets had little wholes in many places the floor was scratched a lot i sensed a really bad smell in the halls one of the receptionists was cranky and moody when people requested things that do match what he wants but are normal people requests i sense some entitlement here that needs them to be reminded of who paying i mean if they ask for so much money they should care about people and listening to them i do need rudeness or crankiness if i paying for a service if you do like your job please change it i insist that the price is too high,VADER
86,1,0,1637,we stayed here nights in an ocean side room on the floor of those nights two were disturbed by an extremely loud concert nearby which made it impossible to sleep the first went on until am the second is still going on but it is am as i write this and the music is still playing whee if you value your rest this is not the hotel for you,VADER

88,1,0,1639,i came to melia for a corporate event the was smooth and i was in my room about minutes after arrival first thing i requested was iron and ironing board it arrived quite quickly however the ironing board was about to fall apart and it was hard to iron on it corporate event rooms were for our arrival and were clean however there was not enough water provided lunchtime rather poor poor selection meals not tasty no tea provided just coffee toilets were dirty and unattended no toilet paper no soap i informed the reception about the problem it was later solved which i good selection as a tea drinker however i found that there was no hot water provided i had to ask staff separately that proved quite a challenge as some of the staff pretended not to hear me calling them and walked not impressed i would go back i would recommend,VADER
89,1,0,1657,we booked our room at the hotel through secret rooms and were promised a star hotel in a central hotel is definitely not star the rooms are very dated and small and are desperately in need of refurbishment what was supposed to be a double bed was singles pushed are a few positives the staff at the hotel are very polite and friendly the location of the hotel is excellent within walking distance of the beach and most major attractions unfortunately this does compensate for the hotels faults our room was cheap for the nights we stayed i would stay here again,VADER

93,0,1,1712,i travel a lot and normally stay at airport hotels the night before i leave for an early morning flight and this one met my expectations this trip i was with family it was a basic airport hotel nothing fancy but fit the bill we did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel though there were other hotels closer i did not want to hear airplane noise the shuttle ride was short just make sure you book it early to get a choice of departure times,VADER
94,1,0,1742,good things good location ner subway and la rambla quite cheap hotel bathroom quite fresh and they cleaned the room everyday friendly staff cons our specific room had a not so modern design with old furnitures and had not been renovated for many years also very noicy from the streets outside and the other hotel rooms not soundproof at all but this mainly bothered us during the weekend and not the weekdays when you use the bathroom there is zero soundproof for the rest of the hotel get what you pay for and we think it worked quite well since we wanted something cheap and central,VADER
95,1,0,1744,the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,VADER
96,0,1,1768,all we can say is very good service very good location excellent service from the staff we will come back again sometime but the bar closes way to early that is the only negative thing i have to say,VADER
97,1,0,1776,easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,VADER
98,1,0,1794,the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,VADER
99,0,1,29,i have to admit that i tried like crazy to cancel our reservation here at the last minute we had a devastating health diagnosis and the hotel which was refused to give us a refund that said we decided to go on our trip after all i have never been more impressed with a hotel or it s staff like i was with this location was perfect and i will never forget the kindness the staff showed me when i became ill i had an infected spider staff arranged for a to come to the hotel they sent me a tray with fresh fruit tea and a get well soon card they even had housekeeping change my bed all within a minute span of calling the front desk i was so ill that the lady from house keeping was changing my pillows as i was crawling back into my bed i remember her lifting my head and fluffing them until they were perfect they sent us dinner via room service at no charge never have i felt so pampered and taken care of i am ever so thankful for the kindness they showed me this is a perfect place to stay in the heart of amsterdam stars all the way,SVM
100,0,1,38,if you value your privacy make sure you ask for a room with a bathroom door we asked for a quiet room when we checked in we were given an inside room which i m sure would have been quiet but much to our surprise it had no door on the bathroom it never occurred to me to ask for room that had a bathroom door i can t believe that anyone actually would want such a room staff was very nice and they agreed to move us to a room with a bathroom door but that room overlooked the street which was very noisy we were embarrassed to ask for another change in rooms i m sure the hotel is very nice and staff is certainly very nice but our experience with the bathroom door and noisy room clouded our whole experience,SVM
101,1,0,46,stayed here in and staying here again will not return from management to front desk staff it been a poor experience it not the same they keep apologizing and sending stuff up to the room i need more action less gifts not letting my mother into her room after i specifically asked the front desk intern to add her name to the room at was and is unacceptable especially on a hot summer day management or leads do not help the situations i would list them by name but i will not several situations have occurred since i am not happy please also note most staff are interns but i honestly think it management issue best to all of you who decide to stay it really unfortunate,SVM
102,1,0,82,we stayed at this hotel before our cruise guests with rooms for two nights a significant investment we went hotel directly from our international flight we knew check in was til later afternoon but hoped for a place to freshen up a bit it was like for us we returned to the hotel at and for our family with rooms we only had ready at we were late for our pm reservations to sagrada familia and no one seemed to care others were waiting for rooms also by sleeping in the lobby i not sure how difficult it would be to have enough staff to get rooms turned around more quickly especially for that first night after international travel the hotel is beautiful loved it and the rooftop area i wish i had felt more cared for in the check in process,SVM
103,1,0,88,location is good rooms are clean although on the small size however the beds are not too comfortable and the noise from the pub downstairs is unbearable in other countries this place would just not get a licence as a hotel we would recommend travellers to keep off this noisy place,SVM
104,0,1,118,overall a good experience location is great and the concierge was very helpful and recommended excellent restaurants the first drawback was they put us in room and it was very noisy it was as if the window was wide open even thought it were closed it was a very active party weekend in the city so there was no way to sleep with the noise we requested another room which they provided with no question i feel from their response that they know these are a noisy block of rooms and they anticipated the room change request also we had drinks in the bar a few evenings and the services was slow no refill requests from the waiter and we had to hunt him down to pay the bill but generally a good hotel and we wold stay there again,SVM
105,1,0,131,if you request a standard deluxe room newly updated you will love the balcony hotel pere iv has no bellman to assist with luggage and taxi it is very hard catching a taxi at this location especially with no staff assistance yes of course free wifi but the connection is extremely front desk staff is nice but they are not trained correctly especially planning reservations for brunch dinner etc with the wifi hardly working the front desk staff wifi works just as slow beware,SVM
106,1,0,223,the hotel is very old like a bit of a haunted house the staff is very friendly helpful the rooms are very nice but big problem we saw a baby rat in our room the vibe of the hotel is amazing old type hotel i wouldnt stay there again,SVM
107,1,0,241,first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,SVM
108,1,0,273,terrible customer service my family stayed there as part of our tour when checking in they misplaced a batch of our tour group room key and blamed someone in the tour group took the key however the keys were found behind the counter and they did even apologize rude customer service as well when asked please be aware that some rooms does not have,SVM
109,1,0,346,this hotel is in a great location but they have a lot of problems connecting online payments and paying at the hotel i paid double at the hotel and online and nobody wants to refund me even after they promised they would i am really disappointed,SVM
110,1,0,365,the place maybe was luxury and presidential in other times now in you have to pay if you want wifi in the room ok the hair dryer was from too and the toilet didnt work we arrive at the hotel to do the check in and the staff was very unpleasant with us to do the check out we arrived hour late and they want to make us to pay the extra day only for hour late we understand that we were late but euros only for hour and the negative attitude to make possible understand our position was very unfear unpleasant and disappointing we have to come back in days in this hotel because we have already made the booking but i dont think that i can change my mind about them we dont recommend this hotel not at all to anybody i hope my experience was helpful to everybody i can assure i will never come back,SVM
111,1,0,366,picked as a relatively inexpensive option for one night prior to flying out of dublin so just looking for a basic place to sleep in a convenient location expected it to be noisy given the busy street did meet these expectations however a fresh coat of paint everywhere and a new mattress and pillows with even a bit of fluff to them would greatly improve the quality of the stay mattress was so saggy and lumpy that we could only sleep on the edges of the bed and pillows might as well have been folded blankets stuck in pillow case triple glazing on windows would also help,SVM
112,1,0,399,this was my trip to barcelona and this is my personal experience i have been in hospitality management for over years i am always willing to bend break the policy when it comes to legitimate human life issues of my i prefer to cultivate a relationship based on trust and return business with my clients on july we had a family emergency but even after explaining the situation were denied a refund for the nights stay on the that we could not use as we had to fly back home to on this personal experience when i return to barcelona in i will book elsewhere,SVM
113,0,1,411,pay the additional charge for a view of the parthenon on the acropolis from your room each night when i rolled over i could see lights on the parthenon it looked like a painting but it was actually my hotel window worth every penny hmmm the rest of the hotel a little dated but they do a good job keeping it clean and modern bathroom was luxurious with thick towels and strong water pressure breakfast buffet was delicious,SVM
114,1,0,423,perfect location for business area in the telecom industry but so far away from business world class standards to host important guest for meeting room high standard gourmet meals and on the palace is not so clean and quite for business travelers that regular to hotels,SVM
115,0,1,431,this hotel is amazingly cheap for what you get the rooms are not fancy at all but they are clean enough and there is air conditioning even if it turns off when you leave room however the location right in the plaka district and close to the acropolis were phenomenal the rooftop of this place was so amazing that we did not even feel the need to go out at night we simply drank wine and beer on the roof and watched as the acropolis lit up at night,SVM
116,1,0,449,the floor boards in the room were broken there was a bit of a funny smell there was free wifi it is located by public transport so getting in to the main part of town is easy the breakfast was not like you would get in canada or the usa ie it not like a continental breakfast i stayed here as part of a tour if i go back to amsterdam i will not stay here,SVM
117,0,1,517,the cleanliness and service of this hotel is awesome we stayed at room the room beside the elevators you could hear some noice but not that much the curtains could have closed the window much more better perhaps an idea to use some rollerblinds in between the curtains and the window,SVM
118,1,0,549,we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,SVM

120,1,0,624,the hotel has free wifi and is located in one of barcelonas most busy streets a short walk gets you to great restaurants as stores and that about it the room was really small having a suitcase got to be a problem we had to place some of our luggage in the bathroom the bathroom contained some hair from other guests and god knows what else the elevator did work the tv had three spanish channels and the breakfast cost extra perfect since the room did offer a simple do not disturb sign it was easy for the housekeeper to wake you up at to tidy your room next time no thanks hotellet er plassert sentralt i barcelonas mest travle gate gåavstand til butikker og gode restauranter gratis wifi der stopper det positive kun spanske kanaler på små rom uten plass til koffert eller sekk sekken måtte for øvrig plasseres på badet badet inkluderte hår fra tidligere gjester heisen var i ustand og alt dette til tross for en vanvittig høy pris for rommet i tillegg manglet enkle ting som et ikke forstyrr til døra pga dette kunne man raskt bli vekket kl noen skulle vaske rommet neste gang nei takk,SVM
121,1,0,702,easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,SVM

123,1,0,799,motel one is far from the city centre and top attractions the central station is very far top attractions and canals will take you around minutes by the public transportation staff were rude no bath available just shower no iron or british electricity adaptors were given rooms were too small keep your passport and money in safe place as no deposit safe was there it is simply a motel not hotel i misunderstood the motel facilities due to reviewers comments and i made a wrong decision if i will be going to amsterdam again i will go for another option,SVM

125,0,1,836,i booked this hotel mostly based on price and location we were in dublin for the concert and visiting the city for the first time so i wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis the hotel was great there are four of us two tall teen boys in tow and i wanted to be sure we were stacked on top of each other i read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations it did and then some upon arrival we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready fine since it was well before scheduled check in i pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the us that flights arrive in the morning but the hotels are always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation americans have of being arrogant travelers we saw this again upon arrival at this hotel americans angry that no room is available at am checkin is clearly noted as pm if your flight arrives at am and you want to be in your hotel at am you need to book it for the night prior if you can not do that then do,SVM
126,1,0,861,for being a hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high forgot our orderlazy in the barservice remote did worktook the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without askinggave us the wrong billthe staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service not worth the visit,SVM
127,1,0,902,the temperature outside is and there is a tiny window in a room for four if one person takes a shower the room is too warm if two take a shower it a sauna for the rest of the night i have encounter the little window phenomenon throughout ireland but his huge monster of a hotel is hot throughout sleeping happens after he room has cooled down around stick to airbnb most homes and flats have actual portals to the outside air,SVM
128,0,1,918,we came to the hotel at when check in is at was told that there are any issues with our room so we went for lunch and came back at room was ready on time was asked to come back at we are busy was the explanation we got nothing alse we thought that it should be reasonable to have been compensated for that but did ask for nothing i think that when paying this much for a star hotel they have to do more to make your customers happy when you messed up i sure that if i did check out on time i would be charged for it and so if my room was ready on time the same rules should apply,SVM
129,0,1,942,i stayed with a group of teenagers with a travel company and i was surprised how calm the atmosphere was in the hotel the reception wanted us to fill out paperwork to figure out the tourist tax when we were trying to get our group settled and organized in their rooms but they let us come back later and figure out the bill the rooms were always cleaned well and the reception put in a call for me and called a taxi for me when i needed to go to the thought that there would be more craziness since it close to la rambla but it was quite the opposite i ca say that i felt unsafe at any point but there were some weird people outside i feel like that is almost everywhere near the city center but i think it important to note if you stay there i never felt unsafe but the people were strange also please note that the download and upload speeds are very slow if you need to upload download or transfer files on business then you might want to consider another hotel i had to try uploading pictures through dropbox and it would take an hour instead of which is the typical time for the amount of files i was working with at the time,SVM
130,1,0,947,this would have been good for a hotel but not for hilton top of the line we stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room the concierge service ranged from outstanding to i ca be bothered but the front desk was outstanding two out of three breakfasts were terrible the buffet items were outstanding but after seating and the initial coffee the wait staff had to be called they never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet i felt they may have been shunning staff at lemuel bar and lounge generally did a good job,SVM
131,1,0,1102,the only good thing about this hotel is its location rooms are very small and becomes congested if you have even a little luggage very few options for breakfast wifi was bad especially in the floor,SVM
132,1,0,1111,the beds were decent the bathroom was worn with rust and discolored tile grout but it was all functional and very important for us well working ac the wifi however was painfully slow a limit of only devices was certainly an issue for us as we had to take turns getting on it,SVM
133,1,0,1154,the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,SVM
134,1,0,1157,i travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels that carry stars unfortunately in my opinion herbert park is at most when i moved into my there was silicone falling off in pieces above the mirror in the bathroom the wooden panel that covered the bottom of the tub was splitting and paint was chipping the pillows smelled in one of the hallways the wall phone was hanging by the wires etc i was moved immediately to a different which was little better but still faced the same issues i do have to give some credit to the staff everyone was friendly and the cleaning staff was superb all rooms need a face lift or a star needs to go,SVM
135,1,0,1183,no longer a doubletree hotel very disappointed with this hotel it is modern in design but lacks character we found the front desk staff to be rude others in the hotel ranged from pleasant to unpleasant charge daily for parking and breakfast is euro it is away from city centre so you will need to take transportation into the rest of dublin a bus stop is outside the hotel but the staff was not at all knowledgeable about the routes rooms were hot and had poor ventilation there was a portable air conditioner in the room but it did not perform well enough to cool the room even opening the windows would not bring in enough cool air,SVM
