0,me and my partner stayed here last week i can still feel my head pumping from the noise of the disco throughout the night i did realise on a thursday night i would have been kept awake on the third floor by the disco smallest hotel room i ever stepped foot in only plus for this hotel is reception staff were lovely and more than helpful,0
1,really nice place to stay breakfast was great rooms were clean and comfortable staff was pleasent and helpful they do have a night club there that can be loud check draws for ear plugs overall we enjoyed our stay,1
3,boy did we learn the hard way do your research before booking the only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location close to the city if i could grade this hotel with a or even a i would this is a star hotel with a popular nightclub on site warned about noise after check in even found the hotel provided ear plugs which did work we were provided with twin beds in a claustrophobic hotbox one small window which had to be closed at night to minimise the noise from the nightclub the ensuite was small and had a broken toilet lid and seat in the room there was outdated information regarding meals in reality we found breakfast available everyday lunch only mon friday no evening meals for guests on weekends bar on a saturday not open until for the nightclub no room service no obvious facilities for the nightclub proved to be a nightmare for us with the amount of noise generated and also the noise generated by the staff cleaning up and disposing of glass bottles at around am hotel does not provide parking and after being directed to a car park minutes walk away from the hotel that supposedly gave hotel guests a discounted rate we found that we were charged the normal rate wifi poor inconsistent unreliable the staff came across as indifferent and brusque towards hotel summary grossly overpriced accommodation for the poor accommodation and service it provides we do not recommended this hotel,0
4,got a cheek to call this a hotel an absolute was charged for nights in this hovel how do they get away with this in my opinion per night would be more suitable people take my advice go elsewhere my towel rail in the toilet was a rusty screw on the back of the door and we had lights hanging off the wall above the bed and a tv that went out of style in the s what a dump and in my opinion a death trap if a fire was to break out,0
5,the hotel was very cheap as dublin goes the service left a lot to be desired i stayed twice in june i felt both times with different receptionists that my arrival was an interruption the room was comfortable and clean the bathroom ont eh second occasion needed work,1
8,worst hotel i have stayed in there no ac holes in the door holes in bathtub dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till am someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous it probably has really good bones and could be redone as a boutique hotel the staff on the other hand was very kind when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air would recommend this to anyone,0
10,lovely olde worlde hotel spotlessly clean very nice rooms the decor is amazing could believe how many people were at the nightclub under the hotel on a tuesday evening could of been a pint offers security on door on an evening to stop people from club wandering into hotel great cooked breakfast next morning good choice of continental as well only fault i could pick beware the windows open very very wide be careful if you have children,1
11,stayed one night at a hugely overpriced rate got back to hotel at about midnight got to sleep at about made complaint at about to night manager mark who was very nice it must be said about the noise as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably i was aware of the nightclub when i made the booking and was prepared to be awake till around but is ridiculous nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle room faced onto the street and the windows are not double glazed the noise from the street coupled with the noise from the nightclub was deafening on checkout i refused to pay the full fee and without even coming to meet me and apologise the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount now while i appreciated the gesture the reduction only brought the charge down to the nightly rate which in my opinion is still overpriced this is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night and only get a little bit of sleep not for anyone who is going to bed,0
12,gorgeous period hotel we were more than pleased with our room really nice fireplace very quirky furniture and the making area was fab up a little flight of stairs its an old hotel and you get exactly what you expect form it the rates were the cheapest i seen in dublin for b b good breakfast excellent choice for the meat eaters i would have liked to had some fried mushrooms as i a vegetarian but otherwise lovely choice of continental too the staff were more than friendly the service is excellent the food and drinks were very cheap in dicey garden bar we were here on an anniversary trip i would not recommend this hotel if you are expecting a good nights sleep or you have kids you wont get it but as for me once my head hits the pillow especially after a few drinks i slept like a baby we had a great time,1
13,hotel is older but clean cozy yet comfortable we were looking for a place to lay out heads this fit the bill price was good you get what you pay for like the big bang theory the elevator does not work but we knew that ahead of time this hotel is in the heart of the temple district with shops bars and numerous restaurants just outside the door we found all forms of transit within simple walking distance staff is friendly no early checkin,0
14,this hotel cost us euros per night i would rather sleep on the street i do know where to staff friendly enough but they would have to be at rates like this the rest is dreadful room was foot above a very loud noisy night club youths congregated right below our room shouting smoking swearing and very loud music i had one hours sleep that all the room was hot so you had to open the window to cool down this let bugs into the room where i was bitten all hotel furniture is basically hand made rubbish gloss tv it must be years old inches square and foot off the ground with no remote so basically only one you are young and a very expensive place to rest your go to the more famous hotels there are plenty off them,0
15,stayed for nights and as per previous review writer i would probably rather sleep on the street if given the choice of returning the staff were friendly enough however the rooms were the most run down that i have ever seen in my employment i have seen very poor homeless accommodation that is like the ritz compared to the river house the street noise was unbelievable even with the windows shut avoid here if you are a remotely light sleeper the location is handy for central dublin but have your wallet ready to be ripped off throughout dublin the shower was powerful but the bathroom was very outdated and tiles were loose on the floor and roof the hotel recommended a parking block and with the hotel stamp we got a couple of euros off the parking bill beware do not park on this street outside this hotel as you are sure to be clamped we seen this frequently during our two day stay i did expect to stay at a top notch hotel but this is grim all visitors to the hotels looked disgruntled and miffed,0
16,the location is great next to the train station and public transportation the bus stop of to the airport is right next to the train station the breakfast is simple but i have no complaints because of the good price the room is clean and comfortable they gave me a quiet room,1
17,stayed here for two nights close to attractions and buses easy to find and bus from airport just stops around the corner staff are friendly and helpful very clean and tidy beds are comfy also restaurant down stairs is pricey and would be my only complaint,1
18,good hotel just on the outskirts of town next to the park bus station just across the road along with the tram would go back nice little hotel also you get a free continental breakfast also free wifi and a good pizza shop just a cross the road with a few shops,1
19,not too imposing from the outside but do be put off friendly staff clean rooms and a lift the only thing we missed was a cooked breakfast although that may have been our misunderstanding the complimentary breakfast appeared to consist of fresh juice cereals toast scone marmalade and jam with tea or coffee,1
20,location right next to phoenix park so walking distance to zoo and only short walk to main areas of dublin buses pass regularly bars in area staff we met were extremely helpful male receptionist checking in on monday july in afternoon could be more helpful told us about the area and where to eat and drink plus managed to check us in a little early as had an early flight and were both very tired room we had was very spacious cleaned everyday to a high standard my partner is a hotel housekeeper and she was very impressed with standard of rooms would definitely use this hotel again if in dublin,1
21,booked this hotel for a visit overnight to see coldplay in concert euro reserved on card met with a rather abrupt receptionist who handed us our key and left us to it up a narrow staircase we found our room brown musty loose fitting carpet flowed from the downstairs right up into our room the beds were at an l shape never seen before a door mat was set in front of one bed obviously to wipe your feet when getting out of bed sitting on the creaky bed i looked up to see that upstairs had leaked a lot of water that had run down the walls and dried in black spot everywhere the window rattled all night and when we woke up the next morning the sun shone through the moth holes in the curtains euro and not even a breakfast really disgraceful how do these people get away with calling that place a hotel a dog hotel would be more apt shameful and quite insulting that the owner would assume people would gladly stay and pay for the exceptionally poor excuse of accommodation,0
22,needed a for coldplay concert and saw leeson inn on for just under for night the fotos looked good and felt that for the price it must be good the reality was a dirty hole damp walls black spot all over curtains dirty brown carpet with car mats strategically covering stains badly broken glass in front window that permanently rattled noise from street all night the beds never seen a bed arrangement like it i could go on but could give the place any more airtime i would say that if you had a big smelly dog and needed to stay in an inn this would be the one as it has the ambiance of a dog kennel,0
23,picked as a relatively inexpensive option for one night prior to flying out of dublin so just looking for a basic place to sleep in a convenient location expected it to be noisy given the busy street did meet these expectations however a fresh coat of paint everywhere and a new mattress and pillows with even a bit of fluff to them would greatly improve the quality of the stay mattress was so saggy and lumpy that we could only sleep on the edges of the bed and pillows might as well have been folded blankets stuck in pillow case triple glazing on windows would also help,0
25,do be fooled by the photographs posted of the new refurbished room because like everyone else you will be told that they are not available and will not be available for the duration for your stay the hotel is very run down however it really only suitable for young people who do mind the noise from the nightclub below and do have very high standards the blonde receptionist was very rude but the male night was very welcoming,0
27,i stayed on the july and the hotel is as described it is no secret that the hotel is attached to a club or that its likely be noisey it is dublin and anywhere near the town is bound to be i had a double room which was bigger than i expected and yes it def not a star hotel but for the price and location it reasonable the room was clean along with the bathroom and clean towels in the room had a station a hairdryer and ironing facilities and a book to advise of local attractions and the hotel only critism i would have is that the shower head looked like it could be cleaned better and the bath had seen better days was clean but old and there were markings in some of the walls where fixtures had been moved and the wifi password in their handbook did not work but the receptionist did offer this when we checked in i would say if your looking a quiet hotel it not for you but if u need somewhere to crash close to town then it were pleasant both during check in and check out times so i would personally stay here again,1
28,exactly what it says on the tin the hotel is very pricey so do expect star luxury however it is right in the centre of temple bar so ideal for that the room was to a good standard and always kept clean daily however many improvements could be made but can not complain with the price we it is above a very busy bar i did hear this once during our stay but we were on the floor ideal for those who are planning on spending much time in the hotel and want to be right in the heart of temple bar,1
30,my daughter and i stayed at this hotel last week and we liked it quite well it was clean the staff friendly and the breakfast was good and we didnt need to stop for a lunch break as breakfast was filling the view was great too we were on the third floor and we saw and heard lots of seagulls and life going by on the millenium and ha penny bridges which were directly opposite the hotel the location was great you could go nearly everywhere on foot as it is very near to nearly all the attractions one negative review for people who tend to have dufficulty sleeping is that there is a pub under the hotel so there is a lot of noise till about in the morning however when one books one is told when booking that there will be noise in the evening till the early hours of the morning so one knows what to expect in our case we both slept well as after a long day of sightseeing shopping and ending the day with a beer or two we were usually tired out all in all we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to be within easy reach of main attractions,1
31,this hotel is extremely dated and dirty there are broken tiles on our bathroom floor and mold in our shower the hotel does not have in room so it loud with the windows open and all i hear are seagulls drunk people and traffic,0
33,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,0
34,where to begin in summary in years as a field engineer i have stayed in many hotels this without a doubt was the worst experience i have ever had i arrived on the monday morning having caught an early flight across to dublin our trusty team secretary had booked a room for me here at the time of booking it was known as camden hotel by thekeycollection arrived early but unable to book in so dropped my luggage off and went to work i arrived back at the hotel at hoping to check in and expecting a rest after my early start the room was available apparently it needed a clean a good sign and i eventually managed to get in at around chance of a rest due to the building works going on so i gave up on any prospect of relaxing until the evening some chance my room directly overlooked the bar area with a single glazed obscured window the music went on until ah well at least i could lie in in the morning nope workmen started at went off to work and then had a repeat of the previous night music until night had the added drama that when the music finished at i was able to grab some sleep until when some noisy guests moved in across the corridor my polite request for them to keep the noise down was met with a threatening response and after a few calls to the concierge they were,0
35,first off i booked this hotel on the recommendation of a tour guide on the basis it ticked all the boxes for a stag party the lads are nothing to raucous or salacious but certainly enjoy ourselves and love music the hotel in itself is clean and basic its also prepared for noise as each bed comes with earplugs but i cant fault it there it fit the my goodness the booking was a nightmare i had a deposit paid two months before our stay only to be hung up on when attempting to pay the rest of the bill in advance finally on sorting this out by having to go into the hotel a week prior to check in thankfully i work close by on check in when the other lads arrived again they were asked for more money i went to the reception and informed them that it had been paid in full using my credit card this was accepted but i was told they would have to look into it yet again leaving everything in the balance until checkout i have never stayed in such an unprofessional place that continually asks guests for money i realize they said it was a mistake fine but there was no recompense or real apology for this pretty large approx mistake but i does help the fact that they had my credit card details i could relax here tbh even if i were to be organizing another stag in dublin id,0
37,stayed here for nights with a friend in twin room we came here to see at croake park it within walking distance from croake park and temple rooms are basic with drinks making facilities and shower the room was cleaned after the first night good value for money and would stay again,1
39,all the advertising for this hotel mentions that it has its own bar does not turns out the bar was closed some months ago another misleading statement is free wifi wifi here is so weak it is unusable even for checking emails let alone anything more demanding we chose this hotel partly because it is close to the centre of dublin this is absolutely the only positive point i can make for it however it is not a nice area retrospect we should have stayed somewhere nicer and used the bus the prices seem cheap but you still get bad value for money as this place is little more than a room was tiny with broken furnishings burns all over the patched up carpet horrible bed uncomfortable the bathroom was shabby and cramped water in the shower constantly fluctuated in temperature making it hard work very noisy no double glazing and it would seem paper thin walls constant creaking of floorboards noise from tvs talking hotel feels they have a terrible system where they ask you to leave your key at reception whenever you leave the hotel but when you pick up a key checks who you are and the reception staff were different every day seems too easy for someone to just walk in and just get any key we took our valuables out with us at all times despite the dubious thing is that there is no drinkable water from the taps unsafe due to lead pipes we,0
41,this was the worst hotel experience i ever had i was hesitant to book in the first place but had issues with my flight and needed a place to stay the hotel offered a off promo on their website which they then did not honor when i explained my booking experience and showed the discount to the hotel staff member at reception he said the discount had already been included but he was able to tell me the full price before discount it was a complete scam he was incredibly unprofessional do stay here the area is also not that great getter off finding a hotel south of the river,0
43,bad in every way dont stay over priced out of date not acceptable in this day and age and expensive for what it is i was booked in here for nights with my daughter for a course she was doing the night watchman was unhelpful the room was small and smelled stale we got up early went across the road for breakfast as there was no way id eat anything in barrys we booked in across the road times nicer rooms and surroundings lovely staff and much less money too so just go across the road if you need to be near this place,0
44,initially we booked a hotel miles away from the city centre then came across barry hotel the price was cheaper and is literally around the corner from street high street the room was a decent size and to a good clean standard there was always someone on reception to assist if needed and a breakfast could be provided at an additional cost of the odd improvement could have been made to the interior here and there but this was not an issue for us as we were paying to stay at the hilton the fire alarm did sound once or twice during the early morning but stopped before we had a chance to react the windows were only single glazed expectant of a georgian period building so the odd bit of traffic could be heard although if you truly commit to irish culture getting to sleep after a long day of exploring dublin should be an summary we would definitely stay here again but if you used to staying at more high end establishments this hotel may not be for you the location saved us a lot of time and energy and the staff were helpful and polite if we ever look to visit dublin again this hotel will be our first choice,1
46,the staff are lovely really helpful kind and friendly however the hotel is falling apart it grubby at best filthy in parts the breakfast is horrible any price is too much i stayed here loads of times in the past and always thought it was acceptable for the price and the fabulous location not anymore it needs to be closed down and renovated it could be lovely the location is great,0
47,my mom and i stayed here while exploring dublin for a few days from the dublin airport we took the aircoach bus route to street it was just a short walk rolling our bags to the hotel it costs euros each round trip the location of the hotel is great and everything we saw was within walking distance dublin castle temple bar cathedral christ church cathedral the brazen head and tons of to see the guinness storehouse you may want to take a cab for around euros maybe and the hotel can call one for you the book of kells is also close by at trinity college the room itself was clean and comfortable we asked for a quiet room so ours faced a little courtyard the room was quiet except for a rattle in the hvac but it did keep us up at night the room has a thermostat so it comfortable to your liking the beds were nice the shower worked i had no drain or hot water issues the staff was very friendly and helpful we did eat breakfast there so i ca comment on that,1
48,i stayed at the tara towers hotel for nights i felt during my stay that the hotel was very service minded a special thank to mark the room was very clean the breakfast was great containing with all kind of things you wish moreover the hotel room was nice with comfortable furnitures a cosy pub with good meal was linked to the hotel tara towers finally its easy to take a bus from the hotel in to the centre of dublin even the flight bus was stopped next to the hotel,1
49,pleasantly surprised at this conveniently situated hotel for the port and airport very comfortable rooms good bathrooms some aspects of the building are a bit tired and dated but the place is clean and the staff are helpful breakfast was good and dinner in the bar was good value in quite an expensive city would stay there again at the right price,1
50,this hotel is a major dump some of the staff not all there was one young man who was so helpful in finding us a taxi after telling us that uber does have enough cars there were so rude and disinterested they should really find another job the room had lights that were broken some hanging out of the ceiling one of the night tables had a handle pulled off so they simply drilling another hole to the right and put another in the shower was built for people tall and the floor of the bathtub was so slippery that my year old niece fell and thought she broke her leg it is a terrible hotel pay a little more and stay somewhere else,0
51,stayed here nights concert weekend in a standard room facing the the hotel is located a bit outside dublin center but the tendering due to the was limited and prices were high taxi to center is train station nearby to center per room was a bit old stylish but beds were quite good there were some noise from the neighbor room and the buffet service was rating is low due price value consideration we payed per room and for that we expect more but maybe that what to expect during dates,0
52,there is an overall feeling of the hotel being tired it is a bit like it not sure what it wants to be and would really benefit from a lick of said the staff make up for it they are really helpful and kind i honestly thought that the guy that checked us out was going to give us a hug as he walked us to the is always worth booking direct with he hotel as you get a better had a lovely sea view which is always a great way to start the was typical of irish hotels,1
54,rooms are not very clean bathroom looked brand new kettle hair on sunday night but i knew that as it was mentioned on the web beer garden and sports bar next is included in murray s staff are irish you,1
55,a wonderful hotel great for the sights in the city very friendly and helpful staff we booked a twin and got a room with double beds the room was very clean and comfortable huge irish breakfast with smaller options for us wimps breakfast is served in murrays bar which is attached to the hotel and is very comfortable we were served by bernie who is a wonderful lady and made us very welcome this hotel will go on my favourites list for any further trips to dublin,1
56,location is good rooms are clean although on the small size however the beds are not too comfortable and the noise from the pub downstairs is unbearable in other countries this place would just not get a licence as a hotel we would recommend travellers to keep off this noisy place,0
59,stayed her for one night check in was quick but we were asked to pay on the arrival a bit unusual informed that breakfast was an additional ten euro which could be paid in the restaurant in the morning but this was wrong we had to go back to reception pay and get vouchers then go back to the restaurant also enquired at the main reception if the spa sold swimsuits and told no so went into dublin to buy one but i checked the next morning at the spa and they do indeed sell swimwear so could have bought one there you also have to pay deposits for towels and lockers and buy swimhats decided not to bother breakfast was awful very poor choice definately not worth ten euro each apple juice was like water no flavour at all very disappointed with looked out on a flat roof with lots of air con equipment supposed to be fifteen minutes walk from croke park more like thirty five,0
60,my niece had her communion here and we were happy at all with the food i had chicken wings for starter which had barely any meat on them and got about on the plate the mains came out about minutes after and i got penne pasta which was absolutely vile to say the least the pasta was dry and hard and the sauce tasted like tinned tomatoes it was basically day old pasta with a tin of tomatoes poured over it with no meat or anything disgusting,0
61,ok hotel needs improvement but no negatives with staff or rooms i stayed in room on the of august when dublin was very busy right from our entry at reception until we left the staff were exceptional reception staff and bar staff excellent i lost my bank card and the receptionist made sure i did not have to pay for parking but was more worried that i got it sorted it was the girl with blonde hair on at pm on the staff one bar man in particular made it his to make us feel at home i think his name was niall the hotel has had its fair share of negativity but from belfast it great if you driving as it next to motorway again dated but if your in dublin to comment on a family trip this is the bus outside every mins fare into city centre,1
62,we spent nights at the dawson hotel our room was comfortable the staff particularly those at the front desk were excellent the hotel is near many of the tourist attractions public transportation and you do want to hear the noise from their club sam be sure to ask for a quiet said on friday and saturday nights the noise from the club including the techno music beat can be heard in all rooms of the hotel and even worse the cigarette smoke from the club wafts up into the entire hotel,1
63,stayed in the deluxe junior suite for our wedding weekend it was one of the most beautiful and largest rooms we ever stayed like a palace and the perfect place for our bridal party to get ready in really enjoyed our stay here the staff were fantastic helping us in and out with our luggage a warm welcome on check in and check out and did really notice the noise at all as some other reviewers had mentioned the only downside is the hotel does do a full cooked breakfast only continental not great if you have a wheat allergy but as it so central there plenty of nearby places to go out for breakfast we really enjoyed our stay here and will hopefully back to relive it soon,1
64,this is a funky elegant hotel in dublin just off stephen green a great location we had a very mix d experience that the hotel made right the room was funky chic think crystal chandelier in bathroom that featured a deep slope top claw foot tub there was all night construction outside our window that we were warned about after a relatively sleepless night complained and asked for full refund within a couple days manager sent an email apologizing and giving requested refund in my opinion stuff happens making it right is what matters my wife and i agree we would definitely stay here again our warning is to either be sure construction completed or you get a room that does not overlook dawson street on other matters friendly helpful staff not very disabled friendly so far as i could tell i rated very good as i sure the hotel is under normal circumstance if you like funky clean but not pristine in a great location this is for you,1
65,there were a few notes and notices from management about people who complain etc but i do see what they would be complaining about we had a lovely twin room ensuite car parking extra clean tidy great for the price could walk to most places in half an hour,1
66,an overnight stay whilst in dublin in this very clean and welcoming hotel the rooms comfortable and clean and although basic that is reflected in the very reasonable price the hotel is situated just outside the city but within easy access with good transport in also not too far from the ferry terminal and has a small car park to the rear of the hotel,1
67,what a wonderful quirky hotel great transport links into the city good value accommodation with witty comments everywhere excellent food in the white moose but at an additional costbonus was that burnley beat shamrock rovers budget hotel,1
68,stayed here last monday with my girlfriend and baby and we could have been location is great minute drive to city centre and only a short drive from phoenix staff were all so friendly and helpful and the room was just right and at euro for the night including parking an absolute bargain for in the infamous white moose was absolutely excellent we were pleasantly surprised with how good it actually will definitely stay here again,1
70,near to airport shuttle bus available at certain times early morning and later in the taxi from airport approx euros good value compared to other hotels friendly staff local supermarket take away pizza nearby,1
71,impressed with the size of the room and the bed was very comfortable i and my partner both managed to get two consecutive good nights sleep however there were exposed plaster and curious large dark marks on one wall the window did not close properly because one handle was broken and just spun had to put the kettle on the floor to boil water because there were no power sockets located near enough to the beverage shower did not work properly and made a horrendous noise when we tried to switch it on we did manage to get water coming out of the side of the shower head and trickling out of the base but we gave up because the inside of the bath beneath the shower was peeling from the effects of being painted with vinyl paint and had a large rusty stain where one of the taps was constantly dripping see photos we decided that it was safer to resort to standing up washes over the badly neglected vanity wash basin see photos again in the bathroom the window was completely devoid of a handle and what is so surprising is that the lack of a fixing was so obvious to customers the bathroom door handle was broken and hanging off on both sides and the door itself well see more photos we were only in dublin for three days so we laughed all this off and decided that the most important thing was a good nights sleep,0
72,we stayed here for one night we were very disappointed in the hotel and staff at arrival with the car we saw a lot of alcoholics around the hotel not the thing you like to see with a small child the lady at the reception was so ignorant i could believe it i asked when i booked the room for a cot but there was no cot in the room when my husband went down to reception to ask for one it was such a big deal to get one for us we had a room to the back of the hotel and it was so loud from all the people outside and also music and also the smell from cigarette smoke from the outside of the pup was unreal all i say i will never again stay in this hotel,0
73,we needed a convenient hotel to stay in with airport shuttle for our early morning flight out of dublin this place is located in a sort of wasteland we pulled up the cab driver did even know this place was here seemed afraid to just leave us here there was a group of loud guys from the pub next door outside our room was typical travelodge but the view outside was a crappy apartment complex with loud people we were hungry but i did want to walk around the sketchy neighborhood no way would i ever go here again,0
75,a lady checked us in who was nice and as we arrived at agreed to let us check in at rather than the usual she left and got another receptionist to take over name was emilio who was comparably less accommodating than the first lady he was very rude and made us feel like we were school children being told off rather than enduring good customer service we asked for adjacent rooms and he said if its available and not that he try he was very dismissive and had a very bad attitude inside the hotel it was clean and the rooms were clean but the shower cream was empty but luckily there was a supermarket where we were able to buy some toiletries as the toilet provided none but tissue paper hence the price we paid for it the room was too hot and the window only opened a few inches there was no other ventilation or air conditioning so had no choice but to sleep in a very warm room we had breakfast at the hotel and considering we had it at and it was not very busy it was a big let down that they had ran out of orange juice but we had no other drink but milk the area was a bit rough and because it was a warm room we had to have the windows open we had to listen to drunken men outside shouting at each other also witnessed one of them urinating,0
76,this place had gotten fine reviews in my home country but i was still surprised how fresh and clean the rooms were this place is in a good location for exploring dublin and is great value for money only complaints would be that there no elevator and that the pillows were a bit too hard for my taste but hey all in all this is a excellent b b highly recommended,1
78,i stayed at gardiner lodge during my visit to dublin i know the hotel and must confess that i was a little bit worried about the few reviews bit it turned out to be a nice surprise it is a beautiful georgian location the location is good not very far from o connell street there are plenty of restaurants markets and shops around at night it seems is a stop of the airlink bus going to the airport in front of the building which is very we have the chance to take the breakfast every day because our day tours were very early but the staff would leave some basic products for us like coffee and only day we took breakfast it was good the staff serves you in your table and the food is the room is small but very clean the shower is good the internet works fine the bed was the staff was really nice helpful and friendly with us have no since the standard rooms are small if you have lots of baggage it might be difficult to walk inside the room since it have a lot of space but other than that i have no complaints,1
79,beautiful house less than minutes walk from the river and main centre i booked rooms in total and everyone was more than happy with their room very clean and comfortable every single member of staff we encountered were so friendly and helpful perfect,1
80,i enjoyed the proximity to the national theater as i was attending an event there for three days also relatively close to the major sites the rooms were clean and everything was in working order the staff was also very friendly,1
81,gardiner lodge has undergone a refurbishment and the results are excellent we had the handicapped basement room even though we are not incapacitated in any way it was perfect and right near the breakfast room the staff are wonderful and everything was just perfect the only thing was small towels but i believe this is going to be rectified you can walk to everything with ease it was a great first stop in dublin,1
82,staff very pleasant we had a triple room clean basic we where at a music festival with a group of girls some stayed on the first floor some on the second the girls on the first floor had no sleep as the music was thumping into their room throughout the night from the beer garden nightclub bar you are supplied with earplugs in the drawer they got some discount the next day after complaining we paid each for breakfast but it was not worth it fine for but i would recommend for a family,0
83,loud music until am every night no accommodations made to help filter the noise light curtain on window no air conditioner no sound insulation whatsoever at one point in the night i wanted to stuff the single bed mattress covers and pillows against the window to block out the noise all they gave was ear plugs our adult children were traveling with us and enjoyed the club the first night however they had an early flight out the second night and did get any sleep even though their room was around the corner from the was a real issue as we were aware of the fact that we had to park several blocks away with a discounted staff is courteous and very friendly rooms are dated but adequate,0
84,clean and quiet when i was there though it was a week night welcoming staff allowed an early and were helpful recommending restaurants room spacious and comfortable would happily stay again,1
85,stayed here for just midweek evening thankfully we booked rooms and were given neighbouring rooms on the floor overlooking the check in my key card refused to work for my room i went back down for them to reactivate it and climbed back up the stairs this happened three times before i could get in to the room it looked pleasant enough upon entering but there was a lot of noise from the busy road out front so i went to shut the window only it was open that genuinely just the noise you have to put up with through the paper thin window hopefully you are not a light sleeper like i from there it all went down hill my bedside lamp did work the socket by the bed had something snapped inside there was something under the radiator which i hoped was just an old malteser that had been missed when the room was supposedly cleaned the bathroom was also very tired looking the soap tray under the shower was only just hanging on to the the plus side the bed was comfortable and linen and towels were clean the bar downstairs has a superb interior and great it a great location but at the end of the day i expect a good night sleep from any hotel the other mishaps only added to my annoyance from lack of sleep and given the price of these rooms i not even the slightest bit tempted to review at more,0
86,perfect location so close to the bars and restaurants and a short walk over the bridge to the shops the staff were very friendly and helpful which made for a nice warm welcome the rooms were fairly old with only available power point but overall very quiant clean and comfortable our room was facing the busy street at the front of the hotel so it was rather noisy through the night with traffic and passerbys but other than that we enjoyed our stay,1
87,great location quintessential dublin experience excellent attached bar walking distance all points of interest breakfast included and great parking expensive no parking on site use drury street lot,1
88,we had a table booked as part of a hen do we ordered of a set menu choice of starters mains and desserts once we had sat down it took a while for us to be acknowledged and the service was slow for the whole we only ever saw waiter would be a lot better if they had more staff they sat us in a dark corner was provided at the table however he asked us if we wanted to order drinks then before we answered ran off and did return for minutes so we had to go downstairs and order wine at the food was hit and miss the starters were all delicious however the burger i had was over cooked and served cold the music was extremely loud and difficult to talk as a group as could hear people across the table drinks were extremely were only toilets for the ladies not enough for a venue of this size so gave up queuing to go at one point must have been waiting minutes also one toilet had no toilet roll this is more of a bar than a restaurant even then drinks are very overpriced probably due to it also being a hotel mostly tourists visiting overall i would not recommend this hotel for a meal for a hen party,0
89,on arrival we were greeted by friendly staff at reception and booked into our first floor room within a couple of minutes with no hassle at all there was a small lift near the reception desk or you can take the stairs the groundfloor was homely and decorated in the edwardian style of the era of the hotel itself and had rooms off the reception area where you could sit in peace and quiet if you wished and admire the decor and stylish was a doorway leading from reception into the bar area which could also be accessed from another door in the street if you go in the bar off the street you see a plaque on the wall as you enter telling you that george bernard shaw once lived in the building that is now the harcourt hotel our room was very clean and and well presented big enough for two and with an ensuite that was well maintained and clean we were very pleased with it the bed looked very clean and comfortable and on closer inspection it was a good nights sleep was on the cards and it certainly did disappoint after a great day visiting the guinness store and walking around dublin it was a nice bolt hole to return to as you had the bar next door which served a good choice of hot or cold food and plenty of beers and cocktails were on display as you expect the odd guinness was taken,1
90,hotel was basic but everything you need if you just looking to explore dublin and do want to spend too much money on a place to sleep room was small but comfy and clean free breakfast was great wifi was rather spotty so do plan to do work or streaming there location was really convenient we had heard that it was a rough area but we were totally fine even late at night bar downstairs is very cute and fun,1
92,excellent location walk from the room was small and bathroom tiny but clean enough a little noisy at nights because of the traffic and pubs in the at reception was ok you just have to ask if you need anything because they wo ask you first esther in care of breakfast is lovely and wifi in the hotel apart from the lobby,1
94,stayed here june room was clean but the pub downstairs was fabulous great music and good old tradional irish food great vibe in the pub and just loved clapping along to the fantastic music definitely worth a stay,1
97,we really liked this hotel the bus stop to the airport is close by as are shops and pubs we had a nice quiet room on the first floor which was cleaned every day the breakfast is great en we enjoyed our stay very much,1
98,pluses perfect location close to everything including a bus station from where you can get a bus or taxi to the airport nice walk to the city centre minutes away the hotel and rooms are finished with enough good materials breakfast rather good big and comfortable room disadvantages small and uncomfortable bathroom strange numeration of rooms for ex next to food could be better some elements destroyed for ex wallpapers,1
100,we stayed in the central as it was one of the very few hotels in dublin available now we know why it was its tired and worn out small old fashioned rooms with no double glazing to block out the street noise which continues until after the general decor is old and worn the curtain in our room was splattered with what appeared to be liquid makeup and the standard of cleanliness in general was wouldnt recommend staying,0
101,great location great old hotel wonderful atmosphere especially the library bar staff helpful and friendly downsides are no and you get street noise all night but easy walking distance to sites shopping and nightlife,1
102,unlike the pictures on their website the room was very very tiny the two twin beds were actually pushed together and with a nightstand on both sides of the beds that was the extent of the width of the room the floor boards in the entire hotel creaked and moaned as you walked across the floor the window opened all of inches with no air conditioning and only a fan to cool down the room we felt like we were sleeping in a sauna it was horrible the shower had no cold water we called to get it checked out twice when they fixed it the second time the water went from scalding to hot and for some reason the cold water from the sink no longer was cold either try brushing your teeth with warm water yuk we tried to spend the entire day sight seeing because we dreaded spending any time in the teeny hot room,0
103,i lived in europe and have traveled extensively throughout the continent but had never been to ireland until recently kellys hotel was definitely a great place to stay perfect close to everything and i walked everywhere i was unaffected by the noise from the bar had requested a room in back but i will say that the seagulls were pretty loud early in the morning when it was still dark bed was very comfortable and was easy breakfast very convenient loved that they had an safe but it was a bit small my ipad would fit the shower was small which was an issue for me but larger people might be upset water pressure was in the back was great for noise but horrible for any kind of view kellys should commission an artist to paint something bright and colorful on the concrete wall across from their hotel,1
104,a bit old in appointments but very welcoming staff makes it pleasant old wood velvet lounges you get the picture good tea selection cookies and spring water in room large bath and large comfortable bed for height of tourist hun bub its quiet and that is great,1
106,it started with finding a parking in dublin near the hotel phew carry luggage to the hotel negotiate flight of stairs no lifts only to be told your bedroom is another three flight of stairs not a good start to a in our room it was beautiful but so very hot no fans available the window just opens a tad i wanted to scream breakfast was continental and well laid out,0
107,a very good travelodge on the outer edges of the city but a good walk in and the busess stop right outside and are every few minutes so no problem with getting in and out no cafe onsite but a cafe a few doors down that does a really good breakfast and was reasonably priced,1
108,very good clean bedrooms big size clean bathrooms and friendly staff close to city and public transport thought it should be a little cheaper though the wifi was excellent defintely recommend it,1
110,soulless exorbitant cube with nowhere near enough furniture and sporadic staff and hardworking housekeepers redeem an otherwise grey establishment busy main road in a pleasant area with the splendid café moda nearby,0
111,room was nice bit small but considering it is in rathmines and bus stop and supermarket just outside it was ok using dublin bus city center is not far way temple bar and other locations for night life nearby also charlemont luas station is mins walking distance and considering most of the day tour start from city center it is a nice location as city center is like mins walking or mins by bus depending on quite a few fooding options within walking distance overall nice place to was nice and clean,1
112,stayed in the house hotel with friends and it was very convenient beside croke park as we were up for an event the rooms are quite small but very clean which is most important nice and quiet outside so no disruption to ones sleep,1
114,we have just returned from a night stay in this hotel firstly i would like to say that whoever gave this place a star rating needs to go back and check again on arrival the first thing that struck us was the overwhelming smell of stale cooking the triple room we paid over for was the size of a postage stamp with not enough room to move around in one of the beds was so near the entrance door that we had to keep pushing it back so that we could close double bed was pushed right up against the wardrobe with very little space between that bed and the single one to give an indication of how small this room was the tea and coffee facilities were in the wardrobe because there was no space for them anywhere else the bathroom had no space to move around in and had a damp mouldy smell we were told that toiletries would be supplied so bought none with us but all that was provided was a hand wash by the sink and an empty shower gel dispenser in the shower we queried this and were told we could have some toiletries that other guests had left behind our room was next to the fire exit door but when we looked there were stacks of chairs a folded up table broken mirrors with shards of glass all over the floor and a henry hoover blocking the stair case not the easiest or,0
115,i booked two rooms at this hotel recently the rooms are not large but are very comfortable there is a pleasant bar and a dining room on management and staff were very pleasant and helpful the hotel is in a quiet residential area close to the botanical gardens and within walking distance of dublin city centre however there are busses available on botanic road and drumcondra road as well as a train service at drumcondra use this hotel again,1
116,we have spent sature au night of july in this hotel and are very disappointed we have been warned that there was a party going on just under our room when we booked the room this should have been a minimum to warn music was very loud and even the floor was vibrating we had a flight at on sunday so woke up à without being able to sleep before am when i asked info on that party to the night receptionist and if we could change room or a have a reduced price due to the circumstances all he could say was that it normal in dublin saturday is in the town center and that if we want calm we have to choose a b b i sorry but i worked for months in the clarence hotel in temple bar and i can tell that it was very quiet last time we went in dublin last year we slept in another hotel closest to the city center and it was very quiet too additionnal to this the flush was very slow really comfortable when you are in a room the beds are ridiculously small i and my feet were out of the bed and we paid for this i sent a mail to the hotel manager a week ago and no answer sure we wo come back,0
117,reception staff was very friendly beds comfortable and rooms very clean hotel is located right in the heart of the city centre so what more would you want to enjoy your mini trip to dublin the breakfast was divine could hope for more would highly recommend it,1
118,being someone who travels extensively for work i can say i experience my fair share of dump hotels this place however tops them by a good way it pure nasty so where do i begin i start with minor grievance of only towel in a bed room i had towels in a no star hotel in lobito the front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless could not offer alternative room when i complained at the rooms allocated small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it a little on the snug side our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get was the sympathetic front desk reply the all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day the photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of guinness would i be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online to top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of in what way was that even remotely possible the only way i can get my head around that if if the catagory was the,0
121,stay in dublin on business frequently have not stayed here before very central and easy to find rooms slightly dated however very comfortable and clean had dinner in their restaurant food and service were fantastic great breakfast and to put the icing on the cake great value for money compared to other big chain hotels would highly recommend will definitely stay there again,1
122,stayed here for the weekend of the coldplay concert it is super modern seriously could not complain about anything rooms perfect on site restaurant perfect staff perfect and all within a short walk of everything will definitely come again,1
123,the hotel is subtly located inside it brings a welcoming atmosphere and the staff are very very helpful i was needing to print some papers for a presentation and they were very glad to do it for free the business lounge though small is also cozy with a great view of part of the city the person in charge of the lounge she is very courteous with a lovely smile she helps a lot to make you settle comfortably thanks,1
124,great hotel stayed here for business meeting and after flying hours the staff could not have been more helpful stayed on level with club access very high tech room and extremely quite across from the train and tram station and right around the corner from talbot street they do a great breakfast and room service is excellent only critique was they did take down my credit card details which meant i had to pay as i went for the breakfast and room service but the staff were very helpful each time will stay here again if ever back in dublin,1
125,have to give this hotel stars we stayed in a club king room staff at reception were great and we were shown to our room hotel room was lovely beautiful bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable went up to club lounge water was complimentary we even had a complimentary packet of crisps and dairy milk in our room which i forgot to eat unfortunately only one thing the coffee pods supplied were espresso would prefer a cappuccino or americano will definitely return,1
127,clean full bathroom quiet good location i was very comfortable here adelphi bar in hotel is convenient i have nothing more to say characters is a bit much to require ridiculous nothing more to add,1
128,we chanced upon this hotel after our original hotel failed to meet our expectations sharon the manager warmly greeted us and immediately went to work finding rooms for us for the week at a very resonable price we had the best stay in a fabulous area because of the hospitality of sharonville and richie they made our vist enjoyable of course having the pub downstairs was very convenient for food and drink mostly drink lol clean comfortable rooms with fans and windows that open for a nice dublin breeze we honestly did not experience noise from the pub downstairs at any time we were on the of floors they offered us umbrellas when it rained converter outlets so we did need to buy any which by the way they have in the lobby if you wish to buy along with lots of brochures so you can find many many things to do and they were always interested in your day when you came back such nice people bagel shop with great sandwiches and coffee on the corner as well as a marks and spencer wonderful food store across the street min walk to temple bar area min walk to street and the hop on hop off yellow bus stop everything was close by the best part about our stay was the staff we definitely be back thank you,1
130,this is not an easy review because there are pros about this place although i would choose to stay here again it is dated but clean it is in a very convenient area where you can walk to most everything with the farthest location being minutes guinness tour st stephens zoo graftin street trinity college etc i felt like it was too expensive for the room we had a triple room two adults and two kids and it was small a bit hot and right above the bar the tram goes by on abbey st which was too bad but in the end it is worth what we paid,0
131,we stayed two nights the receptionist kindly swapped one of the room so that we had adjacent ground floor rooms and could create a apartment between them microwave fridge sink basic crockery and cutlery provided in each apartment supermarkets within easy reach nice walk to south to canal and then east along canal by georgian houses easy to walk to city centre only downside the front ground floor room was bathed in floodlighting until about midnight seems to belong to the restaurant next door and the receptionist did try to get it switched off earlier take eyeshades if staying on this side of the building,1
132,booked in a hurry via a website i picked the best deal combined with proximity to my ultimate destination the room is absolutely fine clean functional and suited my needs lovely pub below which doubles up as the breakfast bar in the and down to earth staff a great location a little off the track but still easily accessible to the centre of town loved it and would definitely stay here,1
133,i stayed here for a total of nights recently i booked this as expedia said there was ac however we go to the place a bit out of the way from main and to our surprise there was no ac staff hours are very limited so we were even able to get a fan when we complained they said they ca keep fans in the room due to fire hazards in addition on our last night we switched rooms this one was even hotter i did sleep and the room looked like it had been cleaned hair in the bed and make up on the pillows hair in the shower definitely not worth over euros i complained to the staff and through expedia and they thought euro credit was enough mind you there was false advertising on the website definitely would not recommend and will not be back,0
134,herbert park is a wonderful property that combines great service at reasonable prices in a fantastic location we thoroughly enjoyed the friendly staff and their ability to accommodate our early arrival,1
135,the food was very continental and there was no attempt to provide food to the largest population segment in the world asia and china and the middle east the kitchen was ill equipped for turning up even basic food say rice and lentils or curried veggies the bangladeshi cook paritosh served thai condiments and passed it as indian curry asians are big spenders so take care of them and the vegetarians second kindly drop the euro service charge for sending anything to rooms,1
136,we had our tea this evening in the terrace lounge area of the herbert park and the food and the surroundings were beautiful two people had the tagliatelle one had caesar salad one had soup and toasted sandwich and i had baked salmon with chive mash everything was just gorgeous having said that what made the evening even better was the service we received from dharam he was friendly helpful and a joy to talk to we always enjoy the food in the herbert park but we will especially be looking forward to our next visit in the hopes of once again having the pleasure of meeting him thank you dharam for making our visit so enjoyable,1
137,i had a wonderfull stay in the herbert park hotel for weeks especially dharam and samer were the perfect hosts in the hotel bar were i enjoyed a drink every evening they can make really nice cocktails,1
138,great location to walk into dublin city centre happy and welcoming staff absolutely fantastic breakfast buffet spread i never seen so much variety comfortable rooms with lovely decor and wonderful park right next door,1
140,i stay in this hotel very regularly on business and can not fault it at all it is very homely staff are very pleasant and the bar food is top are very comfortable clean and modern and there is a great car park on site with plenty of tried various other hotels in the area cheaper and more expensive and this is the best prices are very very reasonable i would highly recommend this not just for business but for family breaks or short away from home is not so much of a chore in this spot,1
141,a smallish hotel in a pleasant area with friendly staff the rooms and food were of good quality and the area quiet nearby is sandymount village with shops and pubs and a little further on is a beach which provided a pleasant evening walk,1
142,the sandymount hotel is a good choice located in sandymount quarter it is easy to reach the center of dublin by the dart train at the end of an ireland trip it is very easy to drive to the airport within minutes,1
143,we stayed in the sandymount for the sunday night of the longitude festival first impression really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything there was a really relaxed feel in the hotel people were just sitting around chilling in various locations there are chairs and sofas around every corner so nice the people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to beatrice she went above and beyond about mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share saving us both money i thought it was a lovely touch she was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before silly maybe but we both agreed that beatrice kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend the beer garden is really lovely while we did get to eat at the hotel other than late night pizza but i think you could honestly go to the sandymount and not leave the grounds at one point i thought we would just forget longitude and stay in the garden we were driving so with regards to public transport i am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is with the aviva stadium i assume they are but not least a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception,1
144,as a single woman traveler visiting dublin for business i found this to be a comfortable and authentic irish experience there is live music and meal service every night in an amiable irish pub environment service desk is excellent,1
145,the room and bathroom were clean and the location was convenient to a served by the dublin airport express route the staff were very friendly and helpful and they were gracious enough to let us check in a few hours early to get a much needed nap the was thankfully has easy walking access to christchurch cathedral shopping and several restaurants it also not too far from trinity college and other major attractions in the breakfast menu was a little limited particularly from the perspective of my spouse who prefers lighter fare and ca eat wheat but i really enjoyed getting the full irish there they provide free tea instant coffee for the rooms but no only serious negative was the noise from their nextdoor neighbor the church for some archaic reason christchurch cathedral still thinks it appropriate to ring its bells every minutes all night bring earplugs,1
146,really enjoyed staying here the staff was very friendly the in house breakfast was excellent and the room was nice the location for wondering around downtown dublin was excellent would definitely stay here again,1
147,the harding hotel provided us a wonderful accommodations experience in dublin we were originally scheduled to stay in iceland and then fly to ireland after our initial flight was cancelled to iceland the hotel was nice enough to extend our stay more days last minute so that we could fly in early to dublin the location is perfect being off the busy and noisy temple bar district but also being only a walk to temple bar and the river it allows for walking distance to all the main sights in dublin and there is a bus stop right outside our hotel room overlooked the courtyard of the christ church cathedral the room was always cleaned well and we did not have any disturbances from outside noise our adjoining rooms the front desk was tremendously accommodating to all our needs and quick to provide any suggestions for restaurants or live music that we were interested in we certainly recommend the harding house hotel for any stay that you may have in dublin,1
148,we spent days in dublin and loved the harding hotel for the location and helpful staff walking distance to many of dublin tourist attractions room was clean and a good size but wish the lighting was better also we found we had to unplug the tv so that we could charge our phones and ipad we always bring an extension cord so that helped with putting our phones on the nightstands enjoyed the irish music food and entertainment at the darkey kelly pub located in the hotel oscars cafe bar christchurch is a good breakfast place around the corner on fishamble street overall we enjoyed our stay,1
149,we booked rooms here total quests for nights first time in a jurys inn rooms very clean everywhere was very clean breakfast was the best yet staff very friendly would highly recommend we got a bus from the airport drop off was min walk from hotel,1
150,staff very friendly and helpful hotel clean and well maintained excellent central location in dublin only issue we had was around parking we had booked stay it indicated parking available but when we arrived this not so we could disembark at the hotel as it had traffic pulled in we ended up going further down road to large city centre car park when we enquired around parking facilities at the hotel they informed us that they had a discounted deal with nearby car park cleary q park we then had to move car to it albeit we had to pay other car park fees for time spent within it it would have been very useful to have known this prior to arrival,1
151,dublin is a beautiful place but even more so during the christmas holidays we have stayed at jury inn parnell street the year before and was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the warm homely atmosphere so we decided to return but with breakfast included this time breakfast was amazing plenty of choice for fussy eaters just like my youngest son will be coming back again for christmas,1
152,friendly reception nice neat room for adults and children very helpful front desk the breakfast was excellent our dinner experience was exceptionally excellent the menu had plenty of choices tasty food and moderately priced restaurant was quiet and a cozy place to sit and talk over dinner,1
153,in a very central location not far from street you can walk to the gpo museum and the hop on hop off buses depart just opposite it the airbus from the airport also has a stop nearby easy to walk to the river and bars good size rooms décor just as you would expect from jurys what made this an exceptional stay was the breakfast an excellent choice on the buffet and the hot food was kept fresh it was as good a breakfast as i had in many more expensive hotels at the moment there are serious road works going on in dublin and there are some just outside the hotel there is only a small pull in drop off area outside i left the car in a nearby shopping centre until i found the hotel and checked in they will give you directions to a nearby car park and validate your ticket for a discount,1
154,we have just come back from nights at the parliament hotel room were basic but could see what other people were moaning about i personally stayed in worser hotels rooms did what was sleep in no issues with the bed slept like a log all nights cuz of all the walking round the city staff were helpful everytime we asked something ventured down to the pub and one afternoon we had a quick snack food was lovely location was good right on the edge of temple bar will be visiting the hotel when we return again,1
156,went as two couples for my birthday weekend good location with most attractions in walking distance got to the hotel early and was allowed to leave bags whilst waiting for room there leaflets at reception with discounts off activities there is lifts to all three through when it came to paying we ended up paying for because of the exchange rate or something to better to to avoid paying euros more than in a double room with bath the room itself was spacious but the bathroom was cramped could have a poo brush your teeth and have a shower at the same time ran water for a bath and it came out dirty for about a minute few stains etc on furniture outdated furniture and accessories such as hairdryer was poor or like the steam press just did work beds were singles put together but thankfully was a poor to average experience basically paying for the location,0
157,not brilliant rooms thread bare carpets on main stairs smells of damp in the stairwellwardrobes knocked up by inept carpenters bathroom had mildew on bath surrounds and the sink was sunk into what seemed to be an excuse of some old piece of kitchen work surface radiators were grubby rusty plaster falling out of wall supports good attempt to hide that behind the curtains folks advice for prospective guests avoid room advice for owners sort it out and put a bit of your profits back into your business all this for for two nights room only welcome to the rip off parliament hotel,0
160,this hotel was clean and the rooms large however it really is near anything so you either have to walk quite a ways or take a taxi the hotel does have and traveling in july it was quite warm since our room looked out into a courtyard we could get any airflow windows only opened about at the most we opened our room door but they had painted the hall and fumes were overwhelming everything great other than lack of or a fan,1
162,walk of about ten minutes to red bus good hotel clean and updated wonderful staff was very accommodating and efficientgood location in town for those who like to stroll restaurant is very nice with fresh veggies good food and fast staff,1
163,i stayed at eliza lodge with two friends over a long weekend in june fabulous room with a view to the river we all had separate beds which was great temple bar is a busy party area which was great for us but perhaps less so if you have small children because of the noise which did not bother us take earplugs though you can walk everywhere there no breakfast included but that is fine because there are loads of cafés just next door rooms are basic but comfortable just what we needed,1
164,stayed at eliza of one night for was i think was too dear for what we room was very basick and i had requested breakfast to be i enquired re same i was informed that we had to go accross the road to another or cross the bridge to another resturant as they did not provide i found unbelieveable as i nevr had this happen before we had a nice lunch there on arrival butnot to do breakfast i didnot staff on arrival at reception a small space as you come out of elivator did not knoe directions to theater told me use girl was not irish but when you are on reception i think person shoud be aware and know places in capital city,0
165,when i stayed here in june with my friends and they sisters we first got there and could pay by card it had to be the one it was booked on which was very awkward we then stayed a night and cleaned the place up the next morning and a week later told there was been takin of our account when the maximum fee was they had no explanation for it or no proof either and it was cheap to stay in for a night either,0
166,this hotel is in a perfect location for anyone touring dublin or the surrounding area it also great for anyone eager to take advantage of the many pubs and discos in temple bar you can party til you drop and then crawl around the corner to the hotel if you need total quiet to sleep bring ear plugs remember temple bar is the party district a monday night here in the summer looks like bourbon street at mardi gras as for the staff here just excellent i do make a habit of hugging hotel clerks but the night before we left i needed to stop by and hug iva to thank her for all she did for us,1
167,myself and my friends went to dublin for a stag do prices for hotels in dublin are generally pretty extornionate so you expect a decent place to stay this hotel was just that the bar and reception were well presented the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable the food menu is good for a day stay the breakfast buffet in particular was delicious location wise a short walk gets you into dublin although those not as keen on the distance can get a taxi booked at reception all in all a great hotel,1
169,this is not a hotel they call it a guesrhouse if you are planning on booking for more than one night they do not service the rooms so be prepared to make your own beds dry your own bath towels and reuse wash your coffee cups if you make one in the room and ration the tea coffee etc supplied as it not replenished,0
171,we stayed in a family room which was plenty big for adults and children the hotel was very accommodating and provided an extra bed for my brother when he arrived early before his hotel was ready the rooms are clean and the location ca be beat you can walk to all the main sites in dublin the hotel is in an area that has a lot of nightclubs so if you are a light sleeper you will be awoken when the clubs let out about from street noise but if you want to partake the hotel is partnered with the harcourt hotel up the street and allows you admission to their for free,1
172,stayed here for two nights after booking a triple room when we were arrived we found out we had been upgraded to room number the suite it was fabulous lots of room and very comfy beds the breakfast was very nice the only downside was the noise at night from the nightclubs opposite we were kept awake til both nights which spoilt the weekend for us as we were very very tired,1
173,this really is a gem of a hotel to stay in and a brilliant base for sightseeing in dublin or travelling further afield to other areas straight off the and easy access to main routes as well as a great and regular bus service which takes you right from outside the hotel into dublin city staff were welcoming friendly and helpful they are happy to please and nothing is too much trouble there is a lovely feel here with locals enjoying the meals and entertainment too business couples families whatever the purpose of your trip it the perfect place to cater for your had some delicious meals which were plentiful and cooked to our liking highly recommend the popular carvery which they serve daily the bar staff were amazing worked very hard and are very busy at times yet always clock when you ready for another it does matter what time of day it is there is always an offering of food and drink of some description you would never go hungry breakfasts were also yummy and plentiful and you can have whatever you ask for if you do want everything on the set menu i usually steer clear of meals such as curries and lasagnes in places that serve a bit of everything not an indian or italian but these dishes were also lovely not forgetting the steak which came with sautéed onions a refreshing change to soggy onion rings you can not fault the food here just to,1
176,room was clean and big however we stayed on the floor and the wifi was ridiculous after sight seeing and travelling we wanted to contact our families but could not get anything to load at all for the two nights we stayed if you are going to run such a big hotel and we are paying a lot of money to stay there there should be boosters on every floor so this is a problem and everyone can have access to fast loading internet also for the price we are paying for accomodation breakfast should be included the first night we got in after delayed flights we slept in the next morning deciding to head down to breakfast at we payed for full breakfast and once asked if we could get a few things refilled were told that breakfast is nearly over so no we are still paying the same amount of price so things that are requested should be refilled or breakfast should be discounted when checking in we had to fix up our bill which was fine however we were charged an extra aus dollars for the accomodation as they accidentally converted the money exchange after we asked them not to very frustrating stay,0
178,was the only place other than a hostel that we could get booked when attending a robbie williams concert in the aviva stadium and it was expensive but soooo worth it the hotel is within spitting distance of the stadium you can walk to it in about mins unfortunately when we arrived most of the carpark was taken up by a radio tourbus and we had to park nearly half a mile away and walk back with our cases in degree heat but we entered a large luxury air conditioned lobby the male receptionist dealt with us very efficiently and we were on our way to the room in minutes added security of having to use your room key to access the hallway to the elevators and rooms so no random people wandering about the rooms were large and airy very clean the bathroom was big too we didnt get time to try dinner or the bar as it was so busy breakfast the next morning was great wide selection and piping hot buffet the best coffee ive had in a hotel in a long time staff were all lovely so yes its expensive but a great hotel id like to go back when its not jam packed with robbie fans,1
179,a very clean and tidy hotel within easy walking distance of the tram and bus and city centre the receptionist was polite welcoming and helpful absolutely spotless room large and airy very good free wifi,1
180,nice hotel and well located for aviva stadium a short walk to the left when coming out of the hotel leads you to and a few shops if you go straight ahead you have a walk of about minutes to st stephen grafton street and you can enjoy the georgian of shops and restaurants along the way our room for people was well fitted out and had most things that are required but no mini bar to keep drinks cool the bed was a proper bed beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet overnight our room overlooked a construction site which became noisy at there is no air conditioning but a fan was provided fixtures and furnishings were generally good quality although our room had a stain on the carpet shampoo and shower gel are provided but not conditioner we stayed room only at a price of euro which was annoying when our friends stayed a few days earlier for a price of euro wifi was good we decided not to have breakfast at a cost of euro each we walked elsewhere and had breakfast for the of us for a total of euro the bar was expensive euro for a pint and a vodka it is a nice hotel but would only stay here again if attending the aviva stadium and i think that when there is an event at the aviva the hotel puts their prices up,1
182,like any travelodge it very convenient to what you want to stay in it was a good location to all the bars and restaurants but not to close where it was on your door step everyone at reception was very helpful would definitely stay again,1
183,we chose this hotel for its central location and the reasonable rates the staff welcomed us very friendly and helpful the room was sized ok and was clean enough it had a window to one of the smaller streets noise was an issue they offer parking for next door mall parking which is very everything was in walking distance from here,1
184,the location is central the hotel is basic and clean the room was completely adequate very small but so what the staff were pleasant and efficient there is nothing to complain about for a reasonable price in central dublin just off stephen green,1
185,dublin seems generally expensive so we choose travel lodge as a budget hotel dublin stephens green is more expensive than most tl but is better than most tl as we had a very nice and large room and bathroom it is very well located just off grafton street not far from the liffey and temple bar you can walk to most places mins maybe to the guinness store house and jamesons distillery for kilmainham prison you will probably need transport and be sure to book in advance,1
186,we stayed at the clayton hotel ballsbridge for a wedding that was taking place in the adjacent thomas prior hall the hotel team did a wonderful was smooth and easy the room was ready at the promised time and the receptionist was very welcoming the room was spotlessly clean and had a good bathroom with a powerful lady who greeted us in the restaurant for breakfast was so friendly even though we arrived only minutes before breakfast was due to who checked us out was and full of smiles when she saw our suitcases she immediately offered to arrange a taxi for us a very nice unprompted touch she really made our departure a warm and friendly experience with lots of wedding reception itself was wonderful great service and very nice you clayton hotel team,1
188,after a couple of great experiences at the clayton dublin airport hotel we decided to stay here in ballsbridge for a couple of nights our room was not quite as spacious as the ones we have had in dublin airport but almost everything else was spot on we enjoyed an excellent vegetarian meal in the bar the gym is very well set up and i enjoyed the virtual reality running machines the beds are super to other hotels the buffet breakfast is expensive especially if you are vegetarian but the hotel is located close to some excellent cafes where we went for a morning meal unfortunately none of these were open on the sunday morning and we circled back to the hotel where we found we could order off the menu i do know if many peolpe do this as there was a lot of confusion from our waiter the food was typical hotel breakfast food nothing bad nothing amazing other than that our experience was great and the staff in general are fantastic,1
192,wow very boutique chic stylish hotel not my traditional style but i was blown away by the service and accommodations i would highly recommend the dean to every person staying in dublin the accommodations were great but most importantly the staff was amazing it like having you own personal concierge when i return to dublin i will only stay at the dean love love the dean ally and tom were awesome,1
193,just the best in hotel hospitality i experienced from the moment we arrived the staff were amazing and soo thoughtful finding out what we needed to do and helping us to achieve staff and especially apple in the rooftop breakfast soo happy and full of enthusiasm management take note you are very lucky to have a great team only one little niggle which seems to be a popular negative is the nightclubs close by and the music into the small hours if you ca bear the noise them or ask really politely to move they will help if they can or bigger ear defenders so a massive thank you for making our birthday celebration a truly memorable one and hope to see you guys and girls next time best always liam mcg,1
194,i was excited on arrival by the look and feel of this hotel but by the time i left the following day i was utterly disgusted by their utter disregard for their guests comfort and satisfaction i thin the following response to my agent complaint letter will tell you all you need to know about why you should choose any other hotel in dublin so disappointed goodness only knows just how appalling it might of been had i been a leisure traveller management response i sorry your client had a noise affected stay with us thanks for taking the time to flag this with us we do have big issues with noise on harcourt street we have some rooms that are but nothing we consider silent by a long stretch harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in for nightlife in general we completely surrounded by night venues although there is little we can do to control this we try to assign the rooms to corporate guests longer stays etc to minimize the impact on our guests i sorry if this was communicated on arrival i will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position as recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours we working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort in relation to the lights coffee machine and basin we,0
195,we stayed on the return leg of our italian holiday they treat their diamond members very well we were upgraded to a lovely corner room combined with complimentary breakfast the stay was great value given the size of long stay parking in dublin and the frequency of the buses to the car park you can get to the hotel quicker than your car most times pity the shuttle does run for an extra hour as many european flights arrive around midnight the taxi is only though,1
196,stayed here for one night location is great very chilled atmosphere the rooms are great so innovative from a record player to the mini bar and munchie tray and the decor there is a bit of noise outside from the night clubs but typically at the weekend did really bother me i slept like a baby on the comfortable beds i will definitely come back to raid the munchie tray and the mini bar and chill out and watch some netflix,1
198,the hotel was excellent and surprisingly quiet with a big wedding going on room was as expected we did have to wait for the shuttle for minutes upon arrival but it was a busy time especially with a large group arriving along with us shuttle ride was about on shuttle so missed breakfast was told there would be a breakfast takeaway for us but i did see one nor was offered at given a voucher for free drinks at bar due to slight mixup with shuttles etc but the drinks appeared on our bill at checkout but were quickly hotel call for cab and they asked cash or credit i said credit but when cab showed up they had us as cash not sure whose mistake but left us scrambling a bit to find atm in the city for the return info euro cab ride to airport euro cab ride to dublin city i say this hotel is halfway between airport and city so i have to say if we had a later flight i probably would preferred staying in the city and taking the bus back and forth to airport not a slight to hotel just whether or not you want to walk home or cab home after a late night out,1
199,a really disappointing hilton firstly the hotel shuttle did show up to the airport as per the schedule annoying in the height of summer but if the weather was bad or if it was the depths of winter i would be going was a chipped cup in the bedroom and there were marks on the splashback if the bathroom sink obviously not been cleaned properly after the last went out on saturday and when we got back late on saturday evening our room had been serviced which was really annoying especially as we supposed to be valued members of the hilton loyalty programme we had a late checkout booked as my partner is undergoing medical treatment and i knew he would be bright eyed and bushy tailed the next day yet despite having the do not disturb card on the door we still had housekeeping knocking on the door hours before we were due to check buffet breakfast was terrible lukewarm everything and dried out to within an inch of its work to be done here,0
200,stayed at this hotel numerous times always reminds me of the library from the board game clue rooms could be a little more spacious and updated but overall it a great experience staff are super super friendly and go out of their way to make you comfortable,1
201,i stayed in the dergvale with two other friends we had a lovely bright three single bed room in my opinion the breakfast was delicious and enough you get orange juice tea which gets topped up if you wish a choice of differently done eggs with sausage and bacon cereal lovely sour dough with jams the people who run it are really lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them it is only about a fifteen minute walk to the temple bar area i would definitely recommend the dergvale and would stay there again,1
202,stayed here four nights very clean efficient and reasonably priced jerry and nancy were friendly and most helpful whenever i needed assistance will definitely stay here again when i am in dublin great value for the price,1
204,i totally agree with all the comments made by my friend sally we were three ladies who came to dublin to celebrate another friend special birthday the dergvale hotel made our visit to dublin even more special breakfast every morning was plentiful and my friend described the scrambled eggs as looking like soft yellow pillows would definitely recommend the dergvale hotel and would love to return,1
205,my partner and i have recently stayed at his hotel for two nights the hotel room was clean and tidy but was overly large however there was more than enough room for the two of us the bathroom was sparkling and had plenty of towels the staff were great very helpful with any questions we had including allowing us to leave our bags at the desk after we checked out saving us from having to carry them around until we got our bus my only fault with the hotel was how thin the walls were we could clearly hear the people in the room next to us talking walking and opening their wardrobes other than that one issue i would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again,1
206,had a tour around trinity college campus by one of the students who had only done one tour but she was excellent very enthusiastic and knowledgeable was very interesting to look around and the personable experiences bought i to life of living on campus and the history behind the different buildings however the queue for bok of kells was quite long and was rather disappointing in the end,1
207,clean secure and central in dublin expensive for what it was a tiny room with single bed and shared bathroom worked out at on hostelworld for a midweek night should be cheaper as comparable prices around dublin can get you lots more for an extra or,0
208,i booked this for a city break with my daughter and was attracted by the central location accommodation in dublin is relatively expensive particularly the city centre hotels i booked online and chose a twin ensuite room but what we actually got was a whole apartment with single rooms a bathroom a lounge and a kitchen we were only there for one night but if we been staying longer we would have made more use of the lounge and kitchen it was clean secure had free and was located in a nice quiet corner of the campus ideal for our needs there was also luggage storage available before and after which was handy,1
209,central but quiet location clean room and bathroom very helpful staff i had a private room which was not too small for a single person kitchen facilities were would stay there again next time,1
210,the location is fantastic we stayed in a two room apartment at botany bay it is basic but fine there were no cooking pots although there was a cooker but maureen the cleaning lady was extremely nice and helpful and she found us some pots main issue is the price we paid euros for six nights plus for a camp bed for three of nights this was the best part of euros for student rooms for less than a the door cards stopped working several times and we had to go back to the accommodation office repeatedly to have them restaurant in the campus closes at which is very friday night the students upstairs were extremely extremely rowdy and disruptive and were shouting and jumping around like a herd of animals,0
212,we have stayed just one night and enjoyed our stay very central location to temple bar liffey river nostalgic design rooms comfy bed good value for money we will recommend the hotel to our friends,1
213,this hotel has great location just a walk from the famous temple bar rooms are cozy equipped with vintage furniture it also clean and there is complementary tea and coffee we suggest this hotel for a short stay in dublin,1
214,clean room although a bit dated lift dodgy as advised by sign advised to take stairs central location with a great pub below bar staff very friendly and hospitable good selection of pub grub will definitely be visiting the pub a few times during our stay,1
215,the house offers first class accomodation in a very convenient location excellent breakfast coffee facilities in the room would be a bonus but is available in the lounge hours staff really helpful and secure parking off road,1
216,it was a lovely townhouse close to the city centre the room was quite spacious with antique looking furniture it was walking distance to tourist attractions minutes the breakfast was quite good i would recommend it for business trips,1
217,from the moment we arrived at the pembroke townhouse hotel we were made to feel as welcome as if we were staying with friends lovely touches like homemade elderflower cordial at reception and a kitchenette opposite reception where you can make tea and coffee and help yourself to gorgeous home baked cookies before flopping into the comfy sofa and armchairs in the lounge area the staff are all extremely helpful and seem happy to go beyond the call of duty to ensure their guests comfort we had asked for rooms next to each other and got rooms in their own little corridor which was lovely the rooms are not high spec but clean quiet and the double beds are huge and very comfortable good tv too breakfasts are really worth including in your booking really the best hotel breakfasts i had in a long time home baking with heavenly soda bread scones and cakes even homemade baked beans the waiting staff were lovely and made each morning a treat the location is perfect as it a minute walk away from the very busy centre so convenient but a lovely place to begin and end a busy day of sightseeing in dublin and in the evening if you want to stay close to home a few v good restaurants within a minute walk we will be back to dublin and definitely back to the pembroke townhouse hotel,1
218,we stayed two nights at the pembroke in july it was an easy drive from the airport and had convenient free parking behind the property we walked all over dublin and reaching the center from the pembroke took only about minutes the room was quiet and immaculate with a super comfy bed and speedy free wifi the best parts of the hotel however were the service and the food the breakfast every morning was delicious warm scones soda bread and other pastries and breads and every afternoon there was a homemade cake the guinness chocolate cake with baileys frosting was amazing at reception and a cheeseboard in the sitting area across from reception finally the staff were lovely and helpful highly recommend and would stay here again,1
219,if you are coming to dublin and if you rather escape the touristic area select the pembroke townhouse this family hotel is located in an up scale area of dublin with embassies near by the area is quiet and refreshing easy to go to the city center of dublin with buses passing by minutes walk get the dublin pass grocery stores and restaurants are within minutes enjoyed my stay there it is really like a british style house the breakfast is very good with buffet and a la carte tea and coffee and biscuits in the foyer you can bring your own food and eat the foyer the hotel staffs even coming from all over europe are very knowledgeable about dublin places to visit transportation and eating out this hotel is a joy and i will come back for sure,1
220,we stayed one night in june after a tour of ireland i have to say that we had the best sleep at this hotel than any of the others we encountered it is centrally located easy to get to the luas train and walking over to shopping areas do let the area fool you it is a great little hotel very clean friendly and helpful staff,1
221,as a solo traveller this worked well for me it was quiet clean and comfortable i would highly recommend it the staff were friendly on my arrival and at no point was i unhappy with the cleanliness the amenities or the quiet atmosphere,1
222,my friend and i stayed for a weekend break the location of this place is excellent being in ths heart of the city centre with it shops and restaurants and only a short walk to the infamouse talbot street if that where you are heading the airport bus service drops off on the same road so the airport transfer could be simpler staff at the hotel are very helpful and knowledgeable check in is a breeze if checking out you can stow your luggage for a few hours safely it basic but it clean and comfortable we were in a room at the front of the building it was a bit noisy with people walking past outside but it was worth it from our perspective to be situated so close to everything would stay again,1
223,this hotel had everything we needed for our night stay in dublin location is great you can walk to all attractions we walked to everything dublin has to offer except the airport bus stop for the airlink airport bus fare is euro is just min away the hotel room itself was small for american or german standards but it had everything you need beds were comfortable and the tiny bathroom had a shower there was a tv with not many channels hot water kettle for and a safe in the room for your valuables built in shelves but not much room to maneuver around the building was old as most in the centre of dublin are but everything was clean and you can open the windows there was no but it was not needed either we were there end of august and it was only in the during the day there was a radiator for heat ca say anything about it as we did need heat either staff is very friendly the irish breakfast buffet not included was very good and carried you through the day until afternoon tea or coffee our room was facing the street and there was some street noise during the night you may want to ask for a room in the back of the building if that bothers you overall the perfect place for my sister and myself for our excursions in dublin,1
224,before booking i read all of the most recent reviews and knew what to expect noting the noise comments i emailed the manager in march months before our visit and requested rooms in the back of the hotel i included pictures of the emails in this review upon arrival with email in hand i was told by the manager that an email stating that rooms have been allocated does not mean they are guaranteed i was very disappointed in this misrepresentation of a management statement the accommodations were basic as expected we did not sleep well as a result of the street noise and the flat pillows i did use earplugs and i would suggest doing so it may save your sanity the room and bathroom was clean bring your own soap theirs is low quality we did enjoy the breakfast before heading out for the day it is a buffet and we found the price to be the same as surrounding restaurants serving a regular breakfast,1
225,we stayed one night here in advance of a ferry trip and found it well located and happy to have our dog poppy which is always in all hotels which profess themselves to be dog friendly our room was clean and had a good sized bed there was a bit of noise from their bar next door but this was to be expected on a saturday had to leave early so missed breakfast but the kitchen had arranged for a packed breakfast for us to take ate in the restaurant and were allowed to take our dog with were friendly and helpful,1
227,the first time i stayed at this hotel was on a friday to saturday as soon as you walk in this hotel feels very homely the staff are welcoming and friendly i had special religious requirements and the staff we able to accommodate these while being very respectful my stay was so nice that i came back a second time the following week where i stayed for a few more nights the hotel is conveniently located close enough to downtown dublin so you can walk there while being far enough to avoid the hordes of tourists the rooms are comfortable and clean i had one issue with plumbing and the response of the staff was excellent they moved me into another room and provided compensation for the inconvenience this is a professional outfit and yet at the same time personable i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a convenient friendly and comfortable stay in dublin a special mention to brian garvan at reception who helped out with recommendations for places to eat and visit also ann marie marcela and laura deserve a mention for being so responsive to email enquiries regarding reservations prior to and during the stay,1
228,just returned from a few days holiday in dublin stayed in the uppercross hotel and we could not have been better treated the hotel while small was very nice and very clean and the staff especially were more than nice and doubt will be back,1
229,the location is perfect close enough to the busy downtown far enough to have quite the hotel is clean the staff was very helpful and friendly breakfast not included unless you purchase it before hand a five minute walk to the buses tour bus airport bus perfect,1
230,we booked a two bedroom apartment absolutely brilliant we were near street right in the heart of the city we will definitely book staff were extremely helpful and pleasant the only problem was having to walk quite a way as the apart ent was not in the actual hotel,1
231,i spent two nights in this small hotel with my wife the location is good and bus stops to the city center very close as well as some shops and restaurants the room was ok but not more for example the air did change too well and the door had to be closed in order to prevent the fire alarm optic i guess from going on the breakfast was good enough but nothing special the carpets in the corridors were worn out and quite shabby parking provided for no extra fee no working in our room and the next building about meters from our window no view,0
232,we stayed for nights in july it a sweet little hotel in a great location everything is a short walking distance the staff was attentive and sweet there coffee machine and a kettle for tea in the room the complementary goody bag they left us for the concert was a beautiful gesture if you book breakfast on the night before you get a discount,1
233,hotel is perfectly located within minutes walking distance of all the major attractions very clean and specious room very helpful and friendly staff can highly recommend this hotel good value for money for hotel in the city centre,1
235,we stayed at stauntons on a saturday night before heading to the airport the service was great the porter met us at the taxi and brought all of our bags in we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the day we were early when we returned our bags had been brought up to our room hooray we were on the second floor and as folks have noted there is no lift our room was beautiful we were in a triple with our young daughter the bathroom was beautiful and we appreciated the deep tub and plush towels at about the music started there was an outdoor concert in the park next door and it was loud our room faced the back garden the concert was nathan carter and it was great instead of being miffed we were happy to have a front row seat to this wonderful concert breakfast was not included in our rate but we went anyway because breakfast is tough to find early on a sunday service was very good always tough to pay full price for a full breakfast for a five year old but that was fine check out was easy and a taxi was called and promptly came to take us to the only beef and this is for irish hotels in general it was warm and without a top sheet only a duvet it was tough to get comfortable,1
236,the building is georgian and i liked the location reception area and the sitting areas the breakfast included fresh fruit salad and a variety of breads and full irish breakfast was very well cooked and presented and the menu offered a choice including smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and also my room small i was comfortable and everything was clean i had booked a single but the room had a double bed which pleased me i did see that there were spacious double rooms available,1
237,wonderful location to get to all the sites loved walking daily through st stephen green family room was great with the two rooms and two bathrooms fantastic full breakfasts friendly knowledgable and attentive staff especially katie and jake old world charm,1
238,i was very pleased with my stay at stauntons on the green the staff was friendly and went out of their way to help with my luggage directions and restaurant ideas regrettably i was only there for one night the room was comfortable clean and well appointed i could easily have stayed a week,1
239,our family of recently stayed at stauntons on the green for nights while visiting ireland we were very pleased with how much room we had in the family room we even had two bathrooms the location was perfect close enough to be within walking distances of most of dublin most popular attractions but also far enough way from the noise of temple bar area the hotel staff was extremely helpful and the room was clean it was definitely a nice alternative from a chain hotel we would certainly stay here again,1
240,we recently staid at the lansdowne hotel to which we were greeted in a friendly manner by the receptionists despite the outdated interior of the building and the room being quite small the place was spotlessly clean as was the bathroom points on to our dismay though there was limited parking available to which we did not know about and we had to drive down the block to try and find parking spaces until the morning we ventured down into the den bar which was lovely and cozy and the bar staff were so helpful and friendly,1
241,set only minutes from the heart of dublin city and only for one night this is great value for moneythe rooms were clean and well presented and there is a very powerful shower to wake you up in the morningthe location is very secure as you must leave your key with reception upon entry and there is a hour security for when you come back late in the nighti will be back,1
242,our tour guide warned us to be alert for petty street crime but we had no problem it a nice walk going west along talbot street toward st it seemed a good location if you want to be on the north side of the liffey also feet away on talbot is the excellent restaurant le bon crubeen the hotel has a tiny reception but rooms were clean and of varying sizes as you would expect in an old hotel the pub was fun with music every night,1
243,the staff were very nice from top to bottom the pub was nice and the breakfast was good the room was dirty and in great need of maintenance do look under the bed the lamp shades were barely hanging on the hot water faucet was loose the shower was leaking and the safe was in operable and broke either they plan on selling the property soon or plan to rent out each room until it ca be rented again the one i was in was very close to this point but on the positive side the location was great they can arrange parking for you about a block away underground and the staff is very nice bring earplugs and an open mind do pay too much and the place will be fine,0
244,great hotel on the doorstep of all the vibrant pubs of temple bar min walk from the river liffey all local buses and tour buses within a few yards lovely breakfast in the floor restaurant entertainment every night in the vat bar in the hotel look forward to coming back some day,1
245,not impressed rude reception staff extremely rude manager myself two friends stayed in blooms as we attended a concert in dublin when we arrived back at hotel after our night out it took the doorman about minutes to answer the door there was anyone on the reception desk or answering the we were three women in a part of town who did appreciate being locked out at that hour of the night approximately it is safe anywhere the breakfast was horrible and i had to ask times for some ice for the oj as it was just sitting out all morning this hotel is a pure tourist trap and they should be ashamed to be changing people to stay there never again i wrote a review on their facebook page and they did i noticed that they only replied to which there were many of,0
246,great irish breakfast we are staying in another location and decided to have breakfast here just early this morning very receptive staff ioanna is a jewel for restaurant there was also this lovely guy who opened the door for us at am for early breakfast,1
248,i seldom post an unfavourable review preferring to deal directly with the restaurant or hotel reference saturday we had occasion to overnight in dublin checked my favourite websites and for last minute price and location hotel seemed to fit the bill central and at very cheap indeed for dublin in july arrival our reservation made and paid for a few hours earlier was confirmed but we were asked for euros cash as a deposit for any room damage well travelled at years of age we were astonished at this request indicating that we were reluctant to stay at an establishment where the guests obviously trashed or ransacked the were advised that it was unusual for the charge to be levied but it was the managers idea and the reception staff could not get the policy were however advised that had we used an alternative website to book there would have been no charge which mystified us were given vouchers for a free drink at the bar at at check inwhen we looked at them later they expired at the room was adequate but when i dropped an earring on the bathroom floor i gave up the search early on as the discovery of a less than clean floor left me feeling a little illthe final insult came at checkout when we were advised that there was a chargeof two euros per bag if we wishedtoleave our small overnight bag with them for a few hours we felt sorry for all,0
249,we stayed here for nights very comfortable stay we were concerned it maybe noisy but we were pleasantly surprised as our room was very quiet room and beds clean and comfortable bathroom very clean the bar attached provided some night time entertainment will definitely return,1
250,ideal in so many ways and really nice breakfast whcih we paid extra for but was well worth it great value for money overall booking through was a bit noisy at night but this is what you would expect in a big city dublin is amazing and this was a great place to see the wonderful city,1
251,i love this place just as well i had not paid for breakfast as i was generally sleeping to late in the morning this was the comfiest quietist and darkest room i have ever had the pleasure to sleep in i loved the vintage feel and would argue that it should never be updated our suite was the perfect size and offered us a comfy environment for a week of relaxation i am already planning another week at the davenport,1
253,stayed here for concert friendly informative staff upon check in room was good size and spotless not the mist modern room but well maintained all the staff were great and had a good breakfast the next day very central location hairdryers in bathroom should be in a museum did ask if they had a better one we could borrow but never heard back overall good stay,1
254,we stayed at the fleet street hotel in dublin in july the location is really good right near temple bar and very close to the bus stop for galway the hotel is above the street level so you have to take the lift or walk the stairs and they have security at the door in the evening and at night to control access the decor is modern and the staff were very friendly my brother a smoker was pleased to learn that they had two outdoor terraces available for smokers,1
255,stayed july room was pleasant and comfortable however at our expectations were not met i passed on breakfast even though it was paid for looking unappetising and poor quality dining room is very outdated a good morning how are you when greeted would be nice upon arrival to the breakfast room check in was very poor phone calls and visit to the hotel and the parking situation was still not made clear as the parking facilities for this hotel is not straightforward make use of your website trips back to the desk to get the room keys to work correctly staff need serious basic training at reception we feel lastly staff were friendly however the guy the area on the needs a proper talking to how he treated and spoke to the staff was shockingly horrific the swearing the tone he took the body language pointing fingers and raising of hands and physically rushing past me that i nearly dropped my drink actually unsettled me to the point i had to leave he is in the wrong job if he gets that angry i felt so sorry for the waiter out of order i wo be returning,0
256,fab hotel in the heart of temple bar literally a stones throw away from all the bars tgi fridays under the hotel which is great if you want food to take to your room staff were pleasant hotel was modern and trendy rooms were clean and had all you need would stay again fleet street,1
257,hotel staff was very friendly we had room confusing at first to find the elevator that goes to the floor great big room with a balcony with outdoor table and chairs it was too noisy at night since we were on the floor great location,1
258,the hotel is located right in the middle of temple bar but our room at least quiet the flip side is that our room was depressingly dark with a small window giving on a very small inner court more like a shaft staff was friendly but the whole hotel is very unpersonal,0
259,stayed in july on a saturday night have to say it a great hotel and well run will definitely use again turks head is a great bar for a night cap breakfast was cooked to order and plentiful thank you to all at the paramount,1
260,a fantastic location in the centre of temple bar this hotel is very clean the staff are very friendly welcoming great rates for its location tea coffee served in reception which is a very nice touch this hotel has special rates with the opposite which is a major plus for central dublin love it here already booked for my second visit,1
261,this hotel is just as the photos show lovely rooms we had room right on the corner with nice views down to the river liffey yes it was noisy at night if you had the window open but that why you stay in temple bar for the night life once you have a few refreshments you do hear the noise staff were lovely and friendly we arrived early so went for breakfast and were called when the room was ready which was an hour before listed check in time,1
262,stayed over night when visited dublin for a zz top gig when you first enter the ground floor looks suspicious as there nothing there bar a lift and entrance to tgi fridays when you arrive at reception on floor you start to see the quirky and charming nature of this hotel it a bit of a maze on the upper floors rooms are small but comfortable bathroom was clean and spacious the bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept in staff were pleasant and ready to help we left our luggage in storeroom to go exploring the city breakfast buffet offered reasonable options for a small boutique hotel everything was nice and fresh overall highly recommend,1
263,great hotel for the money we payed large rooms which we thought was good for a capital city the staff where very polite and friendly well situated for temple bar decorated rooms and bathroom,1
264,the hotel was clean and modern and room was very only complaint would be that there was no air con in our room and as it was facing the main road it was too noisy at night to keep the window staff were very helpful and the location was very good would stay again,1
265,very nice clean up to date art deco style hotel in the heart of perfect sight seeing easy walk to christ church cathedral patricks dublin castle temple bar trinity college stephen green plenty of restaurants and pubs staff was very professional given that there are plenty of hotels in that same area i would stay there again as long as the price remains competitive i would not pay more for it,1
266,not worth the cost does deserve stars probably not even faulty plumbing we had to change room faulty elevator one permanently out of order the other unpredictable noisy rooms you will hear and feel the trains passing every minutea and your neighbours coughing so imagine what else you will hear in the halls outdated rooms dirty carpets on the floors and broken floor tiles orange and brown seems to be the location ok central in dublin min walk to centre and temple bar but across the river however we had daily fights and drug deals taking place on the doorstep of the hotel so slightly dodgy hotel policy we do provide you a mini bar but please do eat any of your own food on our premises what,0
267,hotel nice sauna lovely but it was the concierge that made it for us really helpful and friendly a true delight next door seemed nice though only had a drink next to a train line but could hear it in the room,1
268,the rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building i had to change rooms and i had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total the price is just too high for what you actually get considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc is limited and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block the trains that pass connolly station shake the whole building every ten minutes the walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by as well as what your neighbours are up to go figure the carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh the most positive thing i can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented when i told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue but for the price paid i would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast,0
269,i have just returned from a night stay at the north star with my boyfriend and it was amazing i had stayed here about years ago in a standard double room and even then it was good but since then the hotel has been refurbished to a sleek modern décor and this time i stayed in an executive club king room which was well worth the money the standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money they have upgraded the rooms with smart technology so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button there was also complimentary dairy milk chocolate in the fridge which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over we also had access to the rooftop lounge which was quite what i expected as well as that the hotel was just a high standard robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job i would definitely recommend this hotel if you looking for something more high end i absolutely loved my stay here and it really made my trip to dublin brilliant,1
270,stayed here with my partner for nights hotel room was nice good size and very clean the room was equip with everything we needed and it was cleaned every day the breakfast was nice with plenty to choose from location is very good as it is close to the city center less than minute walk and also it is far enough out that it is quiet for a city at night time staff were all very nice and very negative to add about this hotel we had a great stay and will be returning in the future,1
272,stayed here for one night after the concert it was for the night which i think is expensive but then it is dublin and at a very busy time the hotel is in a good location not too far away from everything but also not a noisy part of town a bit old fashioned in decor and ensuite but very clean and the bed was very very comfortable,1
273,this hotel has a great location and should bar food is average and the service very slow it also is intentioned staff need better customer is my first experience with half a cup of coffee for the price of a full coffee top ups lot of work to is a reason why three sets of tourists walked out service needs serious improvement in this bar there are much better options in dublin,0
274,my daughter and i stayed here for our first taste of ireland we arrived late and spent days exploring the city the staff were friendly accommodating and efficient we will continue to stay there whenever we come to dublin kudos to the management and staff our room was clean and had everything we needed the boutique atmosphere and the neighborhood made us feel truly welcome breakfast was delicious and served in a great room with a view of dublin daily life,1
275,i am writing reviews a few years now and i tend to not leave one if it too for the price i paid for this room i was giving single beds in a room the room had a damp smell in it disgusting the most disturbing part was when i put my toiletries down i noticed thick hairs all over the sink and tap nobs the bathroom was not cleaned no wonder there was a bad smell they need to change the shower curtains as well because when there left up too long they reek and this is the first hotel i actually stayed in where they were going to charge a late check out i had to rush my things out of the restaurant staff were very had a nice pint of heineken,0
276,the location of this hotel is very good it very close to temple bar area and many other attractions the rooms are big and clean the beds are comfortable breakfast could have more options the thing that really bothered me was that i could hear a tram every few minutes and it really annoying in a whole if you are not sensitive to noises as i am i would definitely recommend this hotel,1
277,i surprised by some of the negative reviews due to noise we stayed in a room facing the street on a summer weekend and did not hear much noise perhaps we were lucky the hotel was great wonderful location tasty breakfast friendly service we were pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews,1
279,stayed nights for the concert at corke park lovely hotel very clean and spacious rooms had dinner one first night and food was excellent and great value very friendly and helpful staff would definitely stay again,1
281,we bought a leap card at the tourist info desk in airport and this allowed us to use the bus train and luas for got a bus into the city centre and then the luas to kylemore and hotel is a minute walk so great hotel is a little dated but spotless clean we arrived at and were given a room which was were in room small with a sloping ceiling but clean and well stocked with toiletries and tea and coffee large tv with lots of were above the lively bar but music stopped at on sat night and on sunday night so did bother deal included breakfast which was buffet style cereal juices toast pastries fruit and cold meats and cheese the cooked breakfast was to order and the full irish was great there is a cafe and a hour mcdonalds as well as garages across the road for anything else you would use this hotel again to save paying over the odds for a city centre one,1
282,wow what can i say amazing hotel lovely bar and restaurant and the rooms were nice and big too we came on our own but perfect for families to and would definitely stay with our is walk and flexiticket for the day only into the is about ride in taxi great all round and breakfast was fantastic too defo go back,1
283,staying last night before trip home free parking though feels limited conveniently located to public transport to city center on luas allowed us to check in two hours early and hey on top of a room we got had sloped ceilings after looking out window mild concussion on accident after accidentally running into sloped ceiling next to it the space is really tight and then they shoved a chair and table into it bath tub also under sloped ceiling so fears of repeating that because you can not stand completely up in it which yep repeat of that and we not that tall when we checked in we were offered a deal of only for breakfast two people math says as we had prepaid already they put it on our debit card and when we looked at it they charged us without explaining that confused as to what was what on unclear the people in the hallway were being loud as we could hear every word we looked through peep hole and saw no one it was the people in the room next to us as hall was and for a while tv reception would crap out lines across the screen and picture having a great start and made our last full day in ireland kind of sad,0
284,my mother and i stayed at your hotel last week and overall it was a dreadful it was described on as a quiet haven it is not for a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet we arrived tired and hungry at later than planned due to travel delays we were told the restaurant was closing even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until the receptionist who greeted us in a rather cold and manner called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open so we rushed through to the restaurant the waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley but he did start the conversation by saying oh the chef is gon na be pissed off grab a table and order quickly the food was not good we had booked a twin room that according to the photos on had two small double beds on arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite however the suite was a room on the ground floor at the front of the hotel next to the busy car park it was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed it was noisy and depressing my mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking i went back to reception to query the,0
285,this is one of my favourite places to go it was closed due to a fire for ages and we where devastated it gorgeous food for really reasonable prices there is a take away attached and a guest house i get the chicken and mushroom pie and my husband the fish and chips kids meal is so reasonable with jelly and ice cream included for a great place to go after a day in town,1
286,stayed here on a sunday night so got a good deal great location just off o connell street room is clean and nicely decorated good restaurant attached to the guesthouse where you can get breakfast and dinner would definitely stay again,1
288,kingfisher was right across from our hotel we went immediately after landing in dublin it happened to be national fish chips day too of all days fish chips were good but guinness was not on draft it seemed like a spot for both locals and tourists,1
289,stayed at the kingfisher townhouse for one night as an added stay to our dublin trip we booked this late for a very good deal therefore our expectations were huge due to the cost of other hotels nearby we were pleasantly surprised though arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady called who explained that our room was yet ready but offered us a discount voucher for the cafe next door we took her up on the offer and enjoyed a fabulous full irish breakfast so much so we went back the following morning for another we returned we found that our luggage had been placed in our room which was hugely appreciated as it was up a number of flights of stairs with no lift the room was modern and the bathroom was lovely and had obviously been recently we were in the room the windows were open and there was a lot of traffic noise however once we shut the window you could hear anything the bed was comfy and the room had all the things you need including tea coffee water and biscuits and information about what to do and see in townhouse is only a minute walk from the aircoach stop on street and is perfectly placed for exploring would highly recommend this as a place to stay in dublin and we would definitely consider returning in the future,1
290,great overnight stay in a classic hotel good amenities and rooms very well furnished to a good standard within walking distance of the main city centre and not far from the very pleasant and helpful breakfast very good choice and tasty,1
292,prices are steep not unlike the rest of the city but the service was exceptional at every turn the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed convenient location to walk to local attractions and shopping area around the hotel is quiet so there is not a lively night life in the immediate area however it is a very short cab ride away,1
293,just off st stephens green large clean room with fresh bedding and good furnishings recently renovated some street noise reasonable friendly and high quality and somewhat pricey fair for the area stays yes,1
294,first impressions are good really nice lobby friendly reception staff but no doorman as a hilton gold member i was upgraded to a room on the higher floors the room was a reasonable size immaculate and tastefully decorated with a feel the property next door is undergoing building works but did hear any noise during my stay the bar is also nicely decorated and has a good selection of service was variable initially attentive but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it was busy and staff lacked knowledge on the menu having requested a swedish whisky which i was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu the staff member had to go and check with another on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an arran a scottish island whisky off the back bar and suggested it hardly the same the hotel has a couple of restaurants alfie and coberg the first has pub food including a number of veggie options the second which is also where breakfast is served has very limited veggie options pasta and salad with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish i did dine in either given so many options nearby in town breakfast was a disappointment no orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte such as toast vs self service on being seated and it not being particularly busy it took minutes from ordering to get a cup of,0
295,placed right off the river liffey tram station and near the guinness storehouse the location is ideal easy stroll down to the temple bar area as well rooms are great spacious and lovely reception greeted us well and although our room was not ready they were able to get us checked in so that when we returned from our first day full of jet lag we could just grab our keys and head to the room baggage storage available and safe,1
296,once again another great stay at the ashling from our first contact st the reception to checking out two days later every member of staff was friendly pleasant and super efficient the breakfast choices were as on previous occasions excellent the hotel is very convenient for heuston station and the airport express service as well as local buses and the lucas thank you to all concerned and we will be back in november if not before,1
297,let me start by saying we booked this hotel through a service and had heard wonderful things about it we were disappointed in the reception the manager was not very helpful the main restaurant of this hotel was not open on sundays for guest which was is problem as there were no restaurants close by the lounge though was open and so crowded you could not get a seat but the staff in the lounge especially maria were outstanding the food was good as was the service i do understand how the food could be so good in the lounge but the restaurant was very bland and everything tasted the same no matter what you ordered the room staff left a lot to be desired also the bed was made but that was all they did we stayed here a week but was tempted to change hotels we were book here again,0
298,this hotel was nice enough good location for the tram line and bus route from the airport hotel had decent enough standards what was exceptional though was being greeted by the man kevin what a character great banter and so helpful louise at the bar was also very kind and helpful in summary a good hotel made great by the people who work there,1
299,from the start when ian checked us in to when we left the stay was perfect we were there for nights in july and i would definitely stay here again the rooms are beautiful and well are a lot of great pubs restaurants down the street also,1
300,i can not recommend this hotel highly enough everything was outstanding staff very friendly and attentive and couldnt do enough for us good location in a nice area rooms fantastic and really clean ca fault a single thing the park is only a stroll out of the door and is lovely for an early morning walk,1
301,modern hotel with comforts facilities very good restaurant very good breakfast good location not far from the city centre close to lansdowne road aviva stadium very kind and helpful staff next to the hotel there the lovely herbert park,1
302,visited this hotel on a work trip i would definitely go again food was devine had bed breakfast and evening meal drinks on the pricey side service extremely good only downside for me is that as i was in a single room so had no coffee or tea making facilities as the room was to small they did state that i could ring reception and they would send a pot of to my room i did not take them up on this but did miss not being able to make some whenever i wanted would i stay again a resounding yes in fact i am in discussions with my husband about a trip for the two of us and if i can find a deal then we will stay at this hotel,1
304,nothing to say in particular apart from the fact that i spent great nights at the hotel the staff was professionnal friendly and available for any enquiry the bedroom was perfectly clean and comfortable,1
305,we stayed at the hi for a couple of nights and were quite happy with our stay first off great location to everything downtown or any of the busses to take you wherever you want to go the staff was very friendly and accommodating we arrived super early in the morning but they were able to take our bags and store them for us while we explored breakfast was included which was a nice display of eggs meats breads and fruits the room itself was clean and spacious enough the only complaint i would have would be we were on the second floor and above the underneath so we could hear people and music well into the night but we would stay there again we would just ask to be in the opposite side of the hotel or on a higher floor,1
306,hotel centrally situated although we arrived very early in the morning the reception staff were able to hold our cases pending check in later all staff extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean and our twin room was very spacious i did email prior to arrival for a high floor but unfortunately enddd up on the second floor at the front which was very noisy through the night with people coming and going but you are in a city centre so it can not be helped would highly recommend,1
307,one of the best hi express i have stayed at it centrally located is almost brand new with big rooms walking distance to major sights in the city center could ask for any more would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in dublin,1
308,the hotel has great location few mins walk to temple bar street the station rail and more attractive room are great the bed was very comfortable and there was also smart tv which you should stream content from your was ok i was missing some vegtables and chees overall very recommended hotel,1
309,brand new hotel the room especially the shower was great you do get tons of street noise but just learned to turn it off i would suggest some type of guide in the room to explains things like that the lights outlets work after you put your key into the slot above the switches there are no ice or vending machines and that is apparently standard in europe that there are no washcloths you have to ask for one at the desk and there is no business center who knew great central location but suggestions for food etc should also be in the room guide would stay again staff was very helpful,1
310,stayed here for one night during a short trip to dublin good location just a short taxi journey from the city centre staff were kind and welcoming and the hotel itself is just stunning beautiful rooms which are immaculately kept and breakfast had everything you could ask for including yummie pancakes i only wish we could have stayed longer,1
311,i stayed here recently for nights and had a brilliant hotel staff were so friendly and helpful with recommendations etc the rooms are amazing and the beds are so comfy could not fault anything with the stay and this is definitely my choice when i am in dublin thank you to all the team at the intercontinental,1
312,if you okay not staying in city center this is a fantastic property very large beautifully appointed rooms excellent service and food and a beautiful pool and workout facility would stay again,1
313,visited this excellent hotel for an overnight while attending a concert in trinity the hotel is a taxi drive from grafton street but worth the fare the hotel is smart and elegant with quality furnishings and lovely circulation areas the staff are welcoming and our executive room was spacious and very well stocked with robes slippers and fridge etc the bathroom was also very spacious and the extensive breakfast was delightful with a chef to cook etc do hesitate to visit the lovely hotel it a real gem it a bit like old money versus the flashy nouveau riche and the old money wins hands down every time ca wait to return,1
314,returned to dublin for a quick business leisure trip and once again the intercontinental was a great place to stay the hotel is bright airy and spotless and is classy without ever being or uptight the rooms are lovely with great linens and toiletries wifi is good pool is great bar is small but good and the good weather meant we enjoyed drinks outside and the restaurant has recently revamped its breakfast offering which was already really good staff all seem friendly and open huge shout out to the lovely lady who greeted us for breakfast,1
315,my wife and stayed for six nights and enjoyed every minute the hotel is modern beautiful and best of all the staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful being right at a luas tram stop makes the location very convenient to desired locations we would definitely stay here again next time in dublin,1
316,the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,1
317,we stayed at the hotel to go to the man u match it was so handy to get to the match the hotel was lovely staff so friendly we had a lovely time enjoyed would go backthe food was lovely breakfast was very good staff helpful room was lovely we really enjoyed our stayruth wood,1
318,we stayed for nights to attend the hotel is modern and very nice the room is very clean and spacious with comfy bed and all necessary stuff fridge iron ironing board kettle etc breakfast is excellent with plenty of warm and cold dishes pastries staff is very professional and helpful i like to acknowledge the receptionists pyotr and patryk and the breakfast room waiters sheenagh zuzanna andrea and hotel is located within minute bus trip from the airport airlink the stop is just next to the hotel tram luas stop is just next to hotel entrance you can get to the city center within minutes by tram,1
319,we stayed here on the first night of a week long tour of ireland and were not disappointing what a service super friendly staff great food and super well decorated hotel and rooms they are also a pet friendly hotel short walk to the city centre and a very nice area to spend the night at,1
320,my husband and i chose to take an express shuttle from the airport to the hotel because we arrived at about am we found the express shuttle paid for the tickets at a kiosk stepped right onto the shuttle amazing luck stood for the minute ride and got off across the street from the hotel the longest part was not wanting to jay walk as our first act in another country so we walked up across and down to the hotel entrance when we arrived our rooms were ready amazing luck we showered and took a nap for an hour or two then hit the town running while we were there we saw a historical recreation ship moored very close to the hotel and the river walk had a festival the hotel had flowers in the lobby so you could take on and brighten your room and free wifi they also had a fake sheep reading a newspaper full of his one review said it not in the city center we had a great time and it a few blocks from the green line bus tour we had dinner at a restaurant that we could see from our hotel room i would stay there again,1
321,we stayed here two nights at the end of a weeklong family trip where we stayed in the country in beautiful inns and hotels dylan is of course in the city and our room was very noisy from the adjacent bar at night it was not city center but still a walkable distance to all the sights rooms were very modern bathroom had heated floors and towel racks the bed was quite comfortable overall nice not great,1
322,i stayed here for one night to attend a concert in dublin we had a package that included valet parking no other parking on site and breakfast the hotel is lovely located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance i love this part of dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre we were greeted at the door and check in was friendly efficient and exemplary the valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when i realized i had left them in the car great service the hotel itself is not overlarge but is welcoming with cool décor every staff member we passed greeted us the room was big with superking bed king for us travelers style interior design quiet and sumptuous the bed was really comfy so much so that i checked out the brand of mattress so i can buy one for home we had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles we also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience the breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites it was great i will definitely check out his hotel every time i get back to dublin and hope i get to stay,1
323,we booked it on lastminute a few hours before check in and had stayed before great location for baggot street restaurants and pubs good clean rooms and breakfast in bed was top class the rooms also had skysports so also got to see the lions match in bed,1
324,highly recommended by a previous guest and deserving of praise walking distance to great irish bars and high end restaurants highly quality furnishings good beds locally produced toiletries and chocolates etc about euros cab fare from airport experience suite is great beautiful views of neighbouring garden had to wait till to access room but worth it highly recommended,1
325,first of all the hotel itself is beautiful very classic charming the staff could not be better very warm helpful and efficient that being said our room did not have ac and it was the tiniest room i ever remember staying in morning breakfast was exceptionally good and again great service although not having ac in an unusually warm july was rough the location was good and we really enjoyed our stay and i would recommend the hotel patty patrick and robert were very helpful and really made our stay memorable,1
327,buswells hotel is a classic georgian style hotel that has excellent service while the hotel is close to a host of touristy attractions it is off the beaten path and a quiet place to stay the excellent breakfast is more than enough to fortify you for a full day of sight seeing would stay here again anytime we visit dublin,1
328,booked last minute by location and reading reviews and could not have chosen a better place staff incredibly welcoming and helpful ideal location for all we wanted to see and do and beautiful well maintained and clean property look forward to staying there again,1
329,staff were very welcoming rooms were clean and larger than expected even though we were just on the edge of the city the room was quiet breakfast was excellent a great place to stay for a visit to dublin,1
330,highly recommendable for location nice hotel people at the desk are helpful room has everything you need the pub next door is a bit loud but one is so tired in the evening that it does really matter because you fall asleep right away,1
331,we last stayed at buswell in december of and were curious to see if a change of season and level of tourism would make a difference it did the stay was a good as the first we like the kind of quirky charm of the building and rooms but this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel it is a period place that is modernized but not modern for people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms a picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation you can see that tbuswell is made up of several old buildings joined together and the rooms do line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay not every room is accessible at buswell the location really is ideal the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along kildare street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at stephen green everything in the city center is a few minute walk room was ready when we arrived at about pm and the manager very graciously bought,1
332,i loved this hotel it was so close to great restaurants bars and breakfast places plus the hotel has hour desk people who are very helpful free newspaper bar next door serves breakfast just for hotel guests and you can walk everywhere cabs are plentiful too,1
333,we wanted to stay in a hotel in dublin but knew we be tired at the end of our two week trip and possibly out of travel funds so we opted for this hotel with its good price and convenient location the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being so busy the room was clean and quiet we faced inside but the location is definitely the best part of staying here it so close to all of the restaurants stores and sites we loved being in the heart of the action the front desk arranged for an excellent cab driver to take us to the airport extremely early in the morning as we drove out of the neighborhood we could believe how many people were still out partying and walking the streets which reveals our age our stay at the drury was a great way to end our trip,1
334,we stayed recently in sandymount hotel with my husband very nice spacious modern clean bedrooms bathroom was also very nice we were attending to concert in which was mins walk the hotel is at great location i left my purse in the security box i only realised on the next day thanks to tania the duty manager of the hotel i got it back by post thanks again for that,1
335,lovely hotel delicious food in the restaurant and reasonably priced great location beside aviva stadium as we were attending the man utd match loved the beer garden rooms spacious n nicely decorated,1
336,stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon hotel is spacious conveniently located has a great hot breakfast buffet staff are friendly and eager to help and even has perks like a business center with printers for any last minute itinerary printing or changes we were even surprised to find a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in our room when we checked in with a note congratulating us on our recent marriage the sandymount has set the bar high for hotels on the rest of our european vacation,1
337,we booked this hotel as we where attending a match in the aviva staduim which sandy mount says is a min walk its actually less i booked the hotel on bookings and before we paid i contacted the hotel and explain we where going to be travelling up and staying the friday night and wouldnt be getting there til later on in the evening and that we would be attending a match the saturday and would it be ok to leave the car there after check out the girl who i was in contact with had no problem with room was clean newly refurbished i think or it was just kept in good condition over time beds where comfortable reception staff upon check in out where friendly we had a few drinks in the bar that night and staff were lovely theres pubs recommend slatterys pub grocery shops and cafes about min walk away from hotel or in taxi download my taxi handy of match there was pop up tents outside the hotel on hotel grounds doing drinks and bbq for people for the match such a good idea we also got to see the football teams driving in by being here they also have a tent for people going to the match to check in there bags,1
338,i stayed here again while on a business trip it did disappoint nice large clean room and extensive menus bar and reception staff most helpful will be back for sure ideally located close to bus routes and city center,1
339,stayed here on the of july and was very unimpressed with the customer service we received at reception when checking in i had booked the hotel through with a voucher i had received i had all the confirmation letters printed out and in order but when we went to check in the receptionist straight out refused to accept the confirmation booking and stated that they did accept the voucher even though i had the paperwork she stated that i did book through the voucher website and that they could accept it as part of the payment she then implied that the fault was on my part and that i had to sort it out with as she had other customers to deal with which i found quite rude to check into the room we had to give the full amount deposit on my visa card which took days before i could access that money again the whole ordeal took over minutes i rang hotelsireland and they were so helpful i gave them my reference number and they checked it out saying everything was in order and that the booking was sent to the hampton the day after i had booked the lady then rang the hampton herself and sorted the whole thing out in a matter of minutes on checking out i paid the remaining balance which i was expecting to do in the first place but was still out of pocket for days because of the deposit payment i,0
340,this hotel is situated within easy distance of for example green i walked liked the decor particularly the lighting in the corridors and the decoration of my room beds were very comfortable bathroom was splendid and there is a good sized restaurant bar on the ground floor also rather important the price was remarkably good for dublin,1
341,lovely hotel nice food and very accommodating staff i really enjoyed my stay here and i would highly recommend a visit if going to dublin i had dinner in the restaurant and it was beautiful i could recommend it enough,1
342,stayed here for one night as i was attending a function in donnybrook the hotel is generally clean but the bedroom could have been cleaned better that aside the room was very spacious and comfortable and the bed was huge there is a secure car park at the rear of the hotel and more parking at the front breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly so all in all good value good hotel good location,1
343,my daughter and i really enjoyed our stay at the harding it is perfectly located in the christchurch area near many of the attractions you want to see the room was clean and comfortable and the staff thanks johnny was friendly and helpful if you driving the parking lot is nearby at a hotel discounted rate our only regret is that we could stay longer,1
344,this hotel could not have a better location it is within walking distance to everything you need but just far enough off the main drag to bring a little quiet to the room in dublin this is critical it is very loud in this city and all the way up until the room was spacious clean and the three beds were comfy it also had a great shower with plenty of room the breakfast was a great bonus and the food was really good we would stay here again,1
345,the staff is great very helpful with directions and printing tickets for attractions the location is perfect most everything within a min walk the only drawback is the wifi it works well during the day but it terrible in the evening on the floor,1
346,the location right next to temple bar district and some of the main sights dublinia castle crhist church is perfect for for a dublin visit the staff is very helpful and rooms are spacious and tidy darkey kelly the pub with direct connection to the hotel is also great there is a lot of live music and a lot of locals to meet however the pub is a backdraft if you are looking for sleep on weekends make sure to get a room to the back of the building then,1
347,easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,0
348,the hotel was good nice beds space etc but it a bit of a walk to see things food was good nothing exceptional most staff from other countries tried their best to be understood just have to get used to different accents pretty often bar was great bar staff was wonderful parking available but tight very interesting history of this hotel,1
349,the schoolhouse hotel is a first class option for enjoying all that dublin has to offer while still having a quiet little oasis to retire for the evening our room the formers chambers of the school headmaster was nicely appointed with a big comfortable bed the included breakfast in the morning is good rory doyle and his staff are consummate professionals rory was particularly kind and very patient answering typical tourist questions if the option presents we will be happy to return to this historic gem,1
350,a lovely historic place upon which to end our stay in ireland beautifully renovated and presented obviously very popular watering hole for the locals road into the carpark could be a little better signposted as it looks as if it is not actually a road but in fact it is bedroom was tastefully decorated and the bed was large and comfortable small bathroom but lovingly decorated and quite adequate,1
351,we had a very nice stay at the schoolhouse hotel in dublin we stayed here for nights and it was a very good jumping off point for exploring all of dublin while still in a quiet neighborhood about a minute walk from trinity university that takes you past beautiful merrion square park the staff were very kind and friendly and the breakfast every morning was hearty and tasty the room was clean and quiet and the bed was quite comfortable it was certainly a more expensive option but it seems that lodging in dublin is expensive on the whole would highly recommend for anyone looking to explore dublin while not wanting the heavy tourist scene downtown,1
352,see title no complaints whatsoever temple bar is in walking distance and just around the corner are bus stops for those who prefer them to walking only downside can be quite loud at night due to being at a busy street,1
353,stayed at the schoolhouse for two nights and really enjoyed the experience the hotel is located about a twenty minute walk from the city center and is situated in what seems a nice area of dublin our room was a good size and had a large and comfortable double bed we enjoyed a very good breakfast in the hotel and had a dinner in the bar the food on all occasions was very hotel bar is frequented by locals and tourists and has a really good atmosphere and serve a great pint of guinness the staff were all pleasant and friendly the hotel is kept clean and in good condition if you are looking for a trendy boutique hotel then look elsewhere but if you are looking for a hotel with a bit of history with great people and offering good hospitality then the schoolhouse comes thoroughly recommended,1
354,great location in dublin city center the room itself is an average stars a bit outdated but clean breakfast was great and staff was friendly considering the price and location it a very good deal if you are visiting dublin,1
355,after travelling around europe we expected a city hotel to have small rooms especially when this is rated stars what a shock this hotel is terrific value for money the room we had was large and clean the staff are fantastic and helpful the is great wifi worked well great location hop on hop off bus just around corner,1
357,lovely hotel off the main street yet only a minute walk to the temple bar area there is everything you need in your room a kettle with mugs and a good supply of tea and coffee hairdryer and even an iron and ironing board the rooms are very spacious with nice comfy beds we did have the breakfast as for someone who only has a slice of toast i thought euros was a bit much there are plenty of places to get a good breakfast within walking distance from euros was very impressed with the security as you had to swipe your room card to get in and out of the lift and corridors all in all an excellent location to explore dublin,1
359,the staff could not have been nicer but this hotel needs work our thermostat in our room and for our shower did not work the thermostat might have been fixed by a battery but the staff were not given the ability to execute any repairs we were given a fan and moved to a new room the next day the new room worked but it had a moldy smell the grout in the bathroom needed a good scrubbing there are no top sheets and only one outlet for charging the breakfast were included and very good i felt that the staff had their fingers in the dike trying to keep the hotel together,0
360,i am a big believer that a hotel serves the trip i do need fancy or endless amenities as i expect to be travelling the totally fit that bill the location in the southwest corner of stephen green made just about everything south of the liffey accessible within a minute walk the room was spacious and clean and the hotel bar was a good place for a final drink so long as your day was ending but midnight which was rare there was also an excellent food truck set up across the road after each night for a late night only issue we had was being there in july we found the room very warm and the ac not very effective opening the windows did he trick but we were on the front of the hotel with a busy street and team line below us that said we generally managed pretty well keeping windows open most of the day and closing them our few hours of sleep but the morning were warm all in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay again,1
361,stayed here for nights for work and whilst the location is superb the room are looking very tried there really needs to be a makeover here as when you enter the hotel the downstairs lobby and bar area look very nice and inviting if a makeover is not performed soon then i can see this hotel losing out on even more business having said that the buffet breakfast was ok the items were crammed down to the one end of the restaurant where there was not enough room to be able to cook your toast etc whist other people wanted to grab some butter jam and other breakfast items the cooked breakfast i had on my last day was oright but i have had a lot better they seemed to want to present it in a fancy way rather than actually giving you a decent hearty breakfast myself and colleagues were not the only ones commenting on this i would stay here again purely due to location and would hope the hotel manager takes onboard some of the guests helpful comments i did find the lobby staff very welcoming and friendly,1
362,i needed two rooms for three days in dublin for a family vacation lucky i had some points to cover most of the cost and found this great place location was good hotel was clean and bright and the staff was outstanding,1
363,about the hotel room itself was well equipped spacious stylish and clean comfortable bed with nice flat pillows which were great for me having a bath was a great bonus a bit of new upholstery on the long seats would add some refreshed look to the cozy atmosphere that the restaurant already the staff lovely and great first impression of the hotel those smiling faces at the reception ready to give a fabulous welcome the manager damien charming and efficient with excellent people skills jiri was attentive to every detail in a first class service restaurant we had pasta requested to add chicken to it without any issues and enjoyed a decadent rich chocolate dessert and lemon tart which were divine not to mention antonio at the bar impressing us with fancy cocktails and last but not least confident very friendly gregorio at reception making sure that i would have left with a good night was enough i definitely have to come back,1
364,i am a silver member so the day before online to make sure i get a room away from the tram if you get the wrong room here it is incredibly noisy my room was very quiet and the bed comfortable the lighting in the room is not bad for a business hotel the breakfast is comprehensive and very tasty with good bakery selection staff are pleasant and helpful,1
365,helpful and hard working front desk staff who were patient with all our questions from fair family good location comfortable rooms great breakfast woke up early one morning and sat overlooking the canal and watched the city come to life,1
366,we have just returned from a fantastic three night stay in dublin could fault this hotel clean modern and with a great bar and restaurant if you need them room was lovely and staff were all really friendly not right in the centre but only a pleasant minute walk to grafton street or you have a tram stop literally right outside we used to walk in during the day and catch the tram home from grafton street at night for minutes later we were back at the hotel perfect and means it just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre loved dublin as a city do expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful welcoming people eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from transport options from the airport were superb we chose the airlink and it dropped us off about a minute walk away the guinness factory is obviously on most people list but the jameson experience is also well worth a visit even if you do do the tour the bar is superb and has a great atmosphere the zoo is also a brilliant visit and great value at,1
367,my friends and i had a great experience at the trinity city hotel really friendly staff and our room was gorgeous it very clean and a real quirky hotel close to everything i would highly recommend,1
368,i stayed in the trinity city hotel recently for a birthday celebration it is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location i particularly liked the inner garden area where we had a fabulous barbecue the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly the room was extremely comfortable i would highly recommend the hotel and will definitely pay it a visit in the future,1
369,it is great with amenities a restaurant and a bar great location a gym and lots of things are in walking distance to the hotel also taxi service is fast you can also get bonus miles with united too there is no spa in the hotel i would stay there again,1
370,while visiting my friend from ireland we wanted to stay at a hotel close to all amenities this hotel did not disappoint it is a stunning hotel with amazing staff and service it is central to everywhere you can go i would highly recommend this hotel and i hope to return in the future,1
371,plush decadent and totally over the top décor loved it great location breakfasts good restaurant food very good and the pub a great place to spend some very spacious we had a room in the annex and the service was good,1
372,this place is in a perfect location not right in temple bar but across the bridge from it so you far enough away from the crazy but not too far the hotel is old but clean beds were comfortable staff was very friendly helpful breakfast was just ok it located on a very busy street so if you leave your windows open at night prepare for lots of shouting drunk people lots of traffic but i think that part of the charm of dublin i think it was a good value for the price,1
374,we spent one night at the arlington hotel bridge after arriving in dublin en route to westport we chose this hotel because of the location and it ended up being a great choice if you want to be close to the action in dublin this location ca be beat it north of the river so a tad quieter than being in the temple bar area but just as convenient for accessing restaurants pubs shopping and many tourist attractions from the airport the hotel is easily accessible from any of the city centre buses both the dublin bus and air coach stop on street just around the corner from the hotel although the stop is closer huge perk that we did even consider when booking is that this hotel has fantastic amenities of its own the hotel bar and restaurant are lively with live music in the evenings it is also the location of the celtic nights dinner and show which hotel guests can take in at a reduced rate we also took advantage of the hotel breakfast which was great as had a great stay and would definitely stay again when in dublin,1
375,so many reviewers extolled the location of the arlington hotel in dublin that i be remiss to go on except wow it really was so easy to walk and grab the streetcar a block away that said the room was not the most luxurious i ever seen and i was glad for that it was clean quiet and comfortable maid service was good bathroom was quite spacious and nice and the front desk folks were courteous if it a busy place but if value and location are tops and you do want squick i would think twice about recommending this hotel and the irish facility was fun do check out govinda vegan restaurant a block away,1
376,came across this hotel as we were on the way to temple bar we never got to temple bar fantastic night of live music it was a rock band the night we visited and it was so much fun great atmosphere and everyone singing and dancing mixed ages but more our age than full of youngsters food was available but we did eat drinks were cheaper than temple bar which means a lot on a night out in dublin it was about euros for a pint of guinness and a vodka and coke which was cheap after the band there was a dj with more dancing we left around and felt like we had had a fantastic night out great find would return,1
377,well i would recommend the maldron hotel in smithfield certainly for the price that we paid for a room for four people sharing with breakfast convenient location away from the hustle and bustle of temple bar and its environs yet not too far away minutes walk from the centre of dublin of the dublin pass attractions is directly across the courtyard outside the hotel jamesons whisky distillery convenient fresh produce supermarket is situated next door to the hotel in case you need to stock up on fresh essentials for your day trips around the have no hesitation staying at this location again,1
379,stayed for four nights staff was pleasant and helpful stayed in a twin room which was furnished just as pictured room was clean and reasonably quiet only noise was from other guests in the hall on one of the nights location was nice really enjoyed staying in the smithfield square was a bit of a walk to high traffic areas like temple bar grafton etc but completely doable and the location encouraged us to see parts of dublin we might not have ventured to otherwise did not really avail ourselves of many hotel was unclear how paying for breakfast worked so we skipped it and used the fresh market next door which had a coffee bar and fresh grab and go type food as well as full grocery there were good restaurants and bars just in the square and jameson distillery and bar just across the way would definitely stay again,1
380,the hotel is located walk from the city centre many buses are stopping close bedroom and bathroom facilities are great breakfast is bad point is the neighborhood the plaza is host of many heavy drinkers though they are inoffensive it does make you feel safe,1
381,recently got the chance to stay at this hotel on business for nites food offerings in coffee bar and breakfast were excellent and staff at coffee bar and breakfast were warm welcoming and friendly we will be returning,1
382,we friends were a weekend in dublin for visiting at croke park but of course wanted a good location to spend some time in the centre of this beautiful city this hotel is km walking from the famous area of temple bar nice hotel with good facilities compared with the price,1
383,i booked my stay last minute on the day i was travelling the reservation person i dealt with stephen was so helpful and friendly we got a great rate for bed and breakfast perhaps due to how late we booked when we arrived the hotel was quite busy but they had every desk open we were checked in by a lovely duty manager unfortunately i forget her name on the day we stayed the weather in dublin was very warm this hotel does not have but when we got to our room they already had the blinds closed and a fan running to cool the air i hadnt stayed her before but i will definitely go back,1
384,overnighted here after a late arrival into dublin airport with kids and adults we normally have to swallow the cost of rooms i was so impressed they offered a family suite beautifully appointed rooms and plenty of space it a gorgeous hotel the staff are friendly and kind the breakfast was incredible,1
385,as you walk in the door a warm greeting from staff receptions staff them happy to help food great breakfast fast and no q dinner good food staff happy to help bar staff knowledge good nothing to much trouble general manager always available upon request and alway around hotel keeping eye upon the operation thank you clayton court the best so far this year,1
386,staff was wonderful hotel was very clean we did have one glitch and when we told the staff about it they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and provided us with a free dinner hop on hop off bus passes by every morning at so you have no problem getting to great attractions,1
387,despite the ongoing renovation work the staff we encountered were all courteous friendly and very helpful we had a beautiful room in the college wing and we slept so well bed was very comfortable and room was warm hotel is in the heart of the city and we walked to wherever we had to go dublin castle temple bar and iveagh gardens to name a few we did eat in the hotel but only because we were out so much car parking facilities are great if a little bit of a hassle trying to get parked outside the hotel to check in first before you can access the car park you need your room key for the lift loved our stay,1
388,the hotel upgraded our room and a bottle of wine on ice awaited us when we entered the room a thoughtful touch for which we were very grateful in spite of the ongoing renovations the hotel is very elegant but comfortable the writers bar very welcoming and the food served there was extremely that said it was the friendliness and easy professionalism of the staff which enhanced our stay our sincerest thanks to everyone there who made our stay so thoroughly recommendable hotel in the centre of dublin,1
389,this is my third year bringing a group to the gresham it seems to get better every year from the exceptional service to the superb rooms the location is great right on o connell street within walking distance to lots of attractions looking forward to returning next year,1
392,stayed here for an early flight lovely and modern and perfect for early flight left car here for nights also and it cost approx euros including the night we had to stay abroad for an extra night due to unforeseen circumstances and i emailed hotel about car and extra night they were fantastic and responded straight away with no extra charge for the night will stay again book directly through their website for a better deal,1
393,the room was very clean comfortable and spacious the main reason i stayed there was because of its location the hotel has a service that brings you to and from the airport at no charge they are very punctual,1
394,once again we had the pleasure of staying at the metro and once again the staff was excellent our luggage did not arrive for three days and the front desk did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable they constantly helped us contact the luggage department and even brought us to the airport three times so we could check on our luggage the shuttle bus driver was fabulous and even let us borrow some of his sports equipment so we could enjoy a game of golf near the hotel our room was perfect and every effort was made to make sure we were content and comfortable back there again next year for sure,1
395,i been staying here since june and have to say it brilliant kate and the team work hard to ensure that we are happy food is good value and well cooked taylor in the restaurant is super enthusiastic and always working hard shuttle bus to airport is handy have used other hotels around here this is the best by miles stars well done guys,1
396,stayed at this gorgeous boutique hotel in temple bar dublin extremely helpful and friendly staff each time we went to reception they would ask if we were ok for directions to anywhere and very helpful for tourist information very convenient location to the night life in the temple bar area beautiful room although the mattresses could do with an upgrade as they were a bit uncomfortable but that was the only thing to find fault with in this lovely hotel very clean and modern decor and attached to oscars bar which was also lovely,1
398,hotel is under renovation but did interfere with stay rooms are clean but on small side no but they did provide a fan as it was warm there is a shuttle from the airport but they charge euros for a round trip which was fine but it was advertised that there was a charge was first hard to find where shuttle picks you up and it is a short walk from the airport staff are friendly and very helpful and accommodating restaurant in the hotel is good the breakfast is an additional charge from the room there are no other restaurants or stores near the hotel as it is more of a residential area overall stay was comfortable and convenient for our purposes,1
399,i stayed at this hotel twice and i ca say about word about it the staff are great location is marvellous and the rooms are superb last time i visited i left my passport in the room and the staff got it in a taxi and got it to the airport in time for me to catch my flight amazing hotel,1
400,good hotel and excellent location the staff really were lovely and so helpful our only issue was that it was quite expensive for what it was especially as when we checked in the man next to us paid less than half we had for some reason equally although spotless when we checked in to the room the cleaning was terrible after the first night and we complained on check out having said that it was a comfortable room and the more than made up for it,1
402,the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,0
403,room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,0
405,we were down in dublin for a concert so just stayed one night the hotel is in a good location when traveling from the north we got parked on the street opposite which was handy we stayed in a refurbished family room which was really nice clean and comfortable with cool coffee machine my husband had a meal in the hotel it was good and value for money breakfast was ok seemed busy due to tour groups overall a lovely hotel and would stay here again,1
406,love this property it is an minute walk to city center and a minute walk tho croke park staff was very accommodating and my room was spotlessly cleaned good value hotel and close to all attractions breakfast was included with my rate but that is an area the hotel needs to work on i already booked my stay for my next vacation in ireland,1
407,we are just back from a stay at the belvedere hotel a lovely hotel and very friendly staff unfortunately the room we were given initially i honestly thought i would pass out in we asked reception for a fan and one was brought to the room straight away it might such a loud screeching noise but did make the room a tiny bit cooler just before leaving the hotel for an evening out i asked them were all the rooms similar and just explained the heat was unbearable the lady at reception was really nice and told us they had a room with air conditioning left we immediately changed it was heaven both rooms were lovely but air conditioning is needed in all rooms,1
408,very professional and delightful staff mark and francais were the best wonderful people wonderful very full breakfast with everything you could think of wonderful music show very professional great location to transportation of tours and airport coaches about minutes to the airport on airport coach rooms are carpeted and had to change rooms due to strong flowery smell but they accomodated us with another room great stay,1
409,my friend and i stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago i booked thorough hours before we stayed the hotel advertises no booking fee on their website but apparently according to one staff member in the print it states that the hotel will put a holding fee on your booking but your card will not be charged when i checked out i paid for our stay that was two weeks ago and the holding fee is still on my account and there is essentially euro in my account i can not access i just wanted to let future guests know as this has been a serious inconvenience for me this last two was fine bed was fine bathroom,0
410,i specifically requested a quiet room when making booking the possibility of a newly refurbished room had a bad feeling when there was a snigger about the possibility of a newly refurbished as we were getting a mid summer madness deal but was guaranteed a quiet room which was crucial for our stay confirmed upon arrival yes we will have a quiet room lying awake the last half hour due to a delivery van with carpet clean outside our wide we awoke often throughout night with street noise was told parking was minutes walk but never told it was clerys carpark drove around in circles to find it have to spend another night here very unhappy never again on first floor restless sleep with important day ahead yes it is what it says mid summer madness,0
411,this hotel is in the middle of downtown just above the action that means that if you go in a weekend night you wo get to sleep unless you wear the earplugs that the hotel provides for you but honestly they do not serve much the view from our room was to the air condition machinery another noise to add when we checkin we were offer a room with air conditioning even that in dublin does go over the with an over price of euros so we said no that s what we got staff is friendly and the room was clean the location is very good you only have to put to the noise level at weekend nights,1
412,lot of great restaurants nearby walking distance i prefer the beauty of ireland more than the party areas temple bar hotel room was great the double windows kept street noise quiet and it was nice to have a place that had air conditioning it was humid the hotel has a great location not too close to the party scene but close enough to walk there i only stayed one night and had to leave early so i did get to use all the amenities,1
413,upon arrival i was greeted with free ice cream which was perfect since i was in a hurry to get to my room change and head out to the convention center which i walked to every day comfortable clean room i enjoyed the free little cookies and even the candy bar on friday night yes you are in a lively loud area of the city as mentioned ear plugs are provided to use while there was a fan in the room i did not use it the room comes with all amenities except conditioner which is okay as i packed my own upon reading a previous post i could walk to many locations in the temple bar area including the locations of tours that i signed up for i appreciated the free map and directions since well google maps had me going in the wrong direction,1
414,in terms of value i would give this hotel mainly due to the service the cleanliness and the location the breakfast could be better for the price it is not included in the cost as the selection is minimal however as stated the service was good they offered a special irish dinner and show with the neighbouring my girlfriend even got asked to try irish dancing which she did to her dismay the experience was enjoyable and memorable however more so for me i think it is located in the centre of shops restaurants and attractions and i would definitely recommend getting the euro bus pass as it enabled us to go everywhere for the days we were so much easier than paying for a ticket each time i would also recommend going to the guinness factory and the hotel is very close to this attraction as it is in the centre we assumed it would be noisy however they provide ear plugs to help sleep overall it was a great trip and we enjoyed coming back to this hotel at the end of a busy day,1
415,great location right in the heart of the action amazing front desk staff began with tania helping locate lost airport luggage before during and after my meltdown she was and kind and helpful ending with her blonde counter part sorry i did get your name recommending a great coffee shop the next morning quick to smile and ready to help thanks for all your help,1
417,on a trip with my mom and sisters and we stayed here for nights because of the location and good reviews staff were friendly breakfast was good rooms were clean though a bit small price was good and the location really was fantastic walking distance to temple bar and other touristy areas and bus stops right outside the hotel my room had views of christchurch which was just lovely though a bit noisy at night from cars and people in the streets with a very clean room updated bathroom and a nice breeze through our window we were very comfortable the others in our group were in a triple but they felt very squished and thought their room was a bit stuffy overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,1
418,great location for walking around staff was wonderful rooms are spacious and clean if booking in summer be aware there is no ac they do have fans and the windows open so did get too warm however we had a room facing christchurch and with the window is open we heard the church bells all night i highly recommend the hotel but if booking for the summer i recommend a room not facing the church,1
420,this was a really great location it is only a block away from the airlink dropoff and pick up point and perfect for taking the public transportation we had the top floor quad room and were really surprised that we got free bottled waters sparkling and non and a whole bunch of flavored walker shortbread cookies i did not know that they even came in other flavors kitkats and some killer hot chocolate sean at the front desk was super nice and showed me where the sites are on the map and was patient with me when i realized i did need the breakfast on all of the days of our stay the breakfast was really good though i was able to sleep very well as we were far enough away from the madness of temple bar the bells of christchurch were really awesome too my only gripe is no ac so we opened the windows,1
421,i have stayed at the grand canal a number of nights over the past year and have been pleased each time the rooms are clean staff is very helpful and attentive and the breakfast buffet or made to order is excellent the rooms are of average size and there is a comfortable chair and a desk chair in the room there is no air conditioning but they did provide a fan when we requested the hotel is a bit off the beaten path down by the grand canal but is less than a min walk to st stevens sr or even less to merrion sq i like the location as it gives me a chance to walk and see dublin vs coming out your door to a crowded scene like at some of the other more city center or temple bar locations there is an attached bar which serves good pub fare and you can get a pint of guinness or a local craft beer the prices in the pub are reasonable and their is plenty of room for a group i will continue to return to the grand canal when in dublin and look forward to my next stay,1
422,a little way out of the centre but ideally suited to the aviva though i prefer the pringle i prefer to stay out of the hustle and bustle and you get far more for your money that way too there still plenty to see and do in this area and it no more than a twenty minute walk to grafton street etc very clean comfortable beds and tasteful decor there even a beneath it though our room was peaceful when we stayed,1
423,very nice hotel within easy reach of plenty of bars and restaurants close to dart station and about minutes walk from connolly are well kitted out and comfortable nice coffee machine and mineral water rate did not include breakfast so we went out for brunch plenty of choice little way out of the centre if you are staying for a few days and want to be in the heart of the action however excellent for events at the stadiums nearby,1
424,great time here what a bar great food and beer and especially great service is the best waitress ever as soon as we were at our table she had drinks in front of us brilliant and then we got unbelievable food it was amazing x,1
425,this large hotel offers an excellent price for value ratio probably one of the best on this side of the city nice staff good breakfast with table service for hot drinks and buffet for the rest pretty high standards in the bedroom and bathroom i really liked their orla kiely soap shampoo and body lotion this hotel also offers a rather quick access to the city centre min walk or appropriate for business trips i have stayed there many times over the past year maybe less for a romantic stay as this is mostly a business one issue the restaurant downstairs is specialised in burgers and beers not the ideal place if you on a diet,1
426,i a light sleeper so this was a perfect location for me to stay in dublin for a couple of nights located away from busy roads pubs and restaurants this was an ideal and quiet location for a light sleeper the decor is a bit dated but the staff and breakfast were fantastic,1
427,well placed in a quiet area near the center the staff is really kind and helpful the breakfast is good very good even if it is necessary sometimes to wait a little because not enough tables the room was cosy a little bit but very quiet i slept with the window opened a good address,1
428,if i was basing this review on service alone it would be stars but i had to balance it out with the outdated room furnishings let me start by saying that we arrive quite early from a transatlantic flight quite tired and although our room was not ready we were graciously offered breakfast and stored our bags as we explored dublin the rooms were clean and comfortable which is very important to us but they really need a bit of sprucing up the bathroom vanity is made of cheap material and the door was falling off the hinges and the floor tiles were cracked that being said the service and professionalism of the staff far outweighed the quality of the room the location is quiet yet close enough to walk to the action we literally walked all over dublin through stephen green and could have wished for a nicer location this was the priciest hotel we stayed out during our entire time in ireland but we did visit during peak season we would stay here again,1
429,on a girl s trip to ireland we stayed three nights in kilronan house upon arrival we were invited to sit down with a cup of tea or coffee and cookies vio answered any questions we might have and then showed us to our rooms both rooms were just one flight up with skylights the beds and linens were comfortable and the bathrooms and showers fine the wifi also worked well breakfast was served in a charming dining room each morning we had juice fresh coffee or tea delicious yogurt and fruit and a choice of pancakes omelets or eggs as you liked them we found kilronan house to be in a good location you just have to walk out the front door and make two lefts and you are near stevens green and only a short walk to trinity college book of kells graffton street and museums etc although kilronan house has free parking we found it easier not to have a car in the city it was an easy walk to many fine restaurants and pubs i would recommend kilronan house to friends and family i hope to bring my husband here in the near future,1
432,a minute walk from the hotel covered all and more of the tourist spots we wanted to see on our day stay and most were closer than that the food was good and there were plenty of restaurants nearby the only negative in that context was the coffee at breakfast which was so thin and watery that we had breakfast elsewhere on the other mornings the dwarf jar doors along was excellent and even had freshly squeezed orange juice as a bonus being in temple bar meant the hotel octagon bar was mostly empty and a bit bleak not helped by the air conditioning on cool and the barman appearing a bit bored but a quiet bar could be an advantage with all the other noisy ones nearby still we would stay again,1
433,we stayed at the clarence on the tail end of a trip to ireland and were very excited to stay here big mistake it was a total dump we had two rooms and both were filthy the bathrooms floors were sticky and spotted the shower curtain liners were black with mildew one room had a horrible and persistent smell one sink did not drain at all the vents were covered in dust there were random smears of gd knows what on the shower walls one room windows did not open at all and there was no ac or ventilation gross and loud as our rooms overlooked a beer garden next door the lobby was likewise nasty with a sticky counter and floors i am not sure how other guests gave good reviews this hotel was totally especially for the price,0
434,this is a nice hotel like many others we stayed her during the recent joshua tree tour in dublin like those others we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by bono and the edge kinda nerdy but there it is i wanted to give this hotel stars but i ca this is not a holiday inn you paying more for a better experience and in some ways the clarence fell hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist it an easy walk to all of temple bar the book of kells and the fun stuff on street its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the guinness factory most public buses run on either street or dame street either one is a five minute walk away the temple bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did i feel uncomfortable walking around regardless of the hour the staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system printing out maps etc if my review ended there it would have five best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds the bed was probably one of the best i ever encountered in europe the front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing they made me want to stay longer this hotel could be so much more sadly several of us met in,1
435,february stay for nights when we got to the hotel they charged us more for the room than what we had booked more which seemed quite a lot spoke to the manager and he blamed and said there was nothing they could do about it he said it happens all the time if this is happening all the time they really should have sorted this by now or at least expect customers to be annoyed when they charge you a lot more for your room when you booked a budget hotel could have paid the same money and stayed in temple bar hotel was or so minute walk from temple bar so good location rooms quite despite other reviews our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as i told them the rooms were nice their room was horrible only just enough room for a small double bed disgusting again when they complained they were told tough there no more rooms i rant up from the uk and spoke to reception about booking another room for the dates they were staying and was told there was lots available etc and what would i like to book told them the situation and the tone of the conversation immediately changed back to the hotel being really busy and no rooms available after they had just told me the hotel was dead would not stay here again as there are far better hotel in the,0
436,let me start with a positive the hotel is in a great location in the temple bar area it ends there upon arriving at the hotel i was underwhelmed at the cleanliness and effort to update the hotel for per night it was rundown the bellman took me to my room and it appeared that the carpet had been cleaned in years the room was dingy and in need of a good updating after returning to my room for dinner and drinks there was a raging party going on down the hall no big deal i thought it will die down eventually at am it was still going i informed the front desk and they told me there was nothing that they could do apparently a group had reserved that part of the hotel for a party i asked to change rooms and was told that since i already been checked into this room for hours it was possible i was offered a tiny discount on the room instead i do want a discount i want a quiet night of sleep to be clear the issue was not the street noise which is a modest hum given the hotel proximity to the bars in the area that would have been tolerable the next morning when i checked out i made mention of the issues they gave me the managers card and told me to email him so i did and after four days i received a snarky response from the,0
437,i have stayed at this hotel twice in the past months early june and late july why did i return because i had a good experience in june because of the hotel location and because of its value for having said that the experience in late july was not as good why is that because the hotel is a victim of it neighborhood there is a sports bar right next door when folks leave there invariably drunk they are extraordinarily noisy they are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood then there the homeless in a churchyard across the street they have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter the police come remove them and they back within an hour then the trucks come to make deliveries around am with back up beepers and running engines the tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning the staff work extremely hard and they are terrific frankly they do deserve this constant barrage on their efforts my room was an adequate size it was spotless the bathroom and shower were very good daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere so should you stay here yes just get a room in the back of the hotel,1
439,easy minute bus ride from dublin airport centrally located in city my husband i walked everywhere clean comfortable room bathroom by american standards but typical for a european city we did try the breakfast as we were in out each day of our stay,1
440,from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff and management could not have done any more for us they are very professional kind and understanding no matter what you ask of them the answer is always no problemthe king room was perfect and very bright and a view of o connell st the location was very good especially for anybody with a disability of any kind the hotel is central to all transport shops and concert venues with many theaters near by james is peter collins deputy he took us under his wing and our every need was seen to the food was excellent and the staff at the bar restaurant were also excellent in particular beata we award her employee of the month as she was so patient with us at mealtimes and went beyond the call of duty to see that we enjoyed our stay a big thank you to you all,1
441,clean comfortable with all the amenities wonderful full irish breakfast inviting lobby area bar and dining available staff go above and beyond to help would stay again close to the quay walking distance to downtown dublin bus routes luas and many amenities highly recommend,1
442,my husband and i stayed for nights on a weekend in july we were impacted by the construction on weekdays the hotel was an easy euro taxi ride from the airport we arrived and they far exceeded my expectations by allowing us to check in to our room at that bonus points the room was spacious modern and totally clean the bathroom was also modern with a large there is which turned out to be more useful than i thought in ireland given the cool weather but they were our best nights of sleep because it was cool there is not a concierge but everyone at the front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations it was an easy walk to the city center and most attractions yet away from the bustle of the city each morning we needed a cab and ordered one the night before which worked out perfectly the cabbie even asks your room number to be sure it your restaurant was phenomenal for dinner did eat breakfast here and there is a small shop with any extras you need or there are grocery stores nearby the safe was big enough for a laptop i would stay again though hopefully could get a better price we were there weekend,1
443,hotel is of good standard and situated close to city center would recommend staying if you are looking for an overall good hotel we had a room facing the back which was very quiet parking is good and close in the next door multi storey car you are looking for something exciting this hotel is perhaps on the boring side of things,1
444,staff in the hotel did an excellent job however service in the restaurant was quite disappointing it seems like the wait staff are attentive to your first drink order and food order but after that their rarely check on you and it can be quite an effort to have your finished plates cleared order dessert or get and pay your bill,1
445,what a great hotel the room was incredibly clean with a very nice and modern bathroom the service at the bar was great darren was a great laugh and made sure we were well taken care of all night we were thrilled to see him in the dining room the next morning taking care of breakfast the location is spot on close to everything and anything you would want to see in the city,1
446,it was not our first stay at cassidys it was our but the first with our two children and years old the family room was big enough that all of us have space to relax everything was clean and we had enough towels and toilet paper for all of us the staff was always friendly and helpful everything is so near you do need a car thanks a lot and we see us again,1
448,we have been at this hotel for the third time now this is a clean hotel with friendly staff in walking distance to the centre sights and bus stops are also just a few minutes away to us it is the perfect accomodation for a city trip to dublin,1
449,we stayed three nights at camden court so got a good idea of what the hotel is like the customer service was good the rooms quite large and well equipped and breakfast was outstanding the hotel has an indoor pool and well equipped gym there is much more you could want in a hotel is also well located with easy access to the main attractions it is outside the temple bar zone so it relatively quiet but not too far as to make the walk to see everything too great it is also surrounded by many bars and thought overall it was good value for money,1
450,stayed in dublin one night had reserved parking which is very safe secure on entering hotel was surprised how large it was although it has kerb appeal from outside its very deceptive as to how large this hotel is staff were very friendly and our room was just superb top floor with surround balcony view not great but it suited us smokers room was very clean spacious,1
451,very well located hotel room was comfortable with nice flat screen tv that was very good a bit of noise from the street because hotel is downtown the windows in room open and fresh air was a bonus the beds were very comfortable two restaurants that were fine the bleeding horse pub is adjacent to hotel and many other restaurant in walking distance grafton street shopping area and stephens green as well as the dublin museum of natural history were close walking distance we would stay at the hotel again when back in dublin,1
452,sorry but this hotel was not good stayed in room which faces over the internal courtyard where park to access the hotel no air con so window needed to be left open to keep room reasonable temperature woken at by delivery lorry which was noisily loaded this is street noise this was directly outside the hotel and appeared to be stuff from the hotel reception told me this was a quiet room when i checked in sorry but they were having a laugh,0
453,just back from camden court hotel for the bus from the airport hotel staff very helpful bedroom very clean excellent full breakfast plenty choice only a minute walk to graften street,1
454,beautiful hotel location room size amenities and restaurant all excellent agree with other reviewer about the night noise though especially if you are there in the summer and need your windows open to keep it cool staff was very nice and we would stay there again,1
456,visited here for one night yesterday for my wife birthday the hotel is a ten minute walk from street so a bit of a trek after a night out especially with heels on says the wife upon check in we were met by antonio who was very polite and friendly the room was great very spacious room which is or was a room for disabled persons my wife mentioned to antonio upon check in that it was her birthday and when we returned to the hotel later in the afternoon there was a happy birthday note along with wine and chocolates which was a lovely touch very comfy bed and very clean one slight issue was the cleaners were very noisy from quite early and we wanted a lie in hardly mattered though fabulous hotel and we would definitely recommend and would visit again,1
459,we are traveling with a and year old very safe location deceiving upon entrance then you go downstairs and it opens to a beautiful hotel no ac but ireland is cool most of the time our windows opened fully in our family suite which we loved the double bathroom and layout it on fleet it will be loud but we enjoyed the live music and felt like we were at the concert the room has earplugs if you need them staff is helpful and polite we left our ipad and passports in safe they called us and we will pick up when we return to dublin they are keeping it in hotel safe until our return,1
461,we stayed here for a couple of nights whilst visiting the city staff very helpful the concierge was always polite and friendly reception staff equally helpful and rooms were clean tidy and had all the necessary requirements for a comfy stay the fan provided a welcome cool room the windows opened as well providing fresh air whilst there was some noise from outside it was not excessive or disturbing at breakfast was fabulous great choice and no rush,1
462,excellent visions of beauty great for the young and the old suits all needs entertainment and food plus plenty of history spots too also getting about is made simply with local travel service and taxi s,1
463,excellent location the hotel is situated on temple bar very helpful pleasant staff a bottle of fizz and box of chocolates were left in the room for my birthday great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of temple bay,1
464,we spent nights at this great hotel which is in a perfect location near all shopping and museum when we arrived we got a rather small room which was fine but the very next day we asked for an upgrade and two very helpful staff members bojan and victor were fantastic helpful in making our stay in this wonderful hotel to a fantastic stay i can very highly recommend this hotel in dublin,1
465,we celebrated our honeymoon in ireland and my husband booked a room at the davenport hotel from the outside it a beautiful hotel and when we checked in it was a beautiful lobby i was really excited and then we walked into the room when we walked there was an issue with the electricity within the room we called to the front desk who called several electricians into the room to fix the problem the electricians came in and out of the room for an hour and were able to fix the issue but we lost an hour of our time with no apology or compensation the room was comfortable but a bit dated and really needed to be remodeled the bathtub had wood on the sides additionally there was spots of blood on the shower curtain and the clocks were set at the wrong time which made us an hour late for a tour with all the hotels in dubin i would book this one again,0
466,the davenport hotel is located near the center of dublin ireland just a block north of merrion square it is also located about a block east of trinity college and several blocks south of the river liffey it is also located next to the house were oscar wilde grew up it is now some type of small college the hotel is located about miles from dublin international airport or approximately minutes by taxi longer if you are in rush hour stayed here for nights in late may with my wife and youngest daughter and thought the hotel was nice and also thought it was in a great location near many major tourist attractions we paid a night for a triple room one king size bed and a twin bed which i thought was pretty reasonable breakfast was not included and was euros per day per person i thought the lobby and bar area were nice looking and i also liked my hotel room the carpet and furniture were updated in addition the room was above average in size the front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given only complaint was the poor breakfast service the main breakfast room was full so we had to go to the bar area where the guy working there was lazy and would not help us i thought he was a dishwasher or cleaning person we had to walk back into the other area and ask,1
467,booked this hotel for a long weekend to dublin it was an easy stroll to grafton street and street it was the staff that made this hotel we arrived at and daniel on reception did a bit of shuffling and gave us a room straight away the same for the couple in front not many hotels do this this was a real bonus as we could get in immediately no hanging around and storing bags nice comfy lounge good self service breakfast with delicious yoghurts nice pub opposite called the ginger man just round corner from national gallery too,1
469,great hotel location rooms renovated were very nice did not try any food service manager was very nice friendly one of best rooms that we stayed in ireland plenty of electrical outlets for charging phone computer,1
470,under renovation stay across the street at the davenport until complete they tried hard but are really not ready to provide the experience they want for guests the room updates are good just need to get the rest done,0
471,lovely hotel placed just off the merrion square on min walk from temple street there are few good pubs just nearby also airlink express stops are just around the is newly refurbished actually the work was still ongoing in the common areas during my stay lobby restaurant etc rooms look great with lots of art in it and pretty cool lightning super comfy bed bathroom looks great tho there are some things to improve no soap bowl no good place close to shower to hang the towel while showering but that can be fixed quite of food for breakfast was somewhat limited might be due to the fact that the kitchen was undergoing renovation as was welcoming and professional check went smoothly and quickly,1
472,but right now a little dicey so the hotel is great the room classy and beautiful the staff professional and helpful this is going to be a real winner if it is like its sister hotels nearby but for now bar was dicey no real food options available and the car park was too far and too difficult now there was a great pub across the street and they did send me next door to their sister hotel bar which was very nice so it really is their fault just check to make sure the construction is done if you want things to be easier,1
473,i stayed nights in may at the waterloo house the house is quaint my room had a nice view and breakfast was delicious but my experience was tainted by electrical issues in a nutshell plugging my laptop adapter in a power outlet at this house killed the adapter here s how it happened when i first arrived in my room i noticed one of the lamps would not turn on i notified the clerk at the desk that the lightbulb was burnt but she said that this outlet did not work adding that the electrician could not figure out why fine i thought i ll use other outlets and i should have been more suspicious of the state of the electrical wiring because as soon as i plugged in my laptop to charge it in another outlet of course the power went out in the room and my charger had a burnt smell i notified the clerk again and while she was very nice she did not seem particularly surprised and suggested i talk to evelyn corcoran the owner evelyn nicely told me that this hardly ever happens indeed she said this had happened before but to other devices i understand this is an old house that s part of its charm but a faulty electrical system is not what i expected being in dublin for work i needed to be able to charge my laptop so i went to a computer store the employee said the frying of my,0
474,my sister and i arrived here after a long day of flying from the dublin airport it was an easy bus ride for a walk to this hotel i had requested a quiet room so we could get plenty of sleep and get over our jet lag as soon as possible we were given a room on the top floor facing the back which was perfect we had a nice view and occasionally heard church bells toll the hotel manager was charming and helpful in her suggestions for wonderful nearby restaurants staying there nights was a perfect amount of time to walk through the city and see the sights,1
475,stayed in a refurbished room absolutely fabulous modern decor lovely and calming well equipped and spacious room very soundproof from both inside and who checked us in was very friendly as was girl who served us bar food sorry i do have names,1
476,located just outside downtown dublin these two converted town houses are a kind of b b with around rooms it is adjacent to a commercial street that has several good restaurants shopping and conveniences the service was excellent and the sitting room near the entrance and desk quite pleasant,1
477,quiet understated superbly located lodging with warm and gracious staff the perfect dawn reception following a flight a short walk across the canal to parks aka squares shopping and trinity college just lovely,1
478,arrived after a cramped cold trans atlantic flight to be warmly greeted and told our room was available at am excellent staff quiet well appointed rooms and a lovely walkable neighborhood with a wide range of restaurants pubs and parks within walking distance of stephens green city centre and trinity college highly recommend and will stay here again,1
479,my husband and i stayed nights at the clayton cardiff hotel it is a great location on sir john rogerson quay near the theatre walkable to good restaurants the hotel offers a nice restaurant with good breakfast buffet and gourmet dinner options clean rooms good health and fitness center the staff is friendly and responsive i lost an item and honest staff returned it to me promptly,1
480,my husband and i stayed at waterloo house for three nights at the end of may and could not have been more pleased the location is ideal for visiting dublin the airport aircoach stop is a couple blocks from the house and public buses into city center pick up just a few doors down the street only used them once however as it is an easy and enjoyable walk from waterloo house into downtown dublin the neighborhood is quiet and feels safe with numerous shops and restaurants in short walking distance the georgian house is charming and our room at the back of the house was sizable and very clean with a spacious bath and comfortable bed lovely view out on the garden and the rooftops beyond there was some barking from the resident dogs at the start of each night but they soon quieted down so it was not a problem fabulous breakfasts with a variety of cooked options in addition to an extensive buffet the staff were attentive and accommodating especially irene who was most helpful and and welcoming although the steps up to the front door are rather steep the house does have an elevator which i believe can also be accessed from a ground floor entrance if stairs are a problem all in all a delightful and memorable stay for our first visit to dublin,1
481,really nice place near the grand canal welcoming staff team and good dinner my room was nice and quiet but odd as it had beds nice breakfast also would recommend good for business or leisure did get chance to try the gym,1
482,my wife and i are enjoying our stay at the mespil the rooms are clean and well kept breakfast was quite good offering a really nice variety of hot and cold items the equipment in the gym was new and well maintained also a very reasonable walk min or so to city centre there are good restaurants right around the hotel too thanks,1
483,very king and gentle personnel always available for servings and good advices very good position with bus stop at the door and a straight line to the centre of dublin wonderful terrace to have breakfast in a cute room are not big enough for three persons but good for a couple,1
485,my mother and i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel during our visit to dublin the staff is extremely friendly and helpful from the bar supervisor ivan to the ever so helpful customer service director derek burke i would highly recommend it,1
486,this was my first trip to the clayton hotel and i was very impressed from the moment i walked into the lobby i knew that i was going to have a great stay and i was right the bedroom was on the floor and was stunning comfortable and spacious the beds were comfy and big we ate in the vertigo bar the nights and the food was amazing the breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choices of fruit cereal fry bread juice and toast i had a very enjoyably stay and will definitely be back thanks to all the staff that took care of us from repection to leisure center and all in between especially erika who organized our stay i be back,1
487,absolutely amazing hotel nothing was too much trouble and got great recommendations from the staff for nights out cocktail bars and restaurant choices also enjoyed a manicure in the spa located within the hotel and could be happier for people going for the nightlife the bar also has great deals for cocktails and they do the trick would return great place,1
488,we just spent one night here and really enjoyed it found the staff great all round very friendly tapas drinks good quite reasonably priced ate out elsewhere then returned to a fab evening in the bar which was like a nightclub great dj and atmosphere overall really enjoyed ourselves and would hesitate to return at some stage many thanks,1
490,what a hotel excellent location being at the heart of temple bar next door to the hard rock cafe and a min walk from grafton street the manager was more than friendly and helpful in fact he could have been a better manager greeted with two complimentary cocktails which were amazing food was lovely rooms were perfect with everything you would need the hotel also has an amazingly cosy smoking area which seemed to be where a lot of people chilled out as it has heated sofas and it just lovely the hotel is super busy on a friday and saturday night as it is a popular place for drinks so the vibe is great also very close to many and food places i really ca fault this hotel could have asked for a better stay,1
491,on a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the morgan for three nights the location of this hotel is excellent for those wishing the fun atmosphere of the temple bar with convenient walking distance and to bus routes to dublin were so tired from our daily excursions that the nightlife noise did not bother us too much and the hotel provided earplugs which were included near the bathroom amenities our room was on the second floor facing the street so with windows opened it was a bit noisy we shut the windows the next night and put on the ac and that solved the noise problem we booked this hotel through tripadvisor which was easy and allowed us to get a better rate we opted for breakfast to be included which offered a great selection of fruit pastries eggs sausage bacon and typical irish breakfast fare breakfast wait staff were great and attentive in fact all staff members were helpful and friendly shout outs to sonia who directed us to a local vendor who helped with our computer issues and to david our personable server at breakfast the morgan is part of the intercontinental hotel properties i would highly recommend this hotel for tourists,1
492,this is a very cosy place indeed my favourite when it comes to business trips quiet and discrete with high service and lots of privacy good beds and nights are silent a nice fireplace where you can have business meetings my first priority when it comes to stays in dublin been visiting multiple times highly recommended hope to be back soon,1
493,we arrived at number after a long drive from cork noel immediately jumped into action moved our car brought tea and talked us through the nearby geography of dublin the service was friendly informal and warm the breakfasts were stupendous and the company and conversation in the breakfast room was also warm and friendly like the owner and the employees we would go back in a heartbeat thank you noel and deirdre,1
494,the rooms themselves are nothing special although well equipped and the beds are very the bar and restaurants are very trendy and busy which makes it a place to stay are very friendly and the place is very is of course ideally placed with a car park just opposite offering a discount rate of euro per night if u stay in the hotel,1
495,we stayed for three nights in this excellent friendly georgian house which is spacious with high ceilings comfortable beds and were provided with a wonderful breakfast there is a good sitting area with books and a peat rooms were in fitzwilliam place which is a separate georgian building connected to leeson close by a small peaceful is an excellent bed breakfast situated close to st stephen green and walking distance from all the major attractions on the south side of dublin,1
496,our room had large windows which provided ample light a high ceiling and lots of old georgian house charm although there was street noise from fitzwilliam place we got used to it and it was a problem our first impression of the neighborhood when we arrived from our flight before was that it was very quiet perhaps a bit isolated we soon discovered that we were wrong on that there are numerous interesting restaurants within close walking distance and stephens green and city center are also only a few minutes walk away a very nice offer by number is to invite folks arriving early like we did to join other guests for breakfast and their breakfasts are outstanding so we were able to get a good start on our first day in dublin an excellent experience,1
497,enjoyed a spectacular visit at the number back in march took me a while to sit down to finally write a review but refused to not share what an awesome experience i had at this wonderful home away from home feeling of a and breakfast noel and linda are the sweetest and super helpful i had to cut my visit short because of an issue with my travel companions and they were nice enough to offer me various options to make my stay in dublin amazing i have recommended their place to several friends back in the no other place to stay but number phenomenal breakfast and afternoon great location fantastic owners cute rooms stayed in their largest rooms downstairs meant for a family cool courtyard do miss out on this gem,1
500,wanted a place that we could dive to that would be convenient to everything without driving too fat into dublin this place was great large clean rooms helpful staff stores restaurants pubs buses cabs all convenient to hotel,1
502,from the moment we entered this hotel our stay was perfect room was beautiful and had everything we needed all of the staff were extremely friendly accommodating and were willing to go the extra mile a special thank you to hazel who found out we had just got engaged and gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco this made our stay extra special we did eat in the hotel so ca comment on the food but the bar area was lovely and the afternoon tea looked amazing although the room was incredibly hot we were provided with a fan without even having to ask this hotel is in a great location with lots of shops and restaurants on the same street number bus from the airport it takes about and it drops you right outside the hotel it is also a short bus trip to the city centre and buses are very frequent i will be recommending this hotel to all friends and family and wo hesitate to return when i dublin next,1
503,my husband and i spent our first two nights in ireland at the wynn hotel on lower abbey street in dublin the staff was wonderful the bed was comfortable and the full irish breakfast delicious it is a lovely old hotel in a perfect location with both a restaurant and bar no taxi is needed to get everywhere you would want to go close to trinity college and street shopping pubs and restaurants,1
504,we had a one night stay in a very comfortable and clean room at back so not a good view the hotel is well decorated and style befits its history staff very helpful and friendly we enjoyed a lovely full breakfast from a wide range of choices hotel could not be better located ten yards from street and a tram stop just feet away from door of hotel the dining room is lovely and bar has a good feel and serves good food one negative there is no lounge to to sit around in other than the bar which can be busy overall a great hotel if a little expensive,1
505,this old classic hotel is a bit worn but worth it it is in close proximity to trinity college the newly renovated art museum and not far from the main shopping area the rooms are of adequate size and they hay have king rather than double beds always a good thing,1
506,the hotel has very high standards when it comes to premises and service a special thanks goes to claire for helping us out with the bookings and check in even going the extra mile by supporting us with info related to dublin,1
507,we spent one night in this lovely hotel from the moment we entered we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome from the wonderful lady on reception her name is roberta and she made us feel as if we were royalty what a lovely person who is an asset to the hotel we got a great room looking out onto abbey street it was furnished beautifully and it was spotlessly clean the whole hotel was so clean we remarked about it to the staff at breakfast too as i dont remember when i stayed in such a clean hotel the breakfast was fabulous and the staff were second to none i cant say enough good things about this gem of a hotel right in the centre of dublin,1
508,great location i arrived with the train at heuston station and took the red line tram directly to the hotel the next day i only had to walk a few hundred metres to the airport bus great the staff was extremely nice i had requested a bath and the woman at reception had made sure i got one breakfast was really nice and the waiters charming and funny i will definitely stay here the downside wifi never worked and there was quite a lot of noise from the street,1
509,danilo was a friendly ahd helpful man who got us quickly registered and tried very hard to help us get registration problems sorted out he was back in the morning and promptly got us checked out and called a cab to get us to the train breakfast was good and it was filling the room was wonderful and comfortable we recommend the hotel to anyone who is going in this area,1
510,this world class hotel is an unexpected delight impeccably managed with discrete service and understated elegance the hotel is now undergoing a barely perceptible that is sure to put it in the same league as paris bristol and london connaught sumptuous indoor pool that rivals the pool at the ritz in paris quiet drawing rooms where tour groups mercifully would feel out of place for those accustomed to privilege who value tradition and luxury,1
511,my wife and i loved our stay st the marker we started our vacation in ireland at the marker for daysand finished our vacation hereall the staff were excellent starthe roof bar is outstanding we will return,1
512,if you are staying in dublin this is the hotel to select it is very clean the staff is friendly the location is central to most anything and in the evening when you go to sleep it is quiet this is truly a five star hotel,1
513,we wanted a light lunch and found just the thing in the merrion lobby bar we had the number each which consisted of a small bowl of delicious soup a small assortment of crust less sandwiches and a small chocolate dessert it just hit the spot the surroundings are beautiful with some excellent decor and art just sit and de stress after a days shopping on grafton street,1
514,my wife and i stayed at the marker hotel in dublin twice during our trip throughout the british isles it is five star accommodation with very friendly and helpful staff the location is a newly developing area by the canal river and docks we found that the price of the hotel and parking was quite high even using discounts provided through,1
515,absolutely loved the marker the room bathroom and amenities were top notch the bar has a great selection and their complimentary nuts are so good service is top of the line i was so happy that my dad who was traveling with us took advantage of the tub to relax and loved the shower great views great staff,1
516,one night spent in dublin on business and in all respects the fitzwilliam hotel met expectations nothing would have been too much trouble to the helpful and friendly team if i had any suggestion for improvement it would be to provide a slightly less exclusive dining experience without the need to spoon cereal into breakfast bowls using silver the arrival experience could be tweaked as the desk is tucked away in the corner of the lobby while a tourist information desk is most prominent in the hotel entrance,1
517,even in good hotels i usually find some little niggly detail that was quite right but i can honestly say this hotel was faultless we flew into dublin early and taxied to the hotel arriving expecting to bag check but we were able to check in immediately and access our room the hotel must be very new it was spotless and everything felt new and fresh the outlook was good the facilities were good we did have breakfast there so ca comment on that but there was a great café yards away it is a little bit further out of the city centre but we walked in about minutes or a cab would take no time the staff were helpful and friendly room spacious bathroom really gorgeous with big shower and a bath facilities and a fridge good storage space just all perfect,1
518,a very modern and hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the service was everything was we would definitely recommend this hotel the staff was very helpful in booking tourist tickets,1
519,clontarf castle staff made this visit a lifetime experience this was my first time back in ireland in years special thanks to marta who was originally from poland and took a special genuine interest in our brief visit over to kraków and then when we returned to clontarf castle where karen the irish waitress was also just as kind my apologies to all the other wonderful staff whose names i ca remember they made this trip wonderful clearly whoever does the hiring around here is a genius because i never seen such a group of and dedicated staff who genuinely take pride in providing their guests with a truly remarkable experience thanks so much,1
520,we love to stay at the merrion as it is a home away from home everyone is so welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate your every request it is also a very beautiful hotel the location is perfect with easy access to grafton street the national gallery stephen green and trinity college,1
521,a modern castle hotel much more live able and much much mores affordable than the other castles we stayed at during our plus weeks in staff here was simply amazing without being room with its bed was our last great memorty of our the lounge was fair priced were you were hesitant about ordering more than one drink,1
522,my husband and i stayed at ariel house twice in july and were very pleased the beautifully converted victorian building is conveniently located near restaurants laundry and dart station the bedroom was small but well furnished and we had access to a comfortable drawing room for reading and afternoon tea an ample and varied breakfast with table service was provided in an attractive setting what made this hotel truly outstanding though was the extraordinary concierge service anything we needed from advice to ice for a sprained ankle was immediately provided with courtesy but no fuss i have traveled extensively for five decades ariel house tops every other hotel staff experience,1
523,i was here on a three nights sightseeing trip with my teenage son who had requested a comfy quiet room and good breakfast as mother and son we also wanted twin beds clontarf delivered on all points the room was not super large but large enough with a sitting nook comfy high twin beds that were cm wide lovely locally made toiletries and facility european and american power sockets were a nice touch the room was also very quiet breakfast was fresh much of it was and it was beautifully served in one of the castle characterful rooms travelling to and from the city did take some time around min walk to and around min transport time to connolly station leaving every minutes or so this was not a problem for us who did not mind walking and had bought leap transportation cards as one tour guide said there is no place in dublin that not noisy and clontarf was our quiet oasis after intense city strolls staff was lovely and very helpful but often busy this is a place where you carry your suitcase yourself i personally found the decoration of the hotel a bit kitsch but my teenager loved it,1
524,we are just back from an amazing stay in the castle we had a brilliant time the hotel staff were excellent with us and the food was of the highest quality on the first night we ate in the knights bar and we well looked after and for our anniversary meal we booked the fahrenheit grill and it was outstanding this is one trip we will never forget highly recommended this castle,1
525,nothing ostentetios just pure class excellent location service and anything else you should expect to see in the star hotel nice beds excellent tea service and the star michelin restaurant next door,1
526,excellent service exceptional food have enjoyed at in some of the finest hotels in dublin incl merrion westbury and enjoyed the whole experience here more afternoon tea with a lovely difference,1
528,after reading other reviews we decided that ariel house would be a good place for our night stay upon arrival in ireland it was a bit longer walk into dublin town center than expected about minutes and we are not slow walkers however we enjoyed the stroll on several occasions light outside until pm in june and the quiet stay away from the noise and activity of downtown our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean despite the older bedroom carpet and decor a highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room traditional eggs benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads muffins fruit juice cereals coffee and tea we also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee tea with china cups saucers and mini cake bites there was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at dublin airport we did not use the car while in dublin but did not want to spend time obtaining it before starting our ireland road trip on day there is a steep staircase to reach the front door so do pack light,1
530,my husband and i stayed at ariel house for three nights in july and to say that our stay was absolutely wonderful is an understatement the location is quiet convenient and charming the hotel is beautiful and comfortable the breakfast is fantastic the customer is outstanding and beyond anything we have ever experienced upon our arrival i was quite ill and realized that i required medical attention cecelia immediately called different medical providers and arranged an appointment and transportation to the facility on that first evening we had an unfortunate accident involving the toilet in our room our fault the ever kind and cheerful cecelia evaluated the situation and arranged an alternate room for the night the toilet was repaired actually replaced the next morning at and the owner jennie absolutely refused to allow us to pay for it jennie and her staff assisted us with bus routes sightseeing tickets and more the staff is readily available to assist with any questions and requests when we return to dublin we would not even consider staying anywhere else ariel house does have ample parking and is a leisurely walk from the nearest bus stop congratulations to ariel house as you are finest accommodations in dublin sincerely your american friends karen and gary gray,1
531,this hotel is in a really convenient location to the airport and downtown the restaurant and pub area served really good meals that were enjoyed by all the halls and common areas are clean and updated the room was very nicely equipped and clean a definite stay,1
532,this is a lovely hotel definitely the nicest one we stayed at during our tour de ireland the rooms are nice and updated and the bathrooms were very spacious i would say quality would be on par with a courtyard which is pretty good for a european hotel our room was on floor which is actually the second floor but it was very quiet even the night after a big match at croke one thing i did love was the location trade off it was a solid minute walk from downtown we timed it one night took to minutes to walk from christ church there not much around the hotel bleecker st cafe is a minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every min or so a can from temple bar costs to euros not a bad trade off for a quiet hotel,1
533,seems reasonably new but has an established charm about it directly opposite croke park it might be wise to check if any major events are scheduled before booking here it also a minute walk to the more touristy areas of dublin and the restaurant precinct he rooms a good size they were quiet and there is also free parking and beds were comfortable but the saggy pillows were a disappointment the bathroom was huge with a long deep soaking bath greta after all that walking those not from need to be aware of safety latches on some hot water taps our showers were cool to cold and we could work out why especially as we could have scorchingly hot baths hotel staff were efficient and friendly with the exception of those we encountered at the a latte seemed to take an indication the croke park is similar in both style and price to a mid tier accor properties such as novotel but it has a little more character i stay here again if returning to dublin,1
534,we enjoyed our stay the room was very large by european standards typical size about a mile from the city center it if you up for it or you can take a bus or a taxi very busy on game weekends but it did hinder our agenda,1
535,always love to stay at the westbury when in dublin which is fairly often last week was no different just love to sit in the lobby with glass of wine in hand people watching the are all just perfect kudos to a job continuing to be well done,1
536,we stayed at the westbury at the end of our itinerary side note the train to galway is inexpensive easy and just a bit longer than driving after small rooms at other hotels the westbury was a nice and luxurious way to end the trip our room was spacious and nicely appointed the staff was helpful and responsive and the friendly bartenders at the bar make outstanding cocktails you can not beat this location a block from grafton but still quiet as a bonus for music nerds like me the hotel is near the statue of phil lynott we will return to the westbury,1
537,this is our stay here absolutely perfect location and amenities comfortable rooms great bfast buffet awesome lobby bar and great restaurants great staff too highly recommend it a bit pricey but well worth it,1
538,aberdeen lodge has everything you may want from a bed and brakfast accomodation the house is lovely and charming placed in a quiet beautiful leafy residential area it near to a pleasant beach walk and perfectly connected to the city room was very nice and clean and fully functional the breakfast is rich with plenty of delicious choices last but not least you find smiles kindness and a real sense of hospitality definitely come back,1
539,this is the first place we stayed the beginning of a month journey in ireland the we booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early we wanted to be sure we had the room apparently there was a miscue the hotel thought we were a no show well this amazing staff jumped right on it had us in a room in no time they were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way it went uphill from there they recognized us when we were in the lobby asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable we were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our night stay we booked the room through virtuoso we use them or amex platinum program which lists a room upgrade if available upon check in the hotel did have the upgrade the first night but called a day later moved us into a junior suite really lovely each every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel make every effort to make guests feel special joseph is the guest relations manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome rory is the front office manager who we are still talking about wow does he love his job we watched him interacting with guests spending more time with us than he really needed to an affable manager who wants,1
540,great end to our dublin holiday at balfe at the westbury tonight exceptional service from gabriel our waiter who went the extra mile above and beyond our expectations friendly and welcoming perfect we will be back,1
542,we spent lovely days in dublin and stayed at the aberdeen lodge it is a beautiful lodge and innkeepers are extremely helpful the accommodations and food were exceptional it was nice to get out of but still convenient to the city center lovely area of dublin,1
544,aberdeen lodge is found in the sandymount district on the southern side of dublin it is on a beautiful residential street and fits right in with its impressive brick exterior but it what inside that makes this a great place to stay when visiting ireland capital visit was just for two nights upon arrival we parked our car in the parking area at the front of the lodge and did use it again until it was time to go to the airport which by the way is only about minutes away via an easy direct route we were greeted by a lovely young employee who took the time to show us maps that gave us an idea of where we were and how we could easily get into central dublin by using public transportation she was great cogent and to our room no required a hike up a few flights of stairs it was large and quite comfortable it featured a bed that was truly enormous at night we communicated by semaphore windows looked out on the backyard and beyond that you could hear bat striking ball and shouts coming from the pembroke cricket club ground and the occasional rumble of a dart train heading to or from downtown the bathroom was adequate with an average sized tub the shower was great breakfasts at aberdeen lodge were truly terrific everything was fresh including orange juice a wide variety of fruits and cereals were offered along with the option for variations,1
545,clean friendly and unobtrusive but efficient service lovely bright room with all amenities and in a great location for town nice presentation of food and drinks i hope i get the chance to stay again,1
546,i often stay at hiltons but not as regularly at doubletree hotels this hotel though was fantastic modern clean very good staff who were helpful and courteous at all times great breakfast an overall thoroughly enjoyable stay,1
547,stayed at the morrison found it to be very central for shops restaurants and bars the hotel is located very close to bridge and across the river from temple bar it was very clean and modern the staff were all excellent and really helpful especially darren at reception we received cookies on checking in which is apparently a doubletree thing though i stayed at other doubletrees and never received them and they were amazing the breakfasts were also really good would definitely stay at this hotel again when back in dublin,1
548,we researched a lot of hotels on line and we found the morrison checked all our boxes an easy walk across the bridge over to the temple bar district the morrison is close enough to have fun yet far enough away for a quiet night sleep modern decor is fun and inviting staff was super worth the price,1
549,not sure what it is about going over seas and staying at a good hotel but they know how to do it right the staff was incredibly friendly answered all our questions and we had a lot also helped with good directions when we were leaving we were before our check in time but they go us right in rooms are clean and comfortable we had an issue with our door the batteries had died and we could get in the woman at the front desk dropped everything to help me out breakfast is to die for everything you could possibly want the eggs benedict was incredible i love the welcome on the tv when we come in the letter from the staff welcoming us and then the extra water and chocolate bar on the bed when we gone out thank you so much not only is the hotel in a great spot the staff is truly what makes it the best,1
550,i have just returned from a two night stay at your wonderful hotel where nothing was a problem to resolve i must mention in particular anne kinsella who looked after us so well and marvin who very kindly walked us to the gaiety in case we got lost the restaurant staff were excellent and all our requests were met i look forward to returning and will be recommending it to all my friends in cork and elsewhere thanks again kay,1
551,we arrived at the brooks hotel after a hour flight from the states absolutely exhausted and a nice young man at the desk greeted us and informed us of places to visit on the map he gave us he also said there was a lounge downstairs for guests who wanted to take a nap before their room was ready or just to relax my dad wanted some coffee so he asked at the front desk and they brought it down to him on a platter what amazing service we were able to get in around as the young man had put us as a top priority and the room was fantastic and clean the room staff was super friendly and the head maid actually checked on us to make sure we made it to our room okay breakfast was the only part of this trip that could use some work simply because the head of the separate restaurant where breakfast is served is quite stuck up however the restaurant as i said it separate from the hotel so does not take away anything from the hotel great staff who are friendly and always on hand would absolutely stay again we were absolutely spoiled in great hospitality and the rest of our hotels for the rest of our trip in europe had high bars to reach to come close to the brooks hotel,1
552,good location friendly staff wonderful breakfast we stayed here for two nights i left my sunglasses behind and they helped mail them to me at my home in the states thank you they arrived today in perfect condition,1
553,my husband and i spent nights at the brooks hotel in late june i would say this is one of the best locations in dublin for sightseeing without a need for a car on one side of the hotel was a starbucks and the other side was a typical irish pub with great food and friendly staff we walked to most of the sights although several days is needed to see everything the weather was cool and wet but the room was very spacious nicely decorated and comfortable with and a pillow menu it is close to temple bar but far enough away to avoid the met barry the manager who was very friendly and helpful as were all the staff on any future trips to dublin i would certainly stay here again,1
555,we are here on a two night stay and loved it so much we booked another night for our return trip the staff is truly wonderful from the moment we checked in we were given great service the concierge provided two great restaurant recommendations pinchet and rustic stone both exceeded our room is clean well appointed quiet and there is a beautiful view of the city from our mint bar was a nice surprise great wine selections and highly recommend the westin not only for the local but more importantly for the outstanding service and wait to return next saturday,1
556,the hotel is situated just across the street from trinity college the main attraction of the city and a block from the pedestrian street where the famous temple bar is located their service is very good and the breakfast is outstanding i definitely recommend this hotel,1
557,firstly i have to say that the hotel is very well appointed however we feel let down in many critical areas the room was euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had no windows it had a roof light and very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box the explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room so the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people do need a view we were disturbed after by housekeeping offering a down service we did take this up with mr zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time available if not we have to accept the windowless box again i guess i genuinely felt very uncomfortable about this lack of window it made me very anxious and i not the handicapped partner really upset and disappointed westin gold member and loyal to the brand no longer,0
558,this hotel has everything one needs its located just near christ church and dublin castle its an easy walk everywhere a pet peeve of mine is the breakfast extortion game many european hotels charge where it costs euros when all you want us a cup of coffee and a croissant this hotel allows you to order a la carte in the lobby lounge w wonderful respite about from the scavengers picking apart the room was clean modern and the bed was very comfortable the only thing is that housekeeping tended to make up our room late in the day between which meant after a long day out in the city we sometimes returned with a room unmade and being tired we had to call down to find out when they could clean it could have been the location of our room at the end of the hallway,1
559,you ca get a more central location then this hotel everything is within min walking distance from shops parks transport pubs restaurants etc once you step into this beautiful property staff are welcoming you with warm smiles and make you feel right at home you forget your even in the city i loved their signature white tea aroma that filled the hallways the bedrooms are incredibly spacious and inviting decorated in warm tones their heavenly beds do not disappoint either and their waterfall shower is amazing staff went above and beyond during our stay had some food and drinks in the mint bar highly recommend the pesto chips i previously enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea here which everyone needs to experience staff take the very best care of you and ensure you are completely at ease by providing a personalised service breakfast is amazing even if you are not a guest i would recommend spending your morning enjoying their buffet selection and fresh coffees i was disappointed to leave as it felt like home for me but i will absolutely be back for another stay,1
560,perfect location few steps from trinity college and across the street from temple bar beautiful facilities and very comfortable rooms the restaurant was fantastic and service exceptional all expectations met as a westin property,1
561,perfectly placed for the city our room was spacious and clean and even though we were at the front of the hotel there was no noise at all so our sleep was never disturbed the bed was wonderful a very good size and probably the most comfortable bed we ever slept in when away from home staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome would recommend this hotel without any hesitation,1
562,it was excellent service and nice staying at this wonderful welcome at the checking time with nice and friendly staff room is clean and comfortable even though the hotel does have any outside views as it located and almost surrounded by buildings and far from noisy streets we enjoyed the stay rooms are air breakfast is good with excellent helpful freindly and pleasant staff thank you for great service and highly recommend,1
563,great location comfortable rooms lovely service and amazing breakfast the staff were extremely helpful and polite nothing was too much definitely use this hotel again on either business or as a relaxing short break,1
564,struggled to choose accommodation in dublin as everything is so expensive and the quality seems lacking for the price finally settled on the radisson being a chain and having some level of expectation from previous stays i joined their members club for free online which gave me access to the lowest standard rate cheaper than all of the hotel booking agent sites the hotel is situated on the edge of the main city centre it certainly not too far to walk anywhere and honestly nice to be close enough but not in the hustle and not disappointed with quality king size bed and very comfy room furnishings were modern and the room was large and clean excellent bathroom with full bath and walk in rain shower we had the buffet breakfast the next morning in the restaurant and it was lovely could not fault it extensive range of hot and cold foods excellent we had a really pleasant stay for our last night in dublin the hotel is certainly worth the price if i had to look for faults the pillows were not great but i believe that just a personal preference also the fire doors between the lift foyer in the basement and into the bedrooms corridor on level one are extremely heavy and i struggled to open then while trying to manoeuvre a stroller as did my husband with the luggage trolley all minor issues though would definitely stay here again and highly recommend,1
565,we visited ireland on our honeymoon and stayed in two hotels while in dublin at the beginning and end of our trip i so glad we tried this hotel because it was absolutely gorgeous and such an amazing way to end our honeymoon the location was great and easily walkable to things the staff were friendly and the room was amazing honestly it was a perfect hotel,1
566,travelled as family of and the hotel met our needs one of the best family rooms we have stayed in large comfortable bed and not a sofa bed in sight great breakfast kids loved the pancake machine,1
567,after visiting dublin many times the spencer is definitely the best hotel i have stayed in in dublin the bar has a cool relaxed atmosphere in the evenings as the live dj plays r b the cocktails are amazing and the food in the thai restaurant is incredible after telling the spencer the trip was for an we got an upgrade and rose petals were put on the bed as well as a desert plate saying happy birthday the staff were efficient and ensured we were happy with our trip would definitely visit again,1
568,we stayed here for one night after getting married in the city the hotel staff were fabulous and really made the stay extra special for us on account of the special occasion the room had fantastic views floor to ceiling windows over the river the city and the mountains in the background bathroom was well equiped very good location in the city,1
569,location was very nice and room very clean staff was kind and helpful to us we had a very nice stay location was close to downtown dublin and easily walkable to and from different places nice neighborhood,1
570,this hotel is on the banks of the liffey in dublin financial district the surrounding area is spacious and quiet with many shops places to eat and drink if you take the time to find them the hotel itself is run very professionally with great customer service the rooms are clean spacious and the quality of sleep was excellent with the luas just around the corner and busaras connolly mins walk away it is a great location just off the city center,1
573,we stayed in one of the houses which are owned by desmond the owned of the roxford lodge we booked the house thru airbnb the house was clean modern and well appointed with everything that we needed for our is excellent several local bars and restaurants within metres and a minute walk to trinity college temple bar was an convivial and gracious host and even provided us with some basic foodstuffs on will not be disappointed with this property,1
574,the rooms did not correspond to the rooms at the pictures on the website the size of the room is very different form what is stated when booking it shows that triple rooms are but the actual size of the room was less then the hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived was not small dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room all the halls and corridors are very tiny if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel also no place for the luggage in the room we had to use an extra bed for it the hotel manager was rude to us screaming and shouting sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the website so upon the issue was solved if you book this hotel please do not expect to live in the rooms which are on the pictures and have the size that stated on the website they are tricking people,0
575,thanks again to all the staff who took great care of us at the shelbourne hotel my wife and i had a wonderful stay chris at the front desk was extremely helpful in ensuring we were taken care of before our room was ready and this was much appreciated after a long flight also i like to recognize pawel in the saddle room for his phenomenal customer service and recommendations on within the city the room was clean and comfortable with many amenities i stayed at many hotels and a few star hotels through europe and the states and by far you all are number one in my book,1
576,the queen rooms are small as in new york hotel but comfortable if you can handle the size of the room this hotel has an ideal location across from stephen green and within walking distance to many sights shops museums grafton and temple bar unlike other reviewers we had a good experience with the staff and the concierge desk we found them to be knowledgeable and helpful and the concierge provided great suggestions regarding an excursion to howth that we were considering a trip that we made after the concierge enthusiastically endorsed the idea and gave us some tips and for pubs and restaurants in central dublin the gym is small but it has enough equipment to allow for a solid workout,1
577,what a lovely hotel situated close to st stephen green and close to fine dining and many of the sites a visitor would want to see while in dublin including trinity college the national archaeology museum the national gallery and grafton street too our accommodations were lovely my family went to bed and i took the opportunity to spend a luxurious hour plus in our perfectly huge and well appointed bathroom i never do that while traveling never taking the time to really enjoy a room here at the shelbourne i did staff were fabulous and helpful our car was waiting for us as we exiting the hotel highly recommend,1
578,i spent a delightful few days in this historic hotel that was completely updated about ten years ago and is now a marriott renaissance property the public rooms are beautiful and elegant the food and service were excellent at the restaurants the hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming my spacious floor room had high windows that looked out over stephen s green and beyond the bed was extremely comfortable the beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub shower and commode was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving the room had plenty of lighting a good work desk and plush comfortable reading chairs soundproofing was excellent and i never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly service the hotel has a great location two blocks from the natural history museum and the national gallery of ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and was disappointed when i had to leave the shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent dublin hotel the westbury a century property that does not have the same level of elegance warmth or beauty the combination of history comfort and grace makes the shelbourne an extraordinary place they clearly value their guests and make them feel special it was a wonderful introduction to dublin and really deserves six stars,1
579,stayed here while visiting dublin and surrounding areas the hotel location can not be beat we were able to walk to most sites restaurants and shopping our balcony room on the floor was spacious and comfortable breakfasts were very tasty with many choices would definitely recommend,1
580,good location seconds to grafton street very friendly front of house staff nice rooms although my room was on the small side and the room and bathroom could probably do with a refurbishment very nice lobby area and bar the letdown was the breakfast service with slow and very unfriendly service especially compared to other hotel staff on morning four i just got up and walked out after waiting min to try and order no hot buffet received an apology later and coffee in bar as compensation but then drink was charged on checkout,0
581,we stayed here for a weekend nice hotel not quite sure about the decor of the rooms but it was one excellent feature was the very powerful shower really great though you need to leave the bathroom door open otherwise everything gets wet from condensation very good central location we walked to most places we wanted to see,1
582,this is a very intimate centrally located hotel the rooms are small but have all the amenities the staff is very helpful there is a bar downstairs that has good food and music on most nights i highly recommend the harding,1
583,very nice hotel the best breakfast we had on us trip the service is outstanding if you want to discover dublin then is this the right spot for doing it the bus stops in front of the hotel you have at the back a free parking the standard room is small but nice,1
585,arrived early dublin mid morning was allowed to use secure parking and booked straight in good quiet location short walk to hop on hop off stop fantastic staff nice room great bath short distance to aviva stadium min walk great for the rugby internationals,1
586,nice room had access to patio which was a sun trap it could be used by two other rooms but we only seen one couple for about an hour bathroom ok room was clean coffee machine a lovely touch staff were very friendly and helpful there is no residents bar but advertises drinks can be purchased ar reception for the lounge very limited selection only spirits were barcardi jameson and gin no vodka only a small point but as the surrounding area was packed due to the match at aviva all the bars were busy so was looking forward to a drink at the hotel before bed however lovely hotel we loved the patio and for aviva would definitely stay here again,1
587,we stayed here for two nights and it had several lovely staff was lovely and very helpful we had a couple of issues and they were pleasant the whole time room was nice enough and had air conditioning we had a room with both a tub and a sauna and i used both and they both were very relaxing also i accidentally left a bunch of undergarmets in the drawer of the room i emailed the day we left and they held them for me for a week so i could pick them up before i left location was also lovely just a short walk to town that made it so we could be away from the hubbub but still be able to access it breakfast was also lovely but this is the only place i stayed during my week in ireland that did have breakfast included in the room price cons couple of minor problems that added together lost it a star i used the jetted tub on the first night and it would drain the front desk said it would sometimes get jammed but they could fix it until the morning i also could figure out how to get the coffee maker to work also when i picked up my things i left they had added a bunch of stuff to the bag magazines a magnet etc that someone else had left behind i thought the magazines came with the room but apparently it just was cleaned well,1
588,we had a great stay at the harding the rooms were comfortable but oddly shaped we were on the fifth floor and had to maneuver around some angles in the ceiling it did get a bit noisy on saturday night with the pub below us but they close at it is centrally located and we could walk to most things,1
590,this was our second time staying at the harding hotel and it did disappoint the location is perfect the rooms are spacious and cozy and the staff warm welcoming and helpful the harding represents everything that makes ireland such a lovely country and the copper alley bistro breakfast is such a great way to start your day stay here you will not be sorry,1
593,we only stayed one night saturday in the conrad and they could not have been more helpful almost overwhelmingly so good sized bedroom and larger than normal bathroom it was perfect location for the national concert hall and restaurants which was why we chose it single gripe was that i had to put my suitcase on the floor as there was no luggage rack or at least none that i could find,1
594,great location excellent staff and service i will definitely stay there again the breakfast had superb selection for all tastes the staff go beyond there way to help you and make sure your stay is exceptional,1
595,stayed for nights in dublin at this wonderful hotel just south of st stephens green this was an ideal location for the iveagh gardens which was the purpose of our arrival at the hotel we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in early without comment we had expected to just be able to leave our bags until check in time we stayed in a superior room which was large well appointed and very quiet everything was spotless including the bathroom although it could have been improved with a separate rather than over the bath room included a coffee machines with pods provided mini fridge with water alongside the usual tea bags and hot chocolate was very good with a full breakfast buffet labelled to show that the sausages bacon etc were irish produce good selection of homemade muffins cakes scones and croissants there were also a menu that you could order from which included things like french toast pancakes and omelettes the only thing that could have been improved on was the wait time for someone to come back and check if you did want to place an order but i am being very picky is brilliant for the city centre and just round the corner from one of the airport shuttle be visiting again,1
596,i greatly appreciated the welcoming staff they were professional and helpful and made the stay for myself and my family and enjoyable experience great location to the park and great shopping and dining areas,1
597,staff are top notch and i are the best hotel staff of any hotel i stayed in ireland from the night porter michael whom greeted us at with a cheery smile and friendly manner to the receptionist and the staff at the buffet breakfast each location is on a quiet street very close to saint stephen green and the city center our room was comfortable and very little street noise could be heard the bed was comfortable and the shower was good and the bathroom was very clean buffet breakfast was served with french press coffee that was tasty and was fresh made the bar in the lower floor has a good selection of imported beer and beers from galway brewing company and excellent onion rings i thought parking at euros a night was not overpriced for this central only complaint was that we in early am and slept for a few hours and found it hard to sleep due to other guests slamming their doors,1
598,this hotel was absolutely wonderful to stay at it was located in a central part of dublin enabling walking to most places the hotel staff was top notch warm helpful and very service oriented i would recommend the conrad dublin to anyone coming to dublin,1
599,our experience at the conrad in dublin far surpassed our expectations the wonderful service and amenities of the conrad added very much to our experience special to manager deepu who so warmly welcomed us and made sure that we were very well taken care of we highly recommend the conrad and its fine staff,1
600,we were able to stay at the conrad on a recent trip to dublin the hotel is very nice and the rooms are well appointed generally we like to stay in smaller hotels or b bs when traveling in europe but opted for the conrad because we were able to use hilton honors points very nice high end hotel but located a bit outside of the main tourist areas but the walk through and near the park was very nice,1
601,service service service arriving into dublin after a long flight from the us we requested an early check in and they came through with no issue whatsoever so at noon we were in our rooms and where able to freshen up and rest a rooms are stunning the beds newly renovated and the beds pillow and linens were very high quality and very amount of folks ready to help was impressive there seemed to always be or staff at the from desk willing to assist with restaurant recommendations and guidance on things to also had drinks in the bar off the lobby which was very comfortable we also had breakfast in the main restaurant and it was outstanding the buffet spread was impressive and had something for everyone overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay that the conrad and will surely visit this hotel if our travels takes us to dublin i am a marriott platinum elite member and i prefer the conrad over the marriott shelburn without hesitation cheers,1
602,i stood at the conrad dublin end of july i was there for the concert and had a junior suite this hotel is second to none beautifully decorated the rooms were spotless and the staff was friendly and paid attention to every detail we checked in on thursday morning were i briefly mentioned that we were going to the concert that coming saturday when we returned from the concert late saturday evening we were pleasantly surprised to find a lovely piece of chocolate cake with a note from the staff welcoming us back from a great evening wow that is attention to detail incredible hotel,1
604,this hotel was perfect expensive but well worth the money great location and the breakfast was very very good staff was outstanding we did have to eat again until dinner we will stay here the next time we visit dublin,1
605,this would have been good for a hotel but not for hilton top of the line we stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room the concierge service ranged from outstanding to i ca be bothered but the front desk was outstanding two out of three breakfasts were terrible the buffet items were outstanding but after seating and the initial coffee the wait staff had to be called they never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet i felt they may have been shunning staff at lemuel bar and lounge generally did a good job,0
606,very close to st stephens green which only one reason to make this hotel your go to for dublin an easy walk to grafton street a little longer trek to temple bar area if bussing in from the airport the stop is but a block away the breakfast is wonderful but unfortunately that is the best dining experience in this hotel typically arrived very early morning four am they would always pour us a pint or two before breakfast welcome to ireland rooms are adequate pub in lower level was closed the last visit hopefully that is not permanent and may well be operational as it has been awhile since last visit,1
607,dublin is a real fun city to visit especially when you stay at the conrad hotel the conrad is centrally located in dublin within walking distance to some pf dublin finest resturants pubs and famous grafton street the conrad hotel is a perfect hotel in a perfect location with an award winning staff,1
608,charming clean lines wonderful hotel attractive setting wonderful plush rooms breakfast buffet was excellent staff was pleasant and helpful a definite first choice when in dublin please walk to stephen green and grafton,1
609,this is a wonderful location rooms were very nice and the ac worked always a plus in any european hotel staff was very friendly and helpful could ask for a better location just half a short block from st stephen green,1
610,this hotel is just beautiful the bar is lovely has a nice relaxing feel to it the wine list is very good the staff are so friendly and helpful we had dinner in the coburg restaurant the food was first class everything you would expect and more from a five star hotel the menu had a very good variety and the children menu was excellent the staff are so helpful and friendly i would highly recommend this hotel it is a bit expensive but you really do get what you pay for,1
611,we were attending a family birthday party in dublin and although we only live in maynooth we decided to stay in town as my husband travels a lot we always make use of his hilton honours points we have stayed in the conrad many times and i delighted to say we have never had a bad experience we arrived early around midday as we had plans to visit the guinness storehouse and we were delighted to find our room was ready we had room and it was lovely the bed was so comfortable and the room had everything we needed and more the free shoe shine service was a lovely touch we were out for most of the day but had a nightcap in the residents bar again the staff were lovely the following morning we went down for breakfast which is served until there was a great choice of hot and cold dishes and the omelette was delicious we had a great stay and will definitely return soon,1
612,i stayed at the conrad dublin for my first visit to ireland the entire staff were so kind and welcoming and knowledgeable of dublin city and the country of ireland the food the service the rooms the concierge staff were all wonderful the location of the hotel is perfect as its not in all the tourist action but close enough to walk to if that what you looking for the hotel is directly across from the dublin national concert hall which offers concerts and entertainment throughout the month taxi are lined up outside of the hotel juts a whistle away from taking you anywhere the rooms are beautifully decorated with all modern amenities and hot water shower with dual showerheads the food at the conrad is mouth watering if you want to be spoiled and eat great meals stay at the conrad dublin please,1
613,we arrived at the conrad after a flight around noon and thankfully our room was ready the bed was so comfortable and breakfast was included with our stay the staff was always willing to help us make reservations or help us get around dublin plus it in one of the best locations we definitely recommend this hotel in dublin,1
614,my husband and i stayed at the conrad dublin recently during a shopping trip we have stayed there a number of times before we both agree that it has improved over the years breakfast was excellent those fresh blueberries the layout of the breakfast room is also much improved compared to previous years service was star the only small issue for us was the view from the room i would highly recommend the conrad dublin,1
615,everything was seamless from checkin to concierge and checkout i stayed at dinkier place right after this and the juxtaposition highlighted what top notch hospitality is about my only regret is not having stayed here longer,1
616,prices are steep not unlike the rest of the city but the service was exceptional at every turn the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed convenient location to walk to local attractions and shopping area around the hotel is quiet so there is not a lively night life in the immediate area however it is a very short cab ride away,1
617,just off st stephens green large clean room with fresh bedding and good furnishings recently renovated some street noise reasonable friendly and high quality and somewhat pricey fair for the area stays yes,1
618,first impressions are good really nice lobby friendly reception staff but no doorman as a hilton gold member i was upgraded to a room on the higher floors the room was a reasonable size immaculate and tastefully decorated with a feel the property next door is undergoing building works but did hear any noise during my stay the bar is also nicely decorated and has a good selection of service was variable initially attentive but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it was busy and staff lacked knowledge on the menu having requested a swedish whisky which i was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu the staff member had to go and check with another on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an arran a scottish island whisky off the back bar and suggested it hardly the same the hotel has a couple of restaurants alfie and coberg the first has pub food including a number of veggie options the second which is also where breakfast is served has very limited veggie options pasta and salad with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish i did dine in either given so many options nearby in town breakfast was a disappointment no orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte such as toast vs self service on being seated and it not being particularly busy it took minutes from ordering to get a cup of,0
619,we stayed for a night as a family stunning hotel great location there is a less formal if you have kids little pub in the hotel which is fabulous definitely worth a beautiful breakfast is class as was the service,1
620,hotel is beautiful and liveable staff anticipate needs and are examples of helpfulness the entire staff are gracious and anxious to please but in a quiet reserved manner food is excellent and well presented i recommend that you stay here if you are in dublin,1
621,this is a great hotel the rooms are immaculate and there are extras that everyone loves slippers that are disposable and a bathrobe to use makes this stay a spa experience the lotions are top quality and they use the most comfortable bed linens there is a restaurant and bar on site so you can relax and enjoy also i felt very safe staying here since you needed a room key to use the elevator as well as opening you room i loved the usb ports were available at the desk in the room so you did need a converter it was a great stay,1
622,we arrived well before regular check in as we had a very early flight from iceland to our surprise our rooms were ready and we were able to get settled in before wandering around dublin the hotel made a reservation at a recommended restaurant nearby we went to the hotel bar for a nightcap after dinner one of the bartenders was a wealth of knowledge regarding irish whiskey what a treat that was,1
623,for our first trip to ireland this hotel was perfect because it was within walking distance of many of dublin great attractions the rooms were clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful the food was great and the pub was everything we could have hoped we got to experience much of the irish culture the first day because of the proximity of the conrad dublin,1
624,great overnight stay in a classic hotel good amenities and rooms very well furnished to a good standard within walking distance of the main city centre and not far from the very pleasant and helpful breakfast very good choice and tasty,1
625,colin at the front desk offered the most amazing service checking us in after a long flight i wish all front desk agents were as professional and kind our room was absolutely gorgeous for a two night stay stay here if you have the opportunity i still dream about that breakfast,1
626,arrived at the shelbourne after staying in ardmore cliff hotel spacious entrance with a lovely bar and foyer and well appointed bedrooms staff were accomodating and the service is outstanding rooms are refurbished but i thrink not all and bed is comfy with generous share of toiletries for bathroom clean and comfortable and yes was a good experience my only issue is the way to the spa is like labyrinth and we just lost interest to go there the bar is beautiful and lively good place to spend time after dinner in all it was a lovely city break being in a confortable place in a historical building yes would not mind staying there again when in dublin,1
627,beautiful hotel with a great location great bar tea saloon and restaurant are very always rooms are small and do have a good but still a very good buffet can be richer eapeciallt the cold buffet,1
628,recently i took my mom to dublin for a day of sightseeing and tracing our family roots at the national library we stopped into to shelbourne for lunch and were pleased beyond belief the service was outstanding and the food was incredible the signature burger was all it promised and more the wine selection was fabulous and the atmosphere made the experience complete,1
629,we stayed at the shelbourne for a weekend trip on my birthday everything was fantastic the went smoothly the breakfast buffet was delicious and we enjoyed the location in the city center it was very easy to explore the city the room we had on the first night was too small and we did like it too much even though it was very nice but too small for people so we checked in the morning and could move to a bigger room for a small upgrade fee our luggage was brought to the new room and we could already move at lunch time we also went to the salon to get manicure and pedicure and i need to highlight the perfect service of christie she is amazing moreover we enjoyed the fabulous afternoon tea they took care of my allergies and explained everything in detail fantastic service,1
630,had a night getaway stay with my wife at the shelbourne and it might be the best hotel stay we have had and we have stayed at many similar class great iconic hotels in europe and the us the service was super friendly prompt and overall excellent from front desk to restaurants to housekeeping we never felt like we had to wait for anything and the staff came across as genuinely friendly and helpful breakfast was wonderful the public areas were elegant and perfectly maintained but not stuffy or ostentatious a pass to the very affiliated nice health club to freshen up after long overnight flight was much appreciated we arrived early morning so room was yet ready even though we booked one of the lowest category rooms it think it was called a small queen because unfortunately that was all that was available the room was a nice size pristine in terms of cleanliness and maintenance and nicely updated and it had all the little touches one might expect in a star european hotel twice daily service with turn down slippers beside bed bottled water we got back to the hotel late after seeing at croke park and we were starving they seated us and served us some great pub food in the same beautiful restaurant area they have high tea facing st stephen green great fish and chips club sandwich guinness etc and they were still seating people at am i got the impression that maybe they stayed,1
631,i really love the shelbourne and stay here every time i visit dublin every time i visit it gets better and usual the excellent service starts the second you drive up to the front door bags and car are taken care of with ease allowing you to seamlessly check in my wife and i arrived with a hire car having driven around ireland that week and it needed to be back with avis a couple of hours after our arrival rather than parking the car for us and charging a parking fee the doorman simply offered to leave the car out front for me to pick up later no dramas and made my life easier was easy and they recognised and arranged all of the appropriate amex fine hotels resorts group extras we were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor which was great beds are super comfortable and room amenities are staying at the shelbourne a number of times i had never eaten in the saddle room restaurant the experience was fantastic and i would highly recommend separate review the number bar has become exceptionally busy all day long and so i would recommend getting in there early to avoid disappointment however my favourite has to be the horseshoe bar which is a buzzing secluded bar serving up great beers and lord mayor lounge is always a highlight and my wife and i had a lovely afternoon tea before we had to head off to the airport,1
632,i spent a delightful few days in this historic hotel that was completely updated about ten years ago and is now a marriott renaissance property the public rooms are beautiful and elegant the food and service were excellent at the restaurants the hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming my spacious floor room had high windows that looked out over stephen s green and beyond the bed was extremely comfortable the beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub shower and commode was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving the room had plenty of lighting a good work desk and plush comfortable reading chairs soundproofing was excellent and i never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly service the hotel has a great location two blocks from the natural history museum and the national gallery of ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and was disappointed when i had to leave the shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent dublin hotel the westbury a century property that does not have the same level of elegance warmth or beauty the combination of history comfort and grace makes the shelbourne an extraordinary place they clearly value their guests and make them feel special it was a wonderful introduction to dublin and really deserves six stars,1
633,the queen rooms are small as in new york hotel but comfortable if you can handle the size of the room this hotel has an ideal location across from stephen green and within walking distance to many sights shops museums grafton and temple bar unlike other reviewers we had a good experience with the staff and the concierge desk we found them to be knowledgeable and helpful and the concierge provided great suggestions regarding an excursion to howth that we were considering a trip that we made after the concierge enthusiastically endorsed the idea and gave us some tips and for pubs and restaurants in central dublin the gym is small but it has enough equipment to allow for a solid workout,1
634,what a lovely hotel situated close to st stephen green and close to fine dining and many of the sites a visitor would want to see while in dublin including trinity college the national archaeology museum the national gallery and grafton street too our accommodations were lovely my family went to bed and i took the opportunity to spend a luxurious hour plus in our perfectly huge and well appointed bathroom i never do that while traveling never taking the time to really enjoy a room here at the shelbourne i did staff were fabulous and helpful our car was waiting for us as we exiting the hotel highly recommend,1
635,stayed here while visiting dublin and surrounding areas the hotel location can not be beat we were able to walk to most sites restaurants and shopping our balcony room on the floor was spacious and comfortable breakfasts were very tasty with many choices would definitely recommend,1
636,simply beautiful hotel excellent restaurant great location thank you for the amazing upgrade centrally located off of st stephens park and grafton street there is slot of history to the hotel great bar high tea a must,1
637,we always go to the shelbourne even if we do stay there bar is our first port of call when we land sunday lunch we had the roast beef omg i wanted to order another one straight after it was value for money and absolutely delicious i be back there in october for a roast no question give it a blast,1
639,we love the shelbourne and have made it our hotel when in dublin for a variety of good reasons the building itself heralds the georgian age of architecture that characterizes this corner of dublin the hotel sits across the street from saint stephen green a lush and park most major sites rest minutes away by foot from dublin castle to trinity college everything is near the service must be the very finest in all of ireland the staff clearly crisply and efficiently respond to all requests and anticipate the customers needs the concierge paul arranged a beautiful birthday dinner for my mother at a restaurant we would have never found without his help the front desk checked us in beautifully and responded to our many requests kindly and quickly the doormen are exceptional friendly helpful rooms offer plenty of space and amenities to make the guests more than comfortable and the beds must be the most luxurious in the whole short stay that shelbourne and know that every need will be attended with care and the stay will exceed all expectations plus the food is really good we fans for life,1
640,thanks again to all the staff who took great care of us at the shelbourne hotel my wife and i had a wonderful stay chris at the front desk was extremely helpful in ensuring we were taken care of before our room was ready and this was much appreciated after a long flight also i like to recognize pawel in the saddle room for his phenomenal customer service and recommendations on within the city the room was clean and comfortable with many amenities i stayed at many hotels and a few star hotels through europe and the states and by far you all are number one in my book,1
641,if you want attentive first class service then try the shelbourne the staff were excellent the surroundings luxurious and the location perfect i have stayed in numerous star hotels all around the world but have to say that the staff here have been superior to any other,1
642,best gin cocktail the lavish lady and the restoration ever get down and try them you wo regret it stephen was great company as i was traveling alone sam and niamh were great as well overall a lovely night ca wait to come back,1
643,poor housekeeping missed turndown service poor concierge tea is not replaced no views to speak of wifi is miserable and not secured i would not come here the restaurants are decent the spa has no availability for hotel guests so do come here if you like a good spa for two days they could not give me a slot,0
644,beautiful hotel which has retained all its prestigious elegance excellent staff and very clean in all areas outstanding location would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who seeks perfection,1
645,i stayed at this hotel whilst on a short business trip i was immediately wowed by its grandeur and without the stuffy formalities that sometimes come with hotels of this type i was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome this friendly do attitude was consistent by the staff throughout my stay room amenities were first class spacious and very comfortable sadly i only had time to use the lobby bar no bar it was a bit busy and service was not particularly great but none the less a hugely popular venue for an evening drink this hotel is also in a great location for the best shopping restaurants and bars a in short walk it now the place to stay for my next visit to dublin,1
646,what a wonderful hotel and staff we had a very comfortable and welcome stay at the shelbourne and were very happy with everything from the comfort and spaciousness of our rooms to the attentiveness of the staff and the location of the hotel every detail was thought of in our rooms as it they were very well appointed we were on vacation from the usa with another couple and thoroughly enjoyed our time here the breakfast buffet was delicious we enjoyed two evenings before dinner in the horseshoe bar which is tucked away near the entrance the concierge was great at helping us select restaurants for dinner and getting us reservations we had wonderful views of the beautiful stephens green from our rooms the location allowed us easy access to everything hopefully we will be back again,1
647,everything about our stay was top notch we arrived early morning off of a flight and the front desk recognizing that my elderly companion needed rest offered us a temporary room until our room was ready additionally the hotel lent us a wheelchair to help get around the city apparently this could be reserved with the hotel so we got lucky it was available was great as it is right across street from the park and a few blocks from grafton street also super close to the national gallery which was great,1
648,my wife and i stayed at the shelbourne dublin in august unlike many of the reviews mentioned earlier this is specific to the hotel for staying guests and not its f b hotels generally frequented by wife and i are the raffles the ritz langham oberoi peninsula so this is relevant to customers who are accustomed to similar levels of quality and service which i also understand the peer group that the shelbourne projects would also confirm this as an original review being posted post our stay and not crowd good location without doubt and a grand history the irish constitution indeed drafted at the shelbourne and there is small one room museum to its history next to the reception area can not recommend enough the excellent afternoon tea though with hourly seating and in high demand staff on the ground floor are quite polite and helpful the demerits and there are a few room sizes are really small the queen rooms are tiny there is basically one to feet of space to move around the bed which barely could fit my frame at feet bathrooms are the size of an aircraft toilet with a cubicle attached window on floor looks into the adjoining s room window degree angle and while lying down our bed we could see the bed in the other room in effect ensuring there is no privacy for us or frankly for the other chaps in the other room we had made the booking through and,0
649,there was no part of the hotel we did like the hotel was easily within walking distance of the major tourist attractions again while this hotel will not disappoint we especially enjoyed the casual bar conversing with a couple local irishmen warm friendly and outgoing people we never felt ignored,1
650,i stayed at the shelbourne dublin this july and it is a fantastic hotel the hotel has great history and the location in dublin is excellent i had a suite and everything in the room was perfect and the bathroom was very spacious the breakfast was incredible from the options the seating rooms the staff and the quality of the food the best part was the staff i met at all points during my stay they appear to enjoy working at the shelbourne and it comes across in how they greet you and take care of the hotel and guests i would like to have stayed longer the shelbourne should be your first choice for dublin even if you are not a member of the marriott loyalty program,1
651,we originally booked a two room but we got upgraded to a suite upon arrival the hotel was beautiful and it was in a great location right across the street from stephens green close to the buses within walking distance to the train station and a bus from the airport drops you around the corner from the hotel at a fee we arrived before check in time we were able to leave our bags at the front a helpful doorman pointed out places we could go to kill time until the room was ready and the concierge called when the room was ready the room was ready before the estimated time they contact you before you arrive to see if you have any special requests the staff was super friendly and helpful the room was nice clean and with a great view it had a tv small living room two beds bathroom with a shower and tub and toilet in a separate room with door the pool was nice there was a musician at the entrance all around this was a great place to stay,1
653,we stayed in december but unfortunately we were happy with the room on our return home i wrote an email it was answered by dempsey the manager from that point on things just got better not only were our complaints listened too the situation was rectified we stayed again in the hotel in march as we were attending a wedding and true to his word mr dempsey made us feel like valued guests our room was beautiful the complimentary touches and service made us feel so special i glad to report that the grande dame that is the shelbourne may have changed hands had a facelift and some botox in places but the heart of the hotel the staff and customer service still shines through well done one very happy customer planning on returning to you,1
654,beautifully maintained historic hotel with professional helpful friendly staff we were lucky enough to spend nights here and our stay was impeccable the rooms are large and beautifully decorated the fitness room is spectacular the setting perfect right across the street from st stephens green along with great and restaurants and a lovely afternoon tea fabulous concierge staff that helped us purchase concert tickets as well as arrange for a drop off of a rental car when we left star property for sure,1
655,we stayed at the shelbourne again because we love the historical old place and it location our suite overlooked stephen green a more lovely view would be hard to find the staff is always friendly and the no lounge is a very popular place for drinks,1
657,having lived in ireland previously i wanted to stay at this iconic hotel when i visited with my son we stayed in the renovated front part of the hotel and the rooms were lovely it is the little things that make it luxurious like the bottled sparkling and still water the very soft slippers and the incredibly soft bath robes and fine linens the rooms was very spacious and well appointed my only gripe is that accommodation services could pay a little more attention to things like wiping off fingerprints on the ceiling in the bathroom into the maintenance access and ensuring the toiletries are actually inside the cardboard packets mine were not easy to miss but still it is the small things that can taint a reputation we had dinner in the restaurant which was nice and the service was great breakfast was ok but to be fair i expected a little more class it was your average breakfast foods and the bacon was tough but the service was good and the chefs friendly the view from our twin room was particularly ugly and disappointing a great hotel and i would definitely recommend it,1
658,this is a lovely hotel and i enjoyed a large heritage room on a recent trip to dublin while the property is well located and clearly a fine hotel more than a few staff parade around with a sense that they are tolerating the great unwashed who are also customers mind you on balance there are far too many traveller who seem to confuse casual dressing with sloppy this snobbish behaviour amongst staff was most apparent with the method they use to seat people in the bar or restaurants very few of these service staff sport a smile and carry the mood of one making funeral arrangements i did not encounter anyone on staff but the concierge desk who was a native irish person good this be a eu cultural issue hard to say but it was notable despite being a gold level marriott customer for a fine hotel alternative i would opt for the merrion or westbury on my next visit,1
659,my wife and i decided to walk into the selbourne prior to going to stephen green we were very glad that we did because the interior is super nice and historical looking they have a small museum on the first floor with pictures memorabilia and old guest books dating back to the early lots of easter rising stuff too and the constitution room is here the constitution room is where michael collins and others signed the irish constitution and the condition they been able to keep it in is really nice we were lucky enough to have a hotel employee show us the room after we asked him some general questions about it but i would bet you could see it if you just meander up to the floor and head right it a couple doors down on your left,1
660,had high tea at the shelbourne hotel our first day in dublin it was well worth the price everything was first class the service the pastries were scrumptious and the tea and coffee first rate even though it is a very classy hotel you do have to dress up to attend i had on a polo shirt and slacks and my wife was similarly dressed definitely recommended,1
661,we had a fantastic stay at the shelbourne hotel this hotel is superb it is a beautiful building steeped in irish history room was where the irish constitution was drafted in under the leadership of michael collins many famous people such as charlie chaplin laurel and hardy james cagney the kennedys and elizabeth taylor to name a few stayed in the shelbourne right from its very humble beginnings the hotel is a short walk to all the major attractions shops and pubs while also overlooking the tranquillity of st stephens green directly opposite the saddle room boasts some top notch beautifully presented food and a buffet breakfast with loads of food to choose from and if that was enough you also have the options of relaxing in the bar area or lord mayors lounge for some afternoon tea you really and truely feel special from the moment you walk in the door best hotel iv stayed in by far,1
662,after a long flight from san francisco and jet lag that was making it hard to function we splurged on a lovely tea so we could rest and eat the staff is so lovely they allowed my children to make substitutions for their children tea you can also get a milkshake for the children or hot chocolate instead of tea the room is beautiful the hotel is beautifully appointed and as travelers it was an added bonus that the public bathrooms are great we loved our sandwiches and enjoyed eating mascarpone and jam on the scones even though the setting is very sophisticated the staff is down to earth and accommodating we loved it it expensive but was a fun and delicious splurge it is right by green so we enjoyed a walk through the park after our tea,1
663,this is a wonderful hotel to stay in great historical atmosphere in a grand setting we stayed here with our elderly aunt and uncle for a few nights and spent the time visiting the local sights as well as meeting up with other family members for dinner in a local restaurant we were all very satisfied with our bedrooms we have always had good rooms when we have stayed we ate in the restaurant on the friday night when we arrived this is the first time i have eaten dinner in the hotel and it was of an exceptionally high standard hotel restaurants are not always the best place for fine dining but this was exceptionally good the hotel was very accommodating when asked to find somewhere for our family group to relax after dinner on the saturday evening fourteen of us and on the sunday evening we relaxed with a swim and sauna good sized pool with everything kept at a high standard,1
664,we only got to stay at this beautiful hotel for night as we had a quick overnight visit to meet up with friends the location is great a minute walk from grafton street we got the airport bus which stops just round the corner and over the road for the return journey which is very handy the room was lovely and thought the turndown service was a nice touch would highly recommend this hotel if you want a little luxury,1
665,i visited the bar for a few drinks cocktails are excellent as is the wine the staff were very attentive and friendly a great place to sit and relax the interior is stunning and it only minutes walk to the pubs,1
666,the shelbourne can never disappoint a out of on all points service standard hygiene food location recommend getting a refurbished room as the old ones are tired and need updating wonderful wonderful,1
667,i booked the hotel for one night as we began our day journey to ireland i really only booked it because i had marriott points and was not paying attention to the hotel probably should have very classy luxurious old hotel priding itself on its service when we arrived the desk clerk thought he had a room open but when we arrived at the door luggage in the hands of the bellman and used the key the room was occupied much embarrassment led to our enjoying a complimentary breakfast i used the word breakfast but again i am understating as there were two rooms of beautifully prepared foods at buffet and a waiter who stood by the tables ready to provide any drink or food and complete service the hotel is nice rooms are nice pool is beautiful and long enough for laps exercise room very nice location can not be beat,1
668,recently stayed two nights with my family so we had two rooms had tried to make many coordinations prior to arrival but nothing was done as planned arrived early in the morning on a sat so they were busy although i had used the app and done an early check in it was still discovery learning and the woman checking me in could have cared less i stay over nights a year in marriott so i have some expectation of what right looks like and this was not it i was thanked for my loyalty and gold status although i am lifetime platinum and currently platinum premier seemed odd a manager came over and quickly tried to make things right and apologized for the lack of internal coordination we eventually got two rooms but not without effort my guess is like stated before with an over occupancy they do not have to work hard to get people to come and it is clear no issues with the rooms or breakfast all were very good can not beat the location overall we enjoyed our stay but never once felt appreciated for being there almost like we owed them for allowing us to come in seldom acknowledged by staff or doormen everyone way too busy looking busy stayed at several other hotels in ireland and most tried much harder to earn our repeat business and went out of their way to make us feel appreciated,1
669,my family booked this for my husbands birthday trip to dublin and it really was the perfect choice far away enough from busy city centre but close enough to quickly walk into centre near to the beautiful st stephens green hotel was clean tidy and quiet staff were excellent attentive and smiley bed was lovely room was so dark so had really fabulous nights sleep breakfast was wonderful a lovely selection thank you for a great stay,1
670,i stayed here in july and although the weather was kind the hotel was just perfect we arrived early and were able to check in with no problem what a delight considering the long flight we had the bed was extremely comfy and the curtains blacked out any light we had drinks in the craft beer bar which was a delight and the cocktails in lemeuls where amazing there was an australian chap on reception who was always cheerful and the tall young concierge i think was always there to help perfect location for a nice quiet sleep but close enough to some decent pubs and restaurants would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again,1
671,it was great to see such a stunning hotel after a long bit of travel to get there the lobby is gorgeous the staff is extremely welcoming and the rooms are perfectly appointed my one tiny issue would be with the layout of the shower which has a half glass partition and makes it slightly difficult to run the shower without getting soaked aside from that this room was modest in size but so beautifully furnished that it did feel cramped one bit the location was central and easy to walk around many of the sites i would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting dublin,1
672,i have stayed at the dublin conrad several times in the past this trip was just as great as the other trips the staff are knowledgeable friendly and always willing to meet any request the breakfast selection was extensive and very good lunch and dinner were also excellent wonderful location close to major shopping areas and great restaurants,1
673,stayed multiple nights here staff was very friendly rooms was nice had breakfast twice and was always greeted with smiles concierge staff was also friendly with tips and directions would have no problem staying here next time in dublin,1
674,we really enjoyed our stay rooms were clean and quiet and bed was very comfortable staff was lovely and very helpful especially jack from cork who was at the front desk he offered to print out boarding passes assisted with calling a taxi exchanging money anything we needed he was ready to assist us he really was professsional and courteous staff in the bar and restaurants were also helpful and pleasant top notch service,1
675,top class hotel great location highly recommend it for a special occasion although very expensive bit you get what you pay for and this has the location bang in the city centre walking distance from everything,1
676,good hotel but not a little small but location ca be at hotel was fine but nothing really you do mind paying for the location then i would stay was very friendly,1
677,simply put the shelbourne is perfect the staff are exemplary the rooms are extremely well appointed the breakfast is superb the bar is first class i have yet to find anything even slightly objectionable the concierge knows dublin like his own garden stephens green is directly across the street bank of ireland is very nearby as are excellent pubs and restaurants it is home in dublin,1
680,we were looking for a highly rated hotel in the centre of dublin and many people recommended westin at the price of over per night this is what we got drunk obnoxious neighbours who were falling in and out of their room slamming the doors all day and all night hotel staff that offered to move us even though we were sleeping rather than moving the drink neighbours we checked another room which was even worse than the room we had before it was facing inside the hotel in the bar area so windows could not be opened so hotel idea of helping is downgrading the room elevator that smelt like two days old alcohol and made us want to throw up going into it after getting no sleep i had to get used at for work so if you are looking for somewhere nice to stay that is professionally ran and has knowledge of hospitality do not stay at this hotel,0
681,had the pleasure of staying at the westin for nights i booked using spg points at a night which i thought was an incredible value given that the rooms were almost a night i knew the hotel was near capacity so i was prepared to get a double standard room however we were upgraded to a double superior room and they included a mattress for our year old at no additional charge the room was a nice size and loved the marble bathroom with separate deep soaking tub and shower although i wish there was a larger shelf in the shower i love old world elegance and this hotel has it in spades our room faced westmoreland street but barely heard any street noise being that we were on the top floor this hotel is central to everything we walked everywhere from the waterfront to temple bar to grafton street we had the buffet breakfast every morning which was too bad but there is a starbucks across the street and a couple of rolling donuts within walking distance definitely have a drink at the bar downstairs it gorgeous and the cocktails are is a lot of construction in front of the hotel due to the expansion of the light rail but it happening across the city so there no getting away from it and the noise really was i would not hesitate to stay here again,1
682,i can not say enough good things about this hotel my wife and i were recently honeymooning in ireland and had the privilege of staying at the westin dublin for nights not only was the hotel beautiful inside and out but so was the staff everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful the location does get any better either grafton street shopping and restaurants were just a few blocks away everything else was a short minute walk if possible request a room facing the alluring trinity college you could get used to waking up that view every morning lastly be sure to visit their bar downstairs the mint bar i still dreaming about those cocktails we will defiantly be back in the future,1
683,they do a great job service is high level and the people are very friendly the breakfast is very good and will suffice for a brunch so all you really need is is located near all the bars and shops so you do have to walk far for shopping food or entertainment,1
684,used to be when you were in dublin the staff were extremely pleasant well at this hotel the staff act like kgb officials and are very rude they were intentionally rude to my highly educated daughter and i am a lifetime spg platinum meaning i have spent over nights on the road in spg hotels additionally on some very hot nights the ac did not work in the room and they put us in a tiny room all the while the staff acted like no big yes it is a big deal as our worldwide staff has been instructed that westin dublin is no longer a place they may stay vote with our wallets gm and as the chairman of a worldwide conglomerate i assure you no dollars will be spent at your this hotel much better options where the staffs are polite and respectful of a hotel doctor hit me with some love and a helpful vote,0
685,this is the second time we have stayed in the westin dublin while we do not travel extensively this is certainly the loveliest hotel we have stayed in anywhere the staff are so gracious no detail is too trivial we felt welcomed and taken care of the breakfast included in our room rate was hearty and delicious we were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine and platter of local cheeses on our arrival i traveled with a family of two children age and the junior suite was very spacious room and the hotel kindly gave us a rollaway and an air mattress yes it is a pricey stay but the location in the heart of dublin and the exceptional service by all of the staff make this worth the expense i ca think of a reason to stay anywhere else in dublin,1
686,i love love ireland the first time i went as soon as the plane touch ground to the end of the trip i loved everything everything i saw was great i have been blessed to visited ireland twice i would be ready to go a third time in a heartbeat,1
687,had a fabulous christmas afternoon tea here beautiful setting with christmas trees lit fires and a real christmas atmosphere the afternoon tea was beautiful it presented and plentiful drinks were topped up regularly and service was efficient warm yet unobtrusive lovely way to spend an afternoon with friends,1
689,our room was the most spacious of all the rooms we stayed through our trip the room was super quiet with two beautiful windows the upkeep of the room was impeccably maintained and very clean we had our room made up everyday and got new each was an easy walk to temple bar and the city center and about a mile and a half to guinness storehouse great location if you buy a hop tour bus through for the city,1
690,enjoyed final nights in ireland at the westin dublin and very happy we did the facility itself is very clean and comfortable staff was friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was excellent location is also great one block to trinity university and one block the other way to temple bar area also many other shopping eating and drinking options right nearby highly recommended,1
691,check in there was a small line at check in however it moved quite quickly we arrived a bit before check in and we were quite delighted when the staff member advised us that our room was ready room we had a standard room that was very nice it was immaculate and very quiet as it faced the inner courtyard it had all of the lovely westin amenities and i loved the extra desk space location this hotel is very centrally located we did not have any problems finding places to eat or things to do it located very close to trinity college which is a great place to check out staff the staff at this hotel are so friendly whenever we be leaving the hotel to explore the city the staff at the door would ask us if we needed any recommendations for places to eat or things to see and i thought this touch was amazing i really felt welcome at this hotel and it has left a lasting impression overall i loved my stay at the westin dublin and will be back on future vacations to dublin,1
692,the best feature of this hotel is the location i booked a room for one night using air miles the description on the aeroplan website promised spacious rooms decorated in characteristic irish decor i arrived at and had to wait for a room i was promised one in an hour or minutes but no one called and three hours later i returned at that time i was given a tiny room that faced a busy street and a building covered in pipes i complained and was shown another room that had a view of trinity college much better but also was tiny the decor was more la designer than irish with an upholstered black faux leather headboard with metal studs not what i was expecting the curtains were thin and did not entirely cover the sides of the windows which meant that the room was not dark the street noise was not bad but there was sound transfer from other guest rooms i did not sleep well in this hotel compared with the other hotel i stayed at on staff were friendly enough but when i arrived no one was at the door and i had to pull my luggage up a ramp myself i noticed that the main entrance was often unattended and when i returned to my room in the evening four young men followed me into the elevator when i asked them what floor they were going to they just laughed none of them had room keys,0
693,we found this hotel and the staff to be remarkable everyone was very interested in making sure our stay was perfect although they have no ideal spot for automobiles to pull in as a new streetcar line is being put in right in front of their front doors the bell hops doormen and concierge were all present to help with directions and luggage our rooms were not large but adequate and not cramped probably bigger than most european hotels it was odd a chair was placed next to doors that led out to a balcony it was wet and cold and not particularly inviting so we did not try to use the balcony breakfast was included with our tariff and it was extraordinary both buffet and menu service we would recommend this hotel and stay there again,1
694,the hotel is situated just across the street from trinity college the main attraction of the city and a block from the pedestrian street where the famous temple bar is located their service is very good and the breakfast is outstanding i definitely recommend this hotel,1
695,we are here on a two night stay and loved it so much we booked another night for our return trip the staff is truly wonderful from the moment we checked in we were given great service the concierge provided two great restaurant recommendations pinchet and rustic stone both exceeded our room is clean well appointed quiet and there is a beautiful view of the city from our mint bar was a nice surprise great wine selections and highly recommend the westin not only for the local but more importantly for the outstanding service and wait to return next saturday,1
696,perfect location few steps from trinity college and across the street from temple bar beautiful facilities and very comfortable rooms the restaurant was fantastic and service exceptional all expectations met as a westin property,1
697,firstly i have to say that the hotel is very well appointed however we feel let down in many critical areas the room was euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had no windows it had a roof light and very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box the explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room so the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people do need a view we were disturbed after by housekeeping offering a down service we did take this up with mr zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time available if not we have to accept the windowless box again i guess i genuinely felt very uncomfortable about this lack of window it made me very anxious and i not the handicapped partner really upset and disappointed westin gold member and loyal to the brand no longer,0
698,what an absolute top notch staff we wrapped up a two week trip at dublin westin with previous stops in paris westin vendome and maldives regis and could say enough good things about the hotel and staff first the location is as good as it gets next to trinity college and very short walk to temple bar area the great experience started long before our arrival when i received an email from tracy asking for our arrival details and if anything could be done to make our stay better once we arrived the girl checking us in did catch name after long flight could have been more polite and helpful we also received a very nice hand written note from maggie asst manager during our stay our stay at the westin could have been any better and would stay anywhere else on future trips to dublin,1
699,the junior suite was spacious the pillows confortable the three of us slept very well the bed and the sofa were large and confortable i like having an espresso machine in the room and there was also free bottled water go for the breakfast good,1
700,worst breakfast i believe i have encountered anywhere in the world particularly in light of the star rating inattentive staff busy but not serving very poor cooked food quality undercooked bacon sausage with gristle unappetising scrambled eggs toaster not functioning resulting in long queues and wait time teapots leaking etc etcmanagement need to observe this towers experience and make rapid improvements,0
701,we had a room on the floor with a balcony overlooking the river the room was lovely and bright and the pool and spa were great breakfast was a big disappointment not much choice all in all pretty poor,1
702,we stayed here for one night after getting married in the city the hotel staff were fabulous and really made the stay extra special for us on account of the special occasion the room had fantastic views floor to ceiling windows over the river the city and the mountains in the background bathroom was well equiped very good location in the city,1
703,we visited ireland on our honeymoon and stayed in two hotels while in dublin at the beginning and end of our trip i so glad we tried this hotel because it was absolutely gorgeous and such an amazing way to end our honeymoon the location was great and easily walkable to things the staff were friendly and the room was amazing honestly it was a perfect hotel,1
704,after visiting dublin many times the spencer is definitely the best hotel i have stayed in in dublin the bar has a cool relaxed atmosphere in the evenings as the live dj plays r b the cocktails are amazing and the food in the thai restaurant is incredible after telling the spencer the trip was for an we got an upgrade and rose petals were put on the bed as well as a desert plate saying happy birthday the staff were efficient and ensured we were happy with our trip would definitely visit again,1
705,the hotel has a contemporary elegant aesthetic the foyer is designed with generous space includes a fire comfortable chairs a large refectory style table for sitting working the foyer flows into the bar area i was surprised by the time around that is hard after after an early arriving flight the staff were outstanding professional and so pleasant if you can get a room with balcony they are the best i loved the bathroom overall spaciousness of the high level rooms the breakfast buffet had everything there is a fabulous japanese restaurant directly across the road,1
706,we booked this hotel after a disastrous stay at another dublin hotel was the main draw for our group since this was our last night in dublin and we had seen the more trendy areas the spencer is located in the business district which is more updated clean and modern the down side is the lack of a lot of pubs but there are a few nearby it is about a mile from the temple bar area and very close to the epic heritage tour we stayed in room which had two twins in one large room and a queen in another room it was very modern looking with floor to ceiling windows the rooms were very spacious with a large bathroom that could be accessed from the master or the hallway that lead to the other twin room this had an apartment feeling with a front door that led to our rooms the air conditioner was heavenly and the rooms were quiet the bar downstairs looked nice but we did stay for drinks i would absolutely book here again,1
707,travelled as family of and the hotel met our needs one of the best family rooms we have stayed in large comfortable bed and not a sofa bed in sight great breakfast kids loved the pancake machine,1
708,this hotel is on the banks of the liffey in dublin financial district the surrounding area is spacious and quiet with many shops places to eat and drink if you take the time to find them the hotel itself is run very professionally with great customer service the rooms are clean spacious and the quality of sleep was excellent with the luas just around the corner and busaras connolly mins walk away it is a great location just off the city center,1
709,the spencer did not disappoint great location away from the temple bar bustle but close enough for a nice walk to many sites step out to a roomy fairly private balcony with views of the harp bridge greeted us with rose petals and chocolate artfully sprinkled on the bed modern and nice bar in lobby,1
710,we stayed for nights at spencer hotel stayed at front of hotel on floor which was a little bit noisy is close to main city can walk to main centre and attractions in minutes and is right by bus stops rooms very clean and spacious used pool area which was good and gym area looked very good but did use it new breakfast room was very good with plenty of choice of food good location if attending as you can walk in minutes however very limited choice of restaurants in the area is one in the hotel which was very good and or others close by but otherwise need to go into man city really however would stay here again and recommend it,1
711,we stayed nights in a room one large bathroom with access from both the entry hall and the master bedroom twin beds in the main room beds were comfortable both areas had tv there was a nice outdoor space but we were unable to use it as previous guests had made off with the key the door had to be locked or unlocked by an employee we just left it locked to avoid the quirk of the room while it was nice to have separate sleeping areas for parents and kids the kids part of the room which was also larger had a sitting area the patio entrance the coffee maker and the refrigerator not particularly convenient in the mornings when we wanted coffee etc and the kids wanted to sleep some lobby bar was nice for an drink reception was very helpful organizing taxis when we needed suited us as we do mind a nice walk temple bar took us about minutes at a leisurely pace,1
712,clean hotel and wonderful service the hotel staff took care of us better than any where we have stayed in the is walking distance to trinity university and the shopping districtthere are several small shops and restaurants nearby as well,1
713,we had our annual office summer bbq in the spencer hotel on friday july and it was absolutely brilliant from the initial booking and organisation right through to being looked after on the night the staff in the spencer could not have done more for us they were so pleasant friendly and went out of their way to ensure we were happy nothing was a problem for them the service was excellent and the food was top would highly recommend the spencer hotel for any events,1
714,quiet comfortable extremely convenient to trains and convention center nice size room we were in but pretty unimaginatively furnished couch was pretty uncomfortable rain shower and soaker tub not much storage for clothing huge and well equipped fitness room on site nice hearty breakfast included though no one told us about it til we asked generally the staff was consistent with other reviews not terribly nice brusk and quite terse especially given the general good humor and helpfulness of virtually everyone else we met in ireland during our stay really excellent gin and tonic selection in bar make a point of trying the suggested citadelle gin with tonic and star anise and orange coffee maker in room made virtually undrinkable coffee no matter how many times we tried there is a small indoor mall a block or so away with a good food court for breakfast and lunch btw are definitely some tradeoffs here but i would stay here again,1
715,the hotel is clean and the staff is friendly the location is quiet but close enough to the attractions the bar area was busy almost every night we were there this was a nice added bonus the rooms were spacious for two people and had a safe for valuables there is a wonderful coffee shop just across the walkway,1
717,very nice hotel great pool excellent breakfast service in restaurant is very good special mention to lidiya who is an excellent host and great ambassador for the hotel thanks for the great service we had a family room with a queen and twins this was perfect for us with adults and kids rooms are very quiet about mile from temple bar and st stephens green so be prepared to walk for mins to get to the center of hallways messy during daytime as cleaners clean the hallways are littered with cleaning carts vacuum cleaners dirty laundry would stay again,1
718,we arrived at the hotel well before since we landed in dublin at about am while a room was available as expected given the time the front desk person gave us access to the health club facility which has a shower and pool so we could freshen up we took advantage of that and then went to breakfast at their were advised breakfast would be euro each which felt a bit high but since there were many other dining options nearby and we were tired we went for it the breakfast was a very nice buffet when we went to pay and the manager asked for our room number he actually gave us the breakfast since we were able to check in yet this was a nice gesture that we really appreciated the room itself was much larger than expected and had a nice view of the river liffey we had a king bed that was very firm and comfortable we were a little concerned that the room was directly across from the elevators and adjacent to a vending machine but it was quiet both nights despite the hotel being full we were there on a thursday and friday night the only thing that did hit the same standard was the hotel bar there is a comfortable sitting area but the two times we visited we found the service to be inconsistent slow and unfocused we had a sharing platter of various asian fusion items but it was fairly mediocre,1
719,we were in town for a concert at croke park and decided to book the spencer for our nights in dublin we were very happy with our choice we love to walk and could walk everywhere from here we also took advantage of the dublin bikes and the hotel had a bike almost right across the street everyone who worked there was very pleasant and like others have mentioned the coffee shop across the way is great the room were nicely appointed and the beds were very comfortable would recommend and would stay again,1
720,as many other reviews have pointed out the location is great we ventured out on foot both days in dublin and easily explored most of the key parts of the city we took cabs back late at night after a few pints etc but easily toured the sites by is clean and modern our room for was very comfortable and we slept area is hopping we stopped for a snack and a beer on the way out to dinner one night and upon return around midnight it was packed but upstairs it was plenty arranged a am taxi for us and we asked for a van to ensure luggage would fit and all went according to plan,1
721,the spencer has become my default hotel for business travel in dublin it is conveniently located for work and has good transport links for other parts of dublin should you wish to venture out further the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable the shower is of good quality the staff are always friendly respectful and helpful rooms on the street side can be a bit noisy emptying bottle bins in the early morning should be banned everywhere see you again in september,1
722,we were walked to the spencer by another hotel that overbooked it was a pleasant surprise the rooms were very different from the hotel that we previously booked very irish artsy the room was small but very comfortable bathroom amenities were almost full sized and of great quality this is important to me since i have very long thick curly hair i hate when i get a bottle of shampoo and conditioner in one the staff was attentive and the lobby and bar more than adequate would recommend if you want to stay city center,1
723,the hotel is located roughly min from the hotel in the financial looks very modern very lean and new located along the river only to min walk to sooo many pubs service was excellent check in was easy we landed in the morning but they held our bags until the room was available we had a room that overlooked the river it was descent could hear much traffic the room was fantastic beds were comfortable along with the pillows great sunsets from the higher only complaint was that we requested ice times and nothing was ever brought to the room we did eat at the restaurant but it looked very nice one night they had live music in the lobby area we only sat down there once for some drinks after wondering around all day we did have time to use the gym nor the pool area,1
724,my family and i stayed at the spencer in june the hotel was nice but we had a very bad experience with parking and retrieving our rental car first of all the hotel is not set up for parking they have an underground garage two blocks away with no attendants after a few attempts i parked our rental and registered my license number and space with the front desk the day i was going to leave for the airport i went to move the car and found out i had a boot clamp attached here i was parked in a wrong space even though i was given instructions to park in this place and the garage was full someone decide to call the parking authority vs call the hotel because i had to catch a plane i had the hotel deal with hertz the clamp boot caused damaged to the wheel well euros later i find out my credit card does not cover ireland collision of course the hotel claims no responsibility and they gave me a hard time when i was trying to resolve lesson learned parking at ireland hotels is a challenge avoid a rental car in ireland and or check your credit card for ireland collision coverage chase visa is the only exception,0
725,great food options for breakfast and lunch with options very friendly staff this hotel is in the financial district off of the river the rooms are a bit small business to the lobby and rooms are modern ca say enough about how great the staff is minute walk from temple bar,1
726,min walk from temple bar nice area not congested and not full of tourists good vibe in the hotel very clean and the sheets and beds really spoil you no mini bar but that to me is not really a problem hotel staff went out of there way to assist on most anything including reserving dinner at restaurants etc great gym and spa facilities new and impressive good place to stay in dublin,1
727,my husband and i had stayed here for our wedding anniversary what a fantastic stay we had the hotel made our stay very special by decorating our bed with rose petals and leaving us chocolates the room and facilities were perfect for us we had a balcony room that was just perfect the staff were very friendly and polite breakfast was very good and we also had dinner in the restaurant that served asian food tasty food the location of the hotel was mins walk to temple bar area thank you to all at spencer hotel for making our anniversary stay special,1
728,we spent nights here with no disappointments friendly staff modern clean and comfortable accommodation brilliant breakfast and superb swimming pool and gym the location is fantastic well worth a try,1
729,i stayed with my girlfriend during the august bank holiday very good service excellent spa services always open during the day also the bar is well furnished super location the financial area of dublin very close to city center,1
730,stayed here for two nights recently and have to say i was very impressed the only place was recently decorated and staff were extremely helpfuland friendly the rooms are small but thats common for dublin sonocomplaints here the hotel has extensive leisure facilities with pool sauna and it is alsoconveniently located closeto croke park the bord gais theatre and the arena the only negative i would have is that they charge per night forcar parking which is a lot on top of the room rate,1
731,i been known to winge that hotel service tends to the indifferent these days this could be less true of the spencer which has incredibly helpful competent and positive staff i do know how they manage it but we had a really wonderful stay with fantastic service from reception the bar and restaurant and the spa it really made our break and we were left feeling as if we had a luxury experience highly recommended despite the minute walk into the city centre though as a result at least you got a respite from dublin more chaotic side,1
732,main usp is its location just behind patrick cathedral the biggest in ireland walking distance from the center of the city decent neat clean rooms with good room service good breakfast spread overall a good place to stay,1
733,my dad and i stayed here this week and at first they gave us a business room which was fine until we saw it and it was suitable for a single or double room but since it was my dad and i we needed more space so we asked if we can upgrade and without any fuss they were able to help us with much assistance and were very very kind i was surprised on how patient they were and eager to show us the options for euros more we were upgraded to the apartment size or presidential suit and it was amazing so much space and it was well worth it i felt really safe walking outside from my hotel super short walk to dublin castle and grafton street also a another plus was the breakfast the best hotel breakfast i ever had love it,1
734,a fabulous gwa girls weekend away for three of us to see joshua tree tour it was first time for two of us and yrs prior for other friend since we only had full days of touring we need a hotel with the best location this hotel hit the mark for us first off the staff were awesome hazel and marko were so helpful at the front desk over the days with all our tourist questions the breakfast buffet was perfect and consistent every day and we were greeted with we had a business class with twins and a rollaway and we had plenty of room to maneuver closet was fine plenty of outlets for adapters for phones and other electronics look under bedside tables hair dryer out of for shower water rain shower plus handheld deep soaking tub with hand shower you will use after pounding the streets all day is modern comfortable in deep warm tones hallways are wide and beautifully lit again with deep warm wood tones love the shoe shine station at the elevator on each floor these items are all important but the best reason to stay at raddison blu royal is the location on golden lane walking distance to everything patricks guinness grafton temple bar trinity college etc we were hoping to stay in temple bar it looks so darn cute and it is thank goodness we did way too crazy at night to stay there in our opinion enjoyed the fun and we,1
735,i actually at the hotel now solo traveler the front offic manager adam and ryan who helped my wiindow matt the dutch guy and of course all the bartenders are fantastic damian and amy are great bartenders hotel is very quiet for a wilde yr old californian girl like me but i still love this place a lot,1
736,this is a very nice hotel the staff is very friendly check in and out was very efficient the location is right near the temple bar area super close walk but without any street noise in fact that was the reason we chose it everything was nice i really ca complain about anything the only down side to the hotel is that it is very modern and so it does have any of the quintessential irish charm also the hotel is quite expensive so i would also say it is the best value for the money,1
737,visited as part of a business trip room was very good well equipped and comfortable the business centre facilities were good although looking a little tired in places service was very good with plenty of help in getting the room set up for a training was very good with prompt service the lobby staff were readily accessible and helpful in arranging taxi location is good with easy access to the main high street local coffee shops definitely visit again,1
738,perfectly placed for the city our room was spacious and clean and even though we were at the front of the hotel there was no noise at all so our sleep was never disturbed the bed was wonderful a very good size and probably the most comfortable bed we ever slept in when away from home staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome would recommend this hotel without any hesitation,1
739,while the radisson is a competent business hotel i found it to be excellent by way of location minutes walk to many attractions facilities parking within the premises and good value breakfast large room free wifi and bottled water,1
740,the scenery here is stunning and the staff are incredibly kind we asked to switch rooms since ours smelled of smoke and they did without hesitation we got the room with beds it was a little cramped with our three big bags of luggage but it worked out fine the bathroom was very good too the hotel restaurant was simply delicious i highly,1
741,stayed there last week found the property very good and location excellent staff was very courteous and very helpful especially maria at the front desk who managed everything whether it was charger or restaurant booking breakfast was also much above average took a decision to book a junior suite as we were three adults and one infant which turned out to be very wise as the size of suite was very large special thanks to marion in reservation who also helped and guided while making direct reservation will definitely advise all my contacts to stay here,1
742,stayed two nights very good furnished in old irish i would say england but i think they prefer irish style surrounded by a very nice park and friendly staff rooms are large clean and provide with very comfortable breakfast and high speed internet connection for free,1
743,we stayed at the radisson blu royal hotel on a recent family trip to dublin the hotel is very nice and the staff is very friendly and accommodating the rooms are a bit small but the hotel convenient location is within to many of dublin popular attractions and restaurants,1
744,modern hotel near dublin airport very nice rooms and great breakfast with espresso coffee i had left my ipod behind and called to find that they had found it and secured it three days later when i returned to the airport to fly out they had their shuttle driver bring it to me at the drop up spot they were very helpful and went out of their way to help me with this,1
745,easy walking distance to many attractions such as the castle temple bar trinity college st patrick and christ church cathedralsexcellent breakfast with good helpful staffclean spacious rooms,1
746,i can not tell about the hotel itself but i would strongly recommend visiting the sky lounge as far as i understand it is a venue for up to people should be quite ok and if you have some kind of event the sky is great especially the view that you can have from there really exciting and kind of competeng with the gravity bar at guinness storehouse,1
747,first time to ireland and have to say what a beautiful country our stay at the radisson blu royal was wonderful friendly staff helpful and always attentive the hotel is centrally located to everything,1
748,the hotel is perfectly located in a quiet location but near to loads of shops bars and restaurants the lobby is spacious and inviting and the reception staff friendly room service is quick and has a tray charge half of other dublin hotels the menu a little limited but they do say that if they got it in their kitchen they will make it for you which i successfully tested they do have a gym onsite but guests have access to a nearby mins walk gym with a pool and couple a minor niggles the iron is part of a trouser press which ca be removed from the wardrobe only pulled out they may have freestanding irons i did have time to check but this does make ironing anything difficult also check out is painfully slow i know the receptionists are being friendly and thorough but if you in a rush it just always takes forever,1
749,we thought the over all experience was good but it was good value dublin is a pricey area to visit the rooms were well ventilated and well presented staff were friendly enough did its job but was a particularly memorable experience,1
750,great city centre hotel staff very helpful and friendly good choices for breakfast rooms spacious and well appointed very much enjoyed my recent visit and will use this hotel again highly recommended,1
751,our family enjoyed two nights in dublin before exploring the country the radisson blu royal hotel was in a great location from all of the sites we wanted to see the staff was very helpful and friendly answering any questions we had,1
752,we needed a place to hang out while waiting to get in our airbnb and the radisson blu was perfect they have a nice lobby with plenty of seating and a bar where you can order food and drinks the staff were very friendly and helpful and let us use their phone we were also able to print our boarding passes in their business lounge they rate very high for their friendly service for way to go radisson blu dublin,1
753,great location comfortable rooms lovely service and amazing breakfast the staff were extremely helpful and polite nothing was too much definitely use this hotel again on either business or as a relaxing short break,1
754,this hotel has everything one needs its located just near christ church and dublin castle its an easy walk everywhere a pet peeve of mine is the breakfast extortion game many european hotels charge where it costs euros when all you want us a cup of coffee and a croissant this hotel allows you to order a la carte in the lobby lounge w wonderful respite about from the scavengers picking apart the room was clean modern and the bed was very comfortable the only thing is that housekeeping tended to make up our room late in the day between which meant after a long day out in the city we sometimes returned with a room unmade and being tired we had to call down to find out when they could clean it could have been the location of our room at the end of the hallway,1
755,it was excellent service and nice staying at this wonderful welcome at the checking time with nice and friendly staff room is clean and comfortable even though the hotel does have any outside views as it located and almost surrounded by buildings and far from noisy streets we enjoyed the stay rooms are air breakfast is good with excellent helpful freindly and pleasant staff thank you for great service and highly recommend,1
756,stayed here for nights in july this hotel was excellent we had a business class room which was luxurious beds so comfortable and bathroom gorgeous staff were very friendly and helpful bar food was delicious and kids ate free with paying adult breakfast was lovely with plenty of everything would highly recommend this hotel,1
757,we came to dublin to see riverdance the fitzwilliam had the perfect location and was the utmost in style quality and calibre of staff first class hotel first class service wonderful all round from reception and porters who were friendly and exceptionally helpful to the stunning cuisine and marvellous surroundings the level of attention to detail and service turned a short break into a memorable experience we were treated with personal service as if we were the only guests and the food was of a level unsurpassed thank you to all the staff who were so warm and genuine we will be back,1
758,got upgraded on check in so that was a nice bonus beautiful room a little on the small side but very nice all the same location excellent to see the heart of dublin and staff were so pleasant and helpful a credit to the hotel,1
759,excellent stay at the fitzwilliam will recommend it to my relatives staff was very helpful and the food and drink was great room was comfortable and everything was centrally located being near the green and shopping is a plus temple bar etc,1
760,location could be better walk out the front door to stephens green grafton street and hop on the luas tram staff are lovely and i regularly meet people for coffee in the lobby its so relaxed and chilled out the bedrooms and conference rooms are really good,1
762,perfect location but very expensive may have been because concert was on and most hotels in dublin were fully booked shower pressure was like a waterfall breakfast area was small but the staff were incredibly fast and efficient,1
763,unbeatable location great staff small room and bathroom it was a pleasant stay overall the staff is very friendly and accommodating the bar area is very nice the restaurant serves pretty good breakfast,1
765,this hotel is located right on stephen green with easy access to all the main attractions in dublin what made our visit extra special was the assistance of dane and patrick at the concierge desk from dinner reservations to walking directions to croke park to locating a driver for a trip up north at the last minute all was handled with humor and ease we received a super early check in after our overnight flight too small room but fine for a few days dublin is a fun city,1
766,fab hotel great location wonderful staff who could be more helpful we had a beautiful room lovely view spotless hotel breakfast was delicious will be back in december a wonderful hotel in a wonderful city,1
767,one night spent in dublin on business and in all respects the fitzwilliam hotel met expectations nothing would have been too much trouble to the helpful and friendly team if i had any suggestion for improvement it would be to provide a slightly less exclusive dining experience without the need to spoon cereal into breakfast bowls using silver the arrival experience could be tweaked as the desk is tucked away in the corner of the lobby while a tourist information desk is most prominent in the hotel entrance,1
768,all staff were very helpful patient and friendly the rooms are first class and breakfast is excellent really ca fault the service and highly recommend the hotel dublin is a tremendous city and this hotel typified the friendly attitude we found all weekend nothing was too much trouble and whilst we knew that the bedrooms would be available until when we arrived from the airport at the staff were excellent and offered our party of ten breakfast on the house definitely perared to go the extra mile to make our stay memorable,1
769,our room was quiet and very clean with garden view excellent location staff was very helpful and extremely friendly the breakfast was extensive with a great selection of various buffet foods as well as a la carte the location could not have been better right across the street from steven green and a minute walk to grafton street,1
770,why are you insisting i complete this box i do want to yguygvygbgijhecnrpqworweoufnovweuhnoweuvhnpoencpoupoewnpowencpowqnpwoquncoqwunctpoqeyntpqoewuycnttpoewucnpoweuycnpoqwntpowquyntpouwqynctpontponpuwqeycntpouwtpoquycnopq,1
771,staff very helpful and friendly very comfortable bed food excellent room carpet showing signs of wear an tear so could do with replacing apart from that excellent place to stay and also close to theatre and shopping,1
772,we had a wonderful stay at the fitzwilliam hotel in dublin the staff are very pleasant and very helpful our room was great the location is excellent as well we are happy to rate our entire experience here as excellent,1
773,what a fantastic hotel the location is amazing but too many times you book a hotel because of the location and that all it has to offer the fitzwilliam dublin does just stop at the front door all the staff are extremely polite and helpful i could see this by the reaction of other guest who were visiting dublin and possible ireland for the first time asking question and been given the time and attention supporting their every requirement the food is outstanding using fresh locally sourced ingredients try the citron restaurant then relax in the up the good work,1
774,we stayed here for a weekend nice hotel not quite sure about the decor of the rooms but it was one excellent feature was the very powerful shower really great though you need to leave the bathroom door open otherwise everything gets wet from condensation very good central location we walked to most places we wanted to see,1
775,good location seconds to grafton street very friendly front of house staff nice rooms although my room was on the small side and the room and bathroom could probably do with a refurbishment very nice lobby area and bar the letdown was the breakfast service with slow and very unfriendly service especially compared to other hotel staff on morning four i just got up and walked out after waiting min to try and order no hot buffet received an apology later and coffee in bar as compensation but then drink was charged on checkout,0
776,if you are staying in dublin this is the hotel to select it is very clean the staff is friendly the location is central to most anything and in the evening when you go to sleep it is quiet this is truly a five star hotel,1
777,we thought the fitzwilliam belfast was great but their dublin hotel was even better not to throw shade on belfast dublin is just a bit more sophisticated i was traveling with my two sons so we had three rooms and each was different beautifully decorated with all the amenities you expect from a star accommodation but each room with their own personality if you will staff was top notch the bar had an amazing selection of whiskeys and the bartender was well versed in his craft the location was perfect central to attractions shopping and some great eateries i relieved that i did not book a place in the very busy and overcrowded temple bar area this location was busy but much less noise i will definitely return to dublin and to this hotel,1
778,quirky but stylish roof top room in a fantastic location great service and incredibly helpful people as we were travelling with a disabled relative so close to all the good stuff ca wait to go back,1
779,stayed here with my wife as a treat with evening meal and afternoon tea highly recommend the room was excellent and the staff could have been more helpful will definitely be back it also in a great location for many of dublin attractions and we were able to get to the comedy festival at the iveagh gardens which was just a minute walk,1
780,enjoyed our stay immensely room was clean and modern service at the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and made great recommendations central location on the green allowed us to walk everywhere,1
782,we chose the fitzwilliam hotel for its location and we did not go wrong you could explore the entire city on foot there are tramway works going on in front of the hotel which did not bother us at all however please make sure you pick the room carefully more expensive rooms overlooking the park maybe exposed to noise we were perfectly happy with our quiet courtyard looking room superior room the room layout is modern and smartly done i would have just preferred some extra storage space a lot of space is taken by bar perhaps a little refurbishment one day would make it more what makes the big difference in this hotel is the service and kindness of the team from until concierge service was very efficient and proactive porters tried to anticipate any needs breakfast service was fast and impeccable breakfast as a whole i would say and prompt check in and check out people made you feel at home and went out of the way to give you advice approach you in your own language only negative i would have to warn against is the pricing policy their website advertises lower rates when booking in advance but in fact we should have waited and booked last minute prices in fact go down and by quite a lot since we stayed in june i had time to do check this for other dates and it was the same thing well when you get this through brokers you,1
783,we picked this hotel for the location and found it to be a gem in terms of service and amenities the hotel is within walking distance to city sights friendly staff and very helpful concierge we will be back,1
784,wonderful staff and beautiful hotel easy location to good restaurants and the airport the staff were gracious and helpful the room met all our needs my friend and i would like to stay here again when we visit dublin,1
785,dublin hotels are not cheap and fitzwilliam no exception however this is a prime location with lots to see and do within easy walking distance noise from work on tram system a bit annoying but it is almost finished management has ensured that its staff make the effort to engage with customers be friendly and smile simple stuff that is often forgotten but which makes an enormous difference to the customer experience so well done,1
786,we only got to stay one night but it was a wonderful experience the staff made our stay just perfect victor lined up our reservations for dinner our car return and a cab to the airport before we even arrived just made it so easy for us i really liked our room and view too just a good experience and wish we could have stayed longer,1
787,after just completing our first trip to dublin we ca say enough wonderful things about not only the fitzwilliam hotel but it staff prior to arrival concierge was extremely accommodating with planning airport transportation providing restaurant recommendations etc upon arrival they were friendly and warm and continued this way for the entire week we were visiting they provided amazing restaurant recommendations ex fade street social hatch sons great irish pubs ex macs and must sees in dublin many off of the beaten path and avoiding the tourist traps ex temple bar they also recommended and arranged for a great round of golf at royal dublin and suggested checking out malahide castle and getting lunch in howth all on the coast and wonderful we ca say enough great things about this hotel or it staff especially dane and vicktor we ca wait to return,1
788,we loved our sense of safety and the combination of the rooms overlooking the courtyard the sound of the seagulls the cosy room the bar the staff and all the help everyone gave us made us feel that we had a soft landing after a long and awful flight to ireland we go back without even looking at alternatives next time we are in dublin,1
789,fabulous in every respect is not hyperbole centrally located across the street from stephen green within walking distance to most central dublin points of interest actually within walking distance to almost everything and a accommodation makes this a top spot in my book the breakfast buffet or menu is a very reasonable option you have the option consider staying in the rooms with balcony overlooking the stephen green they are lovely our internal view of the courtyard is quite nice atypical of most european hotel rooms space is tight although it is just fine,1
790,we love staying at the fitzwilliam when we stay in dublin mainly for concerts time we stayed for one night whilst seeing wish it could have been hotel is so stylish and comfortable from the prosecco on arrival to pillow chocolates every nice touch is there including an umbrella great rooms and is superb such friendly staff ca wait to return,1
791,we enjoyed our stay at the fitzwilliam hotel the service was helpful and friendly they lent us umbrellas when it rained the location was perfect for visiting was delicious the rooms were convenient and well appointed,1
792,conveniently located hotel great staff nice service very american hotel they even set up a take away coffee corner for the mornings if you do want breakfast hotel was kind enough to hold our bags days after our departure,1
793,great hotel and service for a long weekend in dublin to watch in concert one of the best hotel breakfast offerings i have experienced and dinner was also staff and comfortable well appointed room not cheap but competitive with other star dublin hotels recommended,1
794,wonderful staff exceptional room with a fantastic location welcome on arrival was a very nice touch and a great way to start the weekend well appointed rooms with lots of space we definitely be back,1
795,it was all good i have stayed here many times and always do when i stay in dublin i think the staff are very friendly and the location is splendid i would highly recommend it to anyone the rooms are clean and the beds very comfortable,1
796,we chose the hotel for its location and on the recommendation ironically of the shelbourne we attempted to book the shelbourne but it was sold out the shelbourne is arguably the premiere hotel in ireland we stayed there and loved it however our experience at the fitzwilliam hotel will have us returning here the next time we are in dublin their staff genuinely takes an interest in your experience and our extremely competent to assist you with anything at anytime,1
797,the fitzwilliam hotel was recommended to me by my clients when i went to dublin on a business trip the room was lovely the bathroom was spacious great food fabulous location friendly staff i had a wonderful experience,1
798,i only stayed one night and had an early departure but the hotel was in a great location and very clean throughout room was nice and comfortable too staff were very helpful as well as efficient would definitely stay here again,1
799,great location close to great shopping and front desk attendants concierge are fantastic irish breakfast included is wonderful with wide arrange of choices rooms are very clean comfortable,1
800,dublin sojourn was magic loved the hotel fab location perfect for shopping visiting the national gallery and dining at restaurant in the evening staff hugely friendly and most helpful we will return,1
801,stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel again to celebrate my husband birthday absolutely delighted with the room it was fabulous with a balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard it was amazingly quiet for city centre dublin highly recommended,1
802,a fantastic week in dublin was made even more so by the superb staff at the fitzwilliam who were so pleasant and cheerful that it put our minds at ease immediately it made the city even prettier,1
804,one of those hotels that if you do ask you do get if you do kick up a fuss on check in you will be given the smallest room on the floor as they try to palm it off on some if you do ask for your room to be fully cleaned you return on the night to find last nights mess still in your location is great staff are very friendly as you walk about and the rooms are nicely executed,0
805,the fitzwilliam is in a great location and has a friendly helpful staff there is easy access to stephen green and grafton street the rooms are clean and comfortable check in was a breeze and the glass of prosecco was a nice touch,1
806,comfortable place for a stay in dublin staff always very nice breakfast room new and perfect to start your day bedroom very comfortable and clean nice to have on the wall here and there explanations of the historic building and the life and families that lived need an update shower was new so the tiles but washing basin need to be replaced,1
807,the staff here is excellent so friendly and helpful from the moment we pulled up to the front door they went out of their way to help us the rooms are beautiful and clean the breakfast was delicious we will definitely stay here again should we ever come back to dublin,1
810,wonderful staff knowledgeable and helpful great location in dublin near grafton street and all tours kudos to the concierge staff especially tom all were wonderful breakfast in the mezzanine was a real treat brought a horde of irish cousins for a late dinner at the citron restaurant food was good staff was patient and courteous would definitely return to the fitzwilliam,1
811,not a star hotel but very good location is truly fantastic for eating drinking and site seeing service was tremendous hotel is a bit dated plenty of space in the standard queen room with a small sitting area and a large bathroom shower is great but finding the right temp is like finding where track begins on a record,1
812,weary travelers arriving in the morning from usa are greeted warmly offered coffee and refreshments while our room is readied hours before check in time we so appreciated this the fitzwilliam is modern and updated but not lavish step out the front door and within steps you on pedestrianized grafton street the concierge booked tickets for us to the book of kells at nearby trinity college we ate a delicious early dinner at the hotel and walked blocks to the gaiety theatre for riverdance following a wonderful nights sleep we enjoyed a substantial breakfast our experience at the fitzwilliam was superior and we highly recommend,1
813,we stayed at fitzwilliam as a default location when we could get into merrion although all previous comments are true that this is a centrally located hotel there is no way this is a star hotel this hotel is quite dated and in fact staff indicated there is a renovation scheduled sometime in the near future the breakfast as well as breakfast location is mediocre at best rooms are ok and as one previous guest stated achieving the correct water temperature in the shower is a challenge and getting into the shower is a death defying feat due to the height of the tub the reason why i gave this hotel a very good as it has an incredible staff from the front desk housekeeping wait staff in restaurant everyone stands on their head to make this as best experience as they possibly can and their concierge staff is one of the best i have ever experienced in travel hopefully they will embark on some renovation improvements in the hotel and the environment will be consistent with their incredible staff,1
814,my friend and i just stayed at the roxford lodge hotel and enjoyed our stay but sadly there were a few issues that let it was from and we arrived after that but our room was not ready not a huge thing and we were offered a lovely cup of tea and choccy biscuits so that made up for room was lovely and the bed really comfy and we both had a good night sleep although though it a little strange to have a sauna in the room however the next morning was a bit of a let night before we were told that breakfast was until but in the morning we were then told it finished at it was am when we were told this there was a bit of a panic but it turned out it was after all so panic when we went in to breakfast the tables had not been cleared and there were no clean glasses for juice it just looked seemed as if there was only one lady covering the breakfast for everything so she was trying to clear the tables take the orders bring the orders and at times she did i afraid get a bit should have had some help selection was very good but the french toast was a bit bland so whilst the hotel is a lovely place to stay with pleasant happy staff there really do need to be more of them to justify the label of luxury accommodation,1
815,wonderful most european rooms are small i was on my own and got a single it had a sauna and a whirlpool tub when i was there it was very hot the room did not have ac and there were concerts going on so there was a lot of traffic with cars and people walking around partying i had to leave the window open so did not sleep for almost nights i stayed i asked to be moved but no availability on night begged for a fan or something or i was going to find other accommodation i feel i should not have had to ask for one but offered so i could close the window for some quiet otherwise it very conveniently located and the tub was great after long days of walking and hiking,1
817,we stayed for three nights at roxford lodge hotel the place was nice and quiet and in a very lovely neighbourhood our room was quite small but we asked for a very quiet one facing the backyard there is a bus going to the centre just outside the lodge hotel but we prefered walking,1
818,i spent one night at this hotel prior to joining an organized tour of ireland however i would have no issue staying here multiple days if the occasion presented staff at the front desk were very welcoming unpretentious and did their absolute best to check me in to my room well before the standard time my flight arrived a the breakfast staff were equally friendly and offerings ranged from basic cereal fruit juice tea etc available as to continental which includes cooked to order porridge accompanied by slices of toast and a nicely prepared plate of cheese and ham to full irish breakfasts again prepared to order and cost a little more note all the breakfasts are separate from the room rate unless otherwise there is one slight issue with the breakfast hour it would be the dining space limited seating and a little cramped i recommend you get down there earlier rather than regards to the room it was very clean and cozy had a comfortable bed an infrared sauna which i did try tea kettle complimentary tea hairdryer and iron with ironing board is available in all areas of the hotel on an open network free of respect to location the roxford is on a quiet but very well connected street in an affluent area of the city the aircoach from dublin airport stops just a min walk away from the hotel main entrance at the schoolhouse hotel and there is a stop for other public transportation right,1
819,i found the roxford lodge to be a good quality place i only stayed one night at the end of my time in ireland the staff was very pleasant and helpful breakfast was good with a variety of options the dining room is not large i went when it opened and it filled up rather i was staying longer i would have liked the location to be closer to the city center it is within walking distance about to minutes depending on where you are going there is a city bus stop right outside the front door and a stop for aircoach the airport one block away bus greystones the location is in a nice neighborhood,1
820,i reluctant to review roxford lodge as i selfishly do want others to find it and make it harder for me to book i always stay here if i can when visiting dublin even spent our honeymoon here when we were upgraded very generously to the top a little walk out of the centre which is part of what i like about it no crowds no finished with saunas jacuzzi baths and tasteful decor the staff are always polite and helpful frankly it a pleasure to stay here,1
822,spent two nights in this hotel friendly staff very nice structure good size room a little bit far out from the center of dublin but overall it perfect if you want to spend few nights and do want to pay too much,1
824,we stayed in one of the houses which are owned by desmond the owned of the roxford lodge we booked the house thru airbnb the house was clean modern and well appointed with everything that we needed for our is excellent several local bars and restaurants within metres and a minute walk to trinity college temple bar was an convivial and gracious host and even provided us with some basic foodstuffs on will not be disappointed with this property,1
825,staff are lovely and very helpful its in a great location with a lovely breakfast we had a room off the patio downstairs which was a great bonus for clean and will stay again when in dublin,1
826,clean and quiet hotel close to avivia and rds without being mobbed staff were polite efficent and nothing was to much for them secure parking is a bonus and there was no noise our room was small but was more than adequate,1
827,the rooms did not correspond to the rooms at the pictures on the website the size of the room is very different form what is stated when booking it shows that triple rooms are but the actual size of the room was less then the hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived was not small dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room all the halls and corridors are very tiny if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel also no place for the luggage in the room we had to use an extra bed for it the hotel manager was rude to us screaming and shouting sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the website so upon the issue was solved if you book this hotel please do not expect to live in the rooms which are on the pictures and have the size that stated on the website they are tricking people,0
828,we greatly enjoyed our quick stay at this hotel and would happily return the staff were very friendly and helpful with breakfast and local tips the executive suite room that we stayed in was recently renovated and a beautiful room we enjoyed using the sauna hot tub and large rain shower,1
829,spent two nights in the house with eight friends we were met in the reception of the hotel the receptionist then showed around the house very polite and efficient the house is immaculate and very spacious we were even supplied with tea coffee bread etc it takes about to walk into the city but staying in accommodation like this and the weather sunny and hot all weekend made it certainly recommend staying in the hotel house fantastic house staff,1
830,excellent on all counts food room quality cleanliness contact staff well done we stayed three nights and the staff contacted me when i had vacated the room by pm on day they wanted to tidy the room good work,1
831,location was very nice and room very clean staff was kind and helpful to us we had a very nice stay location was close to downtown dublin and easily walkable to and from different places nice neighborhood,1
832,great hotel friendly very helpful staff who assisted us with our excursion online bookings we stayed in the room with jacuzzi bath and infa red sauna which was lovely very clean and well located to the centre of dublin within a minute walk with great transport links would stay here again coffee and tea making facilities in the room was a nice touch,1
833,what a sensational room very roomy a sauna next to the bed small balcony spa bath great area not to love thanks for a great stay to all staff car parking also for hire cars walking distance to city,1
834,there were six of us and the townhouse was perfect for our group clean quiet fast assistance whenever it was required special thanks to des the manager who attended to everything with speed effectiveness and a genuine sense of caring about his guests will stay here again next year,1
835,stayed last saturday the reception was very friendly and the staff overall were great beds very comfortable and the breakfast the following morning was exceptional as a coeliac usually the selection isnt great but the roxford does it justice with the tasty delicious food served,1
836,stayed here for three nights while we were in dublin greeted on arrival by the nicest man who told us about dublin and walked us personally to our room we were in one of the rooms in the back which was very convenient because we could come in and out by the back gate rooms were very clean and pleasant parking was included as well as breakfast breakfast was especially the homemade brown toast would definitely stay here again on another trip,1
837,we stayed here for one night before our tour started the rooms are very small and it you have luggage there is very little room to open it you end up tripping over the was difficult walking around the bed because of the tv and dvd player sticking out of the wall near the foot of the bed i had set it up so our group had rooms i was a little embarrassed also you have to be able to walk to get to the on off bus the hotel is in need of updating the paint was peeling off the bath room ceiling there was some black mold in between the tiles in the shower and when they touched up the paint on the walls it did match the ac was also poor on a positive note the breakfast which is extra was very good also do expect to get into your room until after,0
838,the people at the front desk were very helpful as we had questions and needed to call tour locations the rooms were nice well maintained and quiet at least in the back of the hotel where we stayed we had a single room on the ground floor and a family room for on the top floor we really enjoyed that the hotel was walking distance about minutes from many of the places we wanted to visit but not right in the noise of the city the breakfast was good though additional not all rooms have air conditioning so ask if that is important to you,1
839,we walked from heston station to this perfectly located hotel we received a lovely welcome on arrival and were very happy with our room bar food was available all day and we loved the chicken bus to airport was handy too,1
840,this hotel is amazing i was switched rooms with a better view and the staff was amazing i would stay here again for sure the breakfast was the best i have had in the time i was in ireland thank you,1
841,my husband and i spent nights at this hotel we were very impressed with the courteousness of the staff the cleanliness of the rooms and the overall positive atmosphere in the hotel although it is not in the heart of dublin the tram service just outside the hotel is very efficient,1
843,we really loved our night stay at the ashling hotel dublin the hotel location is brilliant nice minute walk to temple bar area plus same distance too guinness storehouse attraction we stayed room only because we enjoy eating out there are so many options for food it just takes a little effort to go out tip for transfer from dublin airport is to catch the bus return ticket was euros each do worry about getting hopper tickets until you in dublin,1
844,the location is excellent for your dublin experience just next to heuston station with busses min drive and trams to the center and also a bus stop for the airport bus and at the same time not in the noisy temple area nice rooms albeit ours without a view with all facilities very good breakfast buffet and quietly competent staff except that the front desk could help us with the best bus connections to the grayhound races do forget to buy a leap visitor card not the standard leap card in the airport days at we loved dublin and would choose ashling again for a next visit,1
845,thanks a lot for having us here we a family of and had rooms close to each other they were big enough clean and breakfast was very very big buffet and well organized no hurry no rush the staff was very friendly and helpfull we even got a fridge when we asked for it the hotel is located near to a big station where you get all the you need,1
846,the ashling is a nice hotel with a convenient location close to the guinness factory and easily accessible by the tram system the staff were great and the rooms were fine buffet breakfast is typical irish fare and reasonably priced coffee was not great but i am a coffee snob so do pay attention to that if you not fussed about your coffee,1
847,we stayed at ashling hotel for a total of three nights over the course of a week and had an amazing stay we arrived on an early morning flight that landed at am and were fortunate that when we reached the hotel there was a room ready we were really only expecting to be able to store our luggage until check in time but being able to check in early and have a made a huge impact on our trip we are incredibly grateful we stayed in two different rooms because we traveled outside of dublin for a few days and then returned both rooms were amazing and outfitted nicely we especially enjoyed the complimentary shortbread cookies we ate at the restaurant twice and found the service very quick and really enjoyed our meals what really set the ashling apart for us was the level of service and the amazing staff on our last day we decided not to have the room cleaned and left the do not disturb tag on the door we were pleasantly surprised when a bag of fresh towels toiletries coffee and even complimentary cookies was left at our door the front desk staff were always warm and personable and gave us suggestions for sites we might want to check out we found the location of the hotel to be perfect for our needs as others have mentioned it is right next to a luas stop making travel other sites convenient although we found that most,1
848,we stopped for nights days and the hotel was fantastic either a walk down the river or an easy stop tram ride to the centre the room was clean and spacious with a bed the staff were all really friend and the reception very helpful and always smiling but to top all this was the breakfast one of the best breakfast menus i have seen even down to a pancake making our trip thank you and see you again soon,1
849,the staff were very welcoming at the ashling hotel the room was nice and clean and the size of the room was typical for a city hotel the location was great and we were able to walk everywhere we stayed nights and we had a very early check out the day we were leaving and they packed us a breakfast bag to go since we would be missing the breakfast that morning so very kind,1
850,great friendly staff and service could not be better really first class operation outstanding service rooms comfortable and clean transportation right outside their doors short trip into heart of city,1
851,great breakfast nice lounge friendly staff clean rooms love the cookies every morning we had a chance to meet family and we had plenty of room with about of usall needed directions and the front girls mapped out the location for us thank you we found also are thankful that we were able to bring our luggage down to the garage and get it weighed before we went to the airport,1
852,i stayed here for one night after a long haul flight and was so pleased that my room was ready when i arrived at so i could have a room was spacious and immaculate breakfast was luas tram runs past the hotel and it just a few minutes into the city and all the attractions of also right near heuston recommended,1
853,we stayed one night at the ashling our room was quiet and comfortable the breakfast buffet was very nice the staff was friendly and helpful we had a problem getting our rental car and they were quite accommodating about letting us have a late checkout,1
854,this is the best hotel i ever been in the service is great reception staff especially are very welcoming friendly and knowledgeable our room was ideal well laid out well serviced and comfortable and very location suited us very well being close to heuston railway station phoenix park museum of modern art national museum kilmainham gaol guinness brewery transport to other areas is easy an excellent taxi service and luas tram service on the doorstep breakfast is an experience in itself the menu covers items,1
855,for me walking into the ashling hotel is like walking into a country hotel you get that warm welcoming feeling its in a quieter part of the city beside huston station the general manager alen can be seen early in the morning welcoming his guests walking the property checking everything is set up for the days business ahead and greeting people as he goes the management team have their briefings and you can see they are happy in their work there is always great banter amongst them its a home from home with in the bar lounge area with the lovely couches and pleasant service is always friendly and polite and the team get to know their regulars the food is good with bar food restaurant available they have a great mix of business regulars individuals groups and corporate its a super location to meet friends or business people with the luas outside the door,1
856,very nice hotel that worked well for our family teenage boys family room had a double and single beds nice restaurant with large breakfast buffet right down the street from phoenix park and an easy min walk to the guinness factory and not much further to the kilmainham gaol about a minute walk to the temple bar area along the river and across the bridge two good pubs ryan and nancy hands a minute away it also right next to the hop off bus stop would stay again,1
857,beautifully appointed hotel located on the river just across from heuston station do let the outside fool you inside this hotel is a gem the extra friendly staff provided maps directions and tips to make our four day stay in dublin a delight in addition to walking to the city center we were able to catch the tram and the local bus both run right by the hotel to wherever we wanted to visit the full buffet breakfast served in the dining room every morning was an amazing value and a great way to start the day and we returned each evening to a soft clean bed in a quiet room to rest up for another adventure in dublin,1
859,very helpful staff who had the room organised exactly as required and were very helpful in any requests that we had special thanks to joao silva for the great work would highly recommend to any organisations looking to host an event,1
860,we spent two nights here at the beginning of july after flying in from the usa the location is close enough to the center of dublin which can be reached by about a minute walk along the river or by taking the light rail system luas which takes you along the north side of the river to many sights a great staff and modern hotel facility i would stay here again when back in dublin it is a great value for the euro,1
861,my husband and i stayed in this hotel for nights it was very clean and comfortable it was in a great location very easy access to public transportation it felt very safe and i had a great trip dublin is a beautiful city i highly recommend this hotel,1
862,excellent night stay everyone at the hotel helpful and pleasant the hotel is very clean the good thing is you can pay as you go for breakfast and in the bar so you have no nasty surprises at the end of your stay it is ideally situated if you what to be just out of the city because the transport links are great you have the luas airport express bus both outside heuston rail station along with other services to get into temple bar and beyond the zoo phoenix park are a min walk from the hotel you can also catch the hop on hop off bus from front door,1
863,although the hotel looked nice from the outside the inside was beautiful it felt very luxurious we had a superior king room overlooking the guinness room was huge but it was clean and comfortable the bar bar staff were great huge comfy sofa to sit on attentive bar booked the hotel restaurant for our night it looked lovely it was advertised as a candlelit dinner but in reality was a tealight on the table with fairly bright overhead lights despite the opulent surroundings there was very little atmosphere though the waiting staff that night were downright miserable we wished we had stayed in the bar to eat breakfast was euro for a full cooked buffet a great base for dublin minute walk to the guinness storehouse about the same to dublin zoo the tram is a minute walk away that will take you in to the temple bar area took about minutes cost to reach from the airport too just take the airlink from outside the terminal it a minute walk from the last stop at heuston station for a euro return highly recommended,1
864,we love this hotel the room is beautiful spacious and cozy the staff is incredible kind and accommodating the morning breakfast is served for a good chunk of time in the and is absolutely delicious the room service food was also very good we would book this place over and over again,1
865,fantastic location if travelling by train close to luas also room was amazing overlooking the city staff friendly and available to fulfil all requests luggage can be stored and collected at a later time after checkout time,1
866,let me start by saying we booked this hotel through a service and had heard wonderful things about it we were disappointed in the reception the manager was not very helpful the main restaurant of this hotel was not open on sundays for guest which was is problem as there were no restaurants close by the lounge though was open and so crowded you could not get a seat but the staff in the lounge especially maria were outstanding the food was good as was the service i do understand how the food could be so good in the lounge but the restaurant was very bland and everything tasted the same no matter what you ordered the room staff left a lot to be desired also the bed was made but that was all they did we stayed here a week but was tempted to change hotels we were book here again,0
867,i booked this hotel well in advanced back in march as i started organising my partners surprise birthday the service from the very start was incredible unfortunately my partner was very well the day we arrived and had an early flight i phoned the hotel when we landed to see whether we were able to check in any earlier than the usual at half they said our room was ready and once we turn up we can check in straight away this was perfect for us and allowed my partner to get the rest he needed before the weekend properly started on the initial reservation i had told them the occasion for our trip and requested a higher floor in the hope of better views and that was exactly what we got we had a welcome letter birthday card and some chocolates in the room on arrival we ordered some room service on friday and shared a burger between the two of us that value for money was excellent and was plenty for us to share we stayed nights and have got a single complaint the hotel was quiet clean and in walking distance to the tram which then took mins to get into the town centre very impressed and would be returning to the hotel on our next visit to dublin,1
868,stayed there for days on a vacation staff were great really close to heuston station tram stops and busses we did not want to stay in the temple bar area as others have told us that is noisy and super expensive so we decided to try this location i think we made the right choice the only downside to the location is that there is limited restaurants close by and the restaurants on the hotel are in my opinion over priced with too small of a menu although the food tasted pretty good i would go back,1
869,the hotel was beautiful i really liked how it was easy to print your boarding passes in the lobby across from the elevators the rooms were really nice and clean the beds were comfortable also if you walk across the street its really close to the public transportation its a couple stops before you in the center of dublin for shopping,1
870,chick was fast and chick in staff were lovely to deal with and it was a room with view of looing dublin city the food was the very good the breakfast was lovely and the chef and the hot food counter and the staff great to talk to the bar staff were love to deal with and hotel had high stander star serves located in huston train station and the tram red line and the city centre,1
871,i selected this hotel because of its close proximity to the train station it does look wonderful from the outside but do be fooled it well kept and comfortable and our room was very nice the price was quite reasonable we were able to check in a little early which was great and the process was efficient we walked to the center of dublin which took about minutes i stay here again for sure,1
872,my family and i stayed here for a total of nights during our trip to ireland we completely enjoyed our stay here we had a triple room and it was very spacious and clean the breakfast has a variety of hot and cold items enough for everyone the location could not be beat we walked into the city with no problem we did not use the tram line but it was very close and would have been another good option we would definitely visit again if we are ever in dublin,1
873,stayed here for one night from work very friendly staff and welcoming and helpful which is what you need on arrival rooms are lovely specious and beds are comfy breakfast with the most amazing variety of food and quick service too also smiling faces all around even tho breakfast starts at that was very helpful as if you need to catch an early train like me you can still have full breakfast perfect,1
874,i had the opportunity to spend an additional five nights in dublin this past july my stay at the ashling hotel was exceptional it is close to all forms of transportation yet it is just outside the hustle and bustle of the city center which made for a quiet stay the room was large and well lit the bathroom was impressive with its separate shower and large soaking tub the staff were more than friendly upon my arrival every employee that i met throughout my stay was helpful pleasant very professional and made my stay that much more special room service was very prompt and the food was fresh and hot the breakfast buffet had so many options to choose from which drew you to it every morning i will definitely stay here again on my next visit to dublin and i highly recommend it to others,1
875,very close to the train station which is an easy taxi or shuttle from the airport our room was very spacious with a sliding door and small patio overlooking the river and guiness factory about a mile away the staff was friendly and ion i think that is how it is spelled who checked us in was so friendly professional and accommodating which was such a nice way to start our vacation especially since we flew all night and were exhausted he got us in our room a little early too which was a nice surprise,1
876,as someone who travels extensively i feel that i can compete hotel prices and ireland is by far one of the most expensive places to stay that said i looked on the internet read a lot of tripadvisor reviews and choose the ashling hotel in price ranges i would say it above middle it a great hotel it not centrally situated but from the city centre it a few stops on the tram it opposite the main train station personally i hopped on to the sightseeing bus as it was en route the hotel was clean modern with friendly staff and a great buzz as you enter the lobby check in with very easy and all of my questions answered by the staff my room was a single one which i was very happy with it was a great size modern tasteful decor with a large size bathroom with great toiletries and just the best irish tea and coffee available in the room this hotel would have had a five stars however the breakfast let it down as a vegan the options available were very and basic nobody wants to eat dry tasteless crackers any more as when there so much amazing vegan available i could eat any of the cooked breakfast options and they been cooked in animal fat and i found the chef to be most unhelpful and not even open to offer me any alternatives when i was checking out i did mention this and they did,1
877,this hotel is very comfortable and just across the road from hueston station the luas stops outside and takes you into the city centre they will hold your luggage if you are on a day trip and want to go see the sights very close to the zoo breakfast was excellent catering for all diets soya milk beside regular milk we didnt have to ask for it overall a good hotel to stay in they also accommodated us on an early check in,1
878,had a week here staff excellent could have been more helpful room was lovely had rooms both excellent left a note to ask for more tea bags as we did want coffee lady left us extra the staff in the bar was very helpful especially robbie all i can say is lovely hotel with lovely staff and ca ask for more would go again,1
879,from the start when ian checked us in to when we left the stay was perfect we were there for nights in july and i would definitely stay here again the rooms are beautiful and well are a lot of great pubs restaurants down the street also,1
880,placed right off the river liffey tram station and near the guinness storehouse the location is ideal easy stroll down to the temple bar area as well rooms are great spacious and lovely reception greeted us well and although our room was not ready they were able to get us checked in so that when we returned from our first day full of jet lag we could just grab our keys and head to the room baggage storage available and safe,1
881,once again another great stay at the ashling from our first contact st the reception to checking out two days later every member of staff was friendly pleasant and super efficient the breakfast choices were as on previous occasions excellent the hotel is very convenient for heuston station and the airport express service as well as local buses and the lucas thank you to all concerned and we will be back in november if not before,1
882,we went there for a short break for my partners birthday there was a great communication from the airport to the hotel and to any other part of dublin via public service breakfast was amazing with a great variety of both cold and hot food staff were very helpful and would be always there to assist our room was spotless throughout our visit the only thing that could be improved was outside noise as we have had a front view room and we could hear outside noises overall i highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to visit dublin but does want to be right in the city centre,1
883,this hotel was nice enough good location for the tram line and bus route from the airport hotel had decent enough standards what was exceptional though was being greeted by the man kevin what a character great banter and so helpful louise at the bar was also very kind and helpful in summary a good hotel made great by the people who work there,1
884,very nice hotel the included breakfast buffet was exceptional the food in the lounge was very good and the service was good we discovered early in our weeks of traveling ireland that the weather is such that air conditioning is rare none of the star hotels we booked had air hotel is at the outer edges of downtown so it is quieter than the downtown hotels we arrived the day of the concert so the city was very busy and crowded it is close to the guiness factory and only a minute walk to the heart of downtown,1
885,paid per night for a room with poorly designed bathroom causing lake on bathroom floor every time showered this is causing mold and mildew on door molding plus the ceiling over sleep area is peeling and moldy shame on management for allowing guests to spend good money to be put in these type of accommodations managment solution was an insult refunded do not stay here see photos,0
886,my boyfriend and i where very unsure on where to stay in dublin we came across this hotel in our research and thought it would do rightly it was a very good choice to say the least the room was so spacious a lot more space than many other hotels we have stayed at the rooms were very modern and had many accessories the little things such as the fan the iron and the complementary bottles of water came in handy during our stay the wifi connection throughout the hotel was very good and we were both able to browse from our room but when we had difficulty booking our tickets for day trips etc online we were able to make use of the hotels computers which are located in the lobby the staff were simply fantastic so helpful when we wanted to know how to get here and there and gave us ideas on different activities to do throughout the day we did have an evening meal in the hotel but the breakfast was the best i have ever had in a hotel the location of the hotel was great min walk from the stop and in mins we were in dublin city centre for a little of i would definitely recommend this hotel for couples families and individuals as it caters for everyone,1
887,when in dublin several times a year the ashling is my first choice it well located for museums tourist attractions and transportation needs directly across from heuston station and minutes from connolly station train connections are easy the luas is also proximate for sightseeing in dublin various hop on hop off tours are easily accessed from the hotel it a scenic walk along the liffey to street from grafton street trinity college book of kells the national museum of archaeology and newly reopened national gallery are just a few blocks away hotel amenities meet or exceed expectations rooms are lovely and comfortable staff friendly and helpful dining delicious especially the full irish breakfast buffet over the years it has not disappointed and continues to serve as a reliable and comfortable home base in dublin,1
889,business and pleasure trip to dublin with my wife her sister and our brother in law as we had planned to scatter the girls mothers ashes back in the fair city in which she was born i had a few messages backwards and forwards with the hotel before we left they were very helpful indeed greeted with excited smiles and real honest interest in our business and when we told them about mum the young irish lady shed a tear sorry the rooms were excellent the food was superb and overall we had the most amazing stay and a great experience it being a family run hotel makes all the difference staff more than helpful and genuinely concerned about our wellbeing throughout our stay i ca see us staying anywhere else next year being on business as well as pleasure i need fairly fast internet and the ashling hotel has fibre i was dow loading at around and uploading about which was a real bonus on top of everything else i do usually pick out members of staff however on this occasion i really do have to mention silvana erin they were magnificent and a real credit to the hotel i would have them in my team in a heart beat thanks to all the staff for an unforgettable stay sizzerals,1
890,we really enjoyed our stay at the ashling hotel the location was perfect for getting around dublin right across the river from heuston train station and between luas stops loads of sites were walkable from the hotel including the guinness storehouse jameson and several museums the hotel itself is really lovely spotless guest room charming public spaces and an engaging staff we happily stay again upon a return to the city,1
891,our check in set the tone for our stay in greeted is with a huge smile and a warm much needed welcome after our overnight flight with no sleep it was just the arrival we room was huge with the largest bath i seen in a room soaking tub and large shower with double the heavy drapes we had lots of windows corner room with a large service was fast and everything arrived hot and tasted very walk to transportation train station and light rail across the street all of the sites less than a minute leisurely be back next time we in dublin,1
892,absolutely lovely hotel rooms are great and very comfortable hairdryer iron ironing board in room and refreshments tea coffee biscuits bottles of water replenished daily food very nice drinks cost the same as in most of the bars location was perfect quiet as away from main area however the luas tram runs in front of the hotel and the bus station and train station are a minute walk over the road taxi also opposite distance to attractions such as kilmainham gaol guinness storehouse and dublin zoo there a smoking corner at the back of the hotel within the car parking area staff were all very warm and friendly nothing was too much trouble ate a couple of evenings in the bar area good quality food and there a restaurant too if you want a meal that a bit more upper park area opposite the front of hotel where it nice to sit by the water i highly recommend this hotel and will stay again when i return to dublin,1
893,we spent two nights in this hotel i was centrally located near the heuston train station which was important for us as we were traveling to galway during our trip you can also catch the luas dublin rail train at the heuston station as well this hotel was some what dated but that did not bother us much the only drawback we had was that there was no air conditioner or fans just to circulate air we had a family room which was a interesting because my husband and i slept on a double bed in the middle of the room with our kids on the sides of us on twin beds the hotel is located west of the main dublin area but it is only a min walk or a luas ride this hotel was located in a more residential area and had limited pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood the staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel had a large area i can not talk about the hotel restaurant as we did not eat there overall we had a nice stay rooms were clean and safe,1
894,ashling hotel was a pleasant surprise location was key for train tram and bus travel staff was very accommodating great breakfast offerings lounge is comfortable and inviting will stay here again,1
895,ashling hotel in dublin was a nice place to stay during the vacation the hotel is not located in the best possible place but you can relatively easily walk to the city center approx kilometres is very near the zoo and beautiful phoenix can warmly recommend the full irish breakfast buffet person family room was good for four persons and the room was well cleaned every personnel in the reception was very helpful while i needed to visit a physician and to get some advice the only thing that i was missing was the gym fitness could i visit this hotel again yes definitely with the good memories of tasty breakfast,1
896,beautiful hotel for two night stay in dublin with friends our person room was comfortable with all the amenities the service was great in both the hotel and their restaurants the wifi worked great my only complaint is the location is not ideal it is close to heuston train station but we were really using it it is a long walk or a euro cab ride to get to many places of interest if it was just a little closer to downtown it would be perfect,1
897,when you look online you see so many different properties and it is hard to tell what is what but this place is amazing first of all it is close to everything very close it is right beside the river and the room was huge comfy bed gigantic bathroom with two sinks and both tub and shower this bathroom was bigger than my college apartment then the lounge was so stylish and comfortable and the food and drinks were great breakfast was large and all encompassing and the person running the front of the restaurant i think her name was savannah had a bubbly personality and stayed cool under pressure she was very impressive overall a great stay highly recommended,1
898,we spend nights at this lovely hotel check in was fast and easy we arrived early and our room was ready we were adults and booked a family room just to reduce costs the room had a double bed twin beds cute seating area by the window area with a bench and a spacious bathroom there was ports above the end table of every stayed a few places in ireland and the ashling had the best breakfast buffet huge amount of choices and reasonably access to transportation luas and heuston station are basically across the street close to phoenix park and nice selection of nearby i lucky enough to visit ireland again i definitely stay at the ashling,1
899,i stayed at the ashling for nights while in dublin the staff goes out of its way to accommodate it is very clean well run and well located it is more at the edge of all the action but that can be a good thing it is a quiet place to stay and only steps away from the tram which takes you to city center in minutes also you can walk to attractions if you to guinness in one direction and phoenix park and zoo in the other the on site restaurant is great offering a wonderful breakfast buffet with many many options the area is inviting and also has wonderful fare i would recommend the ashling as a place to stay in dublin,1
900,kind staffcomfortable bed nice bathroomamazing breakfast cocktail bar for the day after or sirups and marshmallows for hot chocolate also glutenfree products availableclose to heuston station train airlink tram and museum luas station tram,1
901,the ashling is a nice hotel it has great amenities and is located on the west side of the city just a few blocks from the action temple bar etc the room price is a little high but the staff and hotel are excellent good breakfast options as well,1
902,this was our visit to the ashling hotel it is a few minutes walk from heuston station in a quiet location tram takes mins into dublin shopping district hotel is lovely comfortable and spotlessly clean all staff are excellent we received an anniversary card and chocolates for our anniversary which was a nice touch i would definitely return again,1
903,we travelled as a family of four and stayed in the ashling for two nights in a family room with breakfast the hotel exceeded our expectation in every respect the room was large clean and comfortable the breakfast was superb with a huge choice of items for both ourselves and the kids and all the staff were friendly and welcoming the hotel was slightly further out than some but with having a stop on the hop on and hop off bus service right outside as well as a tram stop this did not present a problem it also resulted in a peaceful and quiet nights sleep the addition of parking was a bonus for us in the city centre and the hotel was excellent value for money we would definitely return to the ashling should we visit dublin again,1
904,at first this hotel seemed to be far off the beaten path but we found the location to be very convenient and walked all over dublin from there easy spot to catch buses or other public transportation clean with friendly staff,1
905,we arrived about knowing we could not check in until we asked to store our bags which they accommodated straight away they also said they would make sure a room was available for room was ready as promised for all modern and refurbished everything clean with a great view on the was basic but good with the option of grab and go with a take out coffee and croissant were really accommodating offering maps directions and recommendationswould definitely stay here again,1
906,perfect location the hotel was comfortable and had a nice breakfast they decorated and had a party atmosphere for st patrick day terrific spot on the parade route that you can view from their windows great time,1
907,this is an extreley modern and new hotel the lobby is beautiful the rroms very funky and the staff are just outstanding it is in an excellent will be back for to the awesome staff for looking after us so well,1
908,i met a colleague in the lobby in this ultra modern and very comfortable lobby this is a brand new hotel centrally located and very clean and crisp looking from outside and all the way through there is a really clever projected map on entrance wall and inside modern comfy the bar and dining is all open plan and the place is have to stay here next,1
909,one of the best hi express i have stayed at it centrally located is almost brand new with big rooms walking distance to major sights in the city center could ask for any more would recommend this to anyone looking for a hotel in dublin,1
910,this is a new clean hotel situated above a night club i do know who made the decision to put rooms where people are supposed to sleep above a pounding nightclub but it was a poor choice if you do wind up in this hotel request to be above the first floor or you wo sleep at all you might not sleep if you higher up as well calling the front desk does nothing they just tell you that the nightclub was supposed to be closed already at the location is convenient but it is worth not sleeping,0
911,brand new hotel the room especially the shower was great you do get tons of street noise but just learned to turn it off i would suggest some type of guide in the room to explains things like that the lights outlets work after you put your key into the slot above the switches there are no ice or vending machines and that is apparently standard in europe that there are no washcloths you have to ask for one at the desk and there is no business center who knew great central location but suggestions for food etc should also be in the room guide would stay again staff was very helpful,1
912,we stayed here with six friends for out location was just perfect the staff lovely ok it was busy at breakfast but its summer holidays show me a hotel thats not busy and it was playing in there home city the whole city was full our room was lovely large and we found it quiet,1
913,although the price seemed expensive it was peace of mind when booking ahead from canada it a hotel chain that we have used in other places in the past and know what standards to expect the building was safe secure and well maintained our room was small but had all the amenities needed for our few days in dublin it was conveniently located to the downtown area with all of the hop on bus tours just a minute walk out the front door the staff were courteous and helpful,1
914,within walking distance of the liffey river and temple bar area in the south and to croke park in the north the holiday inn express was a brilliant place to located near the spire it has both a coffee shop and a traditional irish pub with great food right next bank is across the road and shopping strips are nearby on parnell and staff are polite and friendly while small the rooms are clean and quiet and the facilities are modern and is a really great breakfast provided every morning to get your day in dublin moved here from an alternative hotel which did work out and were so glad that we did,1
915,hotel is centrally located this hotel is spotlessly clean very friendly staff excellent breakfast airconditioned the reading lamp above the table should be at a higher level though location is brilliant walking distance to all amenities such as the shopping street minute walk for the temple bar area,1
916,super squeaky clean all over easily accessible great location delicious hearty breakfast spread brilliant service comfy bed and pillows more than enough toiletries makes you want to head to your room for a good rest from the busy dublin life will def stay here again next time,1
917,because of a concert we paid a high price but the hotel is very good it is in the centre of dublin the room is nice and quiet nice colours comfortable bed the bathroom is clean and new breakfast is standard bacon sausages scrambled eggs and beans croissants and bread a lot of different fruit marmelades big coffee cups and fruit to go airport coach stops just a minute walk from the hotel to travel to the airport just cross the street to take the airport coach pay attention to which terminal you need or,1
918,stayed for nights room has a strange layout in a l shape and very little storage space numerous stains and dirty marks on the floor had a stunning view of the hotel roof fencing and walls quite noisy bed was small and creaky paid nearly euros for nights i paid half that in other chain hotels and had nicer room bed and service bar in the hotel is very expensive and the service is poor pub next door is brilliant disappointed with this hotel brilliant location just very poor value and standards would love to return to dublin but i would not stay here again for what it cost,0
919,hotel centrally situated although we arrived very early in the morning the reception staff were able to hold our cases pending check in later all staff extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very clean and our twin room was very spacious i did email prior to arrival for a high floor but unfortunately enddd up on the second floor at the front which was very noisy through the night with people coming and going but you are in a city centre so it can not be helped would highly recommend,1
920,we stayed at the hi for a couple of nights and were quite happy with our stay first off great location to everything downtown or any of the busses to take you wherever you want to go the staff was very friendly and accommodating we arrived super early in the morning but they were able to take our bags and store them for us while we explored breakfast was included which was a nice display of eggs meats breads and fruits the room itself was clean and spacious enough the only complaint i would have would be we were on the second floor and above the underneath so we could hear people and music well into the night but we would stay there again we would just ask to be in the opposite side of the hotel or on a higher floor,1
921,we stayed here for two nights in early july the location is very good you can walk to most of dublin attractions some reviews have mentioned you can get a bus from the airport but if you have much luggage or multiple passengers it might be worth getting a cab we paid about euro the hotel is very new with nice modern touches like usb ports on both sides of the bed the stall shower is nice and the there is sufficient bathroom counter space for those who like to do hair and makeup the air conditioning is good and cold the included breakfast is very good there are several hot options as well as plenty of pastries cereal and juices there is both brewed coffee and espresso the lobby was very busy during breakfast but the staff did an excellent job of keeping everything well stocked and clean if we return to dublin we will likely stay here again,1
922,we stayed here for nights at the beginning of the month this hotel is a great place to start your iris vacation easy to get from the airport take the airport bus euros ow and get off at cathal brugha street the hotel is across the street on upper rooms are modern and well laid out think ikea the rooms also have very rare in ireland nice sized bathroom with a shower there are making facilities in the room we asked for a quiet room one that did not face street there was a big sports bar under our window when they got late and loud i just closed the window turned on the air conditioning the windows appear to be double glazed and keep out exterior noise well there are also decent black out curtains if you want to sleep late do not sleep too late or you will miss out on the included breakfast buffet other reviewers have noted a lot of the front desk staff are esl they try to be helpful but do not always have a very good knowledge of dublin i asked at the front desk where we could pick up the no bus to the botanic gardens the young lady had no idea turned out to be across on the other side of street easy minute walk to the trinity college or temple bar area lots of city busses stop right in front of the hotel the luas tram is just a few,1
923,the holiday in was a good night sleep the breakfast was good if simple the beds were soft and comfortable and they even gave you choices of a hard and soft was nice and clean there was even an ironing board in the only real negative of the hotel was the shuttle make sure you look at the schedule as it only comes once every half hours though the printout of our booking said it was a hour shuttle we actually had to phone at midnight for it to come at am as we sat at the airport waiting for our holiday crown plaza shuttles came three times for the carlton and another local hotel in fairness when at the hotel the schedule is posted at the front desk,1
924,two nights at and service as you expect from a holiday inn walking distance to minutes to city hall and the old is easy to walk in safe and a pint at the crown gin saloon,1
925,looks really modern from both the outside and the impressions on the rooms are clean brand new and a good use of the space iron hair drier and a decent sized telly plus hot drink leaked reported but easy to very good with a reasonable variety of great as its on the bus route from the airport and in the centre of the it and would go again,1
926,i am a gold elite with priority club no upgrade reception staff selected a room with a lousy view and a long walk from elevator the free wifi keeps disconnecting safety deposit box door needs a metal object like tip of the spoon they have in the room to be able to open the door as it does open itself or has a handle to use to open it no water bottles in the room very much like a dormitory reminded me of college days would stay there again,0
927,we spent nights here the location is perfect all of the staff were wonderful breakfast was very crowded fresh and delicious the room was large clean and modern the bed was comfortable there are plenty of outlets an iron ironing board a safe a hair drier and a very large shower,1
928,we stayed at this hotel for our first and only night in dublin we were able to check in early as our flight arrived mid morning and we drove from the airport to the hotel while they do not have parking available at the property a very short walk is public parking we received a discount from the hotel for our parking as well and to our surprise it was a pretty decent discount nearly of the cost the room along with the entire hotel was modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and the was comparable to american standards ie water pressure one thing i did noticed and was a trend with every hotel and b b we stayed at in europe was the lack of face cloth so if you are traveling i and you are use to showering with a cloth remember to pack one otherwise the linens were ample breakfast was included and it was a lovely buffet style with lots of options definitely more than your average continental the hotel is located a short walk to many attractions shops and restaurants overall we had a great stay here and would definitely recommend the hotel to others and come back to visit,1
929,i stayed here for two nights whilst on business the single room is very spacious with a queen size bed and a typical hotel thick duvet the rooms have aircon you can control there plenty of space and even enough room at the table to work with a comfortable enough chair included there were a few nice little touches i liked about this hotel the standard shampoo shower gel and cap were there unless you asked for them i mean who actually uses them typically they get put on your bag in case you need them on another trip but never do breakfast was adequate with a reasonable choice plus there a bar that open until very late in case you arrive late and need s guinness now the bad i stayed in room this read almost over the top of a night club presumably on the thursday night the music was thumping until around i assume rooms to would be in the same position and maybe even to maybe the higher floors may be okay when i checked out and was asked if everything was okay i said the hotel was nice but before i could continue the receptionist said was it a bit noisy si this is something they are obviously aware of i will stay here again but will ensure its not in these rooms if it were for the noise i would mark this with stars if it were for being really nice i mark this,1
930,we wanted to be close to the city center and this location is excellent the hotel is fairly new and the staff was very attentive breakfast was good and the rooms were excellent and clean one can walk out the door and be in the middle of dublin restaurants and pubs are very close as were convenience stores for picking up snacks and drink the price was great for the location i highly recommend this hotel,1
933,the holiday inn express dublin city is a new well designed hotel with decent size modern rooms that have a safe full length mirror good tv and comfy bed fairly small bathroom but it has good counter space and a nice walk in shower very good breakfast and excellent service by the staff great location within an easy walk to temple bar and other areas of the city and with bus stops right outside the hotel for the dublin bus tour buses airport bus etc,1
934,everything about this hotel was fantastic the location was great extremely close to the point for the airport bus and an easy minute walk to the heart of the tourist area on the other side of the river our room was quiet with an extremely comfortable bed the breakfast was amazing lots of fresh fruit cereals breads hot food juices coffee etc and the staff was friendly i would most definitely stay here again if i ever back in dublin,1
935,we had a good stay at the holiday inn the room was comfortable and breakfast was okay the hotel is in a very good position for access to all the tourist attractions and has plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby,1
936,spend nights in the holiday inn express in the dublin city center in hotel is very good neat and the room was clean and we were lucky enough to have a nice view on a clear day the bed was big and comfortable as well as the bathroom maybe the toilet was a bit too high nothing was missing and we felt very personnel of the hotel was very friendly and always up to some the location was almost perfect very close to the city center but also a bit outside so as to avoid masses of people everything was walking of the highlights that deserves its own paragraph was the breakfast not only did it include a very large variety and could serve as brunch i was hungry until the evening but it had the additional novelty of being able to pack it into paper bags and take it with you this proved extremely helpful on the next day where we had to leave for a tour very early we stuffed some paper bags with stuff and covered our entire day in the hotel was a bit too expensive for our budget so i will keep an eye for special offers the next time we visit dublin,1
937,very convenient location in this easy to walk city wonderful breakfast buffet to start each day great bed and shower exceptional maid service the only disappointment was hangers and no other place for clothes,1
938,we did a tour of the uk along with edinburgh and london and stayed at hiex in all three locations this was our favorite centrally located clean great staff large room with room to move around loved the fact that not only was there ample room at the end of our beds to move around there was a little alcove with a narrow closet a safe and a table for things or your suitcase some reviews have complained about lack of space for putting things but our room had a that ran all along the window wall that we found was great for nearly everything we had we folded our clothes into neat piles and put our purchases there as well and used it to sit we are not travelers who need drawers in fact we prefer to not use drawers as things may be left behind easier to see it and pack it hooks on two walls for coats bathroom was huge the only complaint there was we could not figure out how to let the water out of the sink as we could not find a lever to open the drain took five minutes to understand one simply had to push on it to open or shut it eating area is clean and spacious options pretty much uk holiday inn ex standard eggs bacon beans cereals breads fruit beverages good enough to start the day area also clean and the whole place is modern desk staff are wonderful,1
939,new hotel in superb location close to bars shops and restaurants but not very friendly and helpful decor in rooms was very modern and tasteful with facilities in room excellent from kettle tea and coffee to iron and board loved floor to ceiling windows giving view of air conditioning a bonus especially in multi floored freshness of breakfast and variety especially being able to take away a bacon or sausage bap,1
940,overpriced but new holiday inn express in an excellent location in dublin very few vegetarian options at breakfast staff are very helpful and friendly though airport bus stops right outside the hotel very convenient,1
941,nice place to stay and start to my first trip to ireland parking was in front of the hotel fun pubs across the street for a short get the breakfast in the morning everything is fresh and really good,1
942,to penthouse suite lap of luxury this is a relatively new hotel with a good spacious hotel layout and modern interiors location in dublin is very good and the setting of the building on herbert park is especially reception staff and breakfast room staff are excellent,1
943,everyone very helpful rooms clean and neat could be better only minor thing was i thought breakfast at hotel a bit overpriced for what we wanted a light breakfast there are several nearby options for this though if you want light breakfast would definitely stay at herbert park again,1
944,wonderful check in experience and customer service great location excellent accommodations and services loved the irish whisky and bailey offering at for the parents food was excellent,1
945,this is a delightful hotel in dublin we enjoyed all the nearby pubs and parks the hotel is comfortable very clean and the staff goes out of their way to help in any way herbert park is right out the door and a great place to walk,1
946,after a very long day of travel from the states we arrived at herbert park at so ready for a shower and a good night sleep i booked us a room over a month prior with special notations of late arrival when we went to check in we were told that they sold our room subsequently we were being walked to another hotel that meant waiting for a cab and being transferred to a downtown hotel another hour at must say that the desk and hotel staff did everything they could to make us happy they opened the kitchen and cooked us a complimentary dinner while we waited and were extremely attentive we returned the next day to check into our room at the herbert park and meet family we were met with a bottle of champagne and a platter of delicious pastries and treats the staff did exactly what they needed to do to turn a disaster into a pleasant stay cudos to the staff and their hospitality,1
947,this hotel came just perfectly suitable for me the room was very comfortable and quiet the internet is fast and easily accessible no password and not limited by number of hotel is adjoining a huge public park that we enjoyed walking in the morning and late staff are genuinely friendly and helpful from front desk to the house keeping team the hotel is on direct route to most of the places and it wouldn t need more than one change to go to any other place in and restaurants coffee shops and groceries are within stone throw away from the hotel nespresso coffee machine in the room with varieties of coffee or tea much better than the kettle and optimally located,1
948,a wonderful clean hotel with a park located outside the hotel the amenities were very good breakfast was at a cost but well worth the fees the hotel staff was wonderful especially during breakfast the hotel has lots of little cafe shops within walking distance the hotel is located a distance away from the general bus pick up area taxi are available with very cordial drivers eager to know where you come from very safe neighborhood i recommend this property with an excellent rating,1
949,wonderful staff and great service wifi is free and as good as anywhere in dublin plenty of parking nespresso machines in the rooms business upgrade great value and the views over herbert park are spectacular not my first stay and wo be my last,1
950,truly one of the nicest and finest hotels we have stayed in can not find any negatives hotel staff and food all excellent highly recommend the herbert park for a relaxed and quiet stay and a very central location,1
951,everything was great the only issue i had was when i called to the restaurant i asked what was gluten free on the menu and he had a bit of trouble telling me when i asked a few specific things i feel he got a bit annoyed and said look just tell me what you want and i let you know if it gluten free with attitude i was prepared to order right at that moment and i felt that reaction was a little bit rude,1
952,we stayed at herbert park hotel for three nights at the end of our tour in ireland we enjoyed the stay you can walk to the center of dublin or you can take a bus which stops nearby the staff was very friendly and helpful,1
953,visited this hotel on a work trip i would definitely go again food was devine had bed breakfast and evening meal drinks on the pricey side service extremely good only downside for me is that as i was in a single room so had no coffee or tea making facilities as the room was to small they did state that i could ring reception and they would send a pot of to my room i did not take them up on this but did miss not being able to make some whenever i wanted would i stay again a resounding yes in fact i am in discussions with my husband about a trip for the two of us and if i can find a deal then we will stay at this hotel,1
954,i can not recommend this hotel highly enough everything was outstanding staff very friendly and attentive and couldnt do enough for us good location in a nice area rooms fantastic and really clean ca fault a single thing the park is only a stroll out of the door and is lovely for an early morning walk,1
955,we have not even stayed yet in the herbert park hotel and i must give a thumbs up for the reservation staff especially karen my hubs proposed to me in herbert park in when we were just years old we met when i was and he was herbert park was our park so to stay in herbert park hotel for a couple of nights years ago kids and baby grandchildren later means so much to us i rang just now to reservations karen and i was complicating the booking with special requests she was so kind and understanding she rang me back a short while ago with everything in place that is good service but more importantly i had a slight problem and she gave me the solution that is the ethos of customer relations excellent service i will have my second review after the weekend having actually stayed and hopefully enjoyed the food romancestillalive,1
956,ideal location close to parks excellent restaurants and a minute walk to grafton real find superb rooms professional staff my only gripe that because of the bh is was a little pricey,1
957,the herbert park hotel is a beautiful and relaxing hotel just outside the heart of dublin cityit has very professional staff both front of house and behind the scenes the only grievance i would have is the cleaning staff came in to our room at while myself and partner were asleep this took us by shock as we were away for a couples night,1

989,the hotel was quiet and relaxing the cleanliness and rooms were amazing staff were welcoming and could do enough for you the food was stunning a beautiful stay in dublin and definitely advise a stay at herbert park hotel,1
990,the hotel was very very nice the personnel was very friendly and the room was cosy the best thing is that the hotel is in a very nice area everything needed you can find in the room the beds are extremely comfortable,1
991,very good hotel with friendly and professional stuff always ready to help rooms are very clean and peaceful with excellent view at the park the restaurant and pubs offer are great in the neighbourhood,1
992,great location for dublin and a fair price for a let down by the wardrobes being too small for a seven night stay great breakfast room and staff jose and antonio in particular were very attentive in the restaurant where we had a lovely meal on our last night,1
994,this is the best hotel by far that we stayed in the hotel restaurant was amazing i had the best steak and french onion soup of my life the breakfast was wonderful and they had the best white pudding that we have experienced the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly we had a five star experience,1
995,nice hotel good location construction going on behind but was too loud the curtains did keep the sun out much really the only complaint i had a smaller room which was nice as well staff was friendly,1
996,have stayed at your hotel many times it very clean friendly and location is not too far out of dublin centre the food also i would highly recommend in bar and restaurant overall our experience has never been disappointing,1
997,i only stayed here for one night but found the hotel to be extremely comfortable huge rooms friendly staff and good value for money i would recommend thesis a base for exploring dublin i suppose it helped that one of my favourite restaurants was right around the corner,1
998,the building site kicked off quite early just below my room i appreciate in a city centre hotel residual noise is always going to be an issue but i think being woken at is asking a little too much apart from that great location staff and facilities all excellent,1
999,we had a wonderful stay at the herbert park with its main drawback for me being its location although it is a walkable distance away it probably about minutes from grafton street otherwise the room was clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful especially lara at reception,1
1000,fantastic hotel in great location next to the park room was lovely and great menu and food the service was outstanding big thank you to ante and dharam for excellent customer service and hosts for the hotel much appreciated and i will definitely stay again,1
1001,i often stayed at this hotel and always found it exemplary on this occasion we merely called in for a drink which is not really a reason for a review however the service and cordiality was wonderful and thus warrants this review in the past we have been extremely well attended to by siva but his absence was more than made up for by dharam and brian again well done herbert park great service as usual,1
1002,a beautiful very comfortable hotel very nicely located in dublin easy walking to restaurants shops bus stops etc the food was excellent especially loved the breakfast buffet each morning staff was friendly and very helpful,1
1003,i travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels that carry stars unfortunately in my opinion herbert park is at most when i moved into my there was silicone falling off in pieces above the mirror in the bathroom the wooden panel that covered the bottom of the tub was splitting and paint was chipping the pillows smelled in one of the hallways the wall phone was hanging by the wires etc i was moved immediately to a different which was little better but still faced the same issues i do have to give some credit to the staff everyone was friendly and the cleaning staff was superb all rooms need a face lift or a star needs to go,0
1004,we stayed at this hotel on the advise of a friend who lives in dublin we found it clean quiet and upscale the rooms were large and the housekeeping services were excellent we had one in the bar and the service was extremely slow but perhaps it was just an off night front desk staff was helpful this hotel is a bit of a ride from some of the dublin action but if you are looking for cleanliness and space this is a great option there are fun restaurants and bars nearby and a wonderful park,1
1005,the perfect hotel for a stay in dublin walking distance to everything with the added pleasure of herbert park the rooms are modern and immaculate they all have nespresso coffee machines for an amazing cup of coffee to start the day,1
1006,the facilities were excellent and the staff was friendly and efficient we felt welcomed from the time we arrived until we checked location was convenient for touring the city as we began our tour of ireland,1
1007,standard quality hotel for what is the reason to offer a standard business hotel for a price of a lux hotel if i want to sleep and to eat a hamburger and drink a beer i do not want to pay such kind of high price,0
1008,having stayed here before on business it was a natural choice to stay here again breakfast offering is great the rooms are lovely i even received a free upgrade to an executive room overlooking herbert park the staff are always happy to help and i can say with certainty that it makes for a great overall experience being in the ballsbridge area with a good offering of bars and restaurants nearby,1
1009,had the pleasure of staying in the herbert park this week following my relocation to dublin with work i have to say it is a fantastic hotel with lovely staff food and the bedroom exceeded my expectations my stay in the herbert park made the move to dublin easier so thank you for that,1
1010,lovely room excellent location very friendly and efficient staff breakfast superb enjoyed having thepark land beside the hotel where we had a stroll after dinner one minor improvement might be to have digital tv in the room to give wider choice of tv channels,1
1011,being a vegetarian there were less choices however when i requested an off menu vegetarian food the chef made me nice vegetarian fried choices of breakfast are also very good friendly staff at the front office and the restaurant ideal places for business travelers walkable to a variety of places nice park at the backyard free highspeed wifi keeps me well connnected,1
1012,my husband and i are regular visitors to the herbert park have reviewed the hotel positively on several occasions based on location value comfort and friendly staff this visit i want to pay tribute to foyer staff and dharam who over many visits have proven to be at all times professional and courteous but also go that extra mile which is warm and friendly could praise the staff highly enough,1
1013,location location location great location of the hotel the room was clean ca expect luxury it a business hotel but it one of the best on this next to it there is a wonderful park so if you have your kids whit you you can have some good time people was very friendly like most of the irish recommend,1
1014,i stayed for days in the herbert park hotel i totally enjoyed my stay my room was lovely and comfortable the coffee machine was a nice touch the staff were very professional and would recommend this hotel unreservedly,1
1015,i had a wonderfull stay in the herbert park hotel for weeks especially dharam and samer were the perfect hosts in the hotel bar were i enjoyed a drink every evening they can make really nice cocktails,1
1016,excellent hotel with friendly staff and clean environment the facility was great and i will definitely recommend this place to others i will definitely book to stay at the herbert park hotel again in my next trip,1
1017,i had a pleasant stay the service was super and the staffs were excellent the room was clean and of high standard i did have breakfast as i was only there for a night it was only minutes walk to rds,1
1018,perfect location nice clean room friendly efficient staff easy check in and check out upon check in they took my bag to the room as i had a meeting to go to nice breakfast very accommodating ideal hotel for my needs,1
1019,our family of traveled for vacation from the states rooms were very good size for european hotel rooms unfortunately we needed two rooms but this was not a large inconvenience as our children are and the staff was extremely helpful and made checking in and out very efficient car parking was very close only downside was the distance to downtown min walk to the nearest off bus stop we managed this several times but would have preferred to be a little closer however taxi service and local buses are very close hotel appears to be more intended as a business clientele vs families but was not a hindrance we noticed that other tour companies were present during our stay overall experience was very good,1
1020,lovely hotel and very helpful staff we enjoyed our stay very much the views over the park are beautiful and it is lovely to walk around we will definitely stay at the herbert park hotel again when we visit dublin on our next trip,1
1021,we stayed here for nights during a week trip clean room comfy bed and a decent sized bathroom the shower was a little difficult to get into with the height of the tub staff was awesome super friendly and helpful ate at the restaurant both mornings and it was good dinner was also good i would stay here again,1
1022,polished professional clean and good customer service i highly recommend a stay here if one is in dublin on business the location was a little far from the tourist locations the breakfast buffet was excellent the meeting rooms were a bit small for our group of,1
1023,i was in dublin for almost a month for business and decided to stay at the herbert because of it convenient location to be honest at first i was a bit concerned before arriving because some of the reviews were mediocre but i have to say i truly enjoyed my stay it a great hotel especially for a long stay when you spend this much time at a hotel you really get to know what they do well and what can be improved first the many positives about this hotel and friendly service this hotel service staff to include those at check in and the restaurant were simply outstanding helpful and knowledgeable about the city and sites to excellent location far from the maddening crowds a bit out of the crowded parts of the city but only a minute walk to all the main tourist spots also adjacent to a beautiful convenient informal lobby dining set up with comfy sofas and chairs perfect for the business traveler dining alone or with and spotless dining areas and restaurants all within a five minutes walknow for some areas for improvement and there were only a few that i saw a makeup mirror in the bathroom little more variety for the hot breakfast while there was always plenty of food i would suggest switching out the mcdonald style potatoes for real home guest bottom line i would highly recommend this hotel the employees take pride in this hotel and it shows,1
1024,this hotel was perfect for our stay mins walk from the city centre and mins from the aviva stadium it was also overlooking herbert park which was nice for a wander in the morning the staff were all really friendly and helpful and the facilities immaculate could not fault it at all and we will be back,1
1025,the facility was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful it was also in a very nice part of town not downtown but on the outskirts in a safe neighborhood i would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity,1
1026,first class experience each year when we visit location is fantastic for rds and there is always a very pleasing atmosphere about it whilst being treated like we are guests of the hotel food is excellent as well and staff so welcoming,1
1027,this is a gem of a hotel near the american embassy it is quiet unpretentious clean crisp and effortless everything is ergonomicically friendly great oasis in a bustling metropolis the nearby bistro roly was superb for any meal we ate four meals there,1
1028,stayed here for the liverpool football match in the experience great location room clean and tidy great shower and lovely late dinner in the bar area lovely fish and chips and seafood chowder and wheaten bread all in all good stay,1
1029,everything was perfect we enjoyed the friendly reception of cake and welcoming drink all the staff were very friendly and helpful we will definitely be back we have no complaints keep up the good work,1
1031,we stayed here on monday check in was friendly and professional and our executive room was clean bright spacious and super were heading on to galway the next day so we did want to venture far and decided on drinks at the hotel bar there was a nice selection of beer however cocktails are seriously overpriced for the standard they come i ordered a raspberry mojito was was nearly with barely any raspberry muddled through it and just tasted of rum and soda you can get drinks far better and much cheaper in the city we also realised there was no music playing which made for a really strange atmosphere as there was many people in the lounge so we could all hear each other decision was head to head over to the bridge bar across the road and it was great good drinks and good fun came back and we ordered a room service beef lasagne which was served really hot and tasted great the night porter was really helpful that the herbert served its purpose for us as a stop off point i would really recommend it to couples although i would to families and business user,1
1032,i would thoroughly recommend this hotel the staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful choice of food was excellent service was quick and food was piping hot the only downside was that i felt the car parking charges were much too high for residents,1
1033,we stayed in the hotel for just the one hotel is well situated close to the city centre we stay in the standard king room which is was a decent size with a large bed and over all very staff were very friendly and efficient check in and check out were very all we enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to book again,1
1034,just had nights in this lovely hotel for the rds show hotel was spotless service was excellent the food was good and the staff could not have been any more helpful and friendly the only slight down is the fact you get charged for parking your car a resident i do think car parking charges should apply that was the only flaw in an otherwise perfect stay,1
1035,just spent nights at this wonderful hotel and had adjoining rooms for adults and a child it leaning more towards a in my opinion great location with easy bus service to city the hotel is beautifully bright and spacious as you enter and overlooks a lovely terrace the attention to detail was superb beds were just so comfortable bed in one room and decent single beds in the other room the staff were fantastic service excellent great breakfast with fabulous variety of fruit cheeses and everything you could want we ate lunch and had dinner on evenings the food was wonderful really great stay and would be delighted to return i recommend this hotel highly,1
1036,we stayed just one night tues aug and despite a very busy hotel for the horse shoe next door all of the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly my husband and year old daughter had a wonderful breakfast and were looked after very well then lara and egle at the front desk made our day with wonderful homemade cupcakes i can certainly recommend how close it is to both ballsbridge pubs min and the city we walked in great visit,1
1037,excellent hotel location staff and rooms all top a little pricey but that dublin would recommend this hotel and will be back again staff extremely helpful friendly check in check out was seamless room was modern and clean,1
1038,staff were friendly and kind room was better than i expected which was a good surprise food was top notch lounge has that important feeling that many similar hotels lack in close proximity to the aviva stadium so really handy for match trips,1
1039,we had a great stay here from the moment we checked in until checkout the reception staff were so friendly and literally could do enough for us we were early for check in but they still found us a room despite ours not being ready it was no problem to order taxis or store our bags after departure nothing was a bother breakfast was fab with a great variety of buffett and cooked to order breakfasts breakfast was served with a great view of herbert park very scenic beds were really comfortable and the rooms had everything you would need the hotel is in a great location only minutes walk from aviva and a minute drive to city centre there are plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby yet it is a quieter area could fault anything about it and will definitely be back in the future,1
1040,our favourite dublin hotel nice welcome lovely room service in the bar very attentive we ate out that night but had a very enjoyable bar experience before we left and on our return a great relaxing atmosphere,1
1041,we booked this as a last minute deal through the hotel reservation staff and we were delighted with it fab hotel lovely friendly helpful staff could not fault it and we will definetly be returning,1
1042,we arrived and needed a quick check in as we were running late for a wedding the person behind the check in desk was the most efficient i ever seen had us checked in and a taxi outside for us in about minutes breakfast buffet was very nice on departure there was a taxi called for us and was outside in less than a in all an excellent stay and one that will be repeated,1
1043,stayed here a few times excellent hotel great location very friendly and helpfully staff very quite no outside noise whatsoever very helpful with early food is very good and lovely big seating area,1
1044,the herbert park hotel is a nice hotel with fine service and very helpfull staff good and clean rooms the hotel is situated in a nice part of dublin near the herbert park but a bit too far from dublin city center,1
1045,the hotel is close to the centre of dublin walk on a wonderful street very clean and nice ambience sounded from the beautiful park and water quiet for a good sleep we enjoyed the breakfast and the discreet attention of the personal,1
1046,stayed here as it was close to the aviva stadium i honestly could fault it will definitely stay again when i in dublin spotless food was great and staff very personal would highly recommend to anyone,1
1047,we loved the herbert park hotel it fab got a very welcoming feel to it are fantastic especially in the bar restaurant and very attentive room good barroom a little small and no full lenght mirror bit room very big and spotless look forward to returning,1
1048,everything was perfect except one tiny thing on arrival the woman checking us in could hardly crack a smile and was not polite or cheerful talking to us it put a downer on the buzz of finally arriving there was no are you all or was your trip here i stayed in star hotels who ask these questions with a smile they really go a long way to making you feel welcome at the i have to compliment the bar staff they could have been more helpful and nicer they the reason this review is stars,1
1049,stayed for one night lovely staff easy check in great location and comfy bed will definitely return and recommend this hotel perfect for a night or two in town and so handy for events in the rds,1
1050,we enjoy staying at the herbert park but we only want nights which from will no longer be offered so will not be able to stay there next year as there is a minimum of nights shame but we will not book again,1
1051,big hotel but lacks character its good has good facilities better for business trips really its a taxi ride to anywhere but this is really a problem and fairly inexpensive quiet hotel decent overlooks park if lucky or river which is being refurbished and the builders start early july close to aviva stadium short walk comfortable nespresso coffee machines in rooms good sized rooms can not really fault it except a bit pricey so has breakfast around the corner which was very good value the staff were all very helpful and friendly in fact we found everyone in dublin to be friendly and helpful we were lucky enough to have very good weather,1
1052,from the moment the door was opened for us at this beautiful hotel we had a great time our room was kept immaculate every day and bottled water supplied every staff in the bar and restaurant where courteous and we where early risers as we where staying because of the horse show so was able to talk to some cleaners again the staff where courteous and a credit to the the front of house staff where very polite and informative making sure we had everything we needed when booking in we where given cupcakes and a small shot of bailey such a nice gesture i thought the concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable overall the perfect hotel you most certainly get what you pay for here we have stayed here a few times before and most definitely will be back obviously we have a manager here at this hotel who certainly keeps finger on the pulse with an excellent team of people behind i must say also is all the staff here have a lovely smile on their face which says a lot keep up the good work and service,1
1053,this hotel is perfect for dublin horse show and any other event in ballsbridge the staff are some of the best anywhere it is spacious and comfortably contemporary rather than austere the rooms are well appointed but the beds could be softer we enjoyed our stay as always,1
1054,a wonderful hotel adjacent to the rds horse show food is great and reasonably priced in the very relaxing bar staff very friendly i have stayed at this hotel years and will continue to do so if,1
1056,i have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was managed by a different company and enjoyed many happy and successful stays over the years i had been to dublin for a couple of years so had some reservations about what i might find on my return now that intercontinental have taken it over what i found was it still a great property with some of the original staff still working there some aesthetic changes decor and updates like improved wifi and still relatively generously proportioned room sizes the location works really well for me as it close to the city centre but still far enough away to enjoy the beautiful scenery in that neighborhood there are some small issues to work on and improve but the staff that i worked with were very friendly pleasant and efficient and they took my feedback and acted on it so i and my group left as very happy customers who are likely to return there a great running circuit that takes you along the beach of dublin bay and through the local neighborhood with its diverse and impressive properties so if you enjoy a run this is a great hotel for you there are nice shops bars and restaurants nearby so i really like staying here i did eat in the restaurant but i heard good reports from my colleagues and the staff always went the extra mile so i have no hesitation in recommending this hotel great work team,1
1057,we stayed at the intercontinental dublin for two nights the room was comfortable spacious and luxurious service was impeccable our room was ready i think they just needed to put the rollaway bed in for my daughter it was maybe a minute wait at most so we were given a drink on the house in the lounge little touches like this really make the difference loved the pool and spa on a side note the train station is a minute walk and you can take the train into the city centre short walk from station and other locations we chose to take the train to the lovely fishing village of howth which offered great hiking with amazing views,1
1058,stayed a few nights while attending a conference held in the hotel nice common areas and generally spacious well appointed rooms somewhat outside the city centre which in theory did not matter in this case however continuous drizzling rain and cold wind did not encourage venturing out pleasant and friendly attitude notwithstanding it took over min for the reception staff to find my reservation not sure if the fault was with the event organisers or otherwise service in the lounge area could be slow and spotty the spa seemed very popular with no availability for certain treatments without a reservation booked well in advance,1
1059,we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel i am ambassador member and we were upgraded to junior suite the room was available from as we arrived early the staff were very friendly and efficient the public areas are so elegant and comfortable especially the whisky bar and very spacious all the furniture and flower arrangements all so tastefully chosen breakfasts offered plenty of choice including the omelette station the indoor swimming pool was a good size recommend to go after when it tends to be quiet i would say that the room rates are expensive much more so than say frankfurt which is also centrally located this hotel is a fair way out of the city centre a good minutes walk to trinity college otherwise there is a reliable and frequent bus service in to the city,1
1060,stayed room plenty of quietest hotel stay once heard a sound from the rooms on either side or the food in the bar both nights which was very good quality with enough choice for all of choice at breakfast,1
1061,i had a very short stay here and it was appreciate that it is not downtown the train station is a minute walk it will take about minutes or so to get to down town or it is a minute walk to temple normally do not really like the soft beds however here i did not want to get out of it was cold enough and colder than a lot of hotels in europe thank amenities were nice gym set up with a good variety of equipment to get a good work out also have a set up which i did not was good not fantastic and reasonably service from all short great stay repeatable,1
1062,we loved our stay at this hotel the property was amazing the food was fantastic the staff was beyond helpful housekeeping accidentally removed my wife personal pillow they went above and beyond to return it clean and pressed the only issue was our bed there was a huge hump in the middle of our king sized mattress so my wife and i could not sleep next to each other i asked the front desk and housekeeping to look into the matter on separate days and they both promised to look into it but it never was resolved and no followed up regarding it other than that issue we had a fantastic stay,1
1063,very clean and spacious hotel with great facilities definitely try the spa rooms have great beds and are very well equipped and impressive the restaurant offers great food to suit most tastes we both enjoyed dinner and breakfast was a real treat this hotel is in a great location and is always good for celebrity spotting if that of interest great staff especially syeed and nicky logue gm a real pleasure to meet them both they make you feel very welcome,1
1064,stayed for nights for a mixed business and weekend break the hotel has a great feel and on first impressions at the front desk are very professional the rooms are of excellent quality you have everything you need my problem with the hotel is it falls down with very sloppy service we ordered room service on two occasions and it did arrive when you called to question the line was constantly busy breakfast was dysfunctional it took forever for the staff to take your order and when they did on two days running the wrong order was eventually delivered upon check out i was presented with a bill for euros very expensive i was asked if everything was ok i clearly said no and was promised a call back from the manager a week later i still waiting i posted a review on the ihg website where the hotel has an excellent score of out of my review was blocked do stay unless you want an expensive hotel with sloppy service,0
1065,this was the perfect stay for our last night in ireland before flying home the next morning the staff was very attentive and friendly our suite was beautiful spacious comfortable we especially loved opening the balcony doors it truly is an incredible also accessed both the gym and tub and both were lobby bar was bustling but the servers handled it very well and we felt that our service was very attentive even though they were busy the food was excellent i ca say enough about this place i highly recommend it for a retreat while in dublin,1
1066,this hotel deserves a for its excellent customer service overall ambience and a perfect meeting place for a conference the buffet breakfast was a treat with its offerings of an omelette made to your owns specifications lovely fresh fruit veggies and pastries it was a great beginning for each day we were there i ready for a return trip,1
1067,stayed here for one night during a short trip to dublin good location just a short taxi journey from the city centre staff were kind and welcoming and the hotel itself is just stunning beautiful rooms which are immaculately kept and breakfast had everything you could ask for including yummie pancakes i only wish we could have stayed longer,1
1068,clean and spacious food was very service was like swimming pool suana and steam room was very is located in nice neighborhood and within reach to all main tourist attraction,1
1069,stayed one night recently in this elegant property treated like royalty at check in had booked an executive suite with separate living area quite spacious and lovely views of the gardens we dined in the lobby lounge and both the food and service were excellent likewise at breakfast great buffet in a beautiful dining space loved the antiques and ornaments located in the public areas especially the turtles,1
1070,just got back from two nights at intercontinental dublin we had a wonderful stay friendly staff great irish breakfast and very comfortable beds i highly recommend this hotel although it is a bit far from the city center but it worth the distance the area is plush beautiful and very safe thank you intercontinental for making our stay a memorable one,1
1071,from the moment you step over the threshold you know you are in a special place a place of luxury a place of impeccable service a place of tranquility i thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at the intercontinental no request is too much the food and service could not be any better nicky logue and his team do a wonderful job of making you feel welcome and spoiling you i will be back thank you,1
1072,lovely hotel which used to be the four seasons great breakfast well designed room with high quality bed not that convenient to centre city but still easily accessible to centre and airport decent wifi cordial knowledgeable staff,1
1073,we just stayed here this past week while attending a conference and overall enjoyed our stay the hotel public areas and rooms are immaculate very professional yet friendly service enjoyable full breakfast buffet that is included in the price of the room there were a couple of issues that kept me from giving it a rating of especially when factoring in the cost of staying at this property i was surprised by the lack of sound proofing between rooms we could clearly hear everything the occupant in the adjoining room was saying as if he was in our room he was on the phone talking at a normal volume for me when traveling location is key because of the conference held at the hotel it made sense to stay here and if you are in dublin for business then staying out in ballsbridge might be just fine however as a tourist i would prefer to be in the city centre where everything of interest is to be found it about a min taxi ride into town and would cost between euro there is a city bus that stops nearby on the main road which was very convenient bus or takes you into the center of town at a cost of there is also a dart commuter train about a min walk away,1
1074,great hotel service in resterant and bar was slow but friendly my daughters and myself enjoyed the area rooms and amenities were excellent in a great area and on the tour bus route easy to get any where in the city would recommend hotel and hope to return someday,1
1075,while i only got to stay there one night it was really nice the location is only a few minutes away from downtown and the hotel staff and accommodations were very nice from the time we pulled up the bell hops were friendly and helpful the front desk greeted us with a smile and hello the room was more spacious than most european hotels and it was clean and functional,1
1077,i stayed here recently for nights and had a brilliant hotel staff were so friendly and helpful with recommendations etc the rooms are amazing and the beds are so comfy could not fault anything with the stay and this is definitely my choice when i am in dublin thank you to all the team at the intercontinental,1
1078,i stayed at the ic dublin three times and it just keeps getting better and it was excellent to begin with the service is outstanding helpful friendly good humored i would stay anywhere else in dublin plus the location is great lots of good restaurants in walking distance it a short cab ride into the heart of the city,1
1079,myself and my fiancé were warmly welcomed yesterday to a fantastic afternoon tea experience with a twist to celebrate our recent engagement we both chose the crafted g t cocktail which was served in a teapot accompanied by garnishes of apple cucumber and a delicious ginger sugar syrup to start the presentation was just what you expect from a hotel it was much more than that with twists on all the classics adding character and giving the elegant afternoon tea a shake up and a refreshing relevance the classic ham cheese was served on tomato bread and topped with goats cheese cucumber the pork belly was phenomenal there was a caesar taco which both looked and tasted fantastic but the showstopper came in the form of a foie gras white chocolate lollipop which was a taste a must try before you die kinda thing sweet treats were equally as impressive with a selection of strawberry eclairs salted caramel macaroons and ginger meringue cones but the gin infused panna cotta was the talking piece served with tonic foam and cucumber caviar it took real will power not to lick the bowl as an overall experience ca recommend it enough the manager nicky who took the time to congratulate us in person and offer us complimentary prosecco and his team are doing a fantastic job our server gabor could not do enough for us he made us feel so special and really topped off what was an amazing experience overall,1
1080,if you okay not staying in city center this is a fantastic property very large beautifully appointed rooms excellent service and food and a beautiful pool and workout facility would stay again,1
1081,returned to dublin for a quick business leisure trip and once again the intercontinental was a great place to stay the hotel is bright airy and spotless and is classy without ever being or uptight the rooms are lovely with great linens and toiletries wifi is good pool is great bar is small but good and the good weather meant we enjoyed drinks outside and the restaurant has recently revamped its breakfast offering which was already really good staff all seem friendly and open huge shout out to the lovely lady who greeted us for breakfast,1
1082,i was for one night in the gibson hotel i expected to arrive late and sleep well before i check out in the next morning i had a nice relaxing sleep a good breakfast in the morning and a very quick check out gibson hotel meets my expectations,1
1083,i had a wonderful stay at the gibson hotel recently the room was superb and the staff were ever so helpful in particular i would like to mention clare who went out of her way to make sure i was happy with everything it will stand out in my memory as a great break the hotel is edgy and quirky and has that extra factor,1
1084,we stayed here during part of two week trip through ireland london and scotland first of all the location was terrible even though the tram is right outside the hotel you are as far away from the attractions as you can get also the entire area is under construction and felt very unsafe the room was also a let down it was small outdated and the curtains were not even attached to the rod so we were not able to close them we were put in a room with two twin beds and our daughter had to sleep on a bed all were extremely uncomfortable not that we were sleeping anyway but it was extremely loud on our second night the hotel hosted some sort of party that kept us and several other guests up until after when we called to complain we were told they would shut the doors but that never basically stayed out exploring as long as possible to not have to return to our room although we did not like our hotel we did love the people of dublin,0
1085,we stayed for a night to take in the sights of dublin and be near to the airport the hotel is situated by the cruise dock at the point the next stop down from spencer dock in the dock quarter the team terminates at the point so you can use the tram or have a good walk along the river liffy on a sunny day there are also city bicycles to hire along the liffy promenade the gibson hotel stay was on the floor and overlooked an inner garden at present there is a lot of development happening in the port which is exciting for the city but can be noisy ask for an inner room and high floor and you will sleep like a baby the decor service facilities both hotel public areas and room and the all important bed was five star and super modern the breakfast is buffet and provides for healthy and gluten free and out was excellent the staff are very well trained and so is a special hotel rate for guests parking overnight so do take advantage of and quirky the gibson is a must go to destination for dublin city,1
1086,great hotel quirky décor friendly helpful staff great place to stay for a concert at especially if you queuing all day starbucks next door for coffee can go back to your room for a snooze a snack or a loo trip perfect then after the show a quick stumble back to your room also the tram stop is literally at your door,1
1087,i visited the gibson a few times when in dublin mainly for conferences and events but no experience of actually being a guest at the to get a week here recently and it did disappoint given i stayed in a few dublin hotels over the past year staff are very friendly and welcoming on arrival rooms are very nice and airy you can see where money has been spent and i told further improvements refurb will take place in the foreseeable does show this hotel means business and does forget about its clients to ensure the best surroundings during their the hotel is right near the port and there a lot of development work going on but i did hear any building work during my stay hence the double glazing works distance not a problem as the tram can take you into the city as there the final stop outside the hotel it only a ride to st,1
1088,we stayed at the hotel to go to the man u match it was so handy to get to the match the hotel was lovely staff so friendly we had a lovely time enjoyed would go backthe food was lovely breakfast was very good staff helpful room was lovely we really enjoyed our stayruth wood,1
1089,the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,1
1090,my husband and i chose to take an express shuttle from the airport to the hotel because we arrived at about am we found the express shuttle paid for the tickets at a kiosk stepped right onto the shuttle amazing luck stood for the minute ride and got off across the street from the hotel the longest part was not wanting to jay walk as our first act in another country so we walked up across and down to the hotel entrance when we arrived our rooms were ready amazing luck we showered and took a nap for an hour or two then hit the town running while we were there we saw a historical recreation ship moored very close to the hotel and the river walk had a festival the hotel had flowers in the lobby so you could take on and brighten your room and free wifi they also had a fake sheep reading a newspaper full of his one review said it not in the city center we had a great time and it a few blocks from the green line bus tour we had dinner at a restaurant that we could see from our hotel room i would stay there again,1
1091,my wife and stayed for six nights and enjoyed every minute the hotel is modern beautiful and best of all the staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful being right at a luas tram stop makes the location very convenient to desired locations we would definitely stay here again next time in dublin,1
1092,this is a lovely hotel and it customer service was exceptional after having my us passport stolen the staff were so kind and accommodating that i could not have asked for more in particular keith garreth lorraine ivo were amazing they helped me negotiate the embassy the police the taxi and all the other details when i was pretty stressed i am deeply grateful and highly impressed with the level of customer service they demonstrated i did not encounter a staff person at the gibson who was not terrific,1
1093,lovely hotel with a balcony very clean and spacious hotel staff were very friendly and could do enough for you hotel had special touches like fruit on the table near lifts bon bond available as you check out handy maps so we could walk to croke park for concert there is a few eating places near by and cafes the lias is right out side the front door which was a bonus if you wanted to save your legs big car park right on the door step too dependant what side you stay our view was of the train line and a building site which was fine for us as it was the weekend and very quiet however in the week could be louder overall happy with our stay and an ideal location,1
1094,stayed for two nights to attend a concert in dublin our stay was fabulous from start to finish on arrival claire a trainee receptionist checked us in she could have been more helpful from giving us a map recommendations and explaining the luas to us our room was great everything from air con to the fridge and rooftop balcony the location was great as the luas is great value and will take you straight into abbey street for under already looking for another excuse to visit dublin so that i can stay again thank you gibson,1
1095,excellent hotel rooms fairly basic but good facilities in room and bed very large and comfortable lots of channels on television a little out of town but very well connected with tram station at door so access to city centre is mins tram or mins walkbreakfast very good and service excellent,1
1096,stayed for night in july with husband daughter check in was very fast and receptionist was so nice and helpful room was really big and spacious it is in a convenient place as the luas is right outside the door breakfast was very nice overall it was a great place and wld recommend and stay again,1
1098,i stayed here for two nights on business from the airport this hotel is very quick and easy to get to by using the airlink express bus from outside either terminal of dublin airport the bus stops a short walk away from the hotel entrance the whole style and atmosphere of the hotel is very modern in comparison to others in the area check in was quick and hassle free my room was minimalist but very bright and airy as well as being exceptionally clean two free bottles of water were provided as well as a decent hairdryer ironing board and iron two things i have found to be rare in other dublin hotels i did use the restaurant or bar but the choice available on the menu in the room looked great the only negative i would have is that there was one mirror in the room next to the door and there were no sockets close enough to be able to plug the hairdryer in and be able to get close enough to the mirror to use it at the same time,1
1099,we stayed for nights in july to see at croke suited what we wanted mins cab ride from the airport easy walk to town or take the tram or jump in a cab well positioned for croke park or lansdowne rd and very close to the point and the a very modern quirky spacious hotel very well clean and tidy the foyer has a pig and sheep reception staff on check in were very good in fact all the staff were helpful and friendly are flowers to take to your room from the lobby sweets to nibble on and apples on the way to your room and a soundtrack around the hotel all great room was spacious comfortable very large bed and a great bathroom with huge very good all you could want a very minor moan the toaster is not very the balcony to sit out on with a drink in the all like the fact it was a quiet hotel area if you want buzzy it not for you we had had a buzzy weekend in town so it was ideal for us to come back to quiet comfortable see other reviewers have complained about the building works going on well we did hear any disturbances friday or saturday the whole quay area is being regenerated which nothing to do with hotel and is good to see it an up and coming would all stay at the gibson again,1
1100,stayed here the night of the concert in it a great location for any events in croke park fantastic experience from check to departure rooms are compact but very nicely decorated with lovely bathrooms nice bathroom products provided and no problem getting extra i would have liked slippers but these are included for standard rooms newspaper was complimentary next is extra but not overpriced for a city centre location breakfast was tasty and a good selection of hot and cold is a lovely modern hotel with spacious lobby and bar there are lots of floors so possibly not very suitable for elderly or staff were excellent at all top marks for customer hotel is in my opinion great value for its location and all it has to offer,1
1101,the plusses great location for the arena handy for the airport and the luas the stop is just outside great rooms a good restaurant good bar and a good breakfast staff were very friendly though i found that getting things done took longer than expected the minuses the port area is surrounded by construction which means that at some point this looks likely to become a buzzing area but at the moment it is a minute walk to the grand canal street area with its great restaurants and cafés and longer to the city centre the walk did bother me as i happened to be staying during a week of fine weather but i would be keen to be so far out of the centre in rain or cold moreover taxis seemed to have a problem both picking up from the hotel and dropping off in front we kept getting dropped off a few minutes walk away which i did appreciate late at night also the floors dedicated to rooms are a maze i had friends staying on the floor below me and searching for their room the first time was an experience for us i were in town specifically for the arena i would probably stay somewhere more central but for those needing to be in this area the gibson is a very fine choice,1
1102,modern chic boutique hotel with clean lines and at pier point so with the tram just outside the hotel reduced price parking and within an arena of cinema complex shops and entertainment yet pretty close by tram to the city adequate internal restaurant somewhat lacking but lots very close by,1
1104,stayed here for convenience to as i was going to a concert if i was just coming to visit dublin i would stay here it out of town although a taxi is only feels very isolated no restaurants pubs etc next to it the hotel itself is a very modern design nice enough executive rooms with a balcony are very disappointing overlook a construction site noisy too superior double rooms feel a bit claustrophobic windows do open i had a family room which was very nice with opening windows overlooking inner courtyard so very quiet would definitely recommend this rather than balcony rooms or river view rooms the river view is rubbish bed was comfortable good hairdryer iron etc complimentary which was a bit disappointing the dull lacks atmosphere and boring background music played the same it seems each night strange menu mix of asian food etc after the concert the public bar closed by we were told to move to residents bar again very dull boring at over per night i ca recommend this hotel,0
1105,lovely clean quiet safe hotel right next to the hotel making training to downtown dublin easy good beds pillows and outlets for charging electronics in the rooms great shower roomy and nice bar is fine and so is the restaurant and breakfast free in room staff is extremely helpful and polite as a year flight attendant i have stayed in many hotels and the gibson is excellent,1
1106,came here for night during a business trip and had a decent stay had bad luck to be overlooking the construction next door which detracted from the view but i did really spend much time in the room so it did matter the room itself was clean and decent and i opted to have breakfast in the dining room which was convenient plus good note this is a separate charge so you have to request it upon great thing about this hotel is that the luas is right outside the front door i hopped on and within minutes i was near temple bar shame about the rain but dublin is a great little city and i really enjoyed walking around note that although it called gibson and plays up the musical angle think gibson guitars most of the official logos feature a fender guitar headstock just sayin,1
1107,the rooms are very clean and the bed are very comfortable the food is beautiful in the bar or restaurant the staff are very friendly and ca do enough it very child friendly and with the luas just outside easy access to city centre,1
1108,new exciting lunch menu when i visited today service much improved on last visit very pleasant meal food was nice overall very happy with experience good selection of sandwiches and mains to choose from suitable for all tastes with the seating arrangement it an excellent venue for discussing business during the day,1
1109,my partner and i booked this hotel for a last minute trip and were so surprised at the quality and location of the hotel since our first trip we have returned and will continue to use this hotel for our travels to dublin in the future the staff are very accommodating and down to earth as well as rooms are very modern with a comfortable bed and amazing shower i have no faults about this hotel each time i stay it amazes me and i look forward to returning,1
1110,we stayed here for the coldplay concert we were very happy with our stay from start to had a great welcome check in was easy our family room was adequate for adults the bar staff were very friendly and could have done more for us at the end of the evening we had a visit from the local farm animals the resident reception sheep served a great pint of guinness lol great hotel we certainly be back,1
1111,we stayed here for six days our room was spacious and facilities were outstanding friendly staff were very helpful the tram terminus was outside the hotel one could get to street in ten minutes breakfast was above average with a wide spectrum of food on offer an excellent selection of fresh fruit on offer too we had one dinner during our stay which was appetising mdrink was reasonably priced hotel staff made our stay will definitely come again radiohead were quite magnificent too,1
1112,we had a fantastic stay at the gibson the location is great because there is a tram stop right outside the hotel which takes you right into dublin city centre or many other stops the room was beautiful and the staff were always willing to help out with any of my questions about dublin i highly recommend this hotel,1
1113,this hotel is located in an up and coming area that will be really busy in a couple years the hotel just got here first and is located outside central dublin hotel is ultra modern and meticulously clean we arrived here early prior to a structured tour we are not sorry we stayed here despite other reviews we did not notice any construction noise they have a bar and restaurant which have items moderately priced the good point is that the dublin light rail system literally is at the front door this makes it easy to go into central dublin for meals and attractions rooms are especially large with lots of room to spread out and not trip over everything,1
1114,my husband and i just spent three nights at the gibson we were very pleased with all aspects of the hotel including decore cleanliness and comfort all staff are helpful and there are various aspects that give the hotel an extra touch of class such as fresh apples by the elevators and beautiful roses in the lobby to take to your room there is a tram stop outside but we preferred walking to the center,1
1115,excellent food and service only issue was the bar service was slow not enough staff after a concert in the arena meant long queues rooms are large and very comfortable with excellent facilities overall all staff were very friendly and efficient food was of a high quality particularly breakfast location and facilities were great too luas stops right outside for easy access to city centre recommended,1
1117,we stayed last weekend i had notified by email that it was a special occasion on arrival we had the lovely surprise of being upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic with doors opening onto a terrace area a large bathroom and lounge area also then we had a treat delivered to our room with a note wishing us a happy anniversary was a brilliant start to our weekend and everything in the hotel was fabulous from room food staff luas just outside the door to the reservations team and all the hotel staff for making our stay extra special we will certainly return for another stay ken,1
1118,we stayed for nights to attend the hotel is modern and very nice the room is very clean and spacious with comfy bed and all necessary stuff fridge iron ironing board kettle etc breakfast is excellent with plenty of warm and cold dishes pastries staff is very professional and helpful i like to acknowledge the receptionists pyotr and patryk and the breakfast room waiters sheenagh zuzanna andrea and hotel is located within minute bus trip from the airport airlink the stop is just next to the hotel tram luas stop is just next to hotel entrance you can get to the city center within minutes by tram,1
1119,visited for one night at the last minute and we were delighted we did the check in was quick and efficient i do know the girls name but she is very good at her job she was a dark haired girl and she was there when we checked in on the august in the evening and also when we checked out on the she was so helpful to all the guests i saw her speaking to the location is away from the city centre but it is easily accessible by taxi bus and the luas and you can walk it in about minutes to o connell street the rooms are gorgeous so well laid out and relaxing with water provided and large showers and fluffy towels the thai food was delicious in the bar we did have breakfast so i ca comment on this we had a wonderful stay highly recommend it is a really stylish and beautifully laid out hotel with an outside terrace,1
1120,i booked this hotel last minute as surprise and it did not have wanted to stay here since it open on arrival parking was so handy and the easy access to the hotel was just in was super fast staff were so polite welcoming and helpful even offered to carry my luggage to my room for room was beautiful light bright and airy lovely touch was the over the docks bed was very comfortable and bathroom was spacious with a rain stop is right outside the door and is less than euro to street return and takes less than dined in the restaurant which was lovely breakfast is served in the same place the next is a buffet and it was fresh and plentyful,1
1121,great hotel so clean and modern we had an amazing stay but the one thing that made our stay even better was the staff the man on reception was so pleasent and explained everything perfectly to us in such a friendly manor also all bar staff could not have done more for us and they were so friendly and chatty the athmosphere was so good we will be back to stay here and would reccommend this hotel to all my friends,1
1122,booked to stay for one night as we were in dublin to attend the liverpool match in the aviva stadium fantastic hotel with gorgeous massive rooms staff were all very friendly and helpful buffet breakfast the next morning was very tasty and plenty to choose from luas stop right outside the hotel was so good for getting about will definitely book again on our next visit to dublin,1
1123,we stayed here for one night in june the location is great on a very quaint street across from a small park it removed enough to be quiet with some nice pubs around the corner but a close enough walk to the center of town as to not feel isolated definitely has a boutique feel the entire staff was great breakfast was excellent the bar area is really charming as is the dining area the whole premises have a great rooms at least ours felt like it could have used a bit updating we had it did seem to match the quality of the rest of the property or some of the pictures of nicer looking rooms we saw online but we were only staying the one night and i sure they have nicer rooms on the premises this would be the one mark against it the room we had did seem to match the rest of the experience especially for the price all in all though seems a nice hotel and a solid choice when in dublin,1
1124,extremely noisy unable to sleep in the new part of the hotel due to a bar that stays open until that the hotel do not own staff very polite service exceptional shame you just can not sleep in the building no decent water pressure in shower towels are not like the thin type dinner old part of hotel do seem star and were the extension that seems to be poor the shame is the staff seem to know of the issues and so were unreservedly apologetic the cab drivers know about this place problems the senior management should not be selling rooms near the bar unless warning people or heavily should not be charging for these rooms,0
1125,stellar i loved this hotel soup to nuts impeccable service resources traveling alone so this was especially appreciated on a multitude of levels accessibility to all things dublin hotel resturaunt had fabulous food i would go back and stay at the dylan in a heartbeat,1
1126,we stayed at the dylan hotel for the staff is simply great kind and very friendly the rooms are greatly had the chance to enjoy the bar before concert and the drinks are very recommend this hotel,1
1128,we stayed here for one night for the concert the staff are wonderful so friendly and helpful we ate in the bar before the concert and the food was beautiful the hotel have a valet parking service they also organised our taxi to the concert for us the room was lovely and very quiet with a very comfortable bed and pillows we ate brunch on the outdoor terrace before we left on the sunday and again the food and service were wonderful would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again,1
1129,we stayed here on the first night of a week long tour of ireland and were not disappointing what a service super friendly staff great food and super well decorated hotel and rooms they are also a pet friendly hotel short walk to the city centre and a very nice area to spend the night at,1
1130,i stayed here for one night to attend a concert in dublin we had a package that included valet parking no other parking on site and breakfast the hotel is lovely located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance i love this part of dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre we were greeted at the door and check in was friendly efficient and exemplary the valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when i realized i had left them in the car great service the hotel itself is not overlarge but is welcoming with cool décor every staff member we passed greeted us the room was big with superking bed king for us travelers style interior design quiet and sumptuous the bed was really comfy so much so that i checked out the brand of mattress so i can buy one for home we had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles we also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience the breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites it was great i will definitely check out his hotel every time i get back to dublin and hope i get to stay,1
1131,not much to add to my previous reviews great location friendly staff and the building has charm and you like your hotel to be ultra modern and corporate then it probably not the place for if you want a hotel which reflects something of the character of the city you are staying in then you will love room was a bit warm at times but that is a problem all over ireland and the where hot weather is the exception rather than the rule so we do tend to do air are a short walk from all the city centre attractions which makes it an ideal choice if you exploring on foot,1
1132,we stayed at this hotel at the end of our ireland vacation this summer it was a great hotel very clean comfortable with impeccable were both really impressed with the lobby interior of the rooms the hotel is very only two things we encountered parking is at a garage behind the hotel it is validated however i would have felt safe walking over there alone after dark something to keep in mind if you are planning on moving your car or leaving during the hotel is dead prior to it was almost creepy we woke up at for breakfast but it was served until there was literally nobody around no guests or employees i found it strange for a full service hote,1
1133,staff were very welcoming rooms were clean and larger than expected even though we were just on the edge of the city the room was quiet breakfast was excellent a great place to stay for a visit to dublin,1
1135,first of all the hotel itself is beautiful very classic charming the staff could not be better very warm helpful and efficient that being said our room did not have ac and it was the tiniest room i ever remember staying in morning breakfast was exceptionally good and again great service although not having ac in an unusually warm july was rough the location was good and we really enjoyed our stay and i would recommend the hotel patty patrick and robert were very helpful and really made our stay memorable,1
1136,buswells hotel is a classic georgian style hotel that has excellent service while the hotel is close to a host of touristy attractions it is off the beaten path and a quiet place to stay the excellent breakfast is more than enough to fortify you for a full day of sight seeing would stay here again anytime we visit dublin,1
1137,we last stayed at buswell in december of and were curious to see if a change of season and level of tourism would make a difference it did the stay was a good as the first we like the kind of quirky charm of the building and rooms but this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel it is a period place that is modernized but not modern for people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms a picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation you can see that tbuswell is made up of several old buildings joined together and the rooms do line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay not every room is accessible at buswell the location really is ideal the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along kildare street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at stephen green everything in the city center is a few minute walk room was ready when we arrived at about pm and the manager very graciously bought,1
1138,i stayed here for in july with my two teenaged kids we were in room which was a corner unit with a double bed and a single bed it was a great size very clean and very comfortable the staff was lovely and very helpful and accommodating we added the breakfast to our stay and it was well worth it the food was fresh and delicious and the wait staff was super friendly and accommodating i also really liked the location of the hotel because it is close to shopping and attractions it is across the street from the national museum of ireland it is across the street from the national library of ireland it is a couple of blocks from trinity college it is a block from stephen green it is a minute walk to the dart and the aircoach from dublin airport drops you at the corner of the hotel and picks you up a block away i would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1139,this was our first trip to dublin and my wife and i were very happy with our hotel location was nice very close to stephen park grafton street the national gallery and archaeology museum and trinity college temple bar the city centre bus station and other attractions were all very manageable walks also you are on a main road so the outside noise level was quite good for being in the wife and i love classic hotels and this one did not disappoint the lobby was very attractive and the room was nice we had the triple room it was clean and the bed was comfortable it had plenty of room for the two of us free water was a nice touch there was some outside noise but nothing unexpected for being in a city except perhaps the seagulls room amenities were nice and the bathroom was quite was fine we did try the restaurant or bar at any time the service was our first trip to ireland i do have a lot of experience with pricing but this seemed comparable to other hotels in the city and seemed like a good value for the location and room quality,1
1140,we have stayed here many times over the years to us busswells is less like a hotel and more like a home we are writing this comment because we would like ohter travelers to be aware of the possibility of a friendly experience friendly is the word we would use for this hotel does not have the grandeur or modernity or in some cases the spsciousness of other places although it does have a provocative history has great people no number of stars can equal that,1
1141,this was my visit over the last several years it such a wonderful place to stay great charm character lovely friendly staff and a great breakfast too quiet location but minutes from all the great nightlife of dublin my room this time was a little small never a problem before but saying that so very comfortable spotlessly clean and lovely comfy bed great bar to relax either before or after an evening out alway look forward to my next visit perfect place for dublin,1
1142,we had a pleasant night stay in buswells i booked a small double room and it is small limited space around the bed and no seating it has been remodeled and has modern amenities the wifi worked well the bathroom has a long shower room and a rain shower with good water pressure and hot water supply however there was no place to put the shampoo and shower gel other than the floor plenty of towels were supplied but there were no towel bed is comfortable and we slept well there was no air conditioning and it was hot during our stay the provided fan helped circulate the air opening the window cooled the room comfortably but also let in road noise so i had to wear earplugs to breakfast included a buffet with a selection of breads cheese jams natural yogurt fruit fresh and dried and hot breakfast the coffee was good the rooms are not on the same level and you have to go up and down some steps after getting out of the lift to get to some rooms if you have trouble with stairs best to talk to reservations to select a room the hotel is well located a minute walk from the museum of archeology and close to grafton street we would happily stay there again,1
1143,the lobby of the hotel was promising but the hallways were awful the lighting was terrible an annoying fluorescent lighting that hard to describe when my wife and i got to the room there were twin beds which was annoying the bathroom is a little odd with the shower as it points straight down there is no curtain just a glass divider so water creeps around the edge and pools on the floor street noise is a problem but even worse was the flag of the hotel would bang into the window randomly throughout the night it sounded like someone was throwing snowballs at the window and it kept us awake the food was alright but you better off going elsewhere for breakfast the internet was free but you had to sign in with an email address to virgin so someone is probably making money off of my email which is ridiculous considering the rooms are over a night i would not stay there again for the price we paid,0
1144,the location is perfect it is very close to grafton street which is much nicer than street area to trinity college is about minute walk and to the templo bar about minute walk although it is so centrally located around the hotel is quiet we were a small group so i get to see different rooms some triple rooms are larger than the others in some room the faucet did not work properly the hair dryer stops every second and you have to wait until it cools down if you can tolerate inconvenience like these this hotel is very comfortable and nice the breakfast is amazing great variety of hot dishes to order service is very friendly if i come to dublin again i would stay here again,1
1145,dublin city centre is a consruction zone this summer buswell proved to be a relaxed oasis from the chaos of nearby streets great location across the street from national library and museum of archaeology street shops and good restaurants like the farm are nearby most tourist sights are within walking distance i had booked a room with shower plus a ticket to the hop on hop off tour upon arrival they had no record of these requests when shown my original email message from months previously they quickly rectified the situation since the price of the bus tour had increased from my booking they simply gave me the cash to buy a ticket my room was a decent size and nicely appointed although it fronted the street and construction noise began early it was no problem since i was up anyway the breakfast room is rather dark and the buffet choices were the same during my day stay staff were attentive bringing and taking orders for hot breakfasts the lounge is a great place to unwind with drinks or dinner after a hectic day of sightseeing and shopping highly recommended because of location amenities and nice staff,1
1146,we stayed here for two nights after some time in killarney overall we were happy with our stay we asked for a quiet room and got one at the back which was perfect the bathroom was a great size and the room came with a kettle iron tv with lots of channels and a hair dryer the staff were really lovely especially those at breakfast which by the way was superb the bar food for lunch and supper was only ok though there are plenty of eateries about that looked better to be a city centre hotel space is limited and expensive so it important that you have realistic expectations on what size room you will have and the price the location more than makes up though,1
1147,having stayed at buswells on more than one occasion i would highly recommend for its city centre location lovely staff great food on this occasion my only issue was the heat in the room eventhough we had a fan in the room it was very difficult to sleep this is something that is difficult to rectify unless you have air con still had a lovely time eventhough we might be coming home less rested than we had hoped,1
1148,the breakfast at buswells was fabulous homemade scones and croissants straight out of the oven flaky and delicious they also offered cereals and yogurts fruit and hot breakfasts like eggs and toast and bacon service was impeccable the location ca be beat within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in dublin,1
1149,this older hotel is very well maintained and is centrally located in the heart of the downtown action the management and staff are pleasant and customer oriented the breakfasts are very good as well no negatives,1
1150,we have stayed in dublin many times while this hotel is a little further out it is definitely one of the best we have stayed in parking at the rear lovely spacious room recently decorated a leisurely walk to grafton street or bus stop outside we got a taxi back in the evening which was still cheaper than staying in the city centre where mediocre rooms were priced at for one night due to coldplay concert will definitely stay here again have recommended to friends,1
1151,room had a layer of dust over all the furniture windows were dirty and covered in bird poop hallways were narrow and so dark you could hardly see staff was rude when i called ahead to request a bed the person told me to call him back when i was at a place he could hear me better wifi did work in our room bathrooms were large and seemed clean however we booked rooms at this hotel and my family members would concur with this review i would not recommend this hotel at all,0
1152,stayed at this hotel for one night with my husband lovely room very good breakfast and friendly helpful staff a min walk into city centre or a bus stop outside hotel is situated in a very upmarket area and we preferred to walk as it was so pleasant complimentary water and tea making facilities lovely bathroom with double sink and room has a massive television hallways are dimly lit but it adds to the design which was very chic hotel is very clean and i would recommend a stay i will definitely return next time i in dublin,1
1153,i stayed here again while on a business trip it did disappoint nice large clean room and extensive menus bar and reception staff most helpful will be back for sure ideally located close to bus routes and city center,1
1154,we have stayed here several times usually just or days to adjust to the time difference the location right across the street from christ church could be any better the staff has always been excellent we love the rooms and the breakfast we will always stay here when we come to dublin,1
1155,we stayed in a triple room the room itself was pretty basic but functional not as clean as i would have hoped a few stains on the bedspread particularly for the price but we recognize this was a middle of the road place having a refrigerator and ac was helpful it was a little warm for ireland when we traveled location is really the icing on the cake for this hotel walking distance to many things and within view of christ church cathedral while the church view was lovely be aware that you can clearly hear the church bells if you a light sleeper i gave four instead of five stars because the noise from the pub in the basement of the hotel can be loud and late particularly on the weekends it kept me up a bit but overall the hotel was nice and staff were kind i would recommend,1
1156,good location easy walk to main area of temple bar comfortable room reception staff were very helpful has a great little pub attached with good meals and live irish bands every night only downside was the noise from the church bell across the road ringing on the hour but okay with ear plugs,1
1157,my daughter and i really enjoyed our stay at the harding it is perfectly located in the christchurch area near many of the attractions you want to see the room was clean and comfortable and the staff thanks johnny was friendly and helpful if you driving the parking lot is nearby at a hotel discounted rate our only regret is that we could stay longer,1
1158,this hotel could not have a better location it is within walking distance to everything you need but just far enough off the main drag to bring a little quiet to the room in dublin this is critical it is very loud in this city and all the way up until the room was spacious clean and the three beds were comfy it also had a great shower with plenty of room the breakfast was a great bonus and the food was really good we would stay here again,1
1159,the staff is great very helpful with directions and printing tickets for attractions the location is perfect most everything within a min walk the only drawback is the wifi it works well during the day but it terrible in the evening on the floor,1
1160,easy access to all the sights and temple bar shopping cathedrals castle but clearly not worth the price felt like a very low rate motel when there are plenty of other options in the area that are much nicer,0
1161,the location right next to temple bar district and some of the main sights dublinia castle crhist church is perfect for for a dublin visit the staff is very helpful and rooms are spacious and tidy darkey kelly the pub with direct connection to the hotel is also great there is a lot of live music and a lot of locals to meet however the pub is a backdraft if you are looking for sleep on weekends make sure to get a room to the back of the building then,1
1162,the hotel reception staff were courteous and kind the room was clean and decent my only complaint was that you had to go up and down several steps to get to the elevator this was difficult when you had to to carry your own was good since it was close to the temple bar area where there were lots of restaurants,1
1163,realistic price for over night stay in dublin staff are great rooms are big and clean with everything you need hotels location is great for everything you want to do whilst in dublin bus stop pretty much outside temple bar just down the alley guinness storeroom within a minute walk,1
1164,just stayed in the hotel for an overnight and was warmly welcomed a really clean tidy spot in the heart of dublin very reasonable food excellent staff could not do enough to help highly recommend and will be back again for the lovely breakfast,1
1165,i had a single room which was small but adequate the room was clean and comfortable the irish breakfast was excellent the location of the hotel is across from the side of christchurch i found it to be a very good location i found the bells of the church to be a nice part of the ambiance,1
1166,ideal location for visiting dublin and enjoying the nocturnal joys of temple rooms kind staff and good restaurant and pub with live music every a few minutes walk from temple bar christ church and saint patrick cathedral,1
1168,great location in christchurch walking distance to was good bedroom roomy and needs a total in copper ally restaurant was parking in near by car park,1
1169,if you looking for a central hotel with a great bed and friendly staff then you should consider harding hotel this felt like a hidden gem to me after the terrible b b in galway my room was spacious the bed queen sizes and oh so comfortable my view was another hotel which was ok since i was out most of the day and really need my room to be place i can relax and get a good nights sleep the room was a bit outdated in style and the tv is tiny but i do care much about those things i checked in late at night and walked through temple bar to get to the hotel so i was worried about the noise level since the hotel was pretty close to the tourist trap thankfully it far enough from the central area that you wo be disturbed by drink tourist boy was i surprised the hotel is in front of the beautiful christ church cathedral and near the national gallery and walking distance from sights like trinity college and merrion recommend this hotel if you focused on being central getting a good nights sleep and need a bit of space in your room,1
1170,i stayed here for the weekend with a party of ladies i emailed ahead for a quiet room which i had the room was lovely and spacious tea coffee towels changed everyday the reception staff were so helpful with maps and information within walking distance to lots of places darkey kelly bar was great for a few late drinks we stored our luggage and the reception organised a taxi back to the airport enjoyed everything about the hotel will definitely return,1
1171,really well situated hotel if you want to ferry catch or just dip into the delights of a dublin visit or visit the aviva stadium which is literally next door to the hotel ample parking pleasant staff and certainly the amenities were well staffed and provided good food and was well presented and good in quality with nice smiley staff which is really important to us in a morning refurbished rooms were all very acceptably appointed we experienced a little night time sleep disturbance from outside noisy people but as a city centre venue there was nothing out of the ordinary in our opinion,1
1172,a very pleasant stay at the sandymount a little bit out of the city by foot but only minutes drive so luckily we hired a car for our stay the room was however a little warm and lacked air conditioning not many british hotels have though so that is the only negative thing i have to say the staff were all friendly and the hotel in general was very plush the morning buffet breakfast was very tasty indeed piping hot and often a very good selection of everything would stay at this hotel again in future,1
1173,thank you for a lovely stay room was perfect and reception staff were extremely helpful and next morning checking out staff were again lovely and got the shuttle bus turn round to come back me and then left me to the aircoach stop which was very much appreciated bus driver was very friendly also highly recommend this affordable clean nicely located hotel,1
1176,the sandymount hotel was such a pleasure to stay in i will certainly recommend it to others hope there will be a vacancy next time i am in dublin it is walking distance from bord gais theatre and arena it is also perfect location for travelling on to south dublin coastal towns or further on to bray or greystones,1
1177,lovely hotel really friendly chatty staff make you feel welcome the room was clean had everything you need and the bed was comfortable if you like half a wilder beast order the rack of ribs from the restaurant take a doggy bag huge messy and delicious,1
1178,i stay in this hotel very regularly on business and can not fault it at all it is very homely staff are very pleasant and the bar food is top are very comfortable clean and modern and there is a great car park on site with plenty of tried various other hotels in the area cheaper and more expensive and this is the best prices are very very reasonable i would highly recommend this not just for business but for family breaks or short away from home is not so much of a chore in this spot,1
1179,thank you all it was a lovely one night stay clean and staff were very helpful after a long night at croke park will be hoping to come back in to watch england beat ireland at train is on the door step and it is a couple of stations to city eat at the hotel but looked very nice,1
1180,great hotel and very helpful staff thank you saug beatrice for your advice on how to get around and what to see in dublin nice modern room good facilities and breakfast close to the centre of dublin and near to the aviva stadium would definitely stay here again,1
1181,stayed as a tour guide with my group of tourists here several times always happy to come back the most helpful staff great food and a wonderful quiet location but close enough to the city at the canal with a nice walking way,1
1182,excellent location great parking breakfast very good and convenient quiet clean room given central location slight issues but willing to believe this is not typical very nice to see such good renovation of old,1
1183,a perfect destination for our team staff very helpful and friendly and hotel is well appointed rooms clean lounges very comfortable and relaxing an excellent bar and dining facilities free computer room and strong wifi conveniently located to the dart and sandymount village and eateries in ballsbridge highly recommended and would stay here again,1
1184,the clean towels are stored on top of blue plastic on the floor of the hallway these clean towels are exposed to people shoes dust and other pollutants the shower doors are closed allowing water to spill on the bathroom floor room was dark and dank a substandard hotel at best depending who is on duty results in pleasant or unpleasant communication to generate the requested results my request for shampoo led to the maid busting into my room after knocking only once i was naked to prove to me that she had put shampoo in the good point is that it is in close proximity to the city,0
1185,stayed here for a business trip very nice hotel with friendly staff good location for access into the city centre and elsewhere the only negative comments i have which are very minor are around the quality of the tv in the room poor picture and few channels less than freeview and the curtains which let in quite a bit of light around the edges early in the morning which meant i woke up earlier than i would have hoped,1
1186,we love dublin for cultural reasons and wanted a midsummer break at short notice this friendly hotel is central and is convenient for transport on the dart and luas the leap visitors card is a cheap and useful transport card to get you about town and to visit charming seaside towns like malahide and greystones it worth considering for leisure and business reasons,1
1187,lovely hotel very nice staff and comfortable well appointed rooms in a great location but dublin you to get a grip on the prices this is no reflection on the hotel it lovely and well appointed but the price was just too much,1
1188,the sandymount hotel is a good choice located in sandymount quarter it is easy to reach the center of dublin by the dart train at the end of an ireland trip it is very easy to drive to the airport within minutes,1
1189,a smallish hotel in a pleasant area with friendly staff the rooms and food were of good quality and the area quiet nearby is sandymount village with shops and pubs and a little further on is a beach which provided a pleasant evening walk,1
1190,we stayed in the sandymount for the sunday night of the longitude festival first impression really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything there was a really relaxed feel in the hotel people were just sitting around chilling in various locations there are chairs and sofas around every corner so nice the people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to beatrice she went above and beyond about mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share saving us both money i thought it was a lovely touch she was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before silly maybe but we both agreed that beatrice kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend the beer garden is really lovely while we did get to eat at the hotel other than late night pizza but i think you could honestly go to the sandymount and not leave the grounds at one point i thought we would just forget longitude and stay in the garden we were driving so with regards to public transport i am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is with the aviva stadium i assume they are but not least a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception,1
1191,stayed days and it was great location is awesome its quiet and train is just away price was also ok and the staff was really friendly and helpful breakfast was ok too cant complain hope we come back one day,1
1193,stayed here for one night and was totally impressed the hotel was large and spacious with plenty of free parking on arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and this continued throughout our stay the rooms were spacious with free safe wifi hairdryer iron tv facilities and plenty of toiletries we ate from the bar menu and it was delicious breakfast was self service with loads of choice even for non meat eaters the hotel is just mins walk to aviva stadium and train station which took us into city centre in a great friendly hotel in a fabulous location and i would definitely stay here again,1
1194,first class hotel fantastic staff food and service all around the room we got was great the staff could have been more pleasant or helpful they had a bottle of wine and chocolates in the room for our arrival was a nice touch,1
1195,great hotel looks very well i loved the sofas and big mirrors food was quite tasty and the guinness was perfect rooms were lovely and cosy the shower was great some small little things like loose shower fittings and one of the bedside lights not functioning are keeping this hotel from getting stars other then that it deserves them,1
1196,gorgeous hotel with pleasant kind and very helpful staff fantastic food and clean welcoming room expectations were exceeded in every aspect of the stay location very convenient greatly recommended,1
1197,the hotel offers a lot of services it not difficult to get to the centre by bus or by train it also interesting to take a ride along the sea shore at sandymount the rooms are comfortable and there is a big choice of food for breakfast,1
1198,the overall experience was great service friendly and attentive food excellent as i was a solo traveler i felt quite comfortable staying here the location of the hotel was close to the railway good and dave the shuttlebus driver was great,1
1199,stayed here recently with a group of friends from the moment we entered the staff were welcoming friendly the bar is comfortable and spacious with a nice outdoor area rooms are spacious and comfortable all staff were exceptionally friendly will definitely return,1
1200,the hotel is well located close to he village of sandymount but with easy access to dublin city centre via the dart staff are friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and well decorated and the beds comfortable only disappointment was the breakfast not bad just not to as high a standard as previous visits,1
1201,best breakfast food and staff ever bag porter very helpful clean and large on front desk helpful nd capable with very efficent and fast check out and printer very useful and freenick,1
1202,the rooms are small but clean and very efficient the water pressure is great the patio and restaurant and bar are lovely our breakfast was not included in our room price but the breakfast buffet was fantastic and worth the price per person five minutes walk to a dart station which brings youafter three stops to temple bar or trinity college,1
1203,great hotel for dublin ferry reasonably priced for dublin near centre of dublin and only mins drive to ferry lots of parking on site and free rooms are recently refurbished so good and clean really nice neighbourhood with nice pub in walking distance as well,1
1204,very nice but a bit out of the way short walk to the irish sea and to the village a change from the walk to the train to the downtown area clean nice breakfast and lovely garden and flowers,1
1205,the staff was incredible they were helpful and courteous every step of the way the rooms were clean and comfortable very quiet and in a great location minute ride to city center thank you again,1
1206,quick update on past reviews and again following the major refurbishment the sandmount hotel continues to grow in popularity line out bar has undergone major renovations and its efficiency and use of space has improved along with excellent décor food is still the same as tasty as ever accommodation and rooms faultless and comfortable the dublin area is suffering a shortage of accommodation at the moment so rates have been hiked still good value here at the sandymount and overall the friendliness and efficiency of staff and management is they jewel in their crown good to see beatrice as friendly and glamorous as ever need ever for changes there,1
1207,this renovated hotel seems a little far from the center of dublin but the dart dublin area rapid transit is a short walk away and the city center is easily reached as are the coastal towns to the south the rooms were very nice and they serve a good breakfast there is an elevator that goes to the ground floor for luggage and easier access,1
1209,our room was clean and very well stocked with complimentary toiletries the hotel itself is really nice and the location is excellent the hotel is about a minute stroll to grafton street and there a dart station really close to the hotel also there are nice bars and restaurants quite close to the hotel also all in all a really pleasant stay,1
1210,friendly and helpful staff nice rooms excellent breakfast walking distance to the center or at least to public transport or one of the buses and close to the stadium very nice short stay there,1
1211,we stayed at the sandymount on our last night after a week in ireland i had picked it due to price and as we had stayed in ballsbridge previously which is nearby i knew that it would be a nice area what i had realised was that it was withing excellent proximity to the port which was perfect for us as we had an early ferry to catch in the morning the staff were immediately very helpful we arrived early but they let us into our room and gave us details of how to get into dublin they were really friendly and lovely with our daughter who was a bit shy we had a lovely stay at the sandymount albeit short however i would definitely return next time i am visiting dublin,1
1212,my wife and i have been visiting the sandymount since have got to know our hosts and staff on a personal level and are invariably treated like forward to seeing you all again soon,1
1213,we booked this hotel as we where attending a match in the aviva staduim which sandy mount says is a min walk its actually less i booked the hotel on bookings and before we paid i contacted the hotel and explain we where going to be travelling up and staying the friday night and wouldnt be getting there til later on in the evening and that we would be attending a match the saturday and would it be ok to leave the car there after check out the girl who i was in contact with had no problem with room was clean newly refurbished i think or it was just kept in good condition over time beds where comfortable reception staff upon check in out where friendly we had a few drinks in the bar that night and staff were lovely theres pubs recommend slatterys pub grocery shops and cafes about min walk away from hotel or in taxi download my taxi handy of match there was pop up tents outside the hotel on hotel grounds doing drinks and bbq for people for the match such a good idea we also got to see the football teams driving in by being here they also have a tent for people going to the match to check in there bags,1
1214,we found the hotel staff very friendly the room light comfortable and beautifully clean the breakfast delicious and the location ideal for us as it was a short walk to the dart station with regular trains into the city centre we had brought our car for use later in our holiday so the car parking facility made life much easier for us,1
1215,location gives access to many dublin entertainment venues accommodation is very good evening menu choice could be more varied comfortable rooms and friendly staff a bit pricey though we stayed at high season,1
1216,highly recommended this hotel has a home from home feeling spotless and staff are naturally friendly and helpful food very good location amazing we stayed because we were attending the man utd match in the aviva the staff were able to manage a large crowd in their stride,1
1217,excellent location adjacent to aviva stadium minutes walk to rds hotel easily accessible by car surrounding area quiet and safe courteous helpful and friendly staff looked for an early check in and was very pleased when same was accommodated breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice a little disappointed with dinner had steak which was rather tough would have expected a more tender steak for the price charged overall a very pleasant stay at the hotel willandudno be back again,1
1218,we stayed here in july and found it to be a nice hotel rates were affordable and rooms were clean staff is friendly however be careful if aviva stadium has an event as the hotel is very close to it and i heard it can get busy in that area we ate at the pub and found the food very good the hotel is located away from city center although easily reachable by taxi train or bus line there are local within walking distances towards sandymount center do not buy the cityscape hop on hop off bus tickets at the front lobby desk we waited almost mins at each bus stop while all the other bus lines came by every to minutes we finally gave up on them after the stop and used a cab,1
1219,we had a lovely stay at the sandymount hotel the rooms are very modern spotless and cozy breakfast buffet was very nice too staff very friendly and stops with the train to the city centre and sandymount centre with shops and restaurants a minute walk away,1
1220,very friendly service clean and comfortable rooms and very quiet even though we stayed on a match night for access to the aviva stadium this hotel is ideal we have stayed in much nicer places for this price but it clear you definitely pay for location especially as the price gets hiked up on a match night ballsbridge was a lovely area within walking distance,1
1221,a hotel hidden away in a leafy wealthy dublin suburb but yet very central at the same time great access to the dart railway line that will take you to central dublin in minutes this hotel has a lot of old world charm splendid accommodation a great restaurant and also great bar food large secluded gardens with seating to while away a sunny afternoon with maybe several refreshments of your choice secure car parking and a lovely part of dublin derek a true dub,1
1222,only real thing in the hotels favour is its proximity to the aviva this is one of the worst hotels ive stayed in just felt that there was no atmosphere and everything was a total hassle for the staff i travel a lot on business throughout the year and the hotel is terrible value for money especially when it is so dated,0
1223,the sandymount hotel is an excellent hotel with spacious rooms great staff and the bar food we had a meal in the bar and the food was excellent would definitely book the hotel again when we are in dublin,1
1224,good hotel in quiet environment with enough free parking facilities and on walking distance from the train to dublin centre breakfast is more than sufficient very friendly staff excellent beds clean,1
1225,great location nice decor terrible cleanliness sloppy housekeeping this hotel has the potential to be so much better not sure how they can claim its star rating especially as the advertised swimming pool is actually down the road in a school,0
1226,close to railway to access central district clean and comfortable rooms staff very friendly and helpful to service ipromptu needs nice and delicious breakfast quiet area excellent room cleanliness,1
1227,we stayed recently in sandymount hotel with my husband very nice spacious modern clean bedrooms bathroom was also very nice we were attending to concert in which was mins walk the hotel is at great location i left my purse in the security box i only realised on the next day thanks to tania the duty manager of the hotel i got it back by post thanks again for that,1
1228,friendly and helpful staff beautiful spotless comfortable room also very quite in comparison to some hotels ive stayed in and a free off road carprk ideal location for the rds or aviva stadium will definitely be back,1
1229,fabulous hotel could ask for better location as was staying here to attend the dublin horse show the hotel was very kind to mind our bags until check in and even minded the bags after we checking out the hotel had a courtesy bus to bring us to the rds,1
1230,stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon hotel is spacious conveniently located has a great hot breakfast buffet staff are friendly and eager to help and even has perks like a business center with printers for any last minute itinerary printing or changes we were even surprised to find a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in our room when we checked in with a note congratulating us on our recent marriage the sandymount has set the bar high for hotels on the rest of our european vacation,1
1231,i met a client here for a pub lunch i had the chilli burrito and he had the burger both of them were tasty and the service was prompt and reasonably food was nothing fancy but it was good value for a pub lunch in one of dublin most expensive suburbs,1
1232,a very friendly staff and a very good breakfast with a lot of choice it also minutes from the airport and minutes walk from the trainstation and stop of the hop on and off bus so i can recommend this hotel,1
1233,lovely hotel delicious food in the restaurant and reasonably priced great location beside aviva stadium as we were attending the man utd match loved the beer garden rooms spacious n nicely decorated,1
1234,i found the hotel clean comfortable and ideally located just outside the city centre i would recommend it i had one issue of room doors closing and the noise but this has been taken on board by the management and i hope my next stay will be even better,1
1235,good place to stay not too far from the city center modern hotel for not tried the restaurant only return if i ever come back to to the rugby stadium so may be crowded if a game is on check the match program,1
1236,all in all a very pleasant hotel with extremely helpful staff clean comfortable rooms nicely decorated good pub nice breakfast buffet and some quite good food at the restaurant very convenient for a wedding at star of the sea in the village,1
1237,i can thoroughly recommend this hotel it is in a lovely location within walking distance to town ballsbridge and the lovely beach at sandymount the staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble if you are looking for a lovely hotel in dublin this is definitely the one to choose,1
1238,my husband and i stayed at the sandymount hotel for one night in july we were in dublin for the concert at croke park and it was also my husband birthday i booked the hotel direct it was really easy and we booked a classic room and late we chose this hotel based on the great reviews and the fact that it was near the coast which my husband was really keen to visit we were not disappointed with our choice we travelled by taxi from the airport to the hotel the journey took around minutes and cost few days before we travelled i contacted the hotel to confirm our reservation and to ask if there was anything they could recommend in the immediate area of the hotel that i could arrange for my husband to do on the sunday as we were seeing on the saturday evening i got a very fast and very friendly response from iamina who also provided me with website links to the recommended places so that i could get more information fab on arrival we were impressed first impressions were really great the hotel looks really impressive and the reception area was spotless with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere the receptionist was and she gave us loads of information about the area and as we were travelling to croke park she told us where to find the dart station about a minute walk and how many stops we needed to get near to the stadium,1
1239,stayed at the sandymount again for the quarter final had not been for a few years we got the sunday night special deal for two from there web value b b course evening meal free car park bar voucher all for for two how to they do it first of all staff are very friendly polite professional pleasant and very helpful hotel and rooms spotless and immaculate with all you need i have never seen a card in the room before saying if you would like fresh milk with the complimentary please phone well done great touch breakfast is very lets talk about the course evening meal in the bar anything off the menu additional payment for steak we met family at the hotel and we all had the meal and could not get over the choice quality standard presentation potion size and service it was second to none one of the best meals ever nothing is too much trouble this hotel is mins on the dart from the city centre cost return very safe quite easy to drive too plenty of free parking i have stayed in dublin many times and never had such a good deal do not stay anywhere else it is outstanding,1
1240,very well located hotel which offers great value for money considering the prime location close to ballsbridge and the aviva stadium the hotel was originally a conversion of three adjoining georgian houses which lends itself to the layout of accommodation being a bit unorthodox with corridors and stairways being rather random in their lay out that aside the hotel offers a fine guest experience at a very fair price which more than makes up for the unusual character of the property,1
1241,great hotel very comfortable quick walk to train station and a stop for the airport coach beatrice in reception was particularly helpful and kind even letting us use her phone to make a call highly recommended,1
1242,tiny bathroom no bath only a shower pillows like rocks torn carpet very disappointing for the money bar uninspiring entire place tired and cramped would not recommend it at all however it was a great location for rds,0
1244,located in a quiet neighborhood a very comfortable and spacious room kind and helpful staff members at front desk wonderful breakfast waking distance to public transportation dart highly recommend this hotel,1
1245,a very clean comftable room very central and helpful receptionist looking forward for my next walking distance from the centre a very nice bar with the hotel with a superb gothic were clean very quite and quite a nice style,1
1246,highly recommendable for location nice hotel people at the desk are helpful room has everything you need the pub next door is a bit loud but one is so tired in the evening that it does really matter because you fall asleep right away,1
1247,booked last minute by location and reading reviews and could not have chosen a better place staff incredibly welcoming and helpful ideal location for all we wanted to see and do and beautiful well maintained and clean property look forward to staying there again,1
1248,we wanted to stay in a hotel in dublin but knew we be tired at the end of our two week trip and possibly out of travel funds so we opted for this hotel with its good price and convenient location the staff was very friendly and helpful despite being so busy the room was clean and quiet we faced inside but the location is definitely the best part of staying here it so close to all of the restaurants stores and sites we loved being in the heart of the action the front desk arranged for an excellent cab driver to take us to the airport extremely early in the morning as we drove out of the neighborhood we could believe how many people were still out partying and walking the streets which reveals our age our stay at the drury was a great way to end our trip,1
1249,centrally located clean hospitable and helpful staff and safe this was a perfect landing pad for a family unfamiliar with the area after walking the city and viewing many must see sites we realized what a value and what a great hotel we had found,1
1250,i loved this hotel it was so close to great restaurants bars and breakfast places plus the hotel has hour desk people who are very helpful free newspaper bar next door serves breakfast just for hotel guests and you can walk everywhere cabs are plentiful too,1
1252,second time staying here this hotel is in a great location very central to restaurants shopping and nightlife friendly staff and hassle free booking overall cleanliness was satisfactory great value for would definitely stay here again,1
1253,the gentleman behind reception desk was very friendly and help he helped us upgrade our room as we are four and my son is years old the room is clean and has everything you need the hotel recommended the car park which is just one minute walk away great location in the centre of dublin will recommend to friends,1
1254,my husband and i stayed here for our first nights on our honeymoon neither of us had ever been to europe before so we looked for something close to all the sights when we booked this negatives small tvloud at night due to multiple pubs right beside or across the streetthe positives great locationhelpful staff that made our first europe experience so easygreat pub attached to hotel cleandecently comfortable bedit was anything super fancy but it was exactly what we needed we would definitely recommend staying here and if we ever came back we would stay here again,1
1255,i was referred to dch by a local friend and was very impressed the hotel has a great location and is near good coffee shops shopping and restaurants the room was very nice and clean and the staff was outstanding i needed help finding a good rental car company and the staff made sure i got the right one,1
1257,this hotel was a sweep me off my feet kind of hotel mainly due to some wear and tear from people who generally abuse other people property but the service out of this world for this little hotel floors with maybe rooms per floor clean well staffed and the little restaurant which serves breakfast was great we generally stay in or star hotels however due to the concert and a late booking things were tough to reserve we found ourselves at the drury court which on paper is more rated as a star the staff at the hotel were super attentive and professional and what this hotel did have in the rating it certainly has in service we had a great stay and were very pleased with the overall experience we would return based solely on the service and attention which was paid to us as guests very minor tweaks would easily make this a thanks everyone,1
1258,we had a great stay at drury court hotel the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff were also very helpful and helped us with a number of queries we had during our stay as well as letting us check in early highly recommend,1
1259,the location was excellent and the staff was wonderful we could easily walk to most of the principal attractions in dublin as well as dining and shopping we asked for a room on an upper floor towards the back so we did not get street noise,1
1260,you ca beat the location it easy walking distance to lots of dublin sites the airlink bus from the airport and the busses the staff was very gracious and are a couple of pubs nearby we were there on a bank holiday weekend with several huge sports events also going on the summertime crowd at the pubs were partially outside and noisy if you are sensitive to that kind of noise this might not be the place for you,1
1261,just returned from a week stay in ireland with my family of looked at many hotels and for the nights in dublin decided on the drury because of the reviews and location location was great easy walking to everything sights and shopping the front dest was exceptional friendly helpful and so nice to talk to i think staying in a small property was the best choice we made we needed a triple and double room both were huge clean and comfortable it was a deluxe property but beds were so comfy with nice sheets and pillows we had the best sleep,1
1262,really helpful staff only too ready to book excursions tours and give advice position of the hotel was within easy walking distance of all the city attractions and shopping centres at breakfast there was a very good choice with good coffee was good in the room bathrooms needed updating,1
1263,my husband and i stayed at waterloo house for three nights at the end of may and could not have been more pleased the location is ideal for visiting dublin the airport aircoach stop is a couple blocks from the house and public buses into city center pick up just a few doors down the street only used them once however as it is an easy and enjoyable walk from waterloo house into downtown dublin the neighborhood is quiet and feels safe with numerous shops and restaurants in short walking distance the georgian house is charming and our room at the back of the house was sizable and very clean with a spacious bath and comfortable bed lovely view out on the garden and the rooftops beyond there was some barking from the resident dogs at the start of each night but they soon quieted down so it was not a problem fabulous breakfasts with a variety of cooked options in addition to an extensive buffet the staff were attentive and accommodating especially irene who was most helpful and and welcoming although the steps up to the front door are rather steep the house does have an elevator which i believe can also be accessed from a ground floor entrance if stairs are a problem all in all a delightful and memorable stay for our first visit to dublin,1
1264,my sister and i arrived here after a long day of flying from the dublin airport it was an easy bus ride for a walk to this hotel i had requested a quiet room so we could get plenty of sleep and get over our jet lag as soon as possible we were given a room on the top floor facing the back which was perfect we had a nice view and occasionally heard church bells toll the hotel manager was charming and helpful in her suggestions for wonderful nearby restaurants staying there nights was a perfect amount of time to walk through the city and see the sights,1
1265,following a day trip through ireland we spent our last three nights at the schoolhouse hotel in dublin the structure of the hotel is an old private parochial schoolhouse the setting is quaint and the hotel staff is very friendly the rooms are very clean and modern my only issue was that the wireless internet in the room was weak or i went down to the lobby and was told that the hotel had been experiencing internet problems throughout which also affected their computer operations i used my wifi hotspot and all was well the pub was excellent the breakfast in the restaurant was also very good and open at would stay at the schoolhouse again and recommend it to others,1
1266,we stayed here en famille for a few days in june the staff are incredibly friendly and chatty while the rooms are small but comfortable it was great to be back in dublin having not been in town for years although very close to the centre the quiet canal bank location allows one to rest peacefully the beds are very comfortable and all the amenities were perfect the hotel is full of character with rooms named after famous literary characters my wife and i stayed in the christy brown room breakfast was the traditional full irish although other options were available i hold them largely responsible for my holiday weight the perfect location for visiting the historical sites in dublin trinity dublin castle etc it obviously equally good if you can get a room for trips to lansdowne road for matches or concerts we loved the hotel and will definitely stay again if we can on our next visit to dublin,1
1267,we spent one night here at the end of a biking tour hotel is very quaint and we enjoyed a delicious lunch on the day of our arrival bar is great too hotel is about a mile walk to the heart of the district in dublin we enjoyed this distance as the hotel was nice and quiet but others may prefer something closer we left the next morning for the airport before breakfast was served,1
1269,the hotel was good nice beds space etc but it a bit of a walk to see things food was good nothing exceptional most staff from other countries tried their best to be understood just have to get used to different accents pretty often bar was great bar staff was wonderful parking available but tight very interesting history of this hotel,1
1270,a lovely historic place upon which to end our stay in ireland beautifully renovated and presented obviously very popular watering hole for the locals road into the carpark could be a little better signposted as it looks as if it is not actually a road but in fact it is bedroom was tastefully decorated and the bed was large and comfortable small bathroom but lovingly decorated and quite adequate,1
1271,the schoolhouse hotel is a first class option for enjoying all that dublin has to offer while still having a quiet little oasis to retire for the evening our room the formers chambers of the school headmaster was nicely appointed with a big comfortable bed the included breakfast in the morning is good rory doyle and his staff are consummate professionals rory was particularly kind and very patient answering typical tourist questions if the option presents we will be happy to return to this historic gem,1
1272,this beautiful hotel was so well situated for everything we did in dublin and the staff was extremely helpful they not only answered all of our questions but offered suggestions and helped facilitate what we wanted to do,1
1273,we stayed at the marker for three nights in july we arrived in the morning after an overnight flight from the us when we checked in our room was not available but were told if we waited in the lounge they would come and get us when it was we went to the restroom to freshen up returned to the lounge and our room was ready we stayed in a superior room that overlooked the canal and a public square the room was fresh and functional the bath was large and bright service was first class if i ever returned to dublin this would be my go to hotel,1
1274,it was a very great time spent in the marker hotel the room was very nice with good the employees are very quiet very professional the brasserie is very good and the roof so nice,1
1275,the marker is a modern hotel with staff that are exceptionally helpful the room was spacious although a bit light on space to store clothes for a multi day stay the buffet breakfasts were great order your eggs as you want them and do settle for the scrambled eggs that are the default both forms are included in the buffet pricing loved the honeycomb and fresh apricots each morning,1
1276,the marker is an incredible hotel but the best it has is the people that work in it the service is impecable true luxury but a near and warm type of it i travel a lot and it the best hotel i visited since long time ago,1
1277,loved everything about the marker looking forward to another trip location is great and easy to get around the rooftop bar was so awesome and staff always helpful my husband and i cant wait to come back,1
1278,special occasion so we booked this hotel and we wrent disappointed would definitely reccomend the marker hotel thw breakfast was excellent rooms were fab and staff friendly and helpful the area is lovely day and night and close to all areas,1
1279,the staff at the hotel were excellent and went out of there way to help well worth going to the roof top bar great views of the dock area nice walk into the centre of dublin along the river providing it is not raining,1
1280,have stayed here on several occasions always find the staff to be friendly and accommodating great energy and vibe in the lobby the rooftop bar and awesome cocktails as well nice views of grand canal dock nice pool and spa services staff is very hospitality focused room bed and bathroom very nice,1
1281,we stayed one night at the marker before returning home to san diego the next day we were welcomed by staff from the moment we arrived they were extremely helpful and very friendly our room was spacious with a large bathroom the hotel has a modern and attractive feel located in the dockland area with pedestrianized areas coffee shops etc i really like this place i booked one of the special rates online which included breakfast a room upgrade and access to the spa it was worth it and to be honest the price was still way better than i could have got for one of the hotels in the heart of the city the marker was just a short walk or uber ride from the key sights in the city if i come back to dublin i will stay at the marker i doubt that i will even look at other options,1
1282,fabulous location so central and yet serenity by the canal and near to the river liffey the staff are fabulously friendly and efficient and the rooms have views for days they helpfully changed my room so that i could maximise from the experience and the concierge is very knowledgeable and efficient,1
1283,the gernal manager charlie sheil and his entire staff were gracious attentive friendly and took care of our every need they anticipated our needs before we even asked they consistently surprised us at every turn the property is stunningly beautiful but the staff set a new standard for service hospitality and grace we have stayed at star hotel around the world but the marker beats them all we are proud to call the staff at the marker our new friends we can not wait to return bravo,1
1284,my business is organising and leading motorbike tours the marker hotel was a point on a tour of ireland taking in a quick stop in dublin to see the sights and the city there were of us altogether in the tour group the concierge was extremely helpful for us organising an executive minibus to take us around the city and also tickets to enjoy the guinness experience all staff were attentive and polite and saw quickly to our had originally booked the hotel because of the rooftop terrace where we planned to have drinks the terrace was closed for us on the evening of our stay which was initially a great disappointment however the hotel arranged for a rooftop terrace breakfast for us all the next morning which was excellent we were all very happy with the city view and the breakfast and the special way of looking after us all bikers departed for the wicklow mountains very satisfied with the stay we did not have the time to enjoy the spa facilities,1
1285,i stayed in the marker on a recent overnight business trip everything was fantastic and i was delighted to get a complimentary room upgrade my only issue was i arrived late had to leave early so i did get to spend more time there,1
1286,great place to stay and chillout to charlie and all the team the room are good the hallways could do with a touch more lighting the new features in the rooms work enjoyed many stays here and look forward to many more,1
1287,loved our stay at the marker everything you looking for in a stylish boutique hotel impeccable service we arrived early from before our room was ready were able to store our bags and take advantage of the pool shower room to freshen up surprisingly spacious room compared to many european boutiques gorgeous huge bathroom brunch is pricey if you just need a pastry and a coffee hit a local coffee shop very trendy rooftop deck amazing panoramic views meant to take advantage of the complimentary car service but happened to be booked when we were looking to a min walk to the historic dublin core but just cross the liffey and jump on the light rail if your feet are tired will stay here again when we return,1
1288,we had a smooth experience and our room was perfect with a view out on the docs a minor issue with the air conditioning was quickly resolved by the staff who made a nice gesture for the inconvenience really not necessary much appreciated and reflects on the premier experience offering our room was quiet and we slept like kings very pleasant and looking forward to coming back,1
1289,loved the under floor heating in the bathroom the rooms were spacious hotel very central overlooking the beautiful quay staff were lovely and helpful nothing to complain about it was perfect for my business trip,1
1290,the marker hotel is situated in avery relaxed area just next to the grand canal docks it is ideal for people who like to stay right at the edge of an vibrant city but with a calm surrounding we really enjoyed our stay,1
1291,i have had the privilege to stay in some of the best hotels in the world i believe you judge them not necessarily by the initial impression but by how they rectify any issues we had a couple of problems with the room when we arrived but these were sorted quickly and very satisfactorily hence the stars staff are all very helpful and pleasant great to see so many irish people in senior positions special praise to shane in the brasserie and frida on the rooftop bar for superb service and matteo that probably means i forgotten someone but everyone was good hotel very clean bathroom facilities excellent top class hotels can be a bit pretentious which i hate but the marker is not would return and will do on my next dublin visit,1
1292,the marker hotel in dublin is a rare gem located in the heart of the grand canal area next to a number of companies like facebook google and microsoft the hotel is very modern clean comfortable and most importantly they have the best customer service and friendliest staff of any hotel we have ever visited i loved our room the restaurant the food and the general feeling one gets by staying there,1
1293,great service lovely room staff were really helpful and welcoming service in the brasserie was also good but not to the same standard as the hotel we felt a little condescended to by the waitress do think i eat there again but will definitely return to the hotel,1
1294,from the moment the taxi door opened to the opening of mu luggage in the room the marker is a gem cost effective lively fun yet quiet and restful the marker will be my go to stop in the fine town of dublin,1
1295,an excellent business hotel friendly hotel staff to the city center and attractions about minutes walk for a tourist visit a bit too far from everything excellent breakfasts and food but anyway too expensive hotel,1
1296,modern luxurious with attention to detail all staff bar the brasserie waitress were exceptional avoid breakfast like the plague not for food but service was disgusting mistakes were overcharge on credit card and charges of euro for car to be setdown for hours,1
1298,spacious and beautiful rooms very friendly helpful and welcoming staff stefan assisted me with my packing while my baby was unwell as i was alone good spa amenities although treatments were fully booked the bar food in this hotel can be be better but i would stay here again,1
1299,we stewed two nights at the start of a family trip through ireland paris and rome the rooms were good service was great and the food was very good from the bistro and room service could fault it would stay again,1
1300,i do usually write reviews on this but i had to after the fantastic treatment we got at the market check in to leaving the hotel the staff were out of this world they honestly could do anymore for room was perfect we stayed in room we had a corner suite overlooking the docklands just food was fabulous we eat from the bar menu and could fault that had a treatment on the sunday morning i got the sunday package and honestly the best massage i had in a long time and what made the experience even better was the lady that i had her name was amanda she was polite friendly and just made the whole stay perfect for me also the food and beverage manager sandra was fantastic too myself and my friends will definitely be back,1
1302,we had the pleasure of staying at the market during out three week european vacation the hotel is situated in a modern business area of dublin the hotel was gorgeous rooms were spacious amenities were first class the staff made us feel very special we were fortunate to experience the spa the rooftop bar and the fabulous dining the marker hotel stands out amongst the rest in all its offerings and a staff that was spectacular,1
1303,excellent contemporary hotel wonderful rooms with most comfortable beds perfect located in the new harbour region very friendly staff great meeting facilities and a well organised bar for having a drink after work,1
1304,good accommodation everything is just good the steak in the bar is a little bit over cooked and the temperature of the showers during morning time turns between code and hot frequently assuming there are many guests having showers at the same time,1
1305,very nice hotel it in a nice modern business area about a minute walk from town the rooms are big clean and comfortable the brasserie is a really nice design and the breakfast is great i would recommend having dinner there though as there are superior restaurants nearby,1
1307,my family of stayed at the marker hotel on june while the weather was unseasonably warm one of our rooms had no air conditioning at all the temp in the room was over degrees which made it very difficult for my wife and kids to sleep what surprised me is that they could not fix the problem nor was there another room available for us only on the last nite did they offer us another room the gen mgr sent me an apologies note after we checked out but the hotel never adjusted the bill while i appreciate the apology this just isnt good business if you are looking for a star hotel go to the merrian the marker is only priced like a star,0
1308,the hotel definitely feels like a hotel and the service is friendly and attentive the architecture and décor inside are cool giving a welcoming space cocktails in the bar were ok not spectacular and very expensive for two rooms were spacious comfortable and nicely we were not allowed in the rooftop bar at on the saturday evening too busy first time ever i have been refused access as a resident in to a hotel bar maybe you need a policy review one of the reasons i chose the hotel was the rooftop bar expensive error,1
1309,i stayed in the marker at the weekend for the first time and from the moment i was greeted at the door until i left the following day it was first class five star service the doorman was so polite and welcoming and the same was true of the check in staff i arrived mid morning and my room was not ready which i expected as it was early and i was more than happy to leave my bag and head to the shops i was told that i would receive a call when the room was ready and sure enough a matter of around an hour and a half later that is exactly what happened when i arrived back my bag had been taken to my room the room itself was immaculately clean with modern decor the bathroom was beautiful and had a spacious shower i could fault the room at all we had a late dinner in the bar as we were attending a concert and the food was lovely a particular highlight was the chocolate mousse for dessert a must have it was gorgeous we were fortunate to have beautiful weather which allowed us to enjoy a drink on the rooftop bar before the concert later that night we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar our server recommended a great gin which did enjoyed breakfast the following morning which was a self service buffet with hot and cold options could fault hotel was very busy but,1
1310,the marker is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in it greatest asset is its staff i have never stayed at a hotel where they make you so welcome and nothing is ever an issue the attention to detail and cleanliness is second to none and the inhouse restaurant could easily trade words with the finest restaurants in the capital a pleasure in the marker and we will come back again month,1
1311,stayed for a weekend excellent service and a very nice room it is a fifteen to twenty minute walk to the temple bar area and to shopping so other hotels will have a better location if that is your priority the hotel has a nice rooftop bar where you both outside and inside the service at the hotel is very good and very friendly i highly recommend this hotel,1
1312,the hotel is placed in walking distance from most places in dublin really nice rooms and great house maids they made order of our things so i could have an overview and find everything helpful and kind personel everywhere truly a pleasure to stay there,1
1314,not a bad were bar was is and gym great i gave out of for value because naturally it expensive to get such a great hotel and star treatment,1
1315,my wife and i stayed at the marker hotel in dublin twice during our trip throughout the british isles it is five star accommodation with very friendly and helpful staff the location is a newly developing area by the canal river and docks we found that the price of the hotel and parking was quite high even using discounts provided through,1
1316,my husband and i have just returned from a two night stay at this wonderful hotel in dublin from the moment we arrived until our departure we could not fault one single thing it is definitely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in the staff go out of there way to help you in any way they can and are all so polite and immaculately dressed they are a credit to the hotel we had an early morning flight from the uk and arrived at the hotel at when we asked if we could leave our luggage we were told our room was already available for us an excellent start to our stay we paid extra for a deluxe double room that was outstanding in every way we had a wonderful view over grand canal square and the cityscape it had everything we needed during our stay the bathroom was huge and had a separate bath and shower and even underfloor heating which was a really nice we were lucky to have really good weather during our stay and found the air con to be quite sufficient and extremely quite the hotel is in a lovely quite area of dublin and is about a minute walk to the center we used the hop on hop off buses a lot and the nearest stop was just around the corner from the in all an excellent stay in a wonderful hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting,1
1317,stayed for our tenth wedding anniversary on the recommendation of a friend ca fault anything about the hotel facilities staff food etc all excellent they went out of their way to make us feel welcome with added touches like cupcakes and rose petals in the room easily the best hotel spa we visited too,1
1318,this is a great hotel for a city break in dublin the location was perfect far enough away from the hustle and bustle but still a lovely atmosphere the service was also great everyone we met was very friendly and welcoming breakfast was super too,1
1319,stayed here for a hen party last week from the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out everyone was just so helpful and lovely hotel is spotless and so modern door staff were so helpful from booking taxis to giving you umbrellas would certainly stay here again,1
1321,the marker is an outstanding and modern facility with outstanding employees gabriel and robert were excellent we felt well cared for during our stay when we walked out of the hotel one day into the rain with raincoats one of the employees ran after us and gave us an umbrella very sweet and thoughtful,1
1322,very good overall but getting access to the rooftop bar was made very difficult and we were told to wait up to mins for access which was excessive and resulted in us going elsewhere this was disappointing as the rooftop bar was a big draw when choosing the marker the hotel itself is lovely and staff were very helpful,1
1323,my husband and i stayed here in june and it is by far our favourite hotel in dublin the weather was fab the weekend we stayed so we spent a couple of hours at the amazing rooftop bar eating drinking and chillaxin in the sun unfortunately the restaurant was booked out for the time we needed evita was on at bord gais and we were going to see robbie williams at aviva so we had room service the rooms are large and well appointed with fabulous views over the square and water the staff were all very friendly and efficient and the breakfast was fab too did get to use the pool but will definitely be back,1
1324,stayed at the marker with two other friends and got a corner room with a sofa bed the room was very spacious and the person sleeping on the sofa bed did feel as if they pulled the short straw we all had a great sleep and a wonderful stay faultless,1
1325,the roads to the hotel are a bit confusing but there are sign had booked valet parking and that all went smoothly there were bottles of water in the car for our journey home which was a nice corridors were quite dark but the room was bed was so comfortable and the air conditioning kept the room a nice temperature the breakfast was lovely good quality produce the staff were helpful and friendly,1
1326,love this property it is an minute walk to city center and a minute walk tho croke park staff was very accommodating and my room was spotlessly cleaned good value hotel and close to all attractions breakfast was included with my rate but that is an area the hotel needs to work on i already booked my stay for my next vacation in ireland,1
1327,from the initial booking checking that the height of our vehicle would fit in the car park amendment to booking through to our two night stay for people we could not have been treated better the staff at this hotel are all so attentive nothing was too much trouble the hotel was spotless and its unusual layout added to the character and experience breakfast is without doubt value for money and sets you up for a day sightseeing early evening drinks on the terrace followed by excellent food in the vaults is also not to be missed if your lucky enough to be served by hazel and brendan you are in for a real treat especially great if you have children thank you for making our short break such a good one,1
1328,firstly the building is beautiful and quirky and kept spotlessly clean the staff are friendly and obliging the food is delicious the beds are comfortable the bar provides a lyrical and lively irish welcome what more can i say come to dublin and stay here even when it rains and it does you wo regret it,1
1330,i have sent three nights at this hotel in fact it is lots of georgian houses turned into a hotel this was very well done and is well complimented by the furniture and decor in the various common rooms downstairs the hotel is well served by lifts reception was extremely helpful and even cared without being asked to to book us the tour we would have liked to go which had to be done on line as it was too late in the room was very clean and spacious though not large was equipped with tv safe and facilities breakfast was reasonable not a grand choice but enough service in the restaurant was location is just off a main street and though not too central is very conveniently located both for shopping and to visit the main tourist sites around minutes walking distance was a very pleasant stay in a very pleasant hotel i would not hesitate to recommend the hotel,1
1331,we stayed at the castle hotel for two nights before a trip around ireland with a bus tour the castle hotel was the best hotel of our entire trip the breakfast satisfied the whole family including my two teenagers our flight arrived early but they were able to secure our luggage in a facility while we toured dublin it a short walk down to most of the sights and one of the hop on and off tour bus stops is right across the street,1
1332,when we decided to make a last minute trip to ireland we had to decide what sort of room to book we checked out a few sites where you can rent a room house or hotel we opted for the castle hotel because it was convenient included a full irish breakfast and had room for an odd number when traveling our room included a twin and one double roomy enough for our breakfast was a great way to start the day they do mention that certain hours are particularly busy so we were sure to get up early to beat the crowds breakfast included eggs bacon sausage mushrooms tomatoes beans assortment of breads jams and irish butter fruit juice and were included you could go up for night we went to dinner downstairs as it included live music we had their pasta the first night which was heaping bowls served the of us and the night we had the irish stew which was excellent the hamburger with frits was also great the first night we had regular western soft rock but the night was irish music both with one musician it was a fun way to end our evening the food was excellent and reasonably priced and the staff was exceptional always serving with a smile and very helpful the cost for nights was on the pricey side but because we booked so last minute our options were limited if we had more time and more options we might have,1
1336,my husband i stayed here last august for our day vacation we loved the location the staff were so accommodating the uniqueness of this hotel was so nice from the decor to the layout it was almost as if it were a maze as it seems to be made up of a bunch of buildings that have been made into the rooms were clean not fancy but comfortable we were looking for luxury on this trip as we were out and about all day long breakfast here was awesome it was included in our room rate we especially loved to go to the vault downstairs for some entertainment or for a pint of guinness after our day of exploring we fully intend to visit ireland again and we would definitely stay here at this location,1
1337,this was the cheapest hotel i could find in dublin given that i did want to take the hostel route the staff went out of their way to be helpful i had a tour that meant i would miss breakfast which is served from but you can get an earlier continental breakfast if you ask beforehand furthermore i needed to print out my boarding pass so sent it to them by email and they printed one copy sent to my room and another at reception i liked how the breakfast was served by staff but you still had the choice to choose what you wanted a wide choice and good quality rooms are a little tired but it is a three star hotel there is no air conditioning which means it can get a little warm in the summer the corridors have a lot of character and you feel obliged to stop and see what is on the walls and to sit in the various reception rooms the location just off street is very helpful just minutes walk from temple bar etc and close to bus stops for the i would definitely recommend staying here,1
1338,run down in need of repairs no charm except the reception area and overall lackluster experience at best roof was leaking from the upstairs shower in a waterfall elevator down all day busted furniture in room wet paint signs left up for days when dry anyway dirty towel reused it was a horrible stay in an amazing city that brought our overall trip down a notch there are so many charming options in dublin look elsewehre,0
1339,online booking at am the current day of my arrival when i arrived at the hotel at pm and the room were ready the room is a great room with larges windows on the corner of parnell square east and gardiner row large and very tidy room including an ensuite bathroom welcoming mattress anyway the main streets are quite noisy and busy and unfortunately the windows are only pane but it wo disturb me cause i a early riser and a night owl continental or full irish breakfast is available,1
1340,room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,0
1341,the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,0
1342,lovely stay at this beautiful hotel min walk from the city centrestaff friendly and cant do enough for you good facilities ironing soaps shoe shine needle and thread kit comfortable room quiet good food choice with two restaurants on site,1
1343,the reception was wonderful the ladies at the front desk were very helpful and kind i arrived not feeling well and they offered to go to the pharmacy for me was very touched the restaurant staff was so sweet and very efficient we enjoyed our stay very much and would a shout out to the vault in the castle hotel we visited the vault a couple of nights during our time in dublin and had the best time the staff is friendly and efficient but the live music is what kept us coming back it was fantastic and genuine thank you for a wonderful time aj and darlene,1
1345,this place was the first of different b that we frequented while in ireland and it was one of our favorites the place has a different feel with multiple levels with twists and turns throughout but it just had that home feel to it the rooms were comfortable and quiet the bar within the hotel had good spirits and music and the breakfast was quite good a short walk to the hop off bus ride start made our traversing of dublin all that more enjoyable highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place while in dublin,1
1347,as others have said the group has done a wonderful job updating this hotel i stayed at the stephen green location earlier this year and it is a bit dated the alexander was an extremely pleasant surprise as i did not know it was under remodel they are still working on the restaurant lobby bar and the floor but i think this is going to be an amazing property when all is completed and the location is superb walkable to everything,1
1349,we stayed here for a night as there was an issue with a flood in the other hotel we were supposed to stay in this one the alexander is definitely the less nice one bathroom was old with mildew room was musty and carpet was old definitely recommend staying in the st stephens location over this one,0
1350,clearly has just been refurbished and has been done to a really high standard rooms beautiful and spacious bathroom beautiful great location not the cheapest but really nice to stay in would like to go back,1
1351,i known this hotel for a long time as my uni used to have formal balls here i recently stayed here and was amazed by the fantastic renovation they have carried out on the rooms real attention to detail and quality you can tell that a lot of money was spent paint job bathrooms carpets and beds were all beautiful as was the lcd tv in the room also great value imo,1
1352,we only stayed here for one night they did make a hash of the room as we wanted a twin and they gave us a double they did correct it quickly then there was a knock on the bedroom door within a half hour of us getting to the room and the person seemed surprised it was occupied she did apologise but did say why she knocked on the door but saying that the rooms are lovely the bathrooms are great and the beds are brilliant they were very comfortable and unusually we both slept most of the night would definitely stay here again,1
1353,disaster wifi is very very weak there is an arctic duvet on the bed few employees speak english there are no soap dishes anywhere and they use powdered eggs at breakfast i mentioned the heavy duvet after check in asking for only sheets with a light blanket and four days later it has not been changed we have three people and two facecloths there is also no retractable clothesline to hang damp clothes with such a good location the right manager could turn this into a jewel if you open the windows to get air you get loud pub noise at night and squalking birds from am so you wake up drenched in sweat from the north pole duvet it is july front desk is unresponsive,0
1354,great hotel location rooms renovated were very nice did not try any food service manager was very nice friendly one of best rooms that we stayed in ireland plenty of electrical outlets for charging phone computer,1
1356,an otherwise pleasant experience was overshadowed by the fact that the room was like an indian hotbox we requested and received an extra fan but to no avail its not uncommon in ireland to not have air conditioners in the rooms however there should at least be a window that opens all the way the staff was pleasant enough though the bar did close a bit too early its too bad this is a great location in the heart of dublin,0
1358,i booked this hotel for one night it was booked for adults and children but when we got there they only had a double room so we stayed in the room with one double bed the staff was very unwelcoming and rude the rooms was small and very warm u could open the small window because of the noise outside the fridge did work it did cool the food my son was sick and the staff was so unhelpful they told me to clean it myself and if the room ca be booked out again until they can bring in cleaners because the housekeeping only hoover the floor i will be charged a extra night or,0
1359,fantastic position convenient to walk to a lot of the places of interest and wonderful staff helpful and friendly we unfortunately were there during the hot weather and the room was very hot to walk into but there was a fan supplied and the room did cool down,1
1360,the location is great but we found the facilities lacking they do really have a restaurant but share an entrance with the pub next door which provides their meals the single beds were extremely uncomfortable the room was hot we had to leave a door open to draw to draw a draft from the small window and the two fans provided barely moved any air the first refrigerator in our room had the plug cut off they replaced the plug and the light worked but it did cool so they brought in another one that barely cooled we had been told we have a the view was of other roofs and exhaust vents that made it so noisy we wanted to close the window but could because of the heat and some one was apparently recycling glass nearby because several times we would hear what sounded like someone dumping a barrel full of bottles the sink had two faucets so the only way to mix the water to the desired temperature was in the bowl of the sink which we thought went out over years ago some of the staff were great but some were rude on sunday we tried to call the front desk several times with no answer when we went down they said our phone must not be working but then called us moments later also on sunday despite being out of the hotel from about until after our room was not cleaned otherwise the cleaning was,0
1361,always try and stay here when we visit dublin as the apartments are bigger than a hotel room for the kids staff are always helpful and pleasant to deal with only downside is the joke of prices of temple bar we stayed just after coming into dublin airport from portugal and the service you receive there verses here is so different we paid double the difference in temple vs portugal rip of ireland at its best that why staying here balances out the difference thank you for a great stay and see you again,1
1362,very friendly helpful staff had a bit of a mix up with concert tickets and they were more than helpful at the front desk made us feel comfortable and welcome reasonable price too lovely bedrooms and very quiet,1
1363,very good hotel that i would definitely recommend staff was incredibly nice and knowledgable about the area hotel rooms were very clean and the bathroom was heavenly location of the hotel was perfect for walking everywhere,1
1364,very enjoyable stay the staff are very welcoming nothing is a problem the rooms were very clean and the bed was so comfortable great food big bottles of tipperary water is a nice touch rooms are very quiet perfect,1
1365,stayed at this gorgeous boutique hotel in temple bar dublin extremely helpful and friendly staff each time we went to reception they would ask if we were ok for directions to anywhere and very helpful for tourist information very convenient location to the night life in the temple bar area beautiful room although the mattresses could do with an upgrade as they were a bit uncomfortable but that was the only thing to find fault with in this lovely hotel very clean and modern decor and attached to oscars bar which was also lovely,1
1367,worst hotel i have stayed in there no ac holes in the door holes in bathtub dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till am someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous it probably has really good bones and could be redone as a boutique hotel the staff on the other hand was very kind when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air would recommend this to anyone,0
1369,this hotel looks like a converted grand house in a posh part of town there are many period features with some very like in decor at first it looked inviting but then not very coordinated the room was very dated it had a period fireplace but a shabby wardrobe the lovely white sheets covered a poorly spring mattress not very comfortable for sleeping the period like bathroom features looked lost next to plastic door showers with shower heads that did not function well and shaving sockets that felt loose and did not workit is probably unusual to complain of barmy summer heat in dublin but you have to when the room is stuffy and lacks any air conditioning there was no extractor fan in the bathroom the open window was the only cool air to my surprise ear plugs were available in the bathroom their use only become apparent in the evening as the night club bar noise reached decibels as recorded on my mobile app this persisted until hours and was punctuated with sirens followed by shouts and incoherent ramblings of drunk party goers this also explained a bouncer on the hotel door when i arrived he asked if i was staying in the hotel does the hotel entrance also lead to the bar in dublin according to the bouncer i booked through a third party i asked the desk about the noise element in the morning there was no answer at and they did tell me that the,0
1370,stayed one night at a hugely overpriced rate got back to hotel at about midnight got to sleep at about made complaint at about to night manager mark who was very nice it must be said about the noise as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably i was aware of the nightclub when i made the booking and was prepared to be awake till around but is ridiculous nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle room faced onto the street and the windows are not double glazed the noise from the street coupled with the noise from the nightclub was deafening on checkout i refused to pay the full fee and without even coming to meet me and apologise the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount now while i appreciated the gesture the reduction only brought the charge down to the nightly rate which in my opinion is still overpriced this is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night and only get a little bit of sleep not for anyone who is going to bed,0
1371,lovely olde worlde hotel spotlessly clean very nice rooms the decor is amazing could believe how many people were at the nightclub under the hotel on a tuesday evening could of been a pint offers security on door on an evening to stop people from club wandering into hotel great cooked breakfast next morning good choice of continental as well only fault i could pick beware the windows open very very wide be careful if you have children,1
1373,this was the biggest mistake i have made on my trip to ireland please learn from my mistake this place must make money on the bar only it did not look like they put any money into the hotel itself the sour smell in the room was horrible the twin beds leaned to one side had to use a pillow to stop from rolling off the bed cramped small the bathroom was so small you had to turn sideways to get into the shower that did not have hot water the music and young kids started lining up at for a night of fun do worry but they were leaving but then again the staff would start putting the empty kegs on the street at sooo enjoy the hours of sleep food was not hot or tasty the dining room was a makeshift coat check at night made sure it still had a wonderful aroma in the morning for breakfast please note pay the extra few dollars and find a better only plus side walking distance to down town,0
1375,spent three days at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it breakfast was very good and as much as you wanted staff very friendly and could do enough to help yes it is noisy at night time due to the night club at the back that why we requested a room on the top floor also lots of security around at night time in case of any trouble would definitely return,1
1376,hopfully someone contemplating this hotel reads this and saves themselves the hassel i never written a review for a hotel but here i am writing my first review on my way to a new for two nights and checked out after a couple of hours due to the extremely loud music of their downstairs reception told me it would continue until and they offer ear you looking for a hotel room where you want to sleep before this is it,0
1377,shabby run down room sheets stank of smoke shower door had to be held shut to prevent flooding the bathroom blaring music from nightclub kept me awake until ear plugs in bathroom did help because my bed was literally vibrating from the music this hotel may be good value and right in the heart of dublin but it not suitable for business travellers who value their sleep and appreciate small creature comforts when away from home,0
1378,the location was good for what we needed on the nightfirst impression is good but the let down is when we got to the room room key was working bathroom was run down and shabby as was the bedroom definitely needs to be proof windows great for outside noise but noise in hotel due to krystle nightclub went on till about even though are provided not much well the scrambled eggs were just terrible hash brown over done as were the sausages croissants were also overcooked brown and dryon handing back the breakfast to the waitress she even commented on the eggs and reported the returned breakfast to the chef who sent her back into the kitchen with the plate last we heard or seen of the food no apologise or asked if we would like anything else the breakfast chef serving the hot food spent the majority of his time on his mobile phone,0
1380,we stayed one night in june after a tour of ireland i have to say that we had the best sleep at this hotel than any of the others we encountered it is centrally located easy to get to the luas train and walking over to shopping areas do let the area fool you it is a great little hotel very clean friendly and helpful staff,1
1381,good hotel just on the outskirts of town next to the park bus station just across the road along with the tram would go back nice little hotel also you get a free continental breakfast also free wifi and a good pizza shop just a cross the road with a few shops,1
1383,stayed here for two nights close to attractions and buses easy to find and bus from airport just stops around the corner staff are friendly and helpful very clean and tidy beds are comfy also restaurant down stairs is pricey and would be my only complaint,1
1384,the location is great next to the train station and public transportation the bus stop of to the airport is right next to the train station the breakfast is simple but i have no complaints because of the good price the room is clean and comfortable they gave me a quiet room,1
1385,exactly what it says on the tin the hotel is very pricey so do expect star luxury however it is right in the centre of temple bar so ideal for that the room was to a good standard and always kept clean daily however many improvements could be made but can not complain with the price we it is above a very busy bar i did hear this once during our stay but we were on the floor ideal for those who are planning on spending much time in the hotel and want to be right in the heart of temple bar,1
1386,my daughter and i stayed at this hotel last week and we liked it quite well it was clean the staff friendly and the breakfast was good and we didnt need to stop for a lunch break as breakfast was filling the view was great too we were on the third floor and we saw and heard lots of seagulls and life going by on the millenium and ha penny bridges which were directly opposite the hotel the location was great you could go nearly everywhere on foot as it is very near to nearly all the attractions one negative review for people who tend to have dufficulty sleeping is that there is a pub under the hotel so there is a lot of noise till about in the morning however when one books one is told when booking that there will be noise in the evening till the early hours of the morning so one knows what to expect in our case we both slept well as after a long day of sightseeing shopping and ending the day with a beer or two we were usually tired out all in all we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to be within easy reach of main attractions,1
1388,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,0
1389,needed a for coldplay concert and saw leeson inn on for just under for night the fotos looked good and felt that for the price it must be good the reality was a dirty hole damp walls black spot all over curtains dirty brown carpet with car mats strategically covering stains badly broken glass in front window that permanently rattled noise from street all night the beds never seen a bed arrangement like it i could go on but could give the place any more airtime i would say that if you had a big smelly dog and needed to stay in an inn this would be the one as it has the ambiance of a dog kennel,0
1390,the hotel is in need in refurb the bathrooms especially but the staff at the hotel are very good people dec from behind the bar is a great asset to the hotel very friendly and welcoming and always going above and was a good selection of food at breakfast and a bar menu at dinner served a good selection of food i would visit the hotel again as the price is a good the rooms are ok and the staff are great,1
1391,we had a great stay at this hotel the staff where very friendly the breakfast where great could ask for more staff where very helpfulthe rooms where clean and a beautiful view we where more then happy and would visit again,1
1392,myself and my sister stayed here as we were in dublin for a concert the decor really needs a bit of tlc but the food and the staff are commendable i would have rated it out of apart from the decor,1
1393,we wanted a cheap hotel that offered free parking that was between town and marlay park so this hotel was perfect as other reviews have stated decor could do with updating especially the bathroom in the room but for the price paid and the fact that there was free parking which is rare we could complain bus to town right outside the door too,1
1395,i stayed at stauntons on the green for a single overnight stop in dublin and the hotel was convenient for all of the things i to do before moving on the staff was very friendly and helpful and though the room was older it was clean and tidy breakfast was great only note is that there is no parking but there is a parking garage on the northwest side of the green that will give you a discounted rate for an stay with a stamp from the hotel on your parking ticket the location is convenient to a number of restaurants and pubs just east of stephen green and apart from stephen green itself it also possible to reach a number of sites of interest such as patrick cathedral from the hotel on foot overall good value for the room service and location right in downtown dublin,1
1396,wonderful location to get to all the sites loved walking daily through st stephen green family room was great with the two rooms and two bathrooms fantastic full breakfasts friendly knowledgable and attentive staff especially katie and jake old world charm,1
1397,we stayed at stauntons on a saturday night before heading to the airport the service was great the porter met us at the taxi and brought all of our bags in we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the day we were early when we returned our bags had been brought up to our room hooray we were on the second floor and as folks have noted there is no lift our room was beautiful we were in a triple with our young daughter the bathroom was beautiful and we appreciated the deep tub and plush towels at about the music started there was an outdoor concert in the park next door and it was loud our room faced the back garden the concert was nathan carter and it was great instead of being miffed we were happy to have a front row seat to this wonderful concert breakfast was not included in our rate but we went anyway because breakfast is tough to find early on a sunday service was very good always tough to pay full price for a full breakfast for a five year old but that was fine check out was easy and a taxi was called and promptly came to take us to the only beef and this is for irish hotels in general it was warm and without a top sheet only a duvet it was tough to get comfortable,1
1398,the building is georgian and i liked the location reception area and the sitting areas the breakfast included fresh fruit salad and a variety of breads and full irish breakfast was very well cooked and presented and the menu offered a choice including smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and also my room small i was comfortable and everything was clean i had booked a single but the room had a double bed which pleased me i did see that there were spacious double rooms available,1
1399,i was very pleased with my stay at stauntons on the green the staff was friendly and went out of their way to help with my luggage directions and restaurant ideas regrettably i was only there for one night the room was comfortable clean and well appointed i could easily have stayed a week,1
1400,the hotel is easy to find food in the bar was lovely the room itself was clean but would really benefit from a bit of tlc new windows we were on the second floor so the unit was loud there were building works at the back of the hotel which were quite loud with the single glaze windows and paint to cover bad patches on the walls the highlight of our stay was definitely the staff they could have been more helpful in every way from printing maps for us to the bar staff declan was a real tonic and seemed to be popular with all the guests,1
1401,we stayed at the tara towers hotel last hotel was conveniently located yo ucd walking distance to where we had our staff was very helpful and was sumptuous loved bus and dart stations were place to and comfy,1
1402,rooms are big beds are confortablecontinental breakfast okclean of bathrooms and bedroom okthe for going to the centre of dublin is in front of the hotelall the bedrooms have view to the see,1
1403,this hotel is a major dump some of the staff not all there was one young man who was so helpful in finding us a taxi after telling us that uber does have enough cars there were so rude and disinterested they should really find another job the room had lights that were broken some hanging out of the ceiling one of the night tables had a handle pulled off so they simply drilling another hole to the right and put another in the shower was built for people tall and the floor of the bathtub was so slippery that my year old niece fell and thought she broke her leg it is a terrible hotel pay a little more and stay somewhere else,0
1404,a hotel that can be reached by all means of transport from the airport we used the airport shuttle express in just minutes you will be infront of the hotel in about minutes you can be in street by the frequent buses they pass from just outside the hotel nos and just beside the hotel there is a food store which is open hours and a petrol station if you are to be using a hired car regarding the hotel it is clean with good breakfast the only problems were our room had a really noisy really headache bathroom extractor if somebody uses the bathroom at night he wakes up the rest we arrived saturday after and when we went down again at about and asked for the restaurant the receptionist told us that its till she should have told us when we arrived we had to go outside looking for a restaurant by walk but on the other hand when we needed to go out very early for our excursions they made us a good packed lunch thank you for heather and hannah they were very helpful,1
1405,before dublin prices rocketed i used to stay in the shelbourne but the room price now well out of reach so looked around and found stauntons it like a mini shelbourne quaint but spotlessly clean location just as good no long walks or lifts necessary and room is a minute from the front desk ca fault it completely recommend for business or pleasure trips,1
1406,booked this at the last minute based on price and location very happy with the decision the hotel was clean and comfortable and all the staff were freindly and helpful nice touches in the room coffee machine biscuits bottled water and mints would happily stay again,1
1407,the location is perfect close enough to the busy downtown far enough to have quite the hotel is clean the staff was very helpful and friendly breakfast not included unless you purchase it before hand a five minute walk to the buses tour bus airport bus perfect,1
1408,this is a quirky little hotel on the north side of the river liffey something to understand especially if it your first time in dublin is that the south side of the river is considered a little more up market than the north side that being said the hotel was good for what you paid and not run down just be aware there is a stigma attached to the north side we were on the floor and the elevator only goes to the so we had to go the last floor on a small creaky set of stairs the room we were in had a double and single bed with an en suite bathroom and over looked a courtyard so it was relatively quiet the staff was super friendly and check in went smoothly in addition the staff was attentive as we were coming and going there are a lot of restaurants coffees shops and shopping within a few minute walk also there is a major bus stop right outside the hotel for easy access to public transportation and is about a minute walk to the airlink to the airport the only negative is that the wifi would come and go in our room overall i would stay here again and it a perfect hotel for travelers,1
1409,we stayed for nights in july it a sweet little hotel in a great location everything is a short walking distance the staff was attentive and sweet there coffee machine and a kettle for tea in the room the complementary goody bag they left us for the concert was a beautiful gesture if you book breakfast on the night before you get a discount,1
1410,we booked a two bedroom apartment absolutely brilliant we were near street right in the heart of the city we will definitely book staff were extremely helpful and pleasant the only problem was having to walk quite a way as the apart ent was not in the actual hotel,1
1411,hotel is perfectly located within minutes walking distance of all the major attractions very clean and specious room very helpful and friendly staff can highly recommend this hotel good value for money for hotel in the city centre,1
1412,we stayed one night here in advance of a ferry trip and found it well located and happy to have our dog poppy which is always in all hotels which profess themselves to be dog friendly our room was clean and had a good sized bed there was a bit of noise from their bar next door but this was to be expected on a saturday had to leave early so missed breakfast but the kitchen had arranged for a packed breakfast for us to take ate in the restaurant and were allowed to take our dog with were friendly and helpful,1
1413,the first time i stayed at this hotel was on a friday to saturday as soon as you walk in this hotel feels very homely the staff are welcoming and friendly i had special religious requirements and the staff we able to accommodate these while being very respectful my stay was so nice that i came back a second time the following week where i stayed for a few more nights the hotel is conveniently located close enough to downtown dublin so you can walk there while being far enough to avoid the hordes of tourists the rooms are comfortable and clean i had one issue with plumbing and the response of the staff was excellent they moved me into another room and provided compensation for the inconvenience this is a professional outfit and yet at the same time personable i would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a convenient friendly and comfortable stay in dublin a special mention to brian garvan at reception who helped out with recommendations for places to eat and visit also ann marie marcela and laura deserve a mention for being so responsive to email enquiries regarding reservations prior to and during the stay,1
1414,the staff were very nice from top to bottom the pub was nice and the breakfast was good the room was dirty and in great need of maintenance do look under the bed the lamp shades were barely hanging on the hot water faucet was loose the shower was leaking and the safe was in operable and broke either they plan on selling the property soon or plan to rent out each room until it ca be rented again the one i was in was very close to this point but on the positive side the location was great they can arrange parking for you about a block away underground and the staff is very nice bring earplugs and an open mind do pay too much and the place will be fine,0
1415,the maldron hotel pearse street is a clean comfortable hotel the hotel is walking distance from city center and about minutes from the dublin bus airlink pearse street station stop making this hotel ideal for a short stay on a long layover front desk staff is excellent and at times provided rooms are available will allow early recommended,1
1417,we had a very nice check in and check out friendly staff rooms were clean beds comfortable close to attractions and bus terminal breakfast was good different cereals eggs bacon toast tea coffee i would recommend this place,1
1418,solid hotel in perfect location at edge of temple bar with clean safe and spacious rooms and good value for money walk out the front door and you are right in the best tourist walking area in dublin,1
1420,stopped in for lunch after walking around the temple bar area meal was large good service was excellent and the staff could not do enough will go back again the bar area was nice plenty of beers on tap and a relaxing place,1
1421,i stayed here for nights recently and found it to be very good for my purposes the location is very close to everything i wanted to see in the central area of dublin and it s very close to the temple bar area i wasn t particularly interested in seeing that aspect of dublin though it was certainly worth walking through it s only a couple of blocks from the liffey river which is also enjoyable to stroll next to the hotel is situated on a very busy street with lots of vehicle and pedestrian traffic this is probably one of the reasons there are very heavy drapes that can be pulled to cover the windows at night i was one floor above ground level so there was a noticeable amount of noise it is not particularly quiet in the early part of the evening when there is a band playing in the bar downstairs and lots of street traffic this seemed to end by each evening so one could get some sleep after condition of the hotel is acceptable though there is very obvious wear and tear as a solo traveler this wasn t really a problem though if she had been with me my girlfriend might not have felt quite as comfortable the room was quite large as was the bathroom which was an aspect i appreciated after having stayed in very small rooms in amsterdam london paris and rome there was a with one of those retractable,1
1422,the loaction of this hotel is perfect really close to everything tge rooms however are pretty basic if not slightly below average it not fancy no fridge no toiletries no ac but they do have a coffee tray also my room view was facing a wall but i sure there are better ones if you ask worked perfectly in the staff were amazing very friendly helpful and nice also their bar legend bar is perfect great service and staff,1
1423,the parliament hotel is the location you want walking distance to grafton st temple bar area the river liffey is a bar on the main floor with friendly staff where you can also get your free breakfast if in the morning staff informed us the hotel will be going through major renovation as it was recently purchased and the last bookings were set for july which is a good thing as the floors and rooms are works fine in all locations i went to elevator is slow so you will likely end up taking the stairs as you will beat it every is though you will get a discount ticket that gives you almost off when you go to get your car two blocks away be ready to test your driving skills at the parking lot as the the spots are incredibly tight and you will see people trying several times to make it would stay again as i mentioned earlier the location was ideal,1
1424,we stopped for a drink during the day whilst walking around and went back in the evening just to watch the irish dancing and listen to the music friendly place large area so plenty of seating and was an enjoyable evening better than being on temple bar area which is much busier and more rowdy,1
1425,not brilliant rooms thread bare carpets on main stairs smells of damp in the stairwellwardrobes knocked up by inept carpenters bathroom had mildew on bath surrounds and the sink was sunk into what seemed to be an excuse of some old piece of kitchen work surface radiators were grubby rusty plaster falling out of wall supports good attempt to hide that behind the curtains folks advice for prospective guests avoid room advice for owners sort it out and put a bit of your profits back into your business all this for for two nights room only welcome to the rip off parliament hotel,0
1426,we normally stay a little way out of the city centre when we visit dublin but as were in town we had struggled to find accommodation and the parliament hotel turned out to be the most affordable option we could find hotel prices had inflated everywhere in town by at least however we were disappointed the location of the hotel is excellent on the edge of temple bar which we normally avoid like the plague so really accessible without being ridiculously busy and loud i slept really well on the third floor with the window open even with the fan in the room it would have been too warm and stuffy without there was very little noise though yes the walls are thin and floorboards creak could hear the music from the bar at all the doors slam a little too easily i suppose but that down to other guests not treating people with the level of respect that we afforded them when coming and going from the room the staff are approachable and personable and the downstairs has a pleasant atmosphere free entertainment in the evenings and is badly priced we ate there the first evening and the food was excellent the hotel has already stated on here that they are having a refurb in the coming months so i wo comment on the decor other than to say it just a bit tired the bed however i will not have a bad word said against yes it two,1
1427,there must be or maldron hotels in dublin this just south of the river towards the port pearce street is one of the main streets heading towards the centre nothing at all special about it but it a direct minutes walk to bridge temple bar or grafton hotel is modern well equipped nice rooms great buffet breakfast and if you lucky you may be able to get parked in the along the front tend to be fairly noisy especially early morning,1
1428,this hotel was clean and the rooms large however it really is near anything so you either have to walk quite a ways or take a taxi the hotel does have and traveling in july it was quite warm since our room looked out into a courtyard we could get any airflow windows only opened about at the most we opened our room door but they had painted the hall and fumes were overwhelming everything great other than lack of or a fan,1
1429,firstly i advise anyone booking the hotel to do it through as my partner and i had know where booked we just were going to see what was available so i searched the different sites when we arrived at the hotel i asked for two nights stay and reception told me no problem that would be plus another for parking i explained about how it was cheaper on so receptionist told me to go book it online i got the to nights bed n breakfast and parking for hotel was very comfortable shower was fantastic i want like that breakfast was brill set you up for the everything was in walking distance we will definitely stay again,1
1430,walk of about ten minutes to red bus good hotel clean and updated wonderful staff was very accommodating and efficientgood location in town for those who like to stroll restaurant is very nice with fresh veggies good food and fast staff,1
1433,we were street facing and although the part revellers were expected the constant noise of lorries unloading beer barrels street cleaners and the like kept us awake all night the staff were very helpful there really is nothing they can do about the noise the owners need to address the lack of air conditioning and windows the rooms need modernising but if you are staying for just one night or two it a great location breakfast was nothing special i would have liked a traditional full irish but it was more like an english chain hotel reception staff very helpful,0
1435,blooms hotel excellent location possibly is the main reason i rate the hotel as good coz it within minutes walk to airport bus stops sightseeing tour bus stop visitor centre temple bar area minutes walk to bridge and shopping street within mins walk to christ church cathedral st patrick cathedral within mins walk to guinness jameson and other shopping area totally no hassle for the location staffs were friendly helpful and fast every time we needed to call taxi welcome free guinness at vat pub was nice and we even ordered oyster mussels chicken wings which were expensive at all room is a bit old dusty and could be a bit noisy from the street at night sometimes but consider hotels are generally expensive in dublin blooms hotel would be the one which does smash your credit card and still offers excellent location decent pub restaurant with okay room,1
1436,very lucky with location not too far from pubs and shops unfortunately the windows are single pane so the noise from below is quite audible i suggest ear plugs if you need it quiet whilst you sleep hey we very helpful provided us with a fan as it was fairly warm at were even given drink vouchers each to have at the vat bar which is next door guinness larger or baileys two of us had a larger shandy for no extra cost is not included though for an irish breakfast but there are coffee shops and a tesco extra across the main road,1
1437,we stayed here for nights very comfortable stay we were concerned it maybe noisy but we were pleasantly surprised as our room was very quiet room and beds clean and comfortable bathroom very clean the bar attached provided some night time entertainment will definitely return,1
1439,great hotel on the doorstep of all the vibrant pubs of temple bar min walk from the river liffey all local buses and tour buses within a few yards lovely breakfast in the floor restaurant entertainment every night in the vat bar in the hotel look forward to coming back some day,1
1441,i seldom post an unfavourable review preferring to deal directly with the restaurant or hotel reference saturday we had occasion to overnight in dublin checked my favourite websites and for last minute price and location hotel seemed to fit the bill central and at very cheap indeed for dublin in july arrival our reservation made and paid for a few hours earlier was confirmed but we were asked for euros cash as a deposit for any room damage well travelled at years of age we were astonished at this request indicating that we were reluctant to stay at an establishment where the guests obviously trashed or ransacked the were advised that it was unusual for the charge to be levied but it was the managers idea and the reception staff could not get the policy were however advised that had we used an alternative website to book there would have been no charge which mystified us were given vouchers for a free drink at the bar at at check inwhen we looked at them later they expired at the room was adequate but when i dropped an earring on the bathroom floor i gave up the search early on as the discovery of a less than clean floor left me feeling a little illthe final insult came at checkout when we were advised that there was a chargeof two euros per bag if we wishedtoleave our small overnight bag with them for a few hours we felt sorry for all,0
1442,not impressed rude reception staff extremely rude manager myself two friends stayed in blooms as we attended a concert in dublin when we arrived back at hotel after our night out it took the doorman about minutes to answer the door there was anyone on the reception desk or answering the we were three women in a part of town who did appreciate being locked out at that hour of the night approximately it is safe anywhere the breakfast was horrible and i had to ask times for some ice for the oj as it was just sitting out all morning this hotel is a pure tourist trap and they should be ashamed to be changing people to stay there never again i wrote a review on their facebook page and they did i noticed that they only replied to which there were many of,0
1443,i was here in may it located right on the edge of temple bar and from my room i barely heard any noise at night it within walking distance of so many sights i was in dublin for three days and walked everywhere except for my visit to the gaol at which time i took the bus speaking of buses the one from the airport brings you within steps of the hotel i counted if i get back to dublin again i will definitely stay here,1
1445,the hotel is very central to the nightlife got there early and our room was ready which was a bonus the room was basic but clean unfortunately outside there was an air con unit which went off at regular intervals which did disturb our sleep it was better with the window shut but it was hot weather and we were melting no air con in the room what also did help was the amount of construction going on in the area but that was the hotels fault and it was very noisy the bar attached was nice and the food looked nice although we did partake only breakfast which was a buffet and was plentiful and tasty all in all the staff were polite and helpful and i would more than likely stay here again,1
1446,i called blooms this morning and spoke to grainne in reservations who was very plesant and professional my request was for a single room and grainne bet all the famous websites on price this i was surprised at bit she did it great work grainne,1
1447,myself and my husband stayed here lastnight and it was honestly the worst hotel we ever stayed in and we have stayed in many hotels over the time i never usually do reviews but feel the need to save someone else their money it mentions there is a nightclub but they do not give away the extent of the noise disturbances caused our room was literally vibrating it felt like we trying to sleep on the dancefloor i complained to the guy on reception and he could have cared less i got the impression from the staff that they are just there to do the transaction no attentiveness or presence about them at all i all for casual hotels but when they lose sight of customer satisfaction then it just leaves you angry that you spent your money there instead of a nicer hotel that actually cares about your experience for us it was a night away from our baby and crappy nights sleeps at home but instead we got an even crappier nights sleep they should at least offer cheaper rates for the lower floor levels that are most affected anyway to cut a long story short go somewhere else,0
1448,our room was very small but clean and comfortable and adequately catered to our needs all the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful and we were made to feel hotel is in a fantastic position for exploring dublin and all it attractions,1
1450,loved the vat pub traditional irish music after from somewhere pounding driving music from nearby venue kept us awake all night long front desk was interested the next day when i reported it it more like a hostel taxi driver had had an ominous smirk when he dropped us off now i know why,0
1452,stayed at this hotel with a friend it was right by temple bar so it was positioned in such a great location the staff on reception were very helpful and we enjoyed the free entrance to club m worth a stay it has its own pub within the hotel and we were given a drinks token on arrival to get a free drink,1
1453,stayed here twice now and both times have been rooms are nice enough clean decent size and have everything you vat house pub downstairs is a nice of the night type place to have or before you set off however the true beauty of the hotel lies in the location right in the heart of templebar making the night life only a short walk away in all returning to dublin this is definitely the first place i would look to book,1
1454,this is a great hotel expensive but we got a good deal on a website provider the rooms were clean with pleasant staff the hotel is massive and quite posh my boyfriend and i got upgraded to the executive suite aswell which was amazing get the breakfast for which is absolutely amazing value as you get so much with it would come again,1
1455,stayed here for nights while on a visit to dublin hotel was spotless staff were warm and friendly room was lovely and bed was very comfy with crisp white bed linen great location with both dart and bus service on your doorstep the only thing missing was a fridge in the room however it was available on request will definitely be back well done to all a very comfortable stay,1
1457,unless you in town for a quick overnight you should find another option rooms totally outdated no air conditioning bad wifi connection no channel options on tv no ventilation in bathrooms worse coupled with hot week and no air expensive breakfast that is much better than a free continental breakfast no fridge in rooms front desk staff is friendly but did not get the same impression from the staff in the dubliner restaurant attached large amount of inviting seating space in the great because it much cooler than the rooms when it hot excellent concierge staff who help with the usual tourist stuff info about airport trips and getting taxis excessive bar smoke in the evenings if you staying in rooms with windows open above the restaurant,0
1459,clean hotel pleasant staff only fault was not being aware of construction work nearby which woke us very early each morning when we were away also breakfast not included in our price which may even have been a nice guesture considering we chose there as a rest period from work and not pre warned about the noise overall a lovely hotel,1
1460,most of the staff we encountered during our tour were absolutely brilliant and this place was no exception the staff were genuinely just plain nice they were also very good at their jobs so when you get to the tired and frustrated stage after a busy and tiring day touring then this place was just plain worth was also had taps that were easy to use they had a hot tap and a cold tap that mixed in the pipes and you did get scalded trying to use we had a very comfortable although i do have one bone to pick with the staff and that is the the staff took our baggage out the front door but refused to assist our drive with loading the bus this was the only aspect that i really could fault and did make me a little angry considering the amount of money they get paid by our tour did affect the rest of the service,1
1463,my wife and i arrived on july with a child and others off price was supposed to be at reception we were charged on asking why it costed more i was told it was because of the exchange rate doubt that this would have fluctuated by also time i have ever had to pay to park in the hotel car park which cost honestly though the rooms were a bit grubby and dated we we told that we had been upgraded to an executive room as there was construction work going on next door we were grateful of this however if we stayed in an executive room i would want to see the standard room found the staff quite rude in the breakfast in all not a grate experience will not be back,0
1464,stayed for one night the hotel looks good from the outside and reception area but as soon as you go in halls leading to rooms its like you stepped back in time to the rooms very dated we booked an executive room only difference it seems was the bed was bigger building site to the rear of the hotel so its very noisy from,0
1465,i am here for days yesterday the wifi did not work at all today it is intermittent either way it is not possible to work at breakfast today i had scrambled egg on toast with beans and the eggs and beans were cold which is a bit much given that breakfast costs so with not wifi no safe in the room and cold breakfast not great stay elsewhere,0
1467,we stayed nights on arrival no offer of any help with the bags and it only got worse staff decidedly unhappy in most areas breakfast was busy but again staff inattentive the hotel itself was tired and clearly ready for redevelopment which was happening on almost every side of the hotel avoid if possible as there are much better hotels nearby,0
1469,ballsbridge hotel is in a wonderful location close to the city centre but far enough away from the hustle and bustle i picked this hotel because of this i arrived much too early for our check in but the staff were extremely accommodating and i was in my room less than minutes later a huge thank you to steven at reception who was the most amazing help to me making sure our stay would be as relaxing and luxurious as possible very friendly and personable putting me in a great mood for the rest of the day and having very enjoyable light hearted conversation while he sorted out our room could not have asked for a better hotel and a better person to check us in absolutely superb customer service from steven and comfortable spacious have enjoyed my time here can not go wrong booking this hotel and i will definitely be coming back,1
1470,it is a nice hotel but it could do with a revamp getting a little run down looking rooms are nice and big shower not great power was good but heat kept altering no shower creaky to open we were unfortunate that there was building going on right across from our room and it started really early in the morning breakfast was nice but could do with staff been more informative a lot of people had to ask for coffee and tea to be told they had to help themselves from a particular area the pot of coffee i got was cold no member of staff enquired at any time if we were ok the meal in the dubliner was nice good price and nice staff not sure if i would stay again but rumour has it that it may not be there for long,1
1471,nice hotel and well located for aviva stadium a short walk to the left when coming out of the hotel leads you to and a few shops if you go straight ahead you have a walk of about minutes to st stephen grafton street and you can enjoy the georgian of shops and restaurants along the way our room for people was well fitted out and had most things that are required but no mini bar to keep drinks cool the bed was a proper bed beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet overnight our room overlooked a construction site which became noisy at there is no air conditioning but a fan was provided fixtures and furnishings were generally good quality although our room had a stain on the carpet shampoo and shower gel are provided but not conditioner we stayed room only at a price of euro which was annoying when our friends stayed a few days earlier for a price of euro wifi was good we decided not to have breakfast at a cost of euro each we walked elsewhere and had breakfast for the of us for a total of euro the bar was expensive euro for a pint and a vodka it is a nice hotel but would only stay here again if attending the aviva stadium and i think that when there is an event at the aviva the hotel puts their prices up,1
1473,was the only place other than a hostel that we could get booked when attending a robbie williams concert in the aviva stadium and it was expensive but soooo worth it the hotel is within spitting distance of the stadium you can walk to it in about mins unfortunately when we arrived most of the carpark was taken up by a radio tourbus and we had to park nearly half a mile away and walk back with our cases in degree heat but we entered a large luxury air conditioned lobby the male receptionist dealt with us very efficiently and we were on our way to the room in minutes added security of having to use your room key to access the hallway to the elevators and rooms so no random people wandering about the rooms were large and airy very clean the bathroom was big too we didnt get time to try dinner or the bar as it was so busy breakfast the next morning was great wide selection and piping hot buffet the best coffee ive had in a hotel in a long time staff were all lovely so yes its expensive but a great hotel id like to go back when its not jam packed with robbie fans,1
1475,on arrival in dublin our accommodation had been double booked our party of ended up for night at the clayton and the staff could do enough for us the rooms were beautiful and the breakfast was amazing a gentleman called marcus spent the entire saturday morning on the telephone trying to find us another hotel to spend the weekend as the clayton was fully booked eventually marcus found us somewhere and we had a fantastic time all thanks to him his supervisor was also a lovely helpful lady we would all definitely return to this beautiful hotel,1
1476,from the moment i entered i was already impressed this hotel oozes luxury i had so many beautiful photos but due to a dodgy phone i have been unable to retrieve them for this review the staff go above and beyond to make your stay so lovely we received in a room i would personally live in it was so elegantly decorated and absolutely spotless we stayed days and it was cleaned daily on our first evening going for drinks in the bar the receptionist noticed us trying to take photos and offered to take them for us it is so difficult to get a good photo on a couple holiday she was so kind she would have stood there all evening to help us out it was so sweet i being a major rugby fan loved the fact that our room over looked the aviva best was yet to come when we went to breakfast the following morning wow i have never seen such a selection in a hotel every fried food you could possibly think of different varieties of eggs even tough it was buffet it did not taste at all like b b it was batch cooked nothing was soggy or kind of getting cold it was all superb a firm favourite of mine the cold meats and cheeses had an entire section to themselves along with every bread type known to was a banquet not a breakfast the location of the hotel was ideal arena walking,1
1478,stayed overnight at the ballsbridge ready for an early ferry crossing back to the uk the hotel is bright and clean the rooms spacious and very clean and a top notch american bed we wanted to experience dublin so took off on a hike towards temple bar its a good walk what a great cosmopolitan atmosphere the next morning we had to be at the port so wondered if we could get breakfast as they opened at they are very helpful and opened at we were not the only people to take advantage of this early opportunity now this is a proper breakfast just wish we had more time to enjoy the experience one downside is car parking euros is it me car parking should be included if you are paying euros for a night,1
1479,this is a perfectly decent hotel nothing spectacular but pleasant rooms good breakfast and a great location a minute walk up penbrooke takes you past beautiful georgian townhouses to a small community along the canal groceries a few bars good restaurants fast food bakery etc another minutes and you at stephen green all the best of dublin city center just a shortwalk away,1
1480,i do not know where to start day stay booked a classic twin room upon arrival we were informed that we were upgraded to a deluxe twin room visions of luxury came to how i was wrong no one offered to take our bags of which we had very heavy ones which was not too nice after having to walk a while the room looks like an elderly person winter lodge the room was dark and the colours felt heavy and outdated there was marks and chips all over the walls which looked awful the tv was probably the worst tv i seen in the past ten years it was not even digital and for a room that is disappointing furthermore there was no fridge at so if you want a cold drink or a cup of tea or cereal you are going to have to pay more for this and the breakfast is euro pp which is a lot if you want a bowl of rice crispies the room was very warm opening the window offered no relief and there is no air conditioning but i understand it is dublin not dubai the lock on the bathroom door did not work so there was a few close calls the whole establishment is not attractive and the photos are very misleading far nicer hotels in dublin,0
1482,room was clean and big however we stayed on the floor and the wifi was ridiculous after sight seeing and travelling we wanted to contact our families but could not get anything to load at all for the two nights we stayed if you are going to run such a big hotel and we are paying a lot of money to stay there there should be boosters on every floor so this is a problem and everyone can have access to fast loading internet also for the price we are paying for accomodation breakfast should be included the first night we got in after delayed flights we slept in the next morning deciding to head down to breakfast at we payed for full breakfast and once asked if we could get a few things refilled were told that breakfast is nearly over so no we are still paying the same amount of price so things that are requested should be refilled or breakfast should be discounted when checking in we had to fix up our bill which was fine however we were charged an extra aus dollars for the accomodation as they accidentally converted the money exchange after we asked them not to very frustrating stay,0
1484,i arrived in the ballsbridge hotel with very high expectations due to hearing very good things about it from various people however with the hotel being supposedly and so well renowned it was highly disappointing and is at best average in this day and age having wifi at a pace is an absolute disgrace and having to go down to the lobby in the middle of the night to check your messages is a joke despite having full bars of wifi on your device the wifi still will not work i had to go through the hassle of calling reception on multiple occasions to resolve this issue but the staff at reception always turned the sitatuion around to make it seem like i was the one slowing down the wifi the wifi was and not per room so the mere suggestion of the cause of the problem being me and my devices was from this overwhelming techonolgical difficulty the room was clean spacious and there was a tv and a nice ambience in the hotel as a whole however where the room fell short was the lack of although it is available upon request the room service was extremely overpriced for a portion of fish and chips and there was no air conditioning or any sort of temperature control there was also a bit of stinginess with the lgithing as there was no main lgithing fixure in the room only door was also very creaky so much so that my,0
1485,we have recently stayed at the bellagio in vegas and ballsridge hotel was right up there with it huge room welcoming staff great bar with good atmosphere situated just out of the main area of very near the big stadium,1
1487,we chose this hotel for its central location and the reasonable rates the staff welcomed us very friendly and helpful the room was sized ok and was clean enough it had a window to one of the smaller streets noise was an issue they offer parking for next door mall parking which is very everything was in walking distance from here,1
1489,i never written a scathing review in my life but so disappointed with our stay feel i have to try and give a true reflection of this place an over night stay booked as close to ariva stadium cost without breakfast on arrival the hotel was chock a block with football fans not a problem was a nice atmosphere but queuing to check in was painful pleasant enough just not enough of them a quick visit to room on floor to drop bags off shocked by state of the room i honestly stayed in better blackpool b bs on hen nights the walls were filthy not dirty or in need of a spruce they were absolutely black skirting boards had big chunks of wood missing and again dirty beyond words furniture and curtains ok drab and outdated but in ok condition no main light only lamps that did we returned in the evening hotel was still packed with footy fans and after trying to find a table for food we gave up and returned to room to order room service a blt and burger with chips soft drinks euros i could live with that if it was nice deliver on filthy trays and the glass was that dirty i had to use a mug to drink out of food order was wrong and as i have an allergy could eat it chips not cooked so literally ate the burger out of both meals as the thought of trying to wait,0
1490,clearly awaiting its end when lease up room air con not working room smelt damp vent in bathroom not working so after shower couldnt see a thing woke at by work on building site next door not spain but an alleged star in dublin worst hotel i have stayed in for a long time still waiting for the fried eggs i ordered for breakfast at least if they rebadged it as star you could accept this esp if star prices and not the euro plus i paid never ever will i be in this place again,0
1491,this was a good hotel that was close to the city centre which was really convenient we just popped on the tour bus and it took us everywhere we wanted to go the staff were really friendly too the food was tasty and really nice,1
1492,like any travelodge it very convenient to what you want to stay in it was a good location to all the bars and restaurants but not to close where it was on your door step everyone at reception was very helpful would definitely stay again,1
1493,room was reasonable but not worth the and per night shoddy repair work throughout broken mirror covered up with piece of new mirror shower head moving in and out of the window could not be opened very much so the room was very could be best described as disorganised with large amount of tables left unclean after the previous park on arrival day there was plenty of space having returned day i was forced to park on street as the car park was full of match patrons as pay parking commences at i had to relocate my car the following morning at to the hotel car park which when checking out i discovered that they attempted to charge me for x car park stays at a cost of not a good example of a dublin hotel therefore i will chose a different hotel next time,0
1494,the location is central the hotel is basic and clean the room was completely adequate very small but so what the staff were pleasant and efficient there is nothing to complain about for a reasonable price in central dublin just off stephen green,1
1495,fantastic location to walk dublin sights good value for money good room and value safe parking under hotel the staff are all friendly and helpful and the hotel i secure with added car park security of you need in the car park we will use this hotel again,1
1496,dublin seems generally expensive so we choose travel lodge as a budget hotel dublin stephens green is more expensive than most tl but is better than most tl as we had a very nice and large room and bathroom it is very well located just off grafton street not far from the liffey and temple bar you can walk to most places mins maybe to the guinness store house and jamesons distillery for kilmainham prison you will probably need transport and be sure to book in advance,1
1497,stayed on lower level room basic room bathroom door did shut finished to poor standard inside tiling was bodge job and grout was green windows did seal people letting in all of the noise from passers by through out night did sleep friday night in dublin reception did seem interested after we told them of the issues no apology room which was worth it wish i booked something else,0
1498,when i stayed here in june with my friends and they sisters we first got there and could pay by card it had to be the one it was booked on which was very awkward we then stayed a night and cleaned the place up the next morning and a week later told there was been takin of our account when the maximum fee was they had no explanation for it or no proof either and it was cheap to stay in for a night either,0
1499,my sisters and i travelled to dublin on june we choose what we thought was a nice small quiet lodge with an inn type ambience this was to be a trip of a lifetime the room was gorgeous with windows all around and a view of the river liffey however there was a bar just across from us with a big sign on it it said five floors of fun and music as you can imagine my heart sunk when i saw this we tried to sleep that first night sleep which was desperately need as we had travelled at night time no sleep was to be had and when we asked the girl about it she said what did you expect this is temple bar the name meant nothing to us as this was our first time in ireland all three of us took turns trying to explain our predicament to the girl to no avail finally i asked to see the manager who moved us thank goodness to a very small room we did mind as the noise was considerably less my problem is this we contacted eliza lodge with two very polite letters asking for some kind of a credit as we moved from a three person room to a little person room which was considerably cheaper no response whatsoever most of the staff was amazing we were very disappointed,0
1500,this place had gotten fine reviews in my home country but i was still surprised how fresh and clean the rooms were this place is in a good location for exploring dublin and is great value for money only complaints would be that there no elevator and that the pillows were a bit too hard for my taste but hey all in all this is a excellent b b highly recommended,1
1501,very nice and clean hotel with friendly staff breakfast very nice location perfect as it was close to shopping streets railway station and croke negative things were that walls were not very thick so you could hear noise from other rooms also we were given a very small room but this was ok,1
1503,there were a few notes and notices from management about people who complain etc but i do see what they would be complaining about we had a lovely twin room ensuite car parking extra clean tidy great for the price could walk to most places in half an hour,1
1504,what a wonderful quirky hotel great transport links into the city good value accommodation with witty comments everywhere excellent food in the white moose but at an additional costbonus was that burnley beat shamrock rovers budget hotel,1
1505,an overnight stay whilst in dublin in this very clean and welcoming hotel the rooms comfortable and clean and although basic that is reflected in the very reasonable price the hotel is situated just outside the city but within easy access with good transport in also not too far from the ferry terminal and has a small car park to the rear of the hotel,1
1506,stayed here last monday with my girlfriend and baby and we could have been location is great minute drive to city centre and only a short drive from phoenix staff were all so friendly and helpful and the room was just right and at euro for the night including parking an absolute bargain for in the infamous white moose was absolutely excellent we were pleasantly surprised with how good it actually will definitely stay here again,1
1507,all is stated in the title it was a very noisy room i recommend to request a room on the opposite side of the entrance and the air smells a lot the cigarette when we entered which were very annoying for like good points are large room with comfortable beds and a free car park,0
1508,ok for one night as a stop over or for an early flight as it nearby airport but would recommend as a base for visiting dublin they have shut the restaurant so no food available no bar either there was a chinese over the road that was good there was a bar next door but looked a bit rough to me like the whole of the ballymun area i would walk round here after in dublin are expensive in summer so if you end up here it better than no room at all but if you are on holiday and are visiting dublin this would be the last hotel you would want to book ballymun although supposedly being regenerated it still the same old dump it was would recommend this hotel for families or couples the hotel itself is ok but the area lets it down and it no where near dublin,0
1509,we needed a convenient hotel to stay in with airport shuttle for our early morning flight out of dublin this place is located in a sort of wasteland we pulled up the cab driver did even know this place was here seemed afraid to just leave us here there was a group of loud guys from the pub next door outside our room was typical travelodge but the view outside was a crappy apartment complex with loud people we were hungry but i did want to walk around the sketchy neighborhood no way would i ever go here again,0
1510,my flight had an layover in dublin so i searched for an inexpensive place to stay near the airport i arrived at the airport around and had to take a cab to the hotel that cost nearly remember that detail upon arrival the check in process was smooth and the staff was somewhat friendly i asked about the airport shuttle they advertised and was shown the timetable for the shuttle that limited its use to a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the early evening on the way up to my room i noticed the place was either new or recently renovated either way it was nice the room was hot due to unseasonably warm weather in the area the entire exterior wall was made up of windows and a glass balcony door but only one window opened a few inches and the door was locked there was no other source of ventilation so i accepted the mildly uncomfortable room on the balcony was a large seagull sitting very still the bird was so still that i assumed she was sitting on an egg or a hatchling it was until i noticed a couple of flies that i realized it was in fact dead the bathroom was very nice with a huge bathtub and very modern fixtures the television was slightly larger than a postage stamp but there were quite a few channels to watch thinking that this part of ireland was still part of the,1
1511,good experience underground free car park is handy room is standard fit but was clean only two small issues the room was very warm on the top floor and hard to regulate temperature without opening the window which then made the room noisy also there was a light bulb missing from a table lamp,1
1512,near to airport shuttle bus available at certain times early morning and later in the taxi from airport approx euros good value compared to other hotels friendly staff local supermarket take away pizza nearby,1
1513,the hotel was clean and close to the airport but those are the only two good things about it the airport shuttle rarely runs only between and not dependable the hotel is also in the middle of nowhere and the in the hotel was closed during our stay as well as this there were only two power outlets in a room that was housing people,0
1514,after a very bad experience at a travelodge years ago i usually avoid them like the plague so i was looking to forward to staying here when my sister in law booked us in for a night on a trip to dublin the hotel completely changed my hotel itself was very bright and fresh and spacious the rooms were clean and very comfortable everything was well maintained and had everything you could really made it stand out was the excellent service we arrived at midnight after a delayed flight and the night staff could not have been more helpful unfortunately i did get their names but both guys could not do enough to help us and other guests who arrived at the same time the next morning the reception and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful travelodge this hotel and particularly the staff are a great advertisement for youvisit july,1
1515,i enjoyed the proximity to the national theater as i was attending an event there for three days also relatively close to the major sites the rooms were clean and everything was in working order the staff was also very friendly,1
1516,lovely hotel nice staff rooms perfect for a hen party or girly night away clean and comfortable the only fault for me was the room was extremely warm otherwise all great pleasant stay the bar serves lovely food cocktails also,1
1517,loud music until am every night no accommodations made to help filter the noise light curtain on window no air conditioner no sound insulation whatsoever at one point in the night i wanted to stuff the single bed mattress covers and pillows against the window to block out the noise all they gave was ear plugs our adult children were traveling with us and enjoyed the club the first night however they had an early flight out the second night and did get any sleep even though their room was around the corner from the was a real issue as we were aware of the fact that we had to park several blocks away with a discounted staff is courteous and very friendly rooms are dated but adequate,0
1518,clean and quiet when i was there though it was a week night welcoming staff allowed an early and were helpful recommending restaurants room spacious and comfortable would happily stay again,1
1519,staff very pleasant we had a triple room clean basic we where at a music festival with a group of girls some stayed on the first floor some on the second the girls on the first floor had no sleep as the music was thumping into their room throughout the night from the beer garden nightclub bar you are supplied with earplugs in the drawer they got some discount the next day after complaining we paid each for breakfast but it was not worth it fine for but i would recommend for a family,0
1520,i visited with my wife for just the weekend and we found this hotel good the only problem was that they gave us a room with singles instead of a double we were offered to have the bed changed but since it was only for nights we decided not to go through the is good just walk from the centre plenty of nightclubs and restaurants within mins walk,1
1527,i have stayed here a number of time when needing to be on a red eye flight the following morning the corporate rate is excellent it includes free parking and breakfast for a very reasonable price the rooms are always clean and comfortable with good wifi access ramona and the front of house staff are always very friendly and helpful it a plus that they remember faces too the bar is nice and there always a decent atmosphere in there the food in the bar is always lovely any time i stayed here i always been up before breakfast is service however bringing a continental breakfast up to my room is never a problem i will stay again soon,1
1528,i paid approx for a room for one night breakfast not included as my partner and i were down to dublin to watch coldplay i will admit it was close to croke park upon arrival the guy on reception assumed my partner and i would want single beds being guys when i corrected him and said the double was fine he smirked and went ahead with checking us in the hotel must of been grand and luxurious at one stage but it is dated and old now a bit of reinvestment by the owners would do wonders for the business the bedroom had old creaky furniture which was too big in a small room the bathroom was tiny but did have a nice selection of soaps and products a wet room would be much better here the room was spotless and there was a kettle and coffee but no tea also in the room is an iron plus board and a hairdryer there was no air conditioning unit and the room was roasting would have been ok with windows there but we could open them more than a crack although we were there on a saturday the area did have much happening and seems to be pretty quiet the hotel has a pool and leisure facility which we did have time to but you do need a code from reception to get into it a carvery was offered in the and upon inspection we decided it would be better to,0
1529,the staff at the regency hotel were very friendly and helpful at all coststhere is a weird layout to the hotel that if you are on certain floors the lift does not go to you have to get off at one floor and take the stairs it was a nightmare i got to my room and i asked to be switched and the receptionist got me another room straight room was not much better there were cigarette butts on the window sill questionable stains on the pillow and bed cover the was very the cleaners would come in even when you have a not disturb sign on the door the hotel has a nice pub downstairs which i have no complaints hotel is a bus ride away from the center of dublin and a min drive from am certain that there are much better hotels around dublini wont be coming here againnothing against the staff because they were all good just not a fan of the hotel,0
1533,stayed her for one night check in was quick but we were asked to pay on the arrival a bit unusual informed that breakfast was an additional ten euro which could be paid in the restaurant in the morning but this was wrong we had to go back to reception pay and get vouchers then go back to the restaurant also enquired at the main reception if the spa sold swimsuits and told no so went into dublin to buy one but i checked the next morning at the spa and they do indeed sell swimwear so could have bought one there you also have to pay deposits for towels and lockers and buy swimhats decided not to bother breakfast was awful very poor choice definately not worth ten euro each apple juice was like water no flavour at all very disappointed with looked out on a flat roof with lots of air con equipment supposed to be fifteen minutes walk from croke park more like thirty five,0
1534,ok hotel needs improvement but no negatives with staff or rooms i stayed in room on the of august when dublin was very busy right from our entry at reception until we left the staff were exceptional reception staff and bar staff excellent i lost my bank card and the receptionist made sure i did not have to pay for parking but was more worried that i got it sorted it was the girl with blonde hair on at pm on the staff one bar man in particular made it his to make us feel at home i think his name was niall the hotel has had its fair share of negativity but from belfast it great if you driving as it next to motorway again dated but if your in dublin to comment on a family trip this is the bus outside every mins fare into city centre,1
1535,my niece had her communion here and we were happy at all with the food i had chicken wings for starter which had barely any meat on them and got about on the plate the mains came out about minutes after and i got penne pasta which was absolutely vile to say the least the pasta was dry and hard and the sauce tasted like tinned tomatoes it was basically day old pasta with a tin of tomatoes poured over it with no meat or anything disgusting,0
1536,good hotel and excellent location the staff really were lovely and so helpful our only issue was that it was quite expensive for what it was especially as when we checked in the man next to us paid less than half we had for some reason equally although spotless when we checked in to the room the cleaning was terrible after the first night and we complained on check out having said that it was a comfortable room and the more than made up for it,1
1538,i stayed at this hotel twice and i ca say about word about it the staff are great location is marvellous and the rooms are superb last time i visited i left my passport in the room and the staff got it in a taxi and got it to the airport in time for me to catch my flight amazing hotel,1
1539,i booked a single room and it was very small but otherwise not bad the desk staff were very pleasant and helpful the pub adjoining the lobby is lively and has good music too on the whole my stay was with the room were that it was very small for the price the shower door is too narrow and the lamp by the bed is too low for reading the lift did not work when i arrived but it was fixed the next day also the tv info provided in the room was out of date and inaccurate,1
1540,stayed at the citi hotel for a gig in arena a few weeks ago with my fiance and it was ideal directly in centre of bar for double room location is brilliant perfect for having a few pints in town and short walk back rooms grand and clean and staff really nice would highly recommend for anyone planning a night out in dublin,1
1541,excellent location walk from the room was small and bathroom tiny but clean enough a little noisy at nights because of the traffic and pubs in the at reception was ok you just have to ask if you need anything because they wo ask you first esther in care of breakfast is lovely and wifi in the hotel apart from the lobby,1
1543,this is wonderful heritage building with a great location and a great staff it can be a little loud due to all the traffic on the main street but they helpfully provide earplugs they let you store your bags before or after check in and this tiny extra is incredibly helpful in a downtown area,1
1544,the room is small and warm since we stayed here in july however the location is right in the middle of everything making it easy to walk to different sights and pubs the pub attached to the hotel offered great music at night even though the hotel is located in the middle of temple bar we did not have an issues with noise at,1
1545,chose this hotel since it was mins walk from a conference venue great location building clean and well appointed staff were and a true asset to the hotel i would stay there again if the opportunity arose,1
1546,we stayed at the clayton hotel ballsbridge from the hotel is a former masonic girl orphanage and it is quite beautiful the rooms were spacious we thought the location was perfect it was not in the middle of noisy downtown but there was a bus stop right outside the door which would easily take you downtown in about five minutes on the or and the aircoach to and from the airport also stopped right outside of the door all of the staff were very friendly and helpful in particular imelda at the front desk was wonderful we would highly recommend the clayton hotel ballsbridge robert and graham chattanooga tn,1
1547,my wife and i stayed here one night during our trip to ireland with gate travel the room was clean and the bathroom was very nice great water pressure and plenty of hot water we also had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was very good breakfast the next morning was also good if i had one complaint it would be the bed quality the mattress was uncomfortable but this could easily be a personal preference,1
1548,myself and my husband stayed here after getting a really good price for the night online hotel is lovely building in a nice area of dublin room standard enough but both bathroom and bed area was spotless parking which is slightly annoying when you are a paying guest but i would stay again,1
1549,booked in here for three nights and have to say the room was clean and comfortable a bit warm but that something i have come to expect from hotel rooms breakfast is a self service affair with many different treats and offerings blending the traditional irish hot breakfast with the continental style really enjoyable and sets you up for the day staff extremely friendly lunch in the coffee dock was very tasty one small criticism for a small glass bottle of coke a bit expensive again staff very helpful and nice,1
1550,we had a great stay for nights at the hotel the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable we stayed there during the concert at they tailored special services for guests attending the show a special shout out to carlos fernando and roman for their great service,1
1554,we stayed at the clayton hotel ballsbridge for two nights in july the rooms were big compared to other hotels in ireland restaurants and pubs within walking distance the breakfast buffet was good wifi was not good in our hotel room we went to the lobby for better wifi access bus stop in front of hotel with timer that tells you when the next bus will would recommend this hotel,1
1555,we stayed from july to august with our two children the location was minutes walking straight to the centre of dublin the room was very spacious toiletries were very good quality very comfortable beds included children and the breakfast was fantastic great variety in a spacious the staff from the reception desk to the waiters and cleaning staff very very nice and helpful it was a great experience for us all,1
1556,our first taste of ireland we checked in early after an overnight flight the front desk was more than accommodating everyone was so friendly and helpful the room and bathroom were spacious and spotless the hotel is conveniently located not in the city center but easily accessible nonetheless and the neighborhood is can not stress enough how helpful everyone was at one point we saw a woman who was a manager of some sort first she was delivering trays to tables when the coffee bar was getting busy then she was escorting folks to the restrooms not just pointing the way not more than minutes later we found her out front assisting guests in getting taxis all with a smile and kind word we would highly recommend clayton ballsbridge,1
1557,hotel was very good excellent service and great rooms the breakfast is great and parking very handy location spot on only a quick dart into town or the beach a min walk east loved it only thing was we thought the bed was a bit hard so used an extra quilt which they were quite happy to give us,1
1559,we stayed at the clayton hotel ballsbridge for a wedding that was taking place in the adjacent thomas prior hall the hotel team did a wonderful was smooth and easy the room was ready at the promised time and the receptionist was very welcoming the room was spotlessly clean and had a good bathroom with a powerful lady who greeted us in the restaurant for breakfast was so friendly even though we arrived only minutes before breakfast was due to who checked us out was and full of smiles when she saw our suitcases she immediately offered to arrange a taxi for us a very nice unprompted touch she really made our departure a warm and friendly experience with lots of wedding reception itself was wonderful great service and very nice you clayton hotel team,1
1560,we stayed nights and we had a pleasant stay in the hotel we were in dublin for the concert of it was also our first time in ireland the hotel is really nice and with easy access to public transportation there is a very nice square with restaurants pubs and small stores near by the hotel the hotel staff is very friendly,1
1561,after a couple of great experiences at the clayton dublin airport hotel we decided to stay here in ballsbridge for a couple of nights our room was not quite as spacious as the ones we have had in dublin airport but almost everything else was spot on we enjoyed an excellent vegetarian meal in the bar the gym is very well set up and i enjoyed the virtual reality running machines the beds are super to other hotels the buffet breakfast is expensive especially if you are vegetarian but the hotel is located close to some excellent cafes where we went for a morning meal unfortunately none of these were open on the sunday morning and we circled back to the hotel where we found we could order off the menu i do know if many peolpe do this as there was a lot of confusion from our waiter the food was typical hotel breakfast food nothing bad nothing amazing other than that our experience was great and the staff in general are fantastic,1
1562,i have been staying in the hotel for over and a half years between and nights per week and it is highly recommended for its location welcoming and overall comfort the staff are very pleasant and in particular the reception team on bar staff are also very good and the quality and value of the food is very acceptable the girls n reservations are also excellent and whilst i communicate with them a lot by mail i rarely see them andrea and imelda come to mind,1
1563,booking in late after a long flight from asia we arrived was upgraded and had the most beautiful bed and lovely room the soft furnishings and quality of the bed was the highest standard of our weeks in ireland,1
1564,we stayed for three unforgettable nights the people there made us feeling home whatever need we expressed they were there to carry them forward the openness and kindness of the person in charge a lady was something i have not experienced in my life and i travel quite often being a psychologist attend a lot of conferences around the world the location also could not be more convenient,1
1566,room very clean and airy well laid out all meals excellent staff attentive professional and friendly seems to come from the top was asked how was my visit and could he do anything to help more than once good location buses at front of hotel to centre city and other destinations lawns and trees very soothing after long trip,1
1567,if you want to want to be in the city but just slightly off the beaten track then this hotel is well located airport bus to and from front dart is mins regular bus service into city centre on the door stepour family room was on the ground floor we had an issue with the shower thermostat was very sensitive and made water too hot when we raised at breakfast the issue was swiftly escalated and resolved before we had finished along with assistance to move room when we had were friendly and attentive breakfast was more than adequate and very only personal gripe was the residents bar was shut abruptly there was an exciting golf match on the tv and for what i would think as a significant hotel they were trying too quick to shut everything around those that were resident and watching and enjoying a drink the hotel has hour service and i would have expected some discretion up to at an emigrant from the city it is well located for a trip to dublin and enjoy all it has to offer,1
1568,this used to be called bewleys hotel and it had been a couple of years since my last visit however the hotel is ideally situated next to the british embassy and for central dublin spacious rooms pleasant helpful staff breakfast was buffet style and plentiful will be back,1
1569,we found the rooms nice and large and the staff very friendly and was good with easy connections to the city centrethe setting of the hotel is in a beautiful old school building,1
1570,i stayed here for two nights last weekend over all it was a very good experience location is excellent pubs shops etc within a minute walk very safe to go for a stroll room was spotless great amenities comfortable bed etc ate in the bar it was absolutely excellent service in the bar was also top notch breakfast was ok i did find the quality great but it was ok service for breakfast is excellent though reception were very efficient and helpful especially a young man i think his name is stephen i could thank him enough so friendly efficient and sooooo helpful no matter what he always gave a service with a smile i would definitely recommend this hotel i will certainly be back,1
1572,this is a beautiful hotel but the rooms were hot and stuffy one window that only opens part way and a cheap fan did not help much they show care in most details but our south facing room was just about unlivable no ice in the rooms the lobby was like a meat locker and even the halls were cooled breakfast was very good but with little sleep almost nothing is good,1
1573,i booked this hotel for a birthday party for my year old mum the staff were so accommodating of each need the meal was lovely and it was all handled most professionally by abbie in bookings the staff on the day were exceptionally helpful every request was fulfilled great service and most enjoyable really recommend it the atmosphere very relaxed thank you christine,1
1574,this hotel has an interesting history and a character of its own the room was clean and comfortable the food for breakfast is good but advise guests to get up and eat early as the tour buses really impact the food options quickly service was always pleasant but also always slow it is a nice location and gives good access to the sights in dublin,1
1575,the hotel is really nice and with easy access to public transportation airport city center and hop off busses the public bus to the city center is only minutes and then minutes walk there is a very nice square with restaurants pubs and small store near by the hotel the hotel is an old well preserved castle with nice rooms the hotel staff is accommodating and friendly the breakfast is great and worth the extra euros the wifi works great all in all a great experience which we would like to repeat and definitely recommend,1
1576,the service received from vanessa whilst staying at the clayton was excellent despite being busy the service was efficient and friendly the room itself was clean well laid out and with everything you need including the best bed i stayed in,1
1577,the rooms are big for ireland and very comfortable we were only here one night and our evening was planned out for us so i do not know how convenient it is to places in the area if you are looking for a clean large comfortable room this is the place to stay,1
1578,my wife and i stayed for days at clayton hotel ballsbridge in dublin upscale location close to restaurants and transportation the staff was very accomodating and pleasant to deal with from reception to housekeeping especially ana and imelda in reception the facility could use some refurbishing but the cost of a stay was about half of the facility across the street overall it was a good experience recommended,1
1579,i foolishly and paid for a room here in advance and tried to cancel at late notice but over a busy summer weekend i tried to recoup some or part of the high price i had paid but it was a flat no referring me to the fine print in their t c typical big chain approach here i ca comment on the hotel or amenities as i did actually stay here but i certainly wo be back,0
1581,the hotel is in a nice old building but has all the comfort you need staff is very friendly and helpful and breakfast is great a bus stop right in front of the hotel takes you to the city center very quickly if you enjoy walking it takes about in case you coming for an event at the aviva stadium it is a walk which is only thing i missed was a gym where i could spend some time while my kids were in their activities,1
1582,at the hotel for nights no temperature controls for the room came back at still no housekeeping service for the room no bottled water on arrival or mini bar food not great not great value for money nice staff as a whole would not recommend very far from town centre to min walk,0
1583,we stayed in this hotel for one night friday july we were able to get a room at very short notice within two hours of arriving in fact the hotel is large and busy the building is really beautiful we had a most comfortable room great bed good bathroom we also had dinner in the restaurant where we were served by magda magda is a real live asset for this hotel she was excellent in every way smiling polite erudite and helpful i hope she is appreciated by her employers she is a classic example of the old saying you do get many like her in a half dozen we most certainly use this hotel again and look forward to it,1
1584,my son and i stayed here for nights the rooms are well maintained and bathrooms are clean but with the shower in the were allocated a room with poor wifi connectivity but were moved once we reported the issue wifi is good in the room and lounges but be careful as some rooms do not have wifi repeaters and therefore poor only had one meal at the hotel and enjoyed it staff are friendly and helpful,1
1585,the hotel was very quiet and it was a lovely setting and the bar and food was good value for money would recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to the aviva stadium staff were very friendly and the breakfast was also very nice,1
1586,comfy hotel all mod cons really good breakfast available and caters well for those with intolerances we had a basement room with a courtyard view but it was lovely and airy so did actually feel like we were downstairs at all,1
1588,while we have stayed on several occasions at this hotel it was the last visit gave me the push to give a staff are very professional and welcoming but particularly at the receptionthe rooms are perfect and well equippedthe location is terrific being in and very accessible to dublin by foot or public transport this is most relevant to us as regular visitors to the city to see our children family and friendsconvenient parking is chargeable nightly but we did not need to exit till pm that eveningbreakfast is well worth the extra a nice practical pleasant place to stay and compares very favourably with other hotels in the suffers the common problem in the tourist season of higher prices than the rest of the year,1
1589,on a corner of a busy intersection they all are in dublin sits this regal and hotel with a great staff and welcoming dining are and the best bed i have ever slept on a nifty enclosed central veranda and old style wood and marble everywhere else make this a nice place to see and stay in,1
1590,this is a nice hotel a little off the beaten path it in an affluent area of the city dublin and the building was originally a masonic girls school in the if you looking for a chain hotel this should be your choice but if you like some character and charm check out the clayton hotel ballsbridge and the staff is very friendly which made the stay even more pleasant,1
1591,really nice hotel with great staff service hotel is slightly outdated but due to the age it is very had great friendly service from the entire staff and especially from fernando in the bar area he offered great wine selections and made us feel very welcome,1
1592,my husband daughter i stayed here for two nights at the start of our visit to ireland we enjoyed the hotel found it to be comfortable for our time in dublin clean the staff was helpful the hotel is a good minute walk to trinity college but we enjoyed the walk we liked being out of the crowds after a day of sightseeing in the center of the city the breakfast buffet was really nice the bar is decent if you want a quick bite to eat i would stay here again if i was back in dublin,1
1593,the night stay was very enjoyable without exception the staff were friendly and accommodating special mention to maria and renata at the terrific coffee shop for going out of their way to obtain the perfect coffee for my elderly mother and making a big fuss of my daughter please can we have more of your gorgeous cakes on display to choose from next year rooms were of excellent standard and cleanliness would it be possible to include hot chocolate and biscuits with the beverages ca forget to mention the fabulous breakfast the choice and quality were probably up there with anywhere else on offer in the city the hotel is situated in a lovely area of dublin and was close to all the major travel routes shall be back soon x,1
1595,i have now been to dublin a few times and stayed in multiple hotels i love the city and have stayed in great locations but this is my favorite and where i will stay from now on first the location is perfect you can still walk to temple bar and grafton for all the main shopping areas and bars but you are in a lovely quiet area with everything still at your fingertips you also have more locals around you than just the tourists that take over temple bar the hotel is beautifully designed and very artistic we had a king room with an entire corner of windows the rooms are also designed very creatively but also very clean and elegant we had a record player with and a vintage speaker with modern technology blue tooth adapters etc at level of it was so loud we are actually going to order one for our own house we have a samsung sound bar but this speaker was so clear and crisp i love the unique art in the rooms with the artists i took pictures and plan on ordering art by them the bathroom was large and clean with a great shower and even heated towel racks a lovely bar and beer garden also a full rooftop restaurant i loved this place it was truly unique without trying too hard ca wait to go back,1
1596,the service is warm and personal there are so many sweet and personal touches which set them apart the room itself note we did stay in a penthouse however i believe it just a bigger version of other rooms has such modern and warm decor with the perfect amenities the rooftop restaurant bar had delish cocktails and food with a wonderful view fantastic location very fair pricing all in all great concept,1
1597,when you book a hotel it usually to sleep with the nightclub in this hotel literally shaking the walls of your room down you will not sleep a wink it am as i write this and i feel as if i have just been scammed by the dean i a frequent traveler and hands down my worst experience at a hotel ever,0
1598,i wish i had nothing bad to say about the dean as is a gorgeous quirky hotel with great deco but the absurd amount of noise that comes from the night club on the ground floor is horrendous and a massive disruption for the night sleep even if my night sleep only started at am is ridiculous loud and not acceptable it outweighs any other good feedback about this place is a shame and i actually feel sorry for the staff as they do a great job but at the end the noise from the night club kills any effort and positive feedback,0
1599,this hotel is conveniently located to all the central dublin sights it is also located amid some nightclubs and has one itself that said it is not a perfectly quiet place for lodging but soundproofing is actually very good and we had no problems staying on the first floor the room was tiny but so fun with a twin over queen bunk the shower was awesome after a long day of walking beautiful dublin rooftop is lovely and lobby bar is active all day overall we would recommend the dean and happily stay there again,1
1600,stayed at the hotel for three nights and really have only positive things to saw what a great hip buzzing hotel a little loud perhaps but that is no secret if you read the reviews before coming they do give earplugs to sleep too which i found hilarious the service was fantastic great bar and restaurant which was also gluten free vegan friendly loved the room decor and features ca wait to go back with the mrs,1
1601,i really want to like this place and write a great review and it is great in many respects funky quirky designed room great bar and reception area and friendly staff but i in a room which is literally a handful of metres from copperface jacks nightclub it on a tuesday night and the music has only just stopped pumping out i booked via and did see any reference at point of purchase to the noise level and it fair to say i have experienced anything like it in a hotel really disappointed i here for business have barely slept and will be knackered tomorrow the earplugs were not a good sign when i first arrived if the hotel owners know it that bad specific reference needs to be made to the noise issue when booking i being moved tomorrow night but having now seen the other reviews on trip advisor it clearly a common issue shame,0
1602,really cool and nice hotel situated within walkable distance to many sights in dublin stayed for nights the room was nice superoom comfortable bed and lots of amenities as we stayed over the weekend and on the floor there was a lot of noise from the hotel bars luckily they provide you with earplugs so we got a good night sleep either way had dinner one night at sophie topfloor and had tasteful gnocchi reservation is recommended aspecially during the weekend as the place was packed would like to come back at another occasion recommended,1
1603,wow very boutique chic stylish hotel not my traditional style but i was blown away by the service and accommodations i would highly recommend the dean to every person staying in dublin the accommodations were great but most importantly the staff was amazing it like having you own personal concierge when i return to dublin i will only stay at the dean love love the dean ally and tom were awesome,1
1604,we stayed in the dean for a one night trip we were attending a concert across the road from the hotel so the location was perfect the room was a room that we paid for without breakfast the room was stunning very unique lots of quirky touches like the orange smeg mini fridge we ate in the restaurant slightly pricey but we just had pizza and that was reasonable we drank in the bar very friendly staff expensive drinks we had been warned about the noise and as we were out until ourselves we did sleep through it with the help of the pricey drinks i mentioned earlier they leave ear plugs beside the bed they were very useful rooms were very warm and when i opened the window the noise obviously increased so we just left the ceiling fan on all night i would recommend this hotel for young couples groups of friends maybe not families or older folks we really enjoyed the experience even if we are quite tired now,1
1605,just the best in hotel hospitality i experienced from the moment we arrived the staff were amazing and soo thoughtful finding out what we needed to do and helping us to achieve staff and especially apple in the rooftop breakfast soo happy and full of enthusiasm management take note you are very lucky to have a great team only one little niggle which seems to be a popular negative is the nightclubs close by and the music into the small hours if you ca bear the noise them or ask really politely to move they will help if they can or bigger ear defenders so a massive thank you for making our birthday celebration a truly memorable one and hope to see you guys and girls next time best always liam mcg,1
1606,i was excited on arrival by the look and feel of this hotel but by the time i left the following day i was utterly disgusted by their utter disregard for their guests comfort and satisfaction i thin the following response to my agent complaint letter will tell you all you need to know about why you should choose any other hotel in dublin so disappointed goodness only knows just how appalling it might of been had i been a leisure traveller management response i sorry your client had a noise affected stay with us thanks for taking the time to flag this with us we do have big issues with noise on harcourt street we have some rooms that are but nothing we consider silent by a long stretch harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in for nightlife in general we completely surrounded by night venues although there is little we can do to control this we try to assign the rooms to corporate guests longer stays etc to minimize the impact on our guests i sorry if this was communicated on arrival i will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position as recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours we working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort in relation to the lights coffee machine and basin we,0
1608,the accommodation was exceptionally clean and the location is a centre as can be which is amazing for the low price of the accommodation the shared kitchen is great for travellers on a budget as it allows you to prepare your own meals staff are very helpful if you have any issues and security on the site seems tight the only drawback is the windows are single glazed and as the main roads are nearby it may not be great for those who are woken easily,1
1609,i graduated from the other dublin university even so i have a major grá love for this campus i pass through every day to and from work and it an oasis of academia and tourism in the city center some day i even make it to the book of once i worked out at what time the queues are but even so i love the courtesy of having sunshades over the queue for the so polite you do see that in,1
1610,had a tour around trinity college campus by one of the students who had only done one tour but she was excellent very enthusiastic and knowledgeable was very interesting to look around and the personable experiences bought i to life of living on campus and the history behind the different buildings however the queue for bok of kells was quite long and was rather disappointing in the end,1
1611,when i booked i had a romantic vision of being in a wood panelled room with a large leather topped desk but the reality was really basic student digs the room was large a single bed and a shower and loo down the hall was tea and coffee making facilities the college is beautiful a stunning building and bang in the centre of dublin there a cafe there the buttery that does cheap studenty food lasange cooked breakfast etc that cheap and not only drawback was check out was and they knock on your at exactly to get you to vacate an hour later would be so much better the room cost around euros which is very good for the centre,1
1613,clean secure and central in dublin expensive for what it was a tiny room with single bed and shared bathroom worked out at on hostelworld for a midweek night should be cheaper as comparable prices around dublin can get you lots more for an extra or,0
1614,i booked this for a city break with my daughter and was attracted by the central location accommodation in dublin is relatively expensive particularly the city centre hotels i booked online and chose a twin ensuite room but what we actually got was a whole apartment with single rooms a bathroom a lounge and a kitchen we were only there for one night but if we been staying longer we would have made more use of the lounge and kitchen it was clean secure had free and was located in a nice quiet corner of the campus ideal for our needs there was also luggage storage available before and after which was handy,1
1615,central but quiet location clean room and bathroom very helpful staff i had a private room which was not too small for a single person kitchen facilities were would stay there again next time,1
1616,the location is fantastic we stayed in a two room apartment at botany bay it is basic but fine there were no cooking pots although there was a cooker but maureen the cleaning lady was extremely nice and helpful and she found us some pots main issue is the price we paid euros for six nights plus for a camp bed for three of nights this was the best part of euros for student rooms for less than a the door cards stopped working several times and we had to go back to the accommodation office repeatedly to have them restaurant in the campus closes at which is very friday night the students upstairs were extremely extremely rowdy and disruptive and were shouting and jumping around like a herd of animals,0
1617,dublin is not a cheap place to visit but every now and then a bargain surfaces amongst the greed of a constant roundabout of those that want a bargain and are not worried about a luxurious stay then i can highly recommend trinity college campus accommodation for a stay in may until september when the students are not on site the accommodation can be rented out and for a fraction off the cost of a normal hotel accommodation is basic and by that i mean a bed table wardrobe and for me a shared bathroom and toilet but you get what you paid for and at for a nights accommodation in the heart of dublin it worked to my pockets advantage,1
1618,i travel a lot and normally stay at airport hotels the night before i leave for an early morning flight and this one met my expectations this trip i was with family it was a basic airport hotel nothing fancy but fit the bill we did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel though there were other hotels closer i did not want to hear airplane noise the shuttle ride was short just make sure you book it early to get a choice of departure times,1
1619,hotel was under construction and we were not told prior to arrival even though a hilton honors member service tried to be helpful but due to inexperience failed plenty of other choices around airport for accommodation,0
1620,standard hilton fayre here truly nothing exceptional bar area could do with a makeover rooms are fine this hotel suits those who need overnight accommodation for early flights it not cheap either and they just started charging for the hotel airport shuttle,1
1623,enjoyed a few days here visiting with friends and family the room was quiet and very clean front desk personnel were extremely helpful our dinners were great they served breakfast until this was great as we are late sleepers,1
1624,the hilton was as expected the staff were friendly and helpful the room was comfortable and the necessities were adequately provided after traveling to dublin madrid paris london and then back to dublin hilton for a one night stay before hopping on a plane back to the states we were a bit tired and decided to eat at the hotel restaurant burnell we were not expecting much but were more than surprised one of the best dining experiences we had during our trip and we ate at many fine restaurants also the shuttle to and from the airport was very convenient but beware there really is not much to do at the hotel location so if you are looking for the dublin experience it will not be found unless you take a taxi for a minute ride good job hilton dublin airport team,1
1627,a little far from airport and shuttle requires fee free for hh members dinner was good also had entertainment in bar which was also good bed was a queen but was two less than twins couples together not great but we were exhausted and slept well,1
1628,you would think being relatively close to a hotel would make this place business focused the wifi is practically useless no matter what on you choose rooms are comfortable and spacious but a bottle of water would be nice massively over priced for what you get and neither breakfast nor parking is check out process is pure chaos queue skipping and staff making a phone call while dealing with you is not what you d expect at a of the lifts was out of order and the signage to guide you to the reception was bizzare to say the the approach to the hotel there is no clear signs at night to guide you to the hotle or the car park when you eventually find the car park it is not obvious which way you should go in or out of it small changes here would make a big difference,0
1629,we stayed on the return leg of our italian holiday they treat their diamond members very well we were upgraded to a lovely corner room combined with complimentary breakfast the stay was great value given the size of long stay parking in dublin and the frequency of the buses to the car park you can get to the hotel quicker than your car most times pity the shuttle does run for an extra hour as many european flights arrive around midnight the taxi is only though,1
1631,we spent nights here one after arriving and one before leaving great rooms some shopping and food close by also breakfast and restaurant in hotel staff was excellent helpful and friendly prices are reasonable shuttle to the airport but be sure you get outside early as they fill up fast would stay here again there is a shopping mall across the street with grocery store as well we did not have time to go but looks fairly large,1
1632,a really disappointing hilton firstly the hotel shuttle did show up to the airport as per the schedule annoying in the height of summer but if the weather was bad or if it was the depths of winter i would be going was a chipped cup in the bedroom and there were marks on the splashback if the bathroom sink obviously not been cleaned properly after the last went out on saturday and when we got back late on saturday evening our room had been serviced which was really annoying especially as we supposed to be valued members of the hilton loyalty programme we had a late checkout booked as my partner is undergoing medical treatment and i knew he would be bright eyed and bushy tailed the next day yet despite having the do not disturb card on the door we still had housekeeping knocking on the door hours before we were due to check buffet breakfast was terrible lukewarm everything and dried out to within an inch of its work to be done here,0
1633,quiet calm and clean and only place we could you for such great helping us out to stay and loved having your bus shuttle too even for am in thank you we enjoyed our stay,1
1635,the hotel was excellent and surprisingly quiet with a big wedding going on room was as expected we did have to wait for the shuttle for minutes upon arrival but it was a busy time especially with a large group arriving along with us shuttle ride was about on shuttle so missed breakfast was told there would be a breakfast takeaway for us but i did see one nor was offered at given a voucher for free drinks at bar due to slight mixup with shuttles etc but the drinks appeared on our bill at checkout but were quickly hotel call for cab and they asked cash or credit i said credit but when cab showed up they had us as cash not sure whose mistake but left us scrambling a bit to find atm in the city for the return info euro cab ride to airport euro cab ride to dublin city i say this hotel is halfway between airport and city so i have to say if we had a later flight i probably would preferred staying in the city and taking the bus back and forth to airport not a slight to hotel just whether or not you want to walk home or cab home after a late night out,1
1636,hilton restaurant burnell has undergone an amazing transformation its redesign merges perfectly elements of new and old dublin and is a dining experience all will remember whether your stay is for business or pleasure this hilton is situated as a gateway into the city the townships of malahide and howth and destinations worldwide,1
1637,the hotel was close to the airport the shuttle service was on time getting us to the airport the hotel has all the amenities you need for a stay the rooms were spacious with comfortable beds and very clean,1
1639,we arrived very late due to flight delays and without luggage pro tip shuttle stops around midnight so get a cab if later than that we were greeting by a very friendly front desk guy who saw i had checked in on line earlier and quickly had keys for us hearing we had no bags he offered up a comp shaving and dental kit we had a late night room service offering of a decent pizza and a couple glasses of wine which all hit the spot just fine we had a quiet and comfortable sleep breakfast the next day was very good shuttle back to airport was fine and we were off,1
1640,picked up at dub as per schedule by the shuttle checked in promptly politely i was able to select my room on line before my arrival which was very useful dined at the hotel burnell grill good food service i would definitely stay here again if i find myself on an overnight stay for dub,1
1641,great location for both airport howth and even for the city as it an easy drive any way hotel is modern so well appointed and clean rooms here are bigger than standard comfy bed and bedding restaurant and bar area very good and well above the normal drab hilton style food in restaurant was superb quality and again well above what i have previously experienced at hiltons great stay and lovely staff too recommended,1
1642,we stayed for one night prior to catching a flight from dublin airport our room was spacious and modern with a large comfortable bed the airport shuttle ran to the published schedule and allowed for the trip to the airport in the morning every staff member we interacted with was friendly and courteous breakfast had a wide selection and everything we tried was fresh and well prepared we will definitely return if we need a hotel convenient to the airport in dublin again and would certainly recommend the hilton to others,1
1643,nice clean hotel with friendly staff the family room was a little small when all the beds were set up pretty quiet even though we were on a busy street nice big shuttle to the airport kids beds were fold out chairs were not comfortable,1
1644,stayed in this hotel before flying out the next morning it was convenient to the airport and had a shuttle service we took advantage of the shuttle by returning our rental that evening and taking the free shuttle back to the hotel the ride to the airport the next morning was euro per person so well worth the convenience the room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast in the morning was pretty good no complaints and would stay here again,1
1646,awful do stay here elevator broken very poor room service computer issues over priced when we checked out the card to open gate in parking did not work no one there to help no phone to call to get assistance very big hassle stay at the maldron closer to the sirport a better value and no problems,0
1647,the house offers first class accomodation in a very convenient location excellent breakfast coffee facilities in the room would be a bonus but is available in the lounge hours staff really helpful and secure parking off road,1
1648,from the moment we arrived at the pembroke townhouse hotel we were made to feel as welcome as if we were staying with friends lovely touches like homemade elderflower cordial at reception and a kitchenette opposite reception where you can make tea and coffee and help yourself to gorgeous home baked cookies before flopping into the comfy sofa and armchairs in the lounge area the staff are all extremely helpful and seem happy to go beyond the call of duty to ensure their guests comfort we had asked for rooms next to each other and got rooms in their own little corridor which was lovely the rooms are not high spec but clean quiet and the double beds are huge and very comfortable good tv too breakfasts are really worth including in your booking really the best hotel breakfasts i had in a long time home baking with heavenly soda bread scones and cakes even homemade baked beans the waiting staff were lovely and made each morning a treat the location is perfect as it a minute walk away from the very busy centre so convenient but a lovely place to begin and end a busy day of sightseeing in dublin and in the evening if you want to stay close to home a few v good restaurants within a minute walk we will be back to dublin and definitely back to the pembroke townhouse hotel,1
1649,very good clean bedrooms big size clean bathrooms and friendly staff close to city and public transport thought it should be a little cheaper though the wifi was excellent defintely recommend it,1
1650,a very good travelodge on the outer edges of the city but a good walk in and the busess stop right outside and are every few minutes so no problem with getting in and out no cafe onsite but a cafe a few doors down that does a really good breakfast and was reasonably priced,1
1651,the only noise was the caw of early morning gulls and it was on a side street that offered pubs shopping and only a few flat blocks from the main street and the bus rooms were large good bathrooms and the front desk is helpful,1
1652,was very pleasantly surprised at this beautiful hotel it so spacious and rooms are very generous in size the staff were just lovely and very welcoming breakfast was included in our stay and there was plenty of it will definitely stay here again and on the plus side you are within walking distance to shops temple bar etc highly recommend it,1
1653,we got dropped off at street from the air coach and the hotel was pretty simple to find from here it around a minute walk from the spire in the already had a good idea of what the hotel looked like from the entrance so we just walked along talbot street and it was straight forward to find only a short walk meant the hotel was in good location the rooms were in good for value with the location breakfast was lovely good selection with the buffet also the carvery was good value for only,1
1655,pluses perfect location close to everything including a bus station from where you can get a bus or taxi to the airport nice walk to the city centre minutes away the hotel and rooms are finished with enough good materials breakfast rather good big and comfortable room disadvantages small and uncomfortable bathroom strange numeration of rooms for ex next to food could be better some elements destroyed for ex wallpapers,1
1657,we really liked this hotel the bus stop to the airport is close by as are shops and pubs we had a nice quiet room on the first floor which was cleaned every day the breakfast is great en we enjoyed our stay very much,1
1662,ripley court is in a great location super close to oconnell street and across the street from many bus stops including the airlock busses helpful staff rooms are spacious and have good decor however it is a bit dated linen and facilities are clean but some work could be done tiles were off in our bathroom behind the door and there was some water damage in the vanity no fridge in our room which was a shame as purchased cold could be kept in the room we had a good double bed a bit firm but ok desk table and chairs side tables safe luggage rack ironing board and iron facilites bathroom amenities were a pump of shower gel on the shower wall and hand wash no shampoo soap etc room serviced daily and pretty quiet breakfast was included in our rate and really good full english breakfast or continental included bacon eggs toast cereal pastries juice etc hotel also had facilities to pack you up a take away lunch but had no evening meal service overall we would stay again and recommend this hotel,1
1663,had a lovely room in this hotel with a four poster bed and had the best nights sleep i have had for weeks the staff were friendly efficient and knowledgable had a good breakfast buffet with all the irish breakfast things and also plenty for vegetarians,1
1664,the only two positive things i can say about this hotel trinity barbut that where it ends room is really no more than a box room and was extremely hot we had to have the window open but the noise outside although i expected was far worse than i expected there is a fan in the wardrobe but was twin beds and could cover both beds the lift still is working as already reported on herewould i go back to dublin again yes in a heartbeat but never dublin citi hotel,0
1665,stayed as couple with friends over the weekend in our opinion this star hotel offers more than other that i have seen it may not have the latest technology or the hyper modern rooms but it clean decent size of rooms and bathroom and the reception staff attended to our not so many needs we did not use the restaurant but coffee is great our room was facing the do know what the reason was but our rooms were insanely hot although the outside temperature was not hot at all all in all great place on foot to city center temple bar grafton street in minutes max we will come back,1
1666,literally the worst hotel ive ever stayed at checked in and get to our room it small and stuffy even with the window open on a very warm day then the night comes and it is loud not even from the bus station there are what sounds like a billion drunk people on the streets below screaming like a bunch of obnoxious we even closed the window and had ear plugs in and could still hear them do know what it was from as there is no pub that close that i was aware of do not stay here if you want any sleep,0
1669,the marker is a star hotel from the minute you walk into the lobby the service is second to none the check in process delightful remembering you if you stay frequently the rooms are sizeable with very comfortable amenities bathrooms are modern updated with radiant flooring restaurant has great breakfast options and the bar has a nice whiskey selection no doubt this is my hands down favorite hotel in dublin,1
1670,excellent service and staff so helpful will definitely return loved the little treat left in our room for wedding we were unable to go up to rooftop bar as when we arrived back to hotel it had closed which was disappointing,1
1672,we loved the marker the location is close to everything but not too you felt as though you were in an exclusive area on the water and only a short minutes walk to grafton street service was loved the spa and rooftop bar we will be back,1
1673,had a great stay at the hotel from check in to check out the staff were not only extremely friendly but very helpful with assisting us with our car trouble flat tire and recommending touring and restaurant options beautiful hotel with great upkeep only slight issue was with the breakfast selection which was vast and lacked fresh vegetables nonetheless will highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in dublin,1
1674,the marker has great staff when you check in they walk you right to the elevator and ensure everything is set for your stay the rooms are large and quiet the staff take great care in their evening turndown and cleaning service the marker is the best hotel i have stayed in in dublin,1
1675,reception staff was very friendly beds comfortable and rooms very clean hotel is located right in the heart of the city centre so what more would you want to enjoy your mini trip to dublin the breakfast was divine could hope for more would highly recommend it,1
1676,book there and go back a nice spot to relax and enjoy the city close to the city definitely a place i will go back next time i will be in town located in a new area of the city with every convenience needed to enjoy yourself,1
1677,there is no other hotel in dublin which provides you with more modern amenities it quiet for sleeping yet he bar downstairs is always buzzing with energy the housekeeping staff is second to none our room was serviced twice daily the beds are incredibly comfortable the area is so unique you can see out your hotel window to the top tech company buildings in the world the bord gais energy theater is practically in the lobby it so researched in dublin for months before our trip i narrowed it down to the merrion the westbury and the marker we visited the westbury and the merrion during our trip for drinks and dinner we are so glad we chose the marker to stay it is out of the busy tourist areas but yet they are still a short walk or cheap cab fare away euro the docklands area is a remarkable sight as well the three tourist buses stop around the corner if you desire that and the buffet breakfast make sure you have a meal at osteria lucio which is about minute walk away casual and delicious meal,1
1678,i had one night here on my own while i was working and for just me it suited well enough unfortunately my girlfriend joined me for the weekend and i just did feel comfortable letting her stay immediate grievance is that they took a photo of my passport and both sides of my debit card if i suffer identify theft in the short future i certainly know who to blame this is not an appropriate behaviour next the hotel is not terrible but there just nothing even slightly impressive about it and many things that just chip away at location is ideal for busses trams and taxis with the stop outside the hotel the downside is that the stop is right outside and at least midnight you have the related noises of also not in a particular nice area to walk back to in the evening dark streets under a railway bridge and as a result i really wished i had chosen somewhere more bedroom was tiny but appeared clean despite one of the windows being filthy oj the outside the is very poor and the television tuning was even worth turning the television on for channels had a reasonable picture but with static for audio and the rest were cheap laminated for the guests all over the hotel room also just looks doors in this building do seem to fit the frames so all night we heard doors being slammed shut including the front door to the hotel breakfast,0
1679,a fantastic location in the centre of temple bar this hotel is very clean the staff are very friendly welcoming great rates for its location tea coffee served in reception which is a very nice touch this hotel has special rates with the opposite which is a major plus for central dublin love it here already booked for my second visit,1
1680,we stayed here for one saturday night before the coldplay concert although it was expensive for night all hotels are about that in centre this is in a great location bathroom is massive we booked the exquisite double room and it was lovely,1
1682,stayed over night when visited dublin for a zz top gig when you first enter the ground floor looks suspicious as there nothing there bar a lift and entrance to tgi fridays when you arrive at reception on floor you start to see the quirky and charming nature of this hotel it a bit of a maze on the upper floors rooms are small but comfortable bathroom was clean and spacious the bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept in staff were pleasant and ready to help we left our luggage in storeroom to go exploring the city breakfast buffet offered reasonable options for a small boutique hotel everything was nice and fresh overall highly recommend,1
1683,we stayed at the fleet street hotel in dublin in july the location is really good right near temple bar and very close to the bus stop for galway the hotel is above the street level so you have to take the lift or walk the stairs and they have security at the door in the evening and at night to control access the decor is modern and the staff were very friendly my brother a smoker was pleased to learn that they had two outdoor terraces available for smokers,1
1684,the price is maybe a little bit higher than one expects but just after your arrival you realize why you are welcome by smiling and efficient staff then you visit your room which is spacious and luxurious perfect location and amazing breakfast,1
1685,every time we asked for something we were told no for example do you change money no do you have a laundry service no do you have a computer i can use no but the worst was our second night we called to see if we could dine in the hotel and were told yes when we went to the dining room we were told we could eat there because there was no food then we were told we could eat in the bar but someone from the front desk came and said no we could we asked if we could order a pizza and someone had to go ask the chef eventually we got a pizza probably frozen and it was awful apparently they cater to tour groups and were only feeding the tour group we did go to the irish night on our last night and it was wonderful however the meat was dry and tough we travel a lot and this was a very strange experience the room was stuffy and the last night there was a party or a fight going on in the street and we had to close our window so it got even stuffier,0
1686,i was looking for a cheap weekend break to see the sights of dublin this hotel is two minutes walk from street where you can catch the hop on hop off bus to tour the city i believe the airport bus is right outside the hotel mark and his colleagues are extremely helpful the breakfast was lovely and vegetarians can request mushrooms and tomatoes also eggs are available to be cooked to your liking we booked the irish night and a three course meal and this was all superb the entrance of the hotel and toilets are lovely however the bedrooms are a little dated and damaged but i do believe it is all down for refurbishment only used as a base and suited us perfect,1
1687,we had a quad room which was a good size considering there were of us shower could be improved attention to detail needed in rooms as we had coffee milk and sugar but no tea one of the cups was cracked which we then threw away as it got washed up and put back breakfast was do think the morning chef was well trained restaurant staff also need training when you refill a dish you do put a dirty spoon back in good selection also had dinner in the hotel which was good and we thoroughly enjoyed the irish night we went to,1
1689,we were down in dublin for a concert so just stayed one night the hotel is in a good location when traveling from the north we got parked on the street opposite which was handy we stayed in a refurbished family room which was really nice clean and comfortable with cool coffee machine my husband had a meal in the hotel it was good and value for money breakfast was ok seemed busy due to tour groups overall a lovely hotel and would stay here again,1
1691,my friend and i stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago i booked thorough hours before we stayed the hotel advertises no booking fee on their website but apparently according to one staff member in the print it states that the hotel will put a holding fee on your booking but your card will not be charged when i checked out i paid for our stay that was two weeks ago and the holding fee is still on my account and there is essentially euro in my account i can not access i just wanted to let future guests know as this has been a serious inconvenience for me this last two was fine bed was fine bathroom,0
1692,i specifically requested a quiet room when making booking the possibility of a newly refurbished room had a bad feeling when there was a snigger about the possibility of a newly refurbished as we were getting a mid summer madness deal but was guaranteed a quiet room which was crucial for our stay confirmed upon arrival yes we will have a quiet room lying awake the last half hour due to a delivery van with carpet clean outside our wide we awoke often throughout night with street noise was told parking was minutes walk but never told it was clerys carpark drove around in circles to find it have to spend another night here very unhappy never again on first floor restless sleep with important day ahead yes it is what it says mid summer madness,0
1693,if you like a small room untidy floor and industrial extractor fans all day then this is for you i stayed in this hotel before and took into account the location and the fact that the building is old the beds were comfortable however this time there was no escaping the fact that the room had not been cleaned and the noise level was beyond ridiculous previously i had been at the front of the property so nightlife influences things considerably but the room this time was so small there was no escaping the noise it sounded like the window was fully open and it was the only quiet place was the bathroom and had there been a bath i most likely would have slept there having had a terrible sleep even with ear plugs i stepped out of the bed to go for a refreshing shower and found that a piece of pepper that had been around the bed not mine became stuck to my foot the level of gross was not pleasant to say the bar is lovely the location great if you completely deaf and the rooms a roll of the dice for the area there are better choices that give a good nights rest,0
1694,the central hotel is in an amazing location right in the heart of temple bar area and super close to all the amazing bars and shopping areas it minutes dander to the nearest tram stop jervis making it so easy to get anywhere in the city there is a bit of noise from the street at night but that really all you can expect from being so centrally located the hotel is a bit old fashioned if that means anything to you but it clean and the staff are all lovely i do think the look of the place really matters anyway a hotel is a place to sleep and especially in dublin where there is so much to explore i was certainly not worried about the décor it an incredible price for the city especially when you consider the spectacular location and i would recommend it to anyone,1
1695,great location great old hotel wonderful atmosphere especially the library bar staff helpful and friendly downsides are no and you get street noise all night but easy walking distance to sites shopping and nightlife,1
1696,we stayed in the central as it was one of the very few hotels in dublin available now we know why it was its tired and worn out small old fashioned rooms with no double glazing to block out the street noise which continues until after the general decor is old and worn the curtain in our room was splattered with what appeared to be liquid makeup and the standard of cleanliness in general was wouldnt recommend staying,0
1697,the hotel is attached to a disco bar loud music until the nights were warm and there was no the staff not the typical irish hospitality it is centrally located definitely not worth staying worst hotel of our month long trip,0
1698,very centrally based character victorian hotel good value breakfast within walking distance of most central dublin attractions minutes to grafton street street dublin castle etc,1
1699,outdated no air conditioning tiny dirty rooms soiled bed linens no screens in windows loud music every night until am rude staff overcharged on bill upon departure all around huge disappointment only saving grace is location not worth the money,0
1700,unlike the pictures on their website the room was very very tiny the two twin beds were actually pushed together and with a nightstand on both sides of the beds that was the extent of the width of the room the floor boards in the entire hotel creaked and moaned as you walked across the floor the window opened all of inches with no air conditioning and only a fan to cool down the room we felt like we were sleeping in a sauna it was horrible the shower had no cold water we called to get it checked out twice when they fixed it the second time the water went from scalding to hot and for some reason the cold water from the sink no longer was cold either try brushing your teeth with warm water yuk we tried to spend the entire day sight seeing because we dreaded spending any time in the teeny hot room,0
1701,i recently was at fleet hotel and was very disappointed with the we arrived we were asked if we wanted the breakfast the next morning for euros a piece i asked if i needed to pay for it that night and the desk clerk said no but they would put our names done my daughter and i got an ally room where the noisy from outside was ongoing we tried to close the windows to buffer the noise but there was no air so the room became extremely stuffy the inside noise was just as bad if not worse the walls were paper thin and every time a door open and closed it vibrated throughout the next morning when we went downstairs for the breakfast we told the hostess what room we were in and i proceeded to get my coffee and plate of breakfast food by the way the canteen was extremely noisy as well the hostess comes over and states that we had not ordered the breakfast at that point i had had it i went to the front and told them that i would be checking out of the hotel a day early due to the lack of sleep due to the noise that my daughter and i dealt with the night before as well as the embarrassment in the canteen when we thought we had lined up the breakfast from the night before they refused to credit our account told us what did we expect from,0
1702,we stayed at the fleet street hotel several times recently this hotel is close to many of the pubs and restaurants in the temple bar area it is also close enough to walk to the museums trinity college and other attractions the hotel was very nice and clean and the employees were very attentive to all our needs we had a room on the second floor above a small side street be aware that noise from the streets and bars will be loud the ear plugs should have been a good clue for this we did close the window on the third night and the noise was reduced and the room temperature remained quite comfortable,1
1703,fab little boutique hotel lots of cute pluses but a mixture of rather tired and old and more modern staff so friendly and helpful breakfast adequate not wonderful great location for temple bar and their own bar is brilliant great live music,1
1704,we stayed here for three nights the location was excellent we did spend anytime in the temple bar area but the hotel was right in the center of everything we wanted to see walking distance to trinity college grafton st stephen green and connolly train station for the train to howth the hotel was clean and surprisingly quiet given all the other comments about noise we were there so perhaps it quieter early in the week our room was in the back of the hotel we slept with the windows open,1
1705,nice quirky little hotel which was clean and comfortable we arrived late afternoon very tired only to discover we need to lug our four cases up and down several flights of stairs not a great start to our stay the rooms although very clean were very small and the bathroom and shower even smaller and no storage facilities in the bathroom and very compact in the bedroom ideal with a lot of luggage the room looked out onto the back of the property not nice view the window opening was small and the room was very stufy and warm free wifi was very poor,1
1707,room was cozy and clean difficult to get to our room with the set up of this hotel had to take the elevator to the floor then go down a flight of stairs walk a hallway then climb up a flight of stairs positives were that the shower had great water pressure nice location and nice outside space the staff were very helpful they brought us a fan as the hotel does have air conditioning and helped book a tour,1
1708,dublin city centre is quite expensive so this hotel felt like a deal compared to some others but for the cad we paid it was anything special clean comfortable and good location but can be noisy from the pubs nearby would stay here again if visiting dublin when the prices are lower,1
1709,room was nice and clean air conditioning worked great also had two big windows to open for fresh air wifi worked at times was a little slow breakfast was delicious just wish they had a little bit bigger variety all service was very helpful and friendly perfect location for everything would absolutely return,1
1710,this was my second time staying at the paramount hotel you can not fault the location on a quiet street just off temple bar you are in the centre of it all the rooms are spacious and come with plenty of storage and we had a very good sized bathroom too we were bed and breakfast breakfast was lovely nice choice of cereals and continental but we opted for the full irish breakfast and we could not fault it for the price you pay i do think a bad word can be said about this hotel staff were also very kind it always great when you can leave your luggage at the hotel i am planning another trip to dublin in october and will be picking this hotel again,1
1713,this is a great location if you want to stay in the temple bar area staff was very helpful breakfast was delicious no air conditioning so can be noisy at night if you have your window open depending on the time of year it may not matter we really enjoyed our stay,1
1715,paid extra for a top floor room with a balcony room was newly carpeted and decorated had a very comfy bed and excellent showers no problems with noise breakfast was goo staff were very friendly and helpful good value for money,1
1716,hotel staff was very friendly we had room confusing at first to find the elevator that goes to the floor great big room with a balcony with outdoor table and chairs it was too noisy at night since we were on the floor great location,1
1717,we only stayed one night we arrived early and our rooms were ready nice surprise room was quite large bed was good and the location was excellent for temple bar area staff were amazing whey could not do enough for us from arranging a cab to take us to the harbour next morning to telling us a place to dine and getting us ice nice hotel would definitely stay again when dublin,1
1718,the right hotel in every sense location hospitality service and superb quiet top it off a wonderful irish throughout are there to make your stay and this they did from reception restaurant and maid top it off the location is ideal for and see you soon,1
1719,stayed in july on a saturday night have to say it a great hotel and well run will definitely use again turks head is a great bar for a night cap breakfast was cooked to order and plentiful thank you to all at the paramount,1
1720,this hotel is just as the photos show lovely rooms we had room right on the corner with nice views down to the river liffey yes it was noisy at night if you had the window open but that why you stay in temple bar for the night life once you have a few refreshments you do hear the noise staff were lovely and friendly we arrived early so went for breakfast and were called when the room was ready which was an hour before listed check in time,1
1721,we stayed here the last night of a trip because it is close to connolly station we arrived back in dublin and had an early flight home we booked a family room and it was comfortable two single beds were placed in a room with a double bed the shower in the bathroom sprayed water everywhere as the glass shower door would not stay closed it was a bit messy but as we were there only one night and did not shower until the morning there was no point in hotel has a nice restaurant is close to the train station and red luas line and is within walking distance to the airport bus,1
1722,stayed here for a total of two nights in one of the premier king rooms the room was modern spacious peaceful and most importantly spotless all the staff from check in to check out were extremely friendly and helpful we ate in the bar and sampled some of there tasty cocktails which were also faultless overall we had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back to this beautiful hotel,1
1723,i came for a weekend with friends this hotel has been recently refurbished and extended we were staying in the new part and our rooms were lovely with lots of nice touches the air conditioning lights and curtains are all controlled by a panel beside the bed each room had a nespresso coffee machine safe and fridge with complimentary chocolate crisps and water our rooms also gave us access to the private club rooms with a lounge outside seating area newspapers and on tap tea coffee fruit and biscuits we had dinner in the hotel restaurant it offers a bistro style menu and all meals were very good they also have a nice bar area and a good cocktail was good we had the choice of a continental breakfast in the upstairs club room or a full cooked breakfast in the main breakfast room all staff were polite and helpful i would stay here again,1
1724,i recently stayed here for two nights and must admit that i had been dubious having read the previous reviews however i could not fault this hotel and i would be quite hard to was spotlessly clean bed very comfy and peacefully quiet we enjoyed breakfast on each morning buffet style with a varied choice to suit all we also dined in the restaurant both nights food was excellent specific compliments and thanks to david restaurant who is charming his customer service skills are fantastic and he is a credit to this hotel,1
1725,we stayed as a couple in the hotel based on reviews however we paid over euros per night for a tired room on arrival the reception area was very impressive however on check in we were directed up a corridor through a security door into what seemed to be a back hotel the room we were given was in a back corridor with tired facilities that overlooked another part of a hotel very disappointing especially considering the price we paid for nights,0
1726,i have just returned from a night stay at the north star with my boyfriend and it was amazing i had stayed here about years ago in a standard double room and even then it was good but since then the hotel has been refurbished to a sleek modern décor and this time i stayed in an executive club king room which was well worth the money the standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money they have upgraded the rooms with smart technology so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button there was also complimentary dairy milk chocolate in the fridge which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over we also had access to the rooftop lounge which was quite what i expected as well as that the hotel was just a high standard robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job i would definitely recommend this hotel if you looking for something more high end i absolutely loved my stay here and it really made my trip to dublin brilliant,1
1727,the hotel was clean and modern and room was very only complaint would be that there was no air con in our room and as it was facing the main road it was too noisy at night to keep the window staff were very helpful and the location was very good would stay again,1
1728,what an enjoyable hotel the rooms appear to have been recently refurbished and is way more than adequate internet also would have liked more and varied tv and movie choices located very conveniently to the tram and bus services,1
1729,arriving at north star hotel in my car i soon realised that the nearest parking was mile away where i had to drag bags from the reception were that friendly and advised me there was no lift to the floor with my bags i went in the summer degree heat no air con in the room although a star and had to suffice to opening the windows which over looked a busy main road and very noisy so no sleep was had during the night i stayed i was meant to stay nights and checked out after stay at a least hotels a week and normally star worst star hotel i have stayed in for a while and not impressed by the cost nor the location avoid the only positive was the restaurant in the hotel who were excellent and great food,0
1730,not worth the cost does deserve stars probably not even faulty plumbing we had to change room faulty elevator one permanently out of order the other unpredictable noisy rooms you will hear and feel the trains passing every minutea and your neighbours coughing so imagine what else you will hear in the halls outdated rooms dirty carpets on the floors and broken floor tiles orange and brown seems to be the location ok central in dublin min walk to centre and temple bar but across the river however we had daily fights and drug deals taking place on the doorstep of the hotel so slightly dodgy hotel policy we do provide you a mini bar but please do eat any of your own food on our premises what,0
1731,booked to coincide with concert in dublin bit nervous as appeared just out of town overlooking train lines but should have been great location for train conolly station tram luas metres away no more than minute stroll to street and heart of room in the new recently renovated section of the hotel the address helpful internet access wifi was good as expected for a hotelhighly recommended,1
1732,hotel was very was staff were very pleasant and helpful and could do enough for could find anything negative about our definitely recommend it and would go back,1
1733,i would say half of this hotel is star and the other half is star our first experience was with the star portion also known as the older part of the hotel you need to be specific when you make your booking that you want to stay in the newer air conditioned portion of the hotel the rooms were still nice in the older portion but as others are mentioning it gets hot over there without ac you face a train station and there are elevators to the floors my wife had a polite conversation with the front desk no screaming or demanding it not their fault we did research the hotel long enough to understand the layout and we stayed in the newer portion of the hotel for the remainder of our trip the front office manager was extremely polite and super helpful ask for ela and she put us in a super nice room in the newer portion of the hotel from then on i would give the hotel a star rating this was by far the nicest room we stayed in throughout all of ireland,1
1734,we got the airport bus into dublin which was really easy it stops just down from hotel we did realise we actually booked premier rooms so we had access to the premier lounge on the top floor this included free bottles of water tea coffee and biscuits all day and a light breakie in the morning cereal yogurt fruit croissants etc all we needed which was perfect room was fab big comfy bed lots of space bathroom was nice but my only gripe would be that it not very well lit in there it like it missing a spotlight dressing gown and slippers in the wardrobe coffee machine lots of storage space reception staff really helpful they book taxis for you shops and city centre maybe a min walk and temple bar maybe min we got taxis during the evening if going out it was too far to walk in heels great stay id definitely stay again thank you x,1
1735,coming in from belfast by train catching flight out next day north star was a great pick across the street from connolly station and a couple of blocks from the flybus stop transit was a snap complimentary upgrade to floor room was most appreciated making for a quieter stay it is close to train tracks had dinner at hotel restaurant and staff friendly and food very good room was spacious and bed very comfortable,1
1736,i was staying several nights in the hotel it was great the best experience was contributed by the consultor concierge name keirn he was helpful and kind and he made my staying much much better is an asset to the hotel and i will sure come back because of only thing i did like was the bad behavior and very in kind of the reception stuff called evagilad,1
1737,stayed here a few times when going to a concert bus station and luas across the road so handy min walk to city centre rooms fab had everything wifi fridge great choice for breakfast staff fantastic highly recommend roll on september for another concert break hopefully the band does cancel this time,1
1738,i booked this hotel recently for a trip with my two teenage children it is in a great location however i had a number of problems with my stay which i do think the hotel staff seemed to give enough attention to firstly when i arrived i was told that i had only booked a double room i explained that i had double checked my email and it says triple room and i paid more to which the receptionist pointed to his form and said no it was a double clearly this was not my fault or the receptionists fault but his response was pointless there is obviously an issue between the booking site and the hotel details he did find me a room with a double and single bed and i was grateful as we were all very exhausted from an active i got to the room and ready for bed we discovered a problem with the electrics only one plug in the room worked as it was late i decided to get some sleep and report in the reported the problem to the receptionist on the morning and he advised he would get someone to look at arrived back to the hotel late that evening and i asked the reception staff if he was aware if the plugs had been fixed in my room he did know anything about it and i hoped this was a good sign unfortunately when we got to the room there was no,0
1739,i been at north star in july for a business trip courtesy of staff above average quality of service fast and and private bathromm were perfectly plus the wifi is excllent at a very high speed and working only minus was in the bathroom where lights over the basin were dim so that shaving properly was quite hard,1
1741,there was a mixup between our booking and the room being upgraded that required the manager to get us a second room to accommodate our family this took about minutes but there was no extra charge to us for the rooms were in the address which is the newer part of the hotel they were very nice and modern really cool technology for lighting ac controls yes ac room attendance etc no sheet just a comforter duvet which annoys me but it s the same in most of northern europe there is a nice roof top café for those in the address i do think it is accessible by those in the older section of the hotel i also not sure how rooms get booked in the older newer section or if it just luck to get the new one there was nothing differentiating the two on the mobile breakfast buffet was well stocked but the room got quite busy likely due to peak tourist location is great it is right across the street from connolly rail station it about a block from the bus station the airport busses drop off on talbot street coming from the airport and pick up at the bus station it a short walk to o connel street within a minute walk to most of the city center attractions about minute walk to guiness teeling or restaurant bar was nice with friendly staff and good food they were accommodating for our young kids and had,1
1742,we stayed here in june very tastefully decorated and a very comfortable room was a little pricey but was worth it great location to pubs and restaurants not too far from airport would definitely recommend,1
1743,while this hotel is quite a walk from the it was clean and comfortable and the room was large the property is well manicured and the structure is historic we ate in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a nice steak staff were very friendly and helpful,1
1745,stayed in a regular hotel room that was fine nothing fancy but a good deal for the money the room and bathroom were very clean the beds comfortable our room came with the full breakfast each morning which i liked very much our walk to trinity college or to the temple bar district took about minutes this was our second stay at the north star and we would stay there again the hotel is right across the street from connolly rail station,1
1746,the rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building i had to change rooms and i had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total the price is just too high for what you actually get considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc is limited and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block the trains that pass connolly station shake the whole building every ten minutes the walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by as well as what your neighbours are up to go figure the carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh the most positive thing i can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented when i told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue but for the price paid i would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast,0
1747,hotel nice sauna lovely but it was the concierge that made it for us really helpful and friendly a true delight next door seemed nice though only had a drink next to a train line but could hear it in the room,1
1748,came to dublin as a treat after recovering from an illness our room was shabby with the formica peeling off the furniture stains on the lampshades and grouting around the bath discoloured the air con was outdated and noisy the shower was extremely low powered the room was at the back of the hotel on the ground floor with virtually no natural light getting in therefore had to have the light on all the time how depressing large blue bins for refuge collection were lined up right outside our window the breakfast was just ok the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and courteous as were the staff in mcgettican cookhouse the food here was very good and great value,0
1749,we had planned a romantic trip to dublin as we had not been in around years we booked a very smart star hotel off stevens and looked forward to it a bit of class and luxury however some friends found out we were coming and the aspect of the trip changed and we realised that we would not be in the hotel so much so why splash out we decided to down grade a little and found the address north what a great decision although not having the plushness of the original hotel the quality was excellent ok its maybe on the north side of the liffey but everything in dublin is easily accessible and the hotel is handy for the bus station luas tram and connolly street station you can walk to the grafton street within mins no problem and there is plenty to take in on noted someone mention that the trains from connolly made the hotel shake this was not our experience at all and we overlooked the track around yards south of the train passed directly below our window i could have jumped onto the roof of it in the morning you were aware they were there but no more than a main road and our intention was to be having a lie in a vibrant city like dublin harsh comment i felt used the floor lounge for continental breakfast which was ideal for something quick before heading rooms were excellently furbished and you will be,1
1750,just came back from a long weekend in dublin nights stayed at the north star hotel well maintained and very stylish star hotel staff was very welcoming and ca assist us enough if we need anything rooms are very well presented and the location is perfect mins from tram or station we had an amazing time and would stop here again,1
1753,stayed here for one night after the concert it was for the night which i think is expensive but then it is dublin and at a very busy time the hotel is in a good location not too far away from everything but also not a noisy part of town a bit old fashioned in decor and ensuite but very clean and the bed was very very comfortable,1
1754,i am writing reviews a few years now and i tend to not leave one if it too for the price i paid for this room i was giving single beds in a room the room had a damp smell in it disgusting the most disturbing part was when i put my toiletries down i noticed thick hairs all over the sink and tap nobs the bathroom was not cleaned no wonder there was a bad smell they need to change the shower curtains as well because when there left up too long they reek and this is the first hotel i actually stayed in where they were going to charge a late check out i had to rush my things out of the restaurant staff were very had a nice pint of heineken,0
1755,this hotel has a great location and should bar food is average and the service very slow it also is intentioned staff need better customer is my first experience with half a cup of coffee for the price of a full coffee top ups lot of work to is a reason why three sets of tourists walked out service needs serious improvement in this bar there are much better options in dublin,0
1757,stayed here with my partner for nights hotel room was nice good size and very clean the room was equip with everything we needed and it was cleaned every day the breakfast was nice with plenty to choose from location is very good as it is close to the city center less than minute walk and also it is far enough out that it is quiet for a city at night time staff were all very nice and very negative to add about this hotel we had a great stay and will be returning in the future,1
1758,overall our room was large and clean i particularly enjoyed the hot tea with real china mugs the bed was large and very comfortable we were at the front of the hotel catty corner from merrion square and the statue of oscar wilde we could hear people laughing from the park the bathroom could use a better overhead light they had a at one time but did not have one open when we were there and it was unclear if they would have one again they were not working on it while we were there the staff was friendly and really helpful we paid for the breakfast at in which is how we got a discount offf the breakfast was great very filling with a good mix of hot and cold items,1
1759,my daughter and i stayed here for our first taste of ireland we arrived late and spent days exploring the city the staff were friendly accommodating and efficient we will continue to stay there whenever we come to dublin kudos to the management and staff our room was clean and had everything we needed the boutique atmosphere and the neighborhood made us feel truly welcome breakfast was delicious and served in a great room with a view of dublin daily life,1
1760,i surprised by some of the negative reviews due to noise we stayed in a room facing the street on a summer weekend and did not hear much noise perhaps we were lucky the hotel was great wonderful location tasty breakfast friendly service we were pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews,1
1762,the location of this hotel is very good it very close to temple bar area and many other attractions the rooms are big and clean the beds are comfortable breakfast could have more options the thing that really bothered me was that i could hear a tram every few minutes and it really annoying in a whole if you are not sensitive to noises as i am i would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1764,we stayed for nirghts at the albany hotel in two different rooms they are very slowly and unobtrusively trying to do repairs and update rooms our first front basement room was updated and faced the tram tracks our second back basement room was partially updated with new bathroom carpet and wall coverings both rooms were an average city size room and functioned well both had instant coff and tea making equipment we asked for a fan and were provided was in a pleasant room with fruit cereal cheeses an assortment of and front desk people were very helpful it was easy to walk to most attractions on both sides of the liffey,1
1765,albany house is close to stephens green and iveagh gardens the staff was great especially in the breakfast room we enjoyed the breakfast lots of options the room was nice and clean with a good size bathroom the only drawbacks were the noise from outside which continued until the middle of the night and the construction inside the hotel the quality of your experience is largely dependent on which room you get,1
1766,albany house is a short walk to a tour bus stop which makes getting around the city very easy hotel is also walking distance to restaurants our group had rooms and all rooms had bathrooms we arrived in dublin early and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags at the hotel before we checked in so we did have to get lockers or lug them around included breakfast was very nice hotel does have air conditioning so i recommend opening the window as soon as you get to your room and leaving it open throughout the day so it is stuffy when you return at the end of the day,1
1767,very tired looking hotel which desperately needs some love first room offered was in the basement and was really noisy moved to the top and was still really noisey due to the seedy all night clubs over the road room walls were heavily stained and the room had an unpleasant musty odour like most hotels in dublin it is overpriced but if you going to pay over the odds you may as well pay a tenner more and go somewhere nice,0
1769,pros the hotel is right next to the bus station and a trolley stop it close enough to walk to the main areas of dublin without being in a busy area not too the room was pretty no ac or temperature controls there literally a floor fan to keep cool not even a good one the bathroom looks like it should be in a star hotel with a toilet that is falling apart and flickering light bad for a quick stay but not a place i would pick again,0
1771,this was a last minute find a good find great location small unique adorable place rooms were clean bed was comfortable and it had everything we needed food was great in the restaurant staff was so helpful when we asked questions about the area good value,1
1772,stay in dublin on business frequently have not stayed here before very central and easy to find rooms slightly dated however very comfortable and clean had dinner in their restaurant food and service were fantastic great breakfast and to put the icing on the cake great value for money compared to other big chain hotels would highly recommend will definitely stay there again,1
1773,stayed nights for the concert at corke park lovely hotel very clean and spacious rooms had dinner one first night and food was excellent and great value very friendly and helpful staff would definitely stay again,1
1774,my wife and i stayed at the sheldon for nights for our wedding anniversary travelled from england to dublin for a weekend away staff very friendly food amazing in the very clean and welcoming hotel,1
1775,we booked very last minute and it was wonderful that they had room for us excellent staff lovely building the last minute deal was off but the room they gave us was far in the noisy back and not worth the price we paid for it better to stay in the wing and closer to the front to avoid the hostel noise,1
1776,being someone who travels extensively for work i can say i experience my fair share of dump hotels this place however tops them by a good way it pure nasty so where do i begin i start with minor grievance of only towel in a bed room i had towels in a no star hotel in lobito the front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless could not offer alternative room when i complained at the rooms allocated small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it a little on the snug side our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get was the sympathetic front desk reply the all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day the photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of guinness would i be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online to top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of in what way was that even remotely possible the only way i can get my head around that if if the catagory was the,0
1777,i was very disappointed in this hotel i do not think it was worth the money charged and the euro extra if you required breakfast was extremely over priced we have stayed in dublin before at a different hotel for less the price and had the perfect stay our stay this time was not good at all our room was so hot it was uncomfortable we could not open a window as it was next to the tram track and railway and was very noisy in fact it was noisy with the window closed too the bed was so hard i probably could have slept on the floor and had the same nights sleep the shower was actually a tap on the wall the room service came at between in the afternoon this was far too late for us and when we spoke to them about this they said their english was poor so did really understand we also made the mistake of drinking in the bar and found that this was also extremely expensive like the breakfast for four bailey and three coffees we did have a good stay at all and would not return the positive was that the hotel was clean,0
1778,pleasant and comfortable hotel with health club very helpful front desk staff the health club has local members too i found i had the most interesting conversations in the sauna where guests and dubliners mix full bar and restaurant great continental breakfast with unlimited fresh fruit and cereals cappuccino machine in lobby only minutes luas ride to dublin city center and minute cab ride to airport the luas stop is a minute walk away very manageable even drunk,1
1779,we bought a leap card at the tourist info desk in airport and this allowed us to use the bus train and luas for got a bus into the city centre and then the luas to kylemore and hotel is a minute walk so great hotel is a little dated but spotless clean we arrived at and were given a room which was were in room small with a sloping ceiling but clean and well stocked with toiletries and tea and coffee large tv with lots of were above the lively bar but music stopped at on sat night and on sunday night so did bother deal included breakfast which was buffet style cereal juices toast pastries fruit and cold meats and cheese the cooked breakfast was to order and the full irish was great there is a cafe and a hour mcdonalds as well as garages across the road for anything else you would use this hotel again to save paying over the odds for a city centre one,1
1780,my mother and i stayed at your hotel last week and overall it was a dreadful it was described on as a quiet haven it is not for a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet we arrived tired and hungry at later than planned due to travel delays we were told the restaurant was closing even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until the receptionist who greeted us in a rather cold and manner called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open so we rushed through to the restaurant the waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley but he did start the conversation by saying oh the chef is gon na be pissed off grab a table and order quickly the food was not good we had booked a twin room that according to the photos on had two small double beds on arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite however the suite was a room on the ground floor at the front of the hotel next to the busy car park it was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed it was noisy and depressing my mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking i went back to reception to query the,0
1781,we enjoyed our stay at the marker we arrived from boston at and the room was ready for us to drop off our stuff and take a shower the hotel is in a great location it took us minutes walk to get to temple bar for drinks and dinner the breakfast was awesome,1
1782,the marker is a really gorgeous hotel and we had a most luxurious stay the location is great and the rooms are very comfortable the staff are all great and very helpful i highly recommend the marker hotel as a treat,1
1783,i decided to stay at this hotel on my first trip to dublin knowing i was in for a real treat this hotel is located in the heart of the grand canal dock or silicone docks with facebook headquarters and other tech companies in the area but if that does interest you the square out front on the water is a gorgeous view for recharging shops are minutes away as well the room was luxurious spotless and has a nespresso machine for coffee fans the staff are very friendly and welcoming and will provide you with anything you forgot at home irish people have got to be one of the friendliest folk i know but i could be biased i used the spa which had everything you need the rooftop bar was closed due to an event but they served great cocktails at the main bar fantastic but not cheap worth a revisit,1
1784,great location in dublin near the ccd all staff were pleasant and willing to assist us snacks in the marker bar were appreciated and very tasty one issue my husband received a pint of guinness he mentioned this to bartender and ordered a different drink he was charged for the guinness that he was unable to drink,1
1785,i travel with my friend and we have stayed in different hotels the marker was the best hotel we have ever stayed in i would highly recommend to friends and family all of our needs were met i was very impressed,1
1786,this is one of the best hotels i stayed in i chose this hotel for it proximity to the rds arena the hotel looks out on to a vibrant area which is busy during the day with office workers but very quiet at night there are amenities close but the hotel offers many services and will do their best to source what you need we were surprised to find how wonderful the staff were and how eager they were to help us with anything the spa was the icing of the cake as it was the perfect relaxation after our flight our room was bright and the bathroom was a great side and both were brilliantly furbished great mattress i would happily stay again,1
1787,the hotel is very comfortable bad room is clean and modern room equipment is great room service service is excellent it is very easy to get to the hotel by bus a lot of places with food around i would definitely recommend this hotel for stay,1
1788,this is my second time visiting the marker it an incredible hotel with outstanding service start to finish every member of the team is friendly welcoming warm and so helpful i never experienced such brilliant service anywhere in the world thank you to all at the brilliant marker we will definitely be back,1
1789,bar staff and receptionists were very polite and is great drinks were great and the rooms are is lovely and quite never too busy and is very definitely pay for what you hotel,1
1790,we stayed at the marker as our first stop in ireland as part of a day trip we were greeted warmly and promptly checked into our room upon arrival the front desk valet and bell service were very efficient we were in our room with our bags and the car valet parked within minutes of pulling up to the hotel we booked a suite which had nice views of the adjacent bord gais energy theatre the room was nicely appointed and a good size toiletries were of a high caliber i blanking on the brand temple bar dublin castle trinity college and other sites are minutes by foot but we took a cab for under used the hotel as a base to visit northern ireland on a day trip to belfast the giant causeway and rope excellent accommodations and service,1
1791,a modern hotel with first class traditional service standards the rooms are clean modern and spacious even with a proper iron for fellow crease freaks the restaurant is great high quality ingredients and a flexible approach to standard requests and the bar delivers fantastic wines and cocktails,1
1792,staff rooms bar food pool were superbthe best weekend in soooo long thank you to all staff they were superb in was very nice to met you charlie and thankyou for everything the hotel is a credit to you and your superb staff,1
1793,we stayed at the marker hotel dublin for nights for my business trip it was an excellent experience the hotel was modern and clean the service was excellent the staff were friendly and helpful whenever we made a request the staff took care of it right away during the first night of the stay the music from the roof top bar above my room was quite loud they immediately changed us to another room on another floor definitely recommend this hotel and will go back again if i am in dublin again,1
1794,stayed in the marker just one night expensive but completely worth it the spa and rooftop are unlike anything you can find in dublin also the staff was very helpful with early and luggage storage,1
1795,soundproofing is one of the most important criteria in our book and we were very happy with this hotel our alarm clock was just about the only thing that disturbed our mornings we know we had a neighbor on at least one side but we never heard a thing also virtually no noise from the hallway housekeeping is very quiet and professional the hotel is very new and everything is still nice and shiny really gorgeous bathroom space for clothes is rather tight but that about the only small issue we had we had a room with a partial view of the canal and loved having coffee there in the morning also beautiful views at night definitely worth the extra money,1
1796,this is a star hotel in terms of service and amenities the staff is exemplary the food is excellent with many locally sourced sections my only request is for windows that allow fresh air after a night stay i was craving fresh air in the room,1
1797,absolutely loved the marker the room bathroom and amenities were top notch the bar has a great selection and their complimentary nuts are so good service is top of the line i was so happy that my dad who was traveling with us took advantage of the tub to relax and loved the shower great views great staff,1
1798,a very modern and hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the service was everything was we would definitely recommend this hotel the staff was very helpful in booking tourist tickets,1
1799,even in good hotels i usually find some little niggly detail that was quite right but i can honestly say this hotel was faultless we flew into dublin early and taxied to the hotel arriving expecting to bag check but we were able to check in immediately and access our room the hotel must be very new it was spotless and everything felt new and fresh the outlook was good the facilities were good we did have breakfast there so ca comment on that but there was a great café yards away it is a little bit further out of the city centre but we walked in about minutes or a cab would take no time the staff were helpful and friendly room spacious bathroom really gorgeous with big shower and a bath facilities and a fridge good storage space just all perfect,1
1800,what a star way to launch a trip to ireland beautiful hotel only outshadowed by their staff and customer service treat yourself to a stay and experience this wonderful property sit on the front patio and watch dubliners go by with a cold guiness or glass of wine or indulge and toast the town from the roof top bar with a spectacular view of the miss the marker already,1
1801,the marker hotel is in a beautiful location allowing us to walk everywhere in room was spacious and had a very luxurious spa was great with a beautiful pool whirlpool and saunas both wet and ordered room service several times and it was excellent with fast service and a reasonable price,1
1802,absolutely no complaints from check in to check out to the room service and to the people who service your room everyone was excellent my wife left a bill on the night stand for a couple of days and it never disappeared they were honest and friendly a great stay and worth the price,1
1803,greeted by friendly staff as we pulled up in car who took our luggage and brought us to reception where equally friendly staff checked us in and brought us to our room i had emailed previously to mention that we were staying for our honeymoon night and the hotel kindly sent us some cupcakes and a note thanking us for choosing their hotel for our honeymoon room was spotless and my husband enjoyed the nespresso coffee machine we also had a great view and the bathroom was huge massive shower lovely soaps food in bar was exceptional staff again very friendly and helpful after our night out we arrived back to find the staff had dimmed the lights arranged rose petals on the bed and made swan towels such a kind gesture ordered breakfast in the room which was amazing pool was incredible steam room and sauna definitely worth a visit overall best hotel experience i have ever had great attention to detail would recommend to anyone,1
1804,i think said it all great service in every area of the hotel even before we had a great time and if we go back to dublin in the future we will be there for sure outstanding experience,1
1805,first class from beginning to end our stay at the marker was remarkable highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to dublin and looking for a hotel which is right in the centre of dublin but within walking distance great location and superb accomodation,1
1806,my wife and i loved our stay st the marker we started our vacation in ireland at the marker for daysand finished our vacation hereall the staff were excellent starthe roof bar is outstanding we will return,1
1807,four weary travelers walked into the marker and somehow in an instant we perked up while the complimentary coffee in the lobby helped it was the exceptional service and friendly staff that made the first impression our group arrived early and barry the concierge invited us to a tour of the area the director of sales roisin and director of revenue catriona took time out of their busy day showed us around shared the area history and dropped us off at the ferryman pub as we kindly requested just had to start off our trip with a guinness we are extra thankful to them other things about the marker they have an afternoon candy bar a eucalyptus steam room comfortable beds a rooftop bar and they are if i could i would live there,1
1808,loved everything about this hotel from the guest relations all the way to the doorman i cant fault anything perhaps except would have prefered non specific times for kids to use the pool although i understand the reasons why the rooms were great internet superfast i suppose you have to be since you are next to facebook and google,1
1809,excellent hotel would definitely stay here again quiet modern friendly staff good breakfast cool rooftop bar lovely rooms with comfy big beds good air conditioning fabulous bathrooms with underfloor heating nicely situated just out of the busy centre of dublin but very quick and easy to get into the centre it located in a hip up and coming part of dublin next to the water with a few restaurants bars and an upmarket supermarket nearby and there nearly always taxi outside waiting to take you anywhere else highly recommend these restaurants osteria lucio grand canal dock near hotel delahunt restaurant lower camden street and fade street social fade street,1
1810,we had a nine day trip to ireland and stayed at the marker at the beginning of our stay and returned for the final three nights of our trip we have stayed at top hotels all over the world and the quality of the service is four seasons or ritz carlton level the property is new and very modern not directly in the touristy center but on quay near all the new tech companies great front desk service extremely efficient management and a great experience overall excellent air conditioning we american beds amenities etc book a rate with the breakfast and it could be your best meal of the day recommended,1
1811,i chose this hotel as a special last night treat to end my holiday from australia a beautiful hotel that is brilliantly located amongst the fresh development of dublin it sophisticated elegant and minimal style was appealing the delux room was lovely and bed very comfortable i would stay here again,1
1813,the marker is truly a great place to stay in dublin i will definitely be back next year the location is fabulous and the staff was even better i did not have a chance to visit the rooftop bar but i will make it a priority next time i would like to see the roof top bar open later on sundays,1
1814,an excellent hotel in great location very warm welcome shown to me for returning to the hotel cake delivered to room with personal message one tiny negative issue handle on shower door is dangerous and should be looked at,1
1815,we had a fabulous water view from room upgraded us for booking online ate in the busy with yummy cocktails there was a young hip and also a business crowd hotel had valet parking a must great friendly service an outstanding breakfast highly recommend the marker hotel,1
1816,brilliant property excellent staff short taxi ride or walk to city center convenient to events at croke park good selection of restaurants on property wonderful place great amenities ca say enough good things about the marker,1
1817,very friendly staff and excellent all around hotel the spa facilities are the best i ever seen at a hotel and felt like a private spa the politeness of all staff from the concierge to the room cleaning staff was a credit to themselves and the management,1
1819,pretty well faultless tastefully modern genuinely courteous staff excellent food we arrived after a long drive and refreshed ourselves in the pool and sauna reinvigorated we took off in the courtesy car really nice touch we were lucky ca book just happened to be free after a brief tour we walked back the mins from the centre of town for drinks on the rooftop and then dinner all good the best night sleep in ireland followed silent corridors silence outside these people recognise that as a hotel what they are selling amongst other things is sleep and here you find top quality sleep,1
1820,booked at this hotel early for my stay arrived and found this hotel just great in the middle for everything close to shopping bars etc the rooms was great and clean good bar with shows you can buy breakfast at the hotel recommended,1
1821,this hotel is old but has comfortable and the staff are very helpful polite and buffet breakfast food and have live music is a great location next to the river liffey,1
1822,when you are in a city for a weekend you want to be in the hub of things this comfortable hotel with friendly staff is a hop across the bridge from temple bar and it amazing selection of pubs and a stroll from all the shops in the opposite direction the added bonus is the lively bar downstairs highly recommend this hotel for weekend breaks with friends in the city,1
1823,this hotel is just so good right on the river front near the halfpenny bridge staff are lovely nothing to much trouble always polite and helpful they are a credit to the hotel breakfast is to die for at it a bargain rooms clean and tidy made up everyday the show in the bottom of the hotel is fantastic and not to be missed included is a three course meal and it great food the irish band and dancers are brilliant the atmosphere was great too thoroughly recommend this hotel and the staff and the show we will be returning next year,1
1824,walking distance to almost everything in dublin and we really enjoyed the downstairs went there for lunch dinner had the very reasonably priced euro buffet breakfast every morning which was great and a few times just sat at the bar drinking a few cocktails and listening to some traditional irish music room was basic but a decent size and comfortable we absolutely stay here again,1
1825,check in was simple with a very pleasant helpful member of staff our room was everything we could want clean comfortable with a safe and ironing board and plenty of tea and coffee bathroom was a good size and lovely orla kielly toiletries this hotel is a little walk from city centre but easy to find and get around from there are plenty of bars cafes etc for food on the route and this proved handy when we walked home late after being out for the evening i used the pool which was quiet and clean another bonus is the bus to and from airport stops right outside this is the second time i have stayed here and i would definately stay again,1
1826,i stayed at the camden court for nights on my way to kerry it is fairly centrally located within easy walking distance of central dublin ca mins with the luas overground train and buses on the doorstep i love this hotel as it offers parking which i often need when coming back to ireland and it has a leisure center with a lovely swimming pool and jacuzzi plus sauna and steam room and all the gym equipment you could want i prefer to just use the pool and the jacuzzi to unwind from being on the road for almost a day breakfast was a pleasant surprise this time around the last time i had breakfast there years ago it was nothing to shout home about this time though it was great high quality and all hot food well prepared there was a huge amount of choice for every taste and staff were helpful and friendly can definitely recommend it i also appreciated the wonderful porters who helped me with my luggage everyone in fact was helpful friendly and a joy to interact with thank you for making my first two days back in ireland memorable and enjoyable,1
1827,hotel was very nice and has a great bar but in the morning housekeeping knocked twice and just walked into my room this was at even thought check out is until noon everything else was fine great location near stephens green and the luas,1
1828,first of all the woman at the desk on check in was nice but after this we were met with a wave rudeness from the staff i asked for a taxi to go to our concert and the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and made me feel embarrassed in front of other guests checking in then when we went for breakfast the following morning that we already paid for at check in we were told we had to pay each when we stated we paid the charge for breakfast already the girl argued with us and would not accept that we paid we were told to sit down but we were given no apology for the mistake then during breakfast i went to the bathroom and while i was gone a member of staff tried to chat up my girlfriend i expect this behaviour from a drunken buffoon in a nightclub at in the morning but not from a member of staff at a four star hotel i would never stay in this hotel again it totally ruined our weekend and would not recommend it either,0
1829,stayed just one night had a family room which was great and very clean all the staff we encountered were very welcoming and helpful it was in a perfect location for the concert we went to in iveagh definitely stay here again,1
1830,lovely rooms supplied with fresh toiletries every day close to many restaurants and bars clean and nice breakfasts wifi was good enough for me to use my laptop whilst here on business rooms are a bit hot and can be noisy when windows open but overall excellent,1
1833,we were not in our rooms much and they were fine a little cramped and no air conditioning but probably not a problem normally since it was much warmer than usual when we were there pretty noisy with windows open at night location is great and offers many walkable restaurants staff was polite and the breakfast buffet was very good,1
1834,i have stayed here many times over the years on business and i like the area being just outside the city centre and unique in having a decent size pool hot tub sauna and steam room and gym which i use every this july trip however the rooms were hot due to lack of any air conditioning and with no mini bar to keep water and drinks cold so a sleepless night with a noisy fan blowing hot air around the room and if you open the window then you will be kept awake by the traffic and noisy people on the street late at night so you ca would imagine they would have to tear the place apart to put air con in so understandable but no excuse for a star hotel not to fit mini bars in the wardrobes so at the very least you can cool down with a cold drink while you sweat the night another matter when i came back here for the england v ireland nations rugby match in march they charged me euros for a room and no breakfast this is simply taking advantage of england fans charging star hotel prices for a hotel just about a star my irish business partner who introduced me to the hotel was so appalled he secretly paid for our room as a surprise when we checked in you really must stop doing this on nations match days it bad than that good all round but i,1
1835,convenient location to city centre clean hotel with good quality fixtures and fittings nice friendly staff and room maintained well by the maid service all in all a great stay here and thoroughly recommend,1
1837,this was the first trip to ireland for my wife and i we were with gate travel and stayed nights here beautiful hotel with very good and friendly was able to walk to numerous places and of course taxis were plentiful,1
1838,one to avoid and i do say that lightly stayed here as it was adjacent to the iveagh gardens and a dropkick murphy gig we were attending with good friends on the face of it a half decent hotel but let down very badly once you scratch the surface no aircon the rooms are melting at best but if you manage to negotiate the safety clasp on the window you can get some air into the room but then the million seagulls keep you awake from the crack of dawn which in july is obviously early just as the brain is beginning to accept the squeaking seagulls the hotel offers a new alarm call tap tap tap on the door so i open the door to a sheepish eastern european girl who is already walking away down the corridor sorry i just checking rooms forgive me but that cheap cheap cheap check out is actually noon so why are you waking us up never ever again disgraceful city centre hotel,0
1839,my wife and i have just returned home from a two night stay july and on the whole enjoyed our stay although we had a few problems with the room it was small as was the bed in the bathroom the shower always seemed on the point of overflowing as the outlet seemed blocked and the temperature valve could be turned so the shower was lukewarm at best these were minor irritations which we reported on checkout and we were assured we would be allocated a better room next time on the plus side the breakfast was absolutely fantastic as was the one evening meal we had in the lounge and the hotel is in a good location and any staff we came in contact with were very helpful we would stay again not in room,1
1840,i stayed here with work previously and it left a good impression so when we were going to a concert this was the first place i thought of really comfortable clean rooms parking was great staff were so helpful lovely seating area to watch the world go by food in the bar was lovely overall would definitely stay here again,1
1841,great place to stay with good communication to dublin city lovely hotel great breakfast and staff perfect way to get to and from the hotel from dublin city take the bus to the river or take a walk for about to the central streets close to all the great places to visit for pictures and cultural interests,1
1842,this was our trip to dublin for my parents and i we were looking for hotels around the same location we stayed last time since it was a zone we were more familiar with and camden hotel stood out because of its location within walking distance from the center of the city noting that dublin it not that big modern look facilities and one of the few that offers family room triple room in our case saving us from having get an extra room the room itself was comfortable and spacious the staff was there are a couple of bars around is right outside but from our room we did hear any loud music or voices so we were disturbed by it a great hotel i would recommend it,1
1843,i always try to be honest and find positives during my stay at various places unfortunately the bad outweighed the good on this check in we were able to get into our room early which was brilliant after a hours train journey from belfast and the weather was scorching however the receptionists were so busy talking between themselves that we were overcharged by unfortunately we did not notice this until we got home but after a quick email to the hotel we were refunded quickly had the check in staff been paying more attention this mistake would not have we got to our room in the blazing heat we were delighted to find it clean and bright but the corridors were tired however the heat was stifling you are not able to open the windows due to safety catches and because we were above the busy main road the traffic was deafening no win situation i now understand that the hotel provide fans on request maybe something the staff should make clear when checking in rather than having conversations with each other after a good nights sleep forget it because we had to keep the window open all night so as not to suffocate in the heat all we could hear all night was traffic and drunk people directly outside the window then at a knock at the door from housekeeping when check out is at noon and after a shockingly bad nights sleep being disturbed at that time was,0
1844,we stayed three nights at camden court so got a good idea of what the hotel is like the customer service was good the rooms quite large and well equipped and breakfast was outstanding the hotel has an indoor pool and well equipped gym there is much more you could want in a hotel is also well located with easy access to the main attractions it is outside the temple bar zone so it relatively quiet but not too far as to make the walk to see everything too great it is also surrounded by many bars and thought overall it was good value for money,1
1845,very well located hotel room was comfortable with nice flat screen tv that was very good a bit of noise from the street because hotel is downtown the windows in room open and fresh air was a bonus the beds were very comfortable two restaurants that were fine the bleeding horse pub is adjacent to hotel and many other restaurant in walking distance grafton street shopping area and stephens green as well as the dublin museum of natural history were close walking distance we would stay at the hotel again when back in dublin,1
1846,sorry but this hotel was not good stayed in room which faces over the internal courtyard where park to access the hotel no air con so window needed to be left open to keep room reasonable temperature woken at by delivery lorry which was noisily loaded this is street noise this was directly outside the hotel and appeared to be stuff from the hotel reception told me this was a quiet room when i checked in sorry but they were having a laugh,0
1847,just back from camden court hotel for the bus from the airport hotel staff very helpful bedroom very clean excellent full breakfast plenty choice only a minute walk to graften street,1
1848,beautiful hotel location room size amenities and restaurant all excellent agree with other reviewer about the night noise though especially if you are there in the summer and need your windows open to keep it cool staff was very nice and we would stay there again,1
1849,this is the fourth time i stay at the clarence and yet again the service was great the room spotless and the view over liffey never dissapoints the only thing possible that could be better is the continental breakfast buffet although everything on it is good it could be more substantial,1
1850,the clarence is a beautiful hotel in the heart of temple bar in dublin the staff is very welcoming and attentive there is a lovely restaurant with a wonderful breakfast buffet the octagon bar serves wonderful drinks and is roomy enough to meet up with friends,1
1851,just had my first stay at the clarence i loved it the staff was magnificently friendly and helpful the design of the building and the rooms are elegant and very stylish my room was generously sized for a european hotel and mine was a standard room i did have any meals except a simple breakfast only issue with this place is the noise of the burger joint in the place next door but i knew this neighborhood would be lively at night and my jet lag was so intense that i had no trouble sleeping through the noise in my very comfortable bed,1
1853,great access to dublin popular temple bar area restaurant and lounge areas are nice serving standard fare hotel close to many dublin attractions like cathedrals dublin castle and guinness storehouse staff is exceptionally helpful and courteous they made the stay very pleasant easy walking to excellent shopping pubs and restaurants fun hotel for fans,1
1854,it a great location for all the sites temple bar district is right outside the backdoor the front faces the river liffey nicely done rooms and amazingly quite rooms with all the noise outside our second time to dublin and have stayed here both times we would recommend the clarence to our family and friends,1
1856,we loved this hotel with extremely helpful staff and a fantastic location but selfishly loud drunks roam the streets of temple bar shouting and singing early into the morning with no air conditioning and unusually warm weather we needed to keep the windows open on our balcony room and had trouble sleeping even on the fourth floor if you want to take part in the fun in temple bar then this will not bother you the restaurant in the hotel unusual casual food which is very tasty so can be a good option for an early gym but you can exercise by walking to just about everything you need to see from here so do bother with the tour buses,1
1857,night stay in july had read some of the reviews concerning heat and noise before staying so emailed to try and avoid same issues hotel could guarantee rooms at the front of the hotel but would try also arranged for fans to be in the rooms when we arrived my parents room was at the front ours at the back there was a bit of noise from the college bars but once the shutters were closed it was gone and we slept like logs opened the windows in the day to keep the room nice and cool which brings me to the bed amazing big and really comfortable easy to have a lie in staff were fantastic especially the guy that helped us get in to the hotel without being seen by people we were avoiding clean nice facilities good cocktails in octogenarian bar and tasty bar snacks would definitely recommend and ca wait to stay again,1
1858,i stayed here for the first time on a recent overnight business trip the hotel decor is art deco plain but true and consistent the public areas are so one is inclined to lounge and the hotel lacks a buzz the room was very nice and comfortable but it was a rare hot evening in dublin and although they supplied a mobile loud aircon unit and a fan it was very difficult to get the room temperature right made worse by a bar courtyard adjoining premises below playing loud music that said this would not be a problem of the time given the climate the tv did work very well and there was a limited range of channels not a huge issue for me breakfast in cleaver east was nice and the dinner menu looked interesting service throughout my stay was excellent the hotel is in a prime tourist location i think it better suited to tourists than business travellers but it was close to the four courts so that suited my purposes by dublin standards the price was good and as such it represented very good value,1
1860,i enjoyed my stay at the clarence the location ca be beat it within easy walking distance of many historical sites shopping and restaurants it also very easy to get to from the airport by bus and to heuston station the hotel itself is very clean cozy and i like the simple decor the room is a nice size and the bed is very comfortable the staff at the clarence were very welcoming friendly and helpful will definitely be staying here again,1
1861,this trip was the third time we have stayed in the clarance and is the best hotel to stay inwhile visiting the capital great location the staff are excellent and we were very comfortable and relaxed,1
1862,i recently purchased a house in clare and when i fly from la into dublin i like to stay at the clarence before traveling onward the location is great and the rooms are well organized and maintained,1
1863,our standard twin room was really very nice with lots of storage comfortable beds and a beautiful bathroom the decor is low key classic front desk staff could have been nicer wish we could have stayed longer,1
1864,brilliantly located and the staff could not do enough to please rooms are clean comfortable and spacious i really enjoyed my time here and i look forward to returning also had a lovely dinner at cleaver east,1
1865,we were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely touch and very much appreciated we had a super view of the liffey the breakfast was very good and overalll we thoroughly enjoyed our stay what more can i say,1
1866,nice rooms perfect location if you want to spend your evenings in the temple bar area this is a perfect location not too big and not to small with afternoon high teas lovely bar and restaurant on the premises as well,1
1867,i was happy with choosing this smaller sized hotel please let bono know it sits between temple bar on its back end and the liffey rover on the front my room was facing the river second floor this is the quieter side since the street behind is the main tourist strip so all of them have traditional irish music every night and has plenty of picturesque drunks of the local and tourist varieties the hotel itself is good friendly staff clean and good sized rooms in room wifi included although it can be spotty you can add breakfast but there are lots of coffee shops etc close by so go out and find something different,1
1868,fantastic night in dublin for the coldplay concert the clarence has one of the best locations in temple bar our room was amazing we booked a standard but the lovely girl on reception upgraded us to the garden terrace it was magnificent best room i ever had in dublin i was just sorry i could stay fir longer but we will defiantly be back,1
1869,i have heard a lot about the clarence and it famous for years but never had a reason to be in dublin that changed not so long ago and given the opportunity i decided i would try and stay i was struck by two things immediately the availability was easy and the price was not out of line with other options provided by the conference i was attending great sign me up i would refer to my first impression as this is authentic i may have been expecting something more extravagant given ownership and what is the norm at boutique hotels in london and ny excellent is cleaver east no doubt about it breakfast out of this world i would have eaten there again if it was for other responsibilities due to the conference lift to room quaintly oldschool the room very nice well appointed with a large washroom and good ammenities ah now let go get a beer in the famous octagon bar okay this needs serious help back over to cleaver east for a pint at the bar i had not researched the location it is literally a minute walk to temple bar the bar not just the area great if you like this sort of thing s t if not very close good news options roberta and the liquor room hop across the liffey and go to terra madre for italian tell alessandro i said hi otherwise the city is small and you can walk to everything,1
1870,had high hopes for this hotel but it was at best described as adequate loud vicinity appreciate that the hotel can only do so much to address this but more could be done in terms of the decor worn out carpets on the stairwells and very low budget shower curtains that stick to you you know the ones polite enough staff but they have an air that they are just going through the motions did find them very genuine it a shame as this place could be so much more,0
1871,my husband and i stayed very recently in clarence hotel we enjoyed our stay staff were very friendly bed very comfortable our room was to the front overlooking the river liffey not too noisy room very warm air conditioning was not inbuilt and we had to use small fan located on side table not the best position for fan television was small with a very limited range of channels tea making facilities were available but we only had cups and no saucers not a sign of a biscuit a little more attention to these small details would have added greatly to our opinion of this hotel,1
1873,a minute walk from the hotel covered all and more of the tourist spots we wanted to see on our day stay and most were closer than that the food was good and there were plenty of restaurants nearby the only negative in that context was the coffee at breakfast which was so thin and watery that we had breakfast elsewhere on the other mornings the dwarf jar doors along was excellent and even had freshly squeezed orange juice as a bonus being in temple bar meant the hotel octagon bar was mostly empty and a bit bleak not helped by the air conditioning on cool and the barman appearing a bit bored but a quiet bar could be an advantage with all the other noisy ones nearby still we would stay again,1
1874,this is a nice hotel like many others we stayed her during the recent joshua tree tour in dublin like those others we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by bono and the edge kinda nerdy but there it is i wanted to give this hotel stars but i ca this is not a holiday inn you paying more for a better experience and in some ways the clarence fell hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist it an easy walk to all of temple bar the book of kells and the fun stuff on street its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the guinness factory most public buses run on either street or dame street either one is a five minute walk away the temple bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did i feel uncomfortable walking around regardless of the hour the staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system printing out maps etc if my review ended there it would have five best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds the bed was probably one of the best i ever encountered in europe the front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing they made me want to stay longer this hotel could be so much more sadly several of us met in,1
1875,we stayed at the clarence on the tail end of a trip to ireland and were very excited to stay here big mistake it was a total dump we had two rooms and both were filthy the bathrooms floors were sticky and spotted the shower curtain liners were black with mildew one room had a horrible and persistent smell one sink did not drain at all the vents were covered in dust there were random smears of gd knows what on the shower walls one room windows did not open at all and there was no ac or ventilation gross and loud as our rooms overlooked a beer garden next door the lobby was likewise nasty with a sticky counter and floors i am not sure how other guests gave good reviews this hotel was totally especially for the price,0
1877,we had a nice family room well recommended if you travel with children quiet room and comfy beds nice bar down at the ground floor parkinson behind the building great service at the reception happy to stay here again,1
1878,we took our extended family on a trip to ireland and booked this hotel primarily because they offered family rooms for those of us with children in tow in addition it a nice location near but not in the middle of most tourist sights from the time we arrived at am hoping for early access to our rooms the hotel staff exceeded our expectations they worked hard to get us in as soon as they could were very helpful and accommodating about needed services extra blankets pillows etc and suggestions for tourist options rooms were clean and spacious the restaurant offered a very nice full buffet breakfast at a very reasonable price ours was included in our rate three bus lines stopped in front of the hotel all in all a very nice stop with special thanks to the wonderful staff,1
1879,hotel is of good standard and situated close to city center would recommend staying if you are looking for an overall good hotel we had a room facing the back which was very quiet parking is good and close in the next door multi storey car you are looking for something exciting this hotel is perhaps on the boring side of things,1
1881,my husband and i stayed for nights on a weekend in july we were impacted by the construction on weekdays the hotel was an easy euro taxi ride from the airport we arrived and they far exceeded my expectations by allowing us to check in to our room at that bonus points the room was spacious modern and totally clean the bathroom was also modern with a large there is which turned out to be more useful than i thought in ireland given the cool weather but they were our best nights of sleep because it was cool there is not a concierge but everyone at the front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations it was an easy walk to the city center and most attractions yet away from the bustle of the city each morning we needed a cab and ordered one the night before which worked out perfectly the cabbie even asks your room number to be sure it your restaurant was phenomenal for dinner did eat breakfast here and there is a small shop with any extras you need or there are grocery stores nearby the safe was big enough for a laptop i would stay again though hopefully could get a better price we were there weekend,1
1882,staff in the hotel did an excellent job however service in the restaurant was quite disappointing it seems like the wait staff are attentive to your first drink order and food order but after that their rarely check on you and it can be quite an effort to have your finished plates cleared order dessert or get and pay your bill,1
1883,our family room had two beds in it that slept four the room was ample sized and comfortable the bathroom was nice but small our first room did not have ac but we were moved to a room with ac when we inquired the breakfast was acceptable location is pretty good to reach major sites thought it was a little pricey but was happy to have a clean comfortable bed to sleep in when first arriving in dublin,1
1884,this was perfect from the start reception staff welcoming polite and helpful as were all the staff we came in contact with kudos to the breakfast staff who were a delight and very hard working breakfast buffet was repeatedly supplied with fresh perfectly cooked food and noting the huge number of guests passing through did a far better job than other places we had stayed at on our was surprising as well as a good sign that the general manager murtagh was actually at the desk checking people in helping out her staff and not in some back office room spotless and well the work going on to convert this from the old jury inn like other properties around europe and add a floor which seems to have become protracted we would not have known if it were not for the scaffolding located we will definitely stay here again when we fly back to ireland thanks murtagh,1
1885,thoroughly enjoyed our stay here beautifully clean room with great view over the river there was fab choice at breakfast really freindly and efficient staff on reception in the restaurant and housekeeping yes there is renovation work going on but apart from the scaffolding you would know the hotel is handy for the airport bus that stops right outside would definitely stay here again,1
1886,right on the river liffey the hilton garden inn custom house has marvellous views of the river and dublin the rooms are spacious and decently appointed with an airport bus stop right at the front door this hotel is convenient in the docklands area it is close to a number of attractions and either a luas light rapid transit ride or short walk from downtown dublin and many attractions lovely shop well appointed fitness room highly recommend this hotel,1
1887,just a single night in a twin room river view room was newly refreshed and a comfortable size for sure the building work needs to be taken into consideration particularly if you have arrived off a transatlantic flight and want some rest as previously mention there is no aircon yet this made it a little uncomfortable during the the best part of this stay was the breakfast certainly in line with or in some cases better than a normal hilton breakfast which is hard to beat would recommend it,1
1888,clean comfortable with all the amenities wonderful full irish breakfast inviting lobby area bar and dining available staff go above and beyond to help would stay again close to the quay walking distance to downtown dublin bus routes luas and many amenities highly recommend,1
1889,after doing on line check in on arrival on a hot day i had a room with no air con not feeling very well i asked the front desk if they could change room the lady apologised and moved me room the room was very clean and ideal the building work did impact as it is during day time location for work is great this is much better hotel than the sister doubletree hotel by miles and in a better location breakfast i was surprised as normally breakfasts in garden inns are not great this was very good,1
1890,was here because of at croke park hotel perfectly situated side of the liffey stones throw from the stadium and and temple bar train station hueston minutes away bus from airport return stops outside taxi constant order from reception but recommend the bus to transfer to airport if they run to your hotel is under renovation at the moment but although external scaffolding no real intrusion while staying conference room gym bar restaurant etc all good costa coffee inside as well staff courteous quick to give information and happy to help with most of the things you need in the foyer there is a machine to buy tickets for most of the attractions in spacious mini bar on request safe deposit box hairdryer bed comfortable shower large well equipped would stay again when in town,1
1891,close to bus terminal block away so very convenient from airport and blocks away from street where there are many places to eat or good checkin and check out rooms very clean laundry machine a plus too only bad thing was room was a bit hot no air conditioning under repairs so a small fan was provided i would recommend this place and would come back myself,1
1892,i booked this hotel mostly based on price and location we were in dublin for the concert and visiting the city for the first time so i wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis the hotel was great there are four of us two tall teen boys in tow and i wanted to be sure we were stacked on top of each other i read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations it did and then some upon arrival we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready fine since it was well before scheduled check in i pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the us that flights arrive in the morning but the hotels are always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation americans have of being arrogant travelers we saw this again upon arrival at this hotel americans angry that no room is available at am checkin is clearly noted as pm if your flight arrives at am and you want to be in your hotel at am you need to book it for the night prior if you can not do that then do,1
1893,very high building noise starting on am during work days no air conditioner no advice about this until arriving at hotel good breakfast except fruit juices which taste very sour awful experience overall,0
1894,the staff at this hotel are the best they are consistently working to make sure that your stay is enjoyable the rooms are new and well appointed the location is overlooking the river liffy blocks from the custom house a comfortable hotel in the center of all activities in dublin,1
1895,location locaion location very close to downtown and everywhere is within pretty much walking distance minute walk to the spire minute walk to george dock luas station if you want to get to the west side of the downtown with ease airlink bus at the door step it took only minutes to the airport the staff is above and beyond the standard they are exceptional hotel appears very new clean and well kept hilton gets free breakfast in olys restaurant on the ground floor which has very good selection of irish breakfast and omelet bar waffle machine it has guest laundry facility within the property eur for washing and drying complimentary laundry detergent there so you do have to wander around the city and sit for hours for laundry i will recommend this hotel to friends or family who will visit dublin in the near future high recommended,1
1896,the hotel is not a long drive to the cruise port and is within walking distance to the city a bus stop is tight outside the front door so it is in an excellent position the main dining room is huge so you are always guaranteed a seat a smaller area of the main dining room is set aside in the evening for light dining and the food was magnificent not a quaint hotel stay but it has wonderful staff and great service,1
1897,great location great staff really helpfull just a shame price went up due to concert apart from that as always great staybreakfast was good lots to chose from and rooms are very comfortable this was my stay here over the years and i will return,1
1898,i booked a room here recently for my parents to visit dublin when booking i realised it was expensive but worth every penny the hotel itself is clean bright in a great location and with a nice view of the river i went to the hotel myself a couple of hours before my parents checked to ask if i could have them leave a bottle of prosecco in their room for them the staff did this no problem and after just chatting to them and telling them the room was for my mama birthday they upgraded their room to a room with a view of the river at no extra cost they also had the prosecco on ice with glasses in their room for when my parents arrived any staff member that i or my parents spoke to that weekend was incredibly friendly chatty and polite really super,1
1899,i arrived and immediately felt welcome by a friendly and customer focus lady in reception soledad is her name highly recommended hotel personal service exceded my expectations soledad made my time at hilton excetional and felt every time special,1
1900,we booked this hotel although the price was hiked up as were playing that night but we normally receive a good experience as a regular hilton user i was disappointed to find the price to be hiked so highly having paid around a night in orlando manchester and leeds recently but this hilton charged per night we contacted the hotel before confirming the booking and explained we had to be somewhere by could we check in earlier than the stated on line or we would have to book else where and we was told that they would do their best and it should not of be a problem on arrival one member of staff could not of been more difficult the first lady was trying her best and was going to speak to house services but then a lady interrupted and took over and pointy blank said check in is at and nothing more could be done it was only after complaining hard that they agreed to try and took our telephone number saying they would ring us when the room was ready and that they arranged a cleaner to go straight to our assigned room and repair it after two hours we had received no phone call so rang the hotel and again the second lady who took our call was rude and and snapped that check in was not until i reminded her that she had stated she had sent a cleaner to the room to prepaid it,0
1901,the hotel was a little difficult to get to because of construction but once there we were glad to see our room was ready early it was clean and modern the hotel is being renovated so there was some noise in the early afternoon the staff was helpful with directions and suggestions for dining we had late night dessert and breakfast in he restaurant and both were delicious,1
1902,located close to all dublin offers and staff make for a great stay enjoyed walking into temple bar for the entertainment and to cbd for history and shopping walk across river to docks area filled with history and cafe scene exciting,1
1903,this was an easy hotel to get to from the airport although there is some construction going on it did not impact on our stay there is a parking building behind the hotel which is great if you have a rental car we had to book two rooms as they did not have rooms according to their website that would fit families of so i was a bit surprised to find that one of our rooms would have accommodated the whole family with a fold away bed their rooms however were clean and modern with air conditioning the breakfast was good as well friendly helpful staff and a guest laundry with a reasonable price per load was fantastic,1
1904,an excellent located hotel within easy walking distance of many attractions and near the hop on hop off stops and also the airport bus stop is just around the friendly staff comfy beds clean rooms nice restaurant and bar,1
1905,the academy plaza hotel is a perfect location that is in walking distance to a lot of places to see in dublin the rooms are all ok and clean the only thing to comment is the shower not so mych pressure in that one but all in all recommended,1
1906,beautiful hotel in the centre of dublin very easy to go everywhere in the centre very clean personal very kind all accessible for people in wheelchair you can do a big continental and english breakfast,1
1907,we stayed here for room was spacious we were in room facing the street once we closed windows we could here any street sound great just the view breakfast was top staff were very helpfula minute walk to trinity collegeplenty of hop on hop off buses minutes from front door of hotel but we enjoyed the walk,1
1908,easy minute bus ride from dublin airport centrally located in city my husband i walked everywhere clean comfortable room bathroom by american standards but typical for a european city we did try the breakfast as we were in out each day of our stay,1
1909,typical european hotel very modern smaller but provided for our needs the bed was excellent probably the best bed we slept in very helpful staff who provided directions to the better places in dublin the breakfast buffet was well stocked and the food was excellent,1
1910,we were here for two nights and were very happy with the hotel room was small as was the washroom but both were extremely clean well prepared beautiful and provided everything we staff was especially lovely and accommodating from those working front desk to the staff in the bar and location was central and very full irish breakfast was fantastic and the staff worked continuously to ensure we were well looked quite convenient the dinner in the restaurant did quite measure up as well as the breakfast did we felt that nothing we ate was made from scratch however if it was then it was a very good choice of accommodations,1
1911,the meeting rooms we used two over days and both were terrible the rooms were dark as no windows as in basement with marks and damage on the walls and ceiling i would book these again the hotel seemed fine however we did not stay,0
1912,my family booked the room for four the room was great a queen bed and two small singles the hotel has which was great on our visit because it was hot location is great easy walk to many sites the airlink bus drops up just in front of the hotel we had the breakfast the second day for euros and it was good,1
1913,stayed here week beginning july very easy to find as the airlink bus stops right outside on cathal brugha st very welcoming reception staff and was processed very quickly lobby very smart and looks very nice which leads into the the only downside is when you exit the lifts they are decorating this area but signs do warn you of this people also for some reason left empty glasses and bottles in the lift area on the floor which i found very odd we had room which over looked the back of the hotel very quiet room even on the main road air conditioning nice and cold and could hear from other rooms either which was nice bathrooms very nice and clean with soap and shower dispensers and a hairdryer coffee facilities in the desk drawer only thing to be picky about was the quality of the picture on the tv was great but we did use it that much anyway overall a great hotel and would highly recommend,1
1914,this was our third stay at the academy plaza and it will always be our preferred stay in dublin as ever the staff were really pleasant and helpful our double room was just fine bed adequate sized room good amenities iron and ironing board plenty of drawer space hair drier etc good sized clean bathroom tv the breakfast facilities are to be highly just off street is ideal just a short walk from the city gave this hotel a good review after our first stay years ago and i still rate this hotel will certainly be back next time we in dublin,1
1915,my daughter and i stayed two days at the beginning of our trip and two days at the end and we had great service both times the lobby is so comfortable and a great place to people watch the bar is inviting and comfortable as well the front desk staff were efficient friendly and courteous the hotel was in a great location and very clean and enjoyable,1
1916,cool stay in dublin inmidst the heart of the city you can have a hop on and off tripp by busses near the stay many city busline are close you are able to visit the city even by foot different restaurants are around,1
1917,stayed for one night at the start of our ireland holiday friendly staff clean and well maintained rooms excellent breakfast and the location is central to shops and restaurants good value and we would recommend wifi is free but poor signal in room,1
1918,though the lobby is indeed large and relatively luxurious we were given a remarkably small room nights with a very small window and an airconditioning making noise outside in a tiny courtyard not suitable for two people and we thought really too expensive the hotel is well located but please check the size of your room before you book,0
1919,february stay for nights when we got to the hotel they charged us more for the room than what we had booked more which seemed quite a lot spoke to the manager and he blamed and said there was nothing they could do about it he said it happens all the time if this is happening all the time they really should have sorted this by now or at least expect customers to be annoyed when they charge you a lot more for your room when you booked a budget hotel could have paid the same money and stayed in temple bar hotel was or so minute walk from temple bar so good location rooms quite despite other reviews our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as i told them the rooms were nice their room was horrible only just enough room for a small double bed disgusting again when they complained they were told tough there no more rooms i rant up from the uk and spoke to reception about booking another room for the dates they were staying and was told there was lots available etc and what would i like to book told them the situation and the tone of the conversation immediately changed back to the hotel being really busy and no rooms available after they had just told me the hotel was dead would not stay here again as there are far better hotel in the,0
1921,i have stayed at this hotel twice in the past months early june and late july why did i return because i had a good experience in june because of the hotel location and because of its value for having said that the experience in late july was not as good why is that because the hotel is a victim of it neighborhood there is a sports bar right next door when folks leave there invariably drunk they are extraordinarily noisy they are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood then there the homeless in a churchyard across the street they have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter the police come remove them and they back within an hour then the trucks come to make deliveries around am with back up beepers and running engines the tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning the staff work extremely hard and they are terrific frankly they do deserve this constant barrage on their efforts my room was an adequate size it was spotless the bathroom and shower were very good daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere so should you stay here yes just get a room in the back of the hotel,1
1922,from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff and management could not have done any more for us they are very professional kind and understanding no matter what you ask of them the answer is always no problemthe king room was perfect and very bright and a view of o connell st the location was very good especially for anybody with a disability of any kind the hotel is central to all transport shops and concert venues with many theaters near by james is peter collins deputy he took us under his wing and our every need was seen to the food was excellent and the staff at the bar restaurant were also excellent in particular beata we award her employee of the month as she was so patient with us at mealtimes and went beyond the call of duty to see that we enjoyed our stay a big thank you to you all,1
1923,fabulous hotel very central when you come out take a right and your on o connell street i alway stay here when i go to dublin lovely food in the bar and the breakfast is lovely highly recommend it,1
1924,the hotel is located right off of the main street and the green hop on hop off bus is a two minute walk away even closer is the airport shuttle which is practically right outside the door of the rooms were fine although i have to say the tv placement in our room was very odd faced a wall and viewing from the bed was at a sharp angle all it would have taken was a bracket mounted on the wall to make the television accessible i mentioned it and i was probably not the only one to do so based on the reply about wiring i got not all rooms have this odd tv placement however and we did get a little bit more room than ones that were like a corridor our view was the shaft but we did not pick the hotel for the view but of course that would have been nicer with only one exception the staff were all polite and welcoming and responsive to any questions about the city we would stay there again,1
1925,what a beautiful city hotel and people dublin is just the best city in the world we have visited to date from the moment we got of the plane the friendly irishman at the bus depot could not have been more helpful from then on everything followed suit our bus driver showed us the way to this perfectly located hotel the hotel staff got us checked in immediately and nothing was too much for anyone amazing food great drink friendly happy people all mingling in this busy bustling city the hotel itself we were amazed at the star rating as it is absolutely lovely does great food and could not be situated in a better location for the whole city extremely child friendly free food free milk and they just adore the children book this place it wo disappoint you,1
1926,stayed at the academy plaza hotel for nights while in dublin it is a few feet away from street which is the main street it is only short blocks away from the spire the tall pole in the middle of the city the hotel looks like it was newly renovated so the rooms look clean and new the beds were comfortable and modern bathroom with plenty of hot water we enjoyed the complimentary in room tea every morning and the wifi it also comes with an indoor safe the street construction was pretty noisy even though we were on the floor however once you close the window it was pretty quiet however you do hear the occational hallway noises the cold and hot breakfast was good it only cost us per adult for breakfast while my year old son ate for free we saw a couple of airline pilots eating breakfast and assumed they stayed there as well the check in and check out was quick and painless it is conveniently located to the taxi stand the bus stop the hop on hop off bus stop it is also walking distance to restaurants and pubs convenience store bank and shopping trinity college was maybe minutes walk overall i would recommend this hotel and would probably book again,1
1928,when i travel i look for a place to sleep that is clean and well located the academy plaza is within the center of the city of dublin well within walking distance of anywhere one could want to walk all the points of interest are well within walking distance with no effort required,1
1929,cab from airport to hotel was euro and about min ride return cab was euro with a cab stand right in front of the hotel hotel is convenient clean and staff was nice breakfast was a nice variety and good quality rooms are small but adequate the price of our stay was fair as dublin hotels in the central city go for a bit more,1
1930,the hotel is very convenient for getting to and from the airport with airlink express stops from airport and to airport on cathal brugha street just opposite the hotel the staff at the reception were very helpful and and were quick we made use of the left luggage facility as our flights were arriving early and leaving late our standard room is small but adequate and clean it was quiet being on the floor the singles pushed together double bed was comfortable the bathroom has shower only but it is ok the breakfast was good with full irish cooked breakfast and the usual choices of juices fruits cereals yogurts cheeses and tea and coffee but there is only type of milk on offer being just off o connell street it is also convenient for shops tour buses pubs and restaurants most of the tourist sights are within walking distances but the dodublin transport pass which included the airlink express and the buses was very good value we would stay here again if we return again,1
1931,although academy plaza is sometimes described as frills hotel my husband and i have been staying here every time we visit dublin for the past or years it is located very close to o connell street and therefore so convenient to all the stores on henry street and for sightseeing etc the buses are just around the corner from hotel the hotel itself is lovely reasonably priced very clean with friendly helpful staff the breakfast has everything you could possibly want to eat really delicious bedrooms very clean and comfortable highly recommend this hotel,1
1932,for a very competitively priced hotel right off street i can see why someone would be skeptical about the accommodations seeing is actually believing though as someone who stayed in even the base accommodations with my wife yes they were a little smaller than we were used to but we were very comfortable things were clean we had our room attended to properly the bed was the most comfortable and luxurious mattress we ever slept on but it was offensive and more than adequate aside from this and the slightly smaller room size it the only reason why i would rate the comfort level slightly less than stars otherwise if you have any reservations leave them at the door you will be out and about in dublin and will come back to a room that will serve your needs more than adequately in bustling dublin city,1
1933,i would stay here again in a hearbeat the rooms are small but comfortable clean and functional the location is fantastic but above all the staff are friendly helpful and professional food in the restaurant was delicious and fresh as well,1
1934,super easy to get to from the airport bus or stops right outside the hotel fantastic lobby area bar and restaurant snacks and essentials available to buy in reception complimentary cakes every day staff were very friendly and helpful city map available rooms were spacious the single beds huge and very comfortable not much noise at all and we slept well great wifi and tv bathroom was spacious and had complimentary toiletries and plenty of towels my only complaint was the shower wasn t very powerful so it took a long time to rinse my long hair there was a safe iron tea and coffee making facilities lots of wardrobe space and a full length mirror we also had river views which were lovely a high standard of cleanliness it s a good walk to the temple bar area but it s a pretty walk along the river we walked everywhere from the hotel the guinness storehouse being a walk most places of interest were roughly walk away we didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that aspect the hotel has excellent public transport links and the hop on and off bus stops right outside the loved this hotel and would stay here again i d recommend for adults rather than children,1
1935,we chose to stay at the hilton garden inn for one night because we were taking the irish ferry in the morning and this hotel was rather close to the port we booked two rooms one a family suite and the other was two double beds both rooms were clean and well appointed the family suite was spacious and comfortable for four people this hotel does not have air conditioning at this time for our visit that was a problem but if it was any warmer that could been uncomfortable they are installing ac the hotel is doing construction and while loud in the afternoon it was quiet by evening overall this hotel met our needs for our visit,1
1936,hotel very clean and comfortable we had a river view room and there was not much noise from the road breakfast was very good with a good choice hotel location was only a short walk away from the city centre so a great location the only annoying thing about the hotel is the music that they play in reception it did get really annoying after sitting there for a while staff were very friendly and helpful,1
1937,this hotel was very good from start to finish my only comment would be that it is not the most convenient location unless you are on business still it is in walking distance lengthy from everywhere nice staff clean rooms good experience,1
1938,right on the river in a bit quieter part of town there is a airlink bus stop right at hotel so makes getting in from airport a breeze also very convenient to train station if you are arriving or departing via train as we did ok the are doing some remodeling and upgrading to the hotel that i believe will be finished in dec of so just be aware if you are traveling between now and then that there might be a bit of construction but they were respectful of guests and did not begin work at first light there is a great bar with a great bar menu they even fixed us a pizza that was not listed for my picky eaters good coffee and breakfast bar and full restaurant situated right on the river and a quick walk to most activities trinity college temple bar folks dublin is a major city there is noise around at night cars but was the same you would find any big city here is why this hotel ranks high in our opinion the staff and management top notch friendly helpful stored our bags for us twice gave great advice and directions answered questions and tried to help the confused americans figure out the power converters i actually blew a fuse on the floor once they were right up to fix it when the construction ends this year this will be a top notch dublin hotel would stay there again in an second,1
1939,perfect location just a few meters away from the shopping streets temple bar and city sights the rooms are nice and clean only negative thing was that the room was quite small i love the fact that there was bathtubs in the bathroom nice after many hours of shopping the breakfast was good and the staff was polite i will definetly go back next time i visit ireland,1
1940,had never been to dublin before was delighted with hotel great for st transport pubs museums shops etc bus transfer from airport stopped right at hotel hop on off bus tour just round the corner lovely hotel nice room nice service nice staff only thing wrong was the poor view from our room but everything else was excellent will be back for sure,1
1941,i do no like the side of the river the hotel is on most of the time i spent in dublin was on the other side so i did not like the location the check in and check out process was mechanical as if a robot was doing it this is the only hotel of i stayed in on this trip where i was not asked how my stay was i think the young man who checked me in only spoke to tell me my room number the room was so small that either my husband or i had to sit on the bed while the other was up moving or we would bump into each other ironically the bathroom was very large the room was clean although the carpet looked filthy to me and quiet,0
1942,the view from the room i was in was that great but it not like you spend a lot of time there anyway the room was clean in good condition beds comfortable and the sheets were super nice especially for a hotel an in room safe was awesome ammenity to have especially since i was travelling from out of the country the hotel was just a short walk from temple bar and along a lot of the site seeing companies and busses took the airlink from the airport and the stop is right outside the hotel,1
1943,i really screwed up my reservation and after my initial frustration alex really got on the phone and get me squared away at another hotel that despite the the city filled upthanks alex i see you next week when i fly out of dublin,1
1944,we stayed at kilronan house for a total of days split up in the middle by two days in northern ireland this quaint and charming hotel was a delight i was traveling with my son and daughter and we were in a comfortable room with twin beds the staff are the friendliest people that you will ever encounter our arrival flight put us into dublin very early and we were able to securely drop off our bags at am with no problem the other highlight was the outstanding breakfast options there were selections available to accommodate every need and it was consistently delicious the price was a great value and very fair the location was great and within easy walking distance to everything i recommend kilronan house to anyone wanting a classic friendly value hotel,1
1945,the decor was somewhat tired and could do with here and there however this was more than compensated by the friendly and helpful staff the comfortable bed and the sumptuous breakfast which was really outanding with masses of choice convenient walking distant from the city centre and competitively priced roomsi stayed in a single room and the toilet was two floors below which was a minus i would check if the other rooms are en suite my room did have a view and overlooked a car park however it was was an office car park and quiet from to if you are fit or in some way infirmed i would suggest that you choose a room on one of the lower floors as kilronan does have a lift and there are a lot of stairs to the upper its drawbacks i would certainly recommend this hotel,1
1946,excellent location lovely bed and breakfast it was the perfect place for a short pitstop in dublin breakfast was delicious and everything was cute clean and cozy i would highly recommend they made an extra effort to help us with printing our plane tickets which was much appreciated,1
1947,rooms are good but in the one we had the bed took up far too much space so if you stopping on a long trip and have several pieces of luggage it is not that easy to move around bathroom is large by the breakfast is excellent and well served and the food is abundant and good quality staff are very kind and helpful excellent location to city center and especially good if like us you were there to attend an event at the aviva since it is within walking distance we also chose this for the parking which is available however you have to leave the keys with the reception as the cars are left in a driveway and you have to block other guests this was well managed and we had no problems but one can get a bit anxious given that we had a rental car this is central dublin afterall so you can not expect wide parking areas for free,1
1948,i a light sleeper so this was a perfect location for me to stay in dublin for a couple of nights located away from busy roads pubs and restaurants this was an ideal and quiet location for a light sleeper the decor is a bit dated but the staff and breakfast were fantastic,1
1949,where do i begin this is the most glorious location we were lucky to be there for a wedding party and stay the night in the most magical grand room i think we have ever seen which happens to be their print room wow the staff are the most helpful that we have encountered at any hotel stay the house itself is so well kept and the interior design is just glorious the atmosphere is exclusive yet personal and as a guest you are made to feel as though you are the owner of the house a true gem in the countryside of ireland we had special food requirements being vegans which the kitchen catered to perfectly and with pleasure i recommend this wholeheartedly and hope to be back soon,1
1950,on a girl s trip to ireland we stayed three nights in kilronan house upon arrival we were invited to sit down with a cup of tea or coffee and cookies vio answered any questions we might have and then showed us to our rooms both rooms were just one flight up with skylights the beds and linens were comfortable and the bathrooms and showers fine the wifi also worked well breakfast was served in a charming dining room each morning we had juice fresh coffee or tea delicious yogurt and fruit and a choice of pancakes omelets or eggs as you liked them we found kilronan house to be in a good location you just have to walk out the front door and make two lefts and you are near stevens green and only a short walk to trinity college book of kells graffton street and museums etc although kilronan house has free parking we found it easier not to have a car in the city it was an easy walk to many fine restaurants and pubs i would recommend kilronan house to friends and family i hope to bring my husband here in the near future,1
1951,we stayed any the temple bar inn and were happy we did it a great location walking distance to so many restaurants and pubs the breakfast was served until am and there was also free newspapers coffee and tea always available in the lobby,1
1952,the hotel location is absolutely perfect only a stone throw from local pubs restaurants and the larger tourist spots being that the hotel is on the main street there is a bit of noise but with the windows closed we did hear anyone else they also provide ear plugs in each room if you a light sleeper the hotel staff was very helpful getting us a cab at an unpopular hour to catch our flight and they gave us great recommendations and suggestions during our short stay the facilities and rooms were immaculate and provided ample room for our belongings i absolutely stay here again,1
1953,had a great stay at temple bar inn dublin writing this review to complement the supervisor of the reception desk simona who really helped me make a change to my car rental made the car rental online out of manchester england hertz and wanted to change the date of pick up extremely difficult to do simona got on the phone with hertz for at least hour and got things adjusted i could not have done that otherwise the full irish breakfast was great as were the staff in the restaurant my only surprise as an american this hotel and others in ireland are not air conditioned it right in the middle of dublin great location,1
1954,the location was key we only stayed one night and wish it could have been longer it was a bit loud at night however we were so tired from flying in from canada we both slept through the noise they do provide ear plugs which i never seen before in a hotel downtown the breakfast was delicious the staff were great security guard named martin was great to talk to would stay again for sure,1
1955,this hotel is in a fantastic location right on fleet street in the busy temple bar area and near all of the main tourist locations however when you enter into the lobby it feels serene and calm away from the hustle and bustle the free coffee tea and newspapers in reception meant that we spent a bit of time chilling out in the cosy lobby something we never do the room was basic but clean with a comfy bed and large tv the reason this review missed out on stars is that our room was so hot even with the fan on which is provided and the windows open it was still stuffy and both myself and my partner woke up sweating it was not a particularly hot evening either we noticed that the mini bar gives off an awful lot of heat which i think is the main cause as to why the rooms are stuffy massive shame especially as the hotel is based in a busy area so having to open the windows let in a lot of street noise back to the positives the breakfast was amazing so much choice and very tasty the reception staff were all very in all we will definitely come back to this hotel if we are in dublin again as it does make a wonderful base for adventures around dublin just a shame about the temperature of the bedrooms,1
1956,i ended up booking at the temple bar inn last minute and i was very pleasantly surprised the hotel is like a little hidden gem with sleek and modern decor i stayed in a room for one since i was traveling solo the room bathroom were very clean updated cozy comfy the bathroom was very spacious especially the shower my room did not face to the street so it was quiet at night its right in temple bar so the location is amazing very central to everything the only complaint i would have was that it was a little warm in my room for my taste but other than that i really enjoyed my stay and i would definitely book this hotel again,1
1957,was charged debit card and reversed with a loss of to me had told receptionist that i wanted to lay cash which i did for more than hotels in this trip she asked for deposit plus my credit card now management is denying responsibility and defended itself by saying i should have read the fine print in my bill sucks,0
1958,what a bad hotel i don t know where to begin the rooms are smaller than small there is no room to put your clothes lights are not working it is loud so if you would like to sleep just for an hour no way the windows do not block the noise at all there is no air in the rooms after hours with people in the room you will snap for air at night when we wanted to go to sleep we had to find out that both beds in our room had big stains on the matrass cover it looked like blood on it was disgusting like all of the hotel the manager naomi is very rude and plays the hard business woman not very nice when you pay over for one night for a room which would be ok for very very bad experience never ever again not even if they would pay my to stay there the only good thing about the hotel they gave us a discount of for the one night for the bloody sheets we left after one night and found us a very nice place for the same price horrible hotel in a wonderful city,0
1960,my parents stayed there this may and it was wonderful the breakfast was excellent with fresh fruits smoothies and a variety of bread and cereals it is located near the trinity college and in the middle of temple bar district all in all a perfect stay for a city trip special thanks to orla meagher who helped with the booking and did a brilliant job,1
1961,one star for the location thats it small very hot room with windows that open only a crack stifling air quality actually you can smell some kind of fume when you walk in the room fans going and i can barely breath very stuffy i had to remove the synthetic comforter and sleep only with the cover was so frigging hot tossed and turn all night barely slept whats worse there is some sort of bottle recycling plant crunching bottles so you have to close the windows to get some sleep not much air coming thru the crack anyway absurd the fridge is even warm it smells like something died in there not could do so much better then this place for less money i stayed at a hotel on abbey street right across the hapenny bridge twice the size and half the price with windows that opened reception has air conditioning its almost a cruel sick checking into an airbnb tomorrow ca wait to gtfoh,0
1962,terrific location if you have no intention of sleeping tiny rooms no no flexibility if the room does accommodate the group we accidentally booked a double when we came to find that we had to have a triple if we wanted our eleven year old to join us staff is indifferent if you use our fee was doubled,0
1964,a fairly decent hotel in good as we got a room towards the back it was impossible to relax and sleep in as there was an outdoor casino at the back with extremely loud slot machines bingo caller of who you could hear every word and loud hits on though we closed windows it was like it all played in our poor ventilation made it stuffy as the windows had to be closed because of the noice,0
1965,the location is great for exploring dublin the bus stops are close and it possible to walk to many tourist attractions from this hotel the staff are a huge plus they friendly and helpful often going out of their way to provide directions or answer questions the hotel truly is a little gem in the heart of dublin the optional breakfast however while convenient was not a good value for the price,1
1966,i was recently on a motorcycle touring trip to ireland and i tended to spend a night in dublin but was worried about secure parking after doing some digging i saw that cassidys had a secure car park at the back in which you could so opted for there the parking was about per night which i would have happily paid but on arrival the receptionist said i could use a tucked away area without charge which was even better the car is protected with an electrically operated gate controlled by the hotel it was only a short walk into all the main areas i did venture as far as temple bar as i been there before so had a few beers in the immediate area after one very dodgy pub i found some nice ones including the confession box which was fantastic and very welcoming it should be noted that drinks are massively cheaper in the area the hotel is in rather than a temple ate at a korean restaurant approx from the hotel and it was first class the following day i had the full breakfast in the hotel which was excellent and amongst the many things on offer was iced water with mint which my body needed after a night in dublin great place great location,1
1967,had a brilliant overnight stay in this hotel in june friendly staff and was pleasantly surprised and the size of the rooms great breakfast in the morning too would definitely recommend it and would stay again,1
1969,it was not our first stay at cassidys it was our but the first with our two children and years old the family room was big enough that all of us have space to relax everything was clean and we had enough towels and toilet paper for all of us the staff was always friendly and helpful everything is so near you do need a car thanks a lot and we see us again,1
1970,what a great hotel the room was incredibly clean with a very nice and modern bathroom the service at the bar was great darren was a great laugh and made sure we were well taken care of all night we were thrilled to see him in the dining room the next morning taking care of breakfast the location is spot on close to everything and anything you would want to see in the city,1
1972,we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel while on a trip to dublin for a fewvisits to see hospital consultantswe stressed the need for a good nights sleep in a quiet room having had not good experiences in other city centre hotelsthis hotel could not be more central but our room was perfect quiet clean and well laid out for my husband who has mild mobility issuesthe staff were naturally friendly without being intrusivethe bar was an oasis of calm at night without loud muzaki will certainly use this hotel again,1
1973,stayed at the hotel in the parnell wing july and must say that i really liked it here it was a walk to the parnell wing but worth the walk as it is quite new and wonderfully quiet for sleeping the rooms are clean and well appointed the check in was quick and easy with a lovely friendly staff i would encourage anyone to stay here as the hop on hop off bus stops practically at the door and it is within walking distance of all sights yet slightly away from the rowdy pubs of downtown the hotel bar and lounge are very nice as well,1
1975,easy check in and very friendly helpful staff location was perfect off street near temple bar area close to hop off bus tour the first night we had a room with no air condition very hot but they moved us the next day ask for a room with air if traveling during summer months both rooms were very clean the king size bed was more like a double bed so if you like room when you sleep i get two beds liz was very helpful at the front desk the hotel bistro served great scones,1
1976,excellent location walk from temple we very friendly and clean and very you could ask for for a short definitely be staying at this hotel again,1
1978,cassidys is right in the heart of dublin fantastic position for exploring dublin hotel was clean and nice the bar was great and we had a good meal there staff really lovely and helpful fantastic breakfast offered,1
1979,not our first stay at cassidys and wo be our clean room on the ground floor no view other than a motor bike stand but then again i did pop to dublin to stare outta a hotel window great breakfast with plenty of choice of well cooked food and i especially like that the eggs fried or poached are cooked fresh to convenient for sightseeing taxis and shopping in real shops i do count grafton street with shops with jaw dropping prices i prefer the likes of henry street just down the road with all the high street names and real world turned the back bar into a sort of bistro looks nice but i did have time to try it a decent pint of guinness what more can you ask,1
1980,a nice older style hotel situated in upper street close to tour pickup locations and restaurants rooms whilst a little small are comfortable and is complimented by excellent staff who go the extra mile to ensure their guests have an enjoyable stay,1
1981,perfect position in the city centre very reasonable rates and on site parking very comfortable room and a comfortable hotel overall had good bar facilities and very nice restaurant free everywhere and the best bit tea and coffee making facilities in all rooms will definitely be back,1
1982,the rooms are clean and well appointed the check in was quick and easy with a lovely friendly staff i would encourage anyone to stay here as the hop on hop off bus stops practically at the door and it is within walking distance of all sights yet slightly away from the rowdy pubs of downtown the hotel bar and lounge are very nice as well great place great location,1
1983,am only recently getting into the swing of trip advisor but felt i had to do a review most recent stay july have stayed here regularly over the last years or so over those years i also stayed in many other hotels in dublin depending on the event location or if cassidys was full just to sample what out there but all round cassidys outshines and outperforms them is unbeatable very central to all services and amenities yet undisturbed by any noise from busy street very convenient to most bus services taxi rank luas tram stops there is the newer executive wing but rooms in the rest of the hotel have continuously been completely refreshed and modernised i have never found fault re cleanliness and the hotel could operate as a training ground for other hotels as regards how to train staff in excellent customer service they really go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay as enjoyable as possible reasonably priced breakfast is very generous and ranged from the hearty full irish to a wide selection of healthy continental options have had evening meals here on a number of occasions and found the menu to be good value and contain a varied choice with something to suit everyone,1
1984,hotel is located just above st excellent location for walking to attractions the hop on hop off bus was located just a couple blocks away ate in the hotel restaurant for two nights very satisfied,1
1985,comfy clean and fantastic staff the beds were very comfortable staff outstanding room a bit too warm but overall terrific place the pillows in the bed cleanliness delicious breakfast and polite and supportive staff made our weekend in ireland very memorable big thanks to stefania,1
1986,we are traveling with a and year old very safe location deceiving upon entrance then you go downstairs and it opens to a beautiful hotel no ac but ireland is cool most of the time our windows opened fully in our family suite which we loved the double bathroom and layout it on fleet it will be loud but we enjoyed the live music and felt like we were at the concert the room has earplugs if you need them staff is helpful and polite we left our ipad and passports in safe they called us and we will pick up when we return to dublin they are keeping it in hotel safe until our return,1
1987,we stayed here for a couple of nights whilst visiting the city staff very helpful the concierge was always polite and friendly reception staff equally helpful and rooms were clean tidy and had all the necessary requirements for a comfy stay the fan provided a welcome cool room the windows opened as well providing fresh air whilst there was some noise from outside it was not excessive or disturbing at breakfast was fabulous great choice and no rush,1
1988,excellent location the hotel is situated on temple bar very helpful pleasant staff a bottle of fizz and box of chocolates were left in the room for my birthday great place to stay if you want to be in the heart of temple bay,1
1989,excellent visions of beauty great for the young and the old suits all needs entertainment and food plus plenty of history spots too also getting about is made simply with local travel service and taxi s,1
1990,we have been at this hotel for the third time now this is a clean hotel with friendly staff in walking distance to the centre sights and bus stops are also just a few minutes away to us it is the perfect accomodation for a city trip to dublin,1
1991,stayed in dublin one night had reserved parking which is very safe secure on entering hotel was surprised how large it was although it has kerb appeal from outside its very deceptive as to how large this hotel is staff were very friendly and our room was just superb top floor with surround balcony view not great but it suited us smokers room was very clean spacious,1
1992,i just returned from a day mini break august from dublin i stopped at cassidy star on street the hotel was spotless and the staff could do enough for me the breakfast self service was awesome and you could have as much as u liked the double room was very clean and was attended to every day there is a free gym on offer the main area temple bar is only about minutes walk this is the time i have stopped here and would definitely stop here again next time i come to dublin,1
1993,the hotel is very well located withing walking distance to the city centre we had asked for a quiet room and ours was indeed very had reserved a twin room and we benefited from a spacious family room with double bed and two single staff are very friendly and helpful,1
1994,we stayed at our usual hotel four of us and had a lovely room for the four of us as well irish breakfast was really yummy as usual we also did the hop on and off bus where ch was only euro for the day mus add guinness factory and prison should be booked n advance there was at least four football and rugby matches going on as well recommend dublin for a break booze is xpensive food prices reasonable pity weather was iffy but not cold,1
1995,spent one night at the maldron hotel with my wife having previously stayed there on a lads rugby is very good the rooms are nice and come with trouser press making facilities i used the hotel car park that was cheap compared with other parking available nearby although very limited and tight reception was prompt and helpful the lifts require a room key when going up from reception this is added security overall a very pleasant stay that is in a good location to access central dublin,1
1996,the hotel is used by tour groups and we arrived a day early for our trafalgar tour we had a small room but it was clean and good enough for nights the breakfast was the best we saw in days in ireland the selection was wonderful if you could not find something to eat you have a problem the location is not near much do bother with the pizza place across the street it a min min walk to street and a grocery store or anything else to do it is right around the corner from the garden of remembrance it does have which is nice when dublin is would stay closer to downtown next time,1
1997,the hotel is well located to access the main city areas on foot and is a minute walk from croke park if you are visiting to attend a concert the staff are friendly and welcoming rooms are of a good size are well furnished and equipped the price for a one night stay was very expensive but that was due to the popularity of the band playing in croke park we would definitely consider using this hotel again,1
1998,room was of a decent size and clean outlook was very good but then we did go there to stay in room looking out of window the staff on reception were brilliant very good at their jobs felt that safe hire deposit was a bit steep at euros we did take credit cards so was out of our spending money i think would of been a better price to ask the was returnable so safe hire cost nothing but it meant euros was tied up until last day cant comment on food as we did eat in lack in communication reguarding the amount of milk we were left there was of us first day little pots left we like each there is very little milk in pot reception were happy to give us more day we left a note please leave us more milk we were left pots not even enough cup of tea of us so we had to get more day note ignored again we said please leave us pots again pots were left was frustrating would of been better left too much surely they must realize those pots of milk hardly contain any other than that moan which was annoying hotel was good,1
2000,just spent nights here and staff very friendly and very helpful check in smooth quick and bags held securely until room was ready and also for the full day on departure clean room and bathroom and clean towels both days perfect location for exploring all dublin after reading some reviews was worried the location was not in a great area but to be honest found all parts of dublin city very run down and hotel location no worse than main tourist a lot of investment in parts of the city road improvements and building work but sad for the city along both sides of the liffey as every other property run down shabby and lots of buildings closed and warmth friendliness and craic of dubliners makes up for everything fabulous people the green hop on and hop of bus tour is absolutely brilliant and true dubliners driving and telling the history and and present about the city well worth doing the city for shopping and amazing recommend a meal at across from the brazen head oldest pub in the city,1
2003,visited here for one night yesterday for my wife birthday the hotel is a ten minute walk from street so a bit of a trek after a night out especially with heels on says the wife upon check in we were met by antonio who was very polite and friendly the room was great very spacious room which is or was a room for disabled persons my wife mentioned to antonio upon check in that it was her birthday and when we returned to the hotel later in the afternoon there was a happy birthday note along with wine and chocolates which was a lovely touch very comfy bed and very clean one slight issue was the cleaners were very noisy from quite early and we wanted a lie in hardly mattered though fabulous hotel and we would definitely recommend and would visit again,1
2004,this hotel is within walking distance of st stephen green and also to offices in the ranelagh area the service is impeccable and the staff is fantastic a special shoutout to fabrizio for taking care of our family while we were waiting for a room the breakfast buffet is to die for,1
2005,i checked into an okay room on the fifth floor but the carpet was worn and the furniture in need of replacement i called the front desk and the young woman who answered the phone was at my door in a few minutes to a new room it was on the third renovated the room was the same size but what a difference when its clean and has a robe in the closet this faced the canal and she was worried the train noise from the nearby luas would be an issue it was not the wait staff in the hotel was great too,1
2006,my husband and i enjoyed our stay very much the hotel staff were very friendly the breakfast was excellent the location was a little out of the city centre for our liking this did not cause us a problem as there were taxis outside the hotel resonantly priced to transport us wherever we wished to go,1
2008,overall a great place to stay good location some noise through the closed window but very little internet connection was good room was clean bed was very comfortable bedroom was nice and big good service at the counter,1
2009,i needed two rooms for three days in dublin for a family vacation lucky i had some points to cover most of the cost and found this great place location was good hotel was clean and bright and the staff was outstanding,1
2010,i stayed at the dublin hilton twice on business for a total of three weeks it is a solid choice for business travelers to dublin and is next to the green line luas for easy transport out to the business parks and suburbs south of the has been quick and professional as was i had rooms on both the and floors and there is an important difference between the two even though the floor is ostensibly reserved for hhonors silver members i much preferred the floor room while both rooms were clean plenty big and offered a desk and chair and a comfortable bed my room on the floor while it had been recently remodeled per the front desk had usable power outlets on the headboard wall no place to plug in my phone to charge and use as an alarm or charge my watch the lights on either side of the bed were wired into the headboard behind the bed and whatever outlet they plugged into was had to call the front desk and get an extension cord sent up which i had to run all the way across the room next to the tv stand in order to get the power i needed on the nightstand shelf i stayed in a hotel of any class that did have power available at the head of the bed and i am astonished that a hotel would overlook this critical second issue i had with the floor bedroom was a complete,1
2011,situated on the canal away from the crowds this hotel permits good sleep our room was a good size the bathroom actually had a bath and there was a fridge safe hairdryer and ironing supplies the decor was modern all the staff we encountered were very pleasant and they responded to a problem i had with the safe extremely quickly it is only a minute walk or short taxi ride to the central attractions there is a gym which we did not use or you could along the canal path,1
2012,rooms were the usual great hilton quality and layout most of dublin within walking distance location near the luas was an added bonus pub next door was excellent and it seemed to be a local hot spot,1
2013,nice clean rooms friendly helpful staff good buffet breakfast did see an egg chef though omelletes etc plenty of parking spaces a short taxi ride from the centre or walk comfortable beds good internet connection,1
2014,i am a silver member so the day before online to make sure i get a room away from the tram if you get the wrong room here it is incredibly noisy my room was very quiet and the bed comfortable the lighting in the room is not bad for a business hotel the breakfast is comprehensive and very tasty with good bakery selection staff are pleasant and helpful,1
2015,while staying in dublin for one night i stayed in the hilton very pleasant stay breakfast was a little bit limited in offerings could have been better stayed in a twin room staff was very kind and helped me finding my way around general i had a very pleasant stay would recommend it to others,1
2016,awesome canalside location well laid out building easy walking distance from key attractions great staff nice decor decent views from almost every side also easy to drive to with great self parking good breakfast and nice pub with live music i be back,1
2017,stay here for the concert arrived around midnight and the greeting was very professional all interaction with staff was very pleasant great place to stay about minutes walk to park and shopping area would definitely stay here again,1
2018,bad old value for qulaity wold definitely not go there again the staff was jjhghvvnm op b,0
2019,helpful and hard working front desk staff who were patient with all our questions from fair family good location comfortable rooms great breakfast woke up early one morning and sat overlooking the canal and watched the city come to life,1
2020,we have just returned from a fantastic three night stay in dublin could fault this hotel clean modern and with a great bar and restaurant if you need them room was lovely and staff were all really friendly not right in the centre but only a pleasant minute walk to grafton street or you have a tram stop literally right outside we used to walk in during the day and catch the tram home from grafton street at night for minutes later we were back at the hotel perfect and means it just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre loved dublin as a city do expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful welcoming people eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from transport options from the airport were superb we chose the airlink and it dropped us off about a minute walk away the guinness factory is obviously on most people list but the jameson experience is also well worth a visit even if you do do the tour the bar is superb and has a great atmosphere the zoo is also a brilliant visit and great value at,1
2021,stayed here for three nights and enjoyed our stay with one exception being that the air conditioning in our room did not work parking costs a night which is a little steep when you are paying a lot of money for the anyway but compensation is that you can easily walk into town thus saving parking fees there great breakfast choice with lots of coffee options nice breads and pastries yoghurts and cereal no fresh fruit salad canned does not hit the spot in august but great start to the day bedrooms of a reasonable size dearth of plugs comfortable bed ok bathroom shower curtain great toiletries all the staff were helpful and friendly and made the hotel a very welcoming oasis highly recommended,1
2022,nice clean rooms with modern bathrooms nespresso machine on the floor with nice selection of coffees and cookies was a welcoming touch friendly staff and good location just out of the hustle and bustle of the city center would stay again,1
2023,the location was a bit out of the way of the centre it took us about half an hour to walk in however just outside the hotels is a tram stop which takes you into the centre in about minutes it was close to any restaurants so you would have to go into the room was lovely it was very clean and comfortable we stayed over the new year and we did have any issue with noise,1
2025,close to dublin city centre easily accessible with the luas claremont street stop on the green line stayed overnight after a concert at arena hotel staff very friendly and helpful room clean and well equipped,1
2026,great experience lovely hotel with excellent food rooms are tiny but we spent our time exploring the city anyway had dinner there and loved the entertainment asked for special accommodations and they were provided without fail,1
2027,stayed here for long weekend as we were attending coldplay concert at croke park it was quite expensive i must say for nights the staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival with us being early they stored our cases and told us to come back in a couple of hours and they would get us a room which they did which was good as check in was till the reception and bar area was lovely bright and airy the bar prices were reasonable we did eat at the hotel but menu seemed lovely the room was as special as i thought it would be considering the price and it being a hilton could been doing with a lick of paint and the bathroom with a freshen up the bed was the comfiest either but that due to personal taste quite a walk from the centre of town depending the way you walk tram stop is right outside and frequent to take you into city over all was a nice stay would stay again if got a better rate for the rooms,1
2028,the only thing was to far from city center all the rest was great the people where very nice and friendly the canal in front was great and beautiful i recommend this place any time food was great bar also loved it,1
2030,stayed here with my daughter room had view of grand canal close walking distance to main staff friendly and made us feel special great bar good deals would highly recommend clean and tidy hotel and rooms,1
2032,just home from a two night stay had a deluxe room which was spotless and comfortable excellent shower quality bath products and excellent touches throughout bar has been refurbished and is excellent well priced with a good product range bistro food was excellent also we also had breakfast with great choices on offer and a buffet area that was so clean special thanks to all the staff two italian waiters in the bistro and the bulgarian girl at the breakfast is in a great area mins from city centre yet in a nice affluent area of the city as a frequent visitor to dublin i am happy to recommend,1
2033,nice hotel but very definitely overpriced especially the added cost for breakfast apart from price very clean and very high quality that you would expect to receive from the hilton group anywhere recommended all the same,1
2034,this is a top class hotel minutes from dublin city centre it is beside the tram line which can bring you to st stephens green or to dundrum in the opposite direction the staff here were so helpful we met lisa the duty manager who could not do enough for us she was friendly warm and welcoming as were all the staff here if you are going to dublin city centre this is the hotel for you great value and great food with a modern bar,1
2035,this hotel is in a great location with easy access to trams and minutes walk to stephen green the staff are excellent breakfast is good and the bar area serves great food too the rooms are in the process of being refurbished i believe floors have been completed but you pay a premium to stay in one of these rooms we stayed on floor whilst acceptable the rooms are tired and well worn,1
2036,i had the pleasure to stay at the hilton dublin recently as it is one of the hotels recommended by my company the location of the hotel is definitely very convenient within a walking distance of our offices the staff is very friendly as breakfast is very good with great choices of a different note i was expecting a little bit more of the bedrooms which are bit outdated specially the bathrooms it was a bit of a disappointment,1
2037,beautiful comfortable hotel lovely restaurant and friendly staff in all areas for me however the star of the show is philip d on concierge who is possibly the kindest person i have ever met i hope i have the opportunity to revisit dublin and if i do i will be back thank you philip,1
2040,i stayed in the trinity city hotel recently for a birthday celebration it is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location i particularly liked the inner garden area where we had a fabulous barbecue the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly the room was extremely comfortable i would highly recommend the hotel and will definitely pay it a visit in the future,1
2041,it is great with amenities a restaurant and a bar great location a gym and lots of things are in walking distance to the hotel also taxi service is fast you can also get bonus miles with united too there is no spa in the hotel i would stay there again,1
2042,plush decadent and totally over the top décor loved it great location breakfasts good restaurant food very good and the pub a great place to spend some very spacious we had a room in the annex and the service was good,1
2043,while visiting my friend from ireland we wanted to stay at a hotel close to all amenities this hotel did not disappoint it is a stunning hotel with amazing staff and service it is central to everywhere you can go i would highly recommend this hotel and i hope to return in the future,1
2044,stayed for nights while going to see at crooke park the location is great you can walk to everything the staff were really helpful and friendly breakfast lovely the room really nice beds so comfy really could fault anything was a brilliant few nights stay would not hesitate in staying here again spot on,1
2045,no room service painfully slow check in and check out housekeeping not up to standard convenient location very friendly bell staff sorry to say we will stay somewhere else when next in dublin,0
2046,my husband and i flew back yesterday after a week in ireland the day before we were to fly out our rental car got broken into and our belongings were stolen there was glass all over the inside of the car we were in between cities and our next hotel for our last night there was the trinity city hotel when we arrived the staff heard what happened and we were greeted with the most friendliest faces and genuinely concerned little philip bellman greeted us and proactively brought out a vacuum and helped my husband clean up all of the glass he was so friendly and personable and would even accept a tip from us the man at the front desk apologies i do not remember his name also made sure we were set up appropriately and made sure we were ok beyond those two men who stood out to us the property is beautiful and very clean and unique we will definitely return,1
2047,stayed at trinity city while in town for gig at croke park for only one night wish it had been more a slight mix up regarding payment at checkin that was dealt with swiftly and we were off to our room very nice indeed stylish well decorated with everything you need the most comfortable nights sleep we have ever had in a hotel we have noted the make of pillows and mattress and will be purchasing ourselves we sat out in the courtyard for lunch with the gargoyles and crocodiles in the sun delicious steak sandwich and beef burger the décor throughout the hotel is very quirky and fun animal statues huge mirrors chez lounges a piano beautiful fireplaces etc breakfast is spot on too buffet style but plenty of choice and very tasty poached or fried eggs need to be ordered on checkout we left our bags with phil the concierge a very charming and warming chap full of knowledge and jokes only a walk to grafton street dawson street and temple go to dublin as much as time allows and know for sure this will be our base every time from now on a jewel in the capital of the emerald isle,1
2048,this was a lovely hotel for a two night stay the rooms were spacious with a comfortable bed the tall headboard triples as a closet and a nightstand there was a small cutaway with outlets just above the bed to charge phones and place other items the closet was cut into the sides of the headboard i would note that there was much space to hang things the bathroom was very spacious with a large and lots of counter space the lobby and lounge were nicely decorated the lounge is popular in the evenings and plays pleasant music the staff is very friendly and efficient it also a short walk from all the bus stops,1
2049,the room was clean and comfy if a little close to the kitchen fortunately we live in new york so do mind cooking smells wafting up to our room the staff was friendly and professional best of all the breakfast was out of this world many many choices and coffee to die for yum,1
2050,my husband and i stayed here for the last days of our honeymoon this summer and despite the unfortunate construction going full strength at trinity we had a really wonderful stay when we first got to our room we could hear hammering almost right across the wall so we asked for a different room and the staff was nice enough to find us something a bit quieter on the other side of the hotel you could still hear it during the day but it was too bad they also brought up glasses of prosecco which was a sweet touch the rooms themselves were very nice and comfortable and we loved the bright trendy decor the hotel itself is in a perfect location too just far enough away from all the bars so that you not in the thick of it but within minutes walking distance to temple bar the only down side was that when we bought a bottle of champagne elsewhere my husband went down to the bar to ask for glasses and they would give them to him unless he bought them full of prosecco,1
2053,my friends and i had a great experience at the trinity city hotel really friendly staff and our room was gorgeous it very clean and a real quirky hotel close to everything i would highly recommend,1
2054,my friend came over to visit from canada and we wanted somewhere central to stay in dublin we got that and so much more from the trinity city hotel starting with a warm welcome the moment you step through the door by the concierge to the friendly receptionists to check you in all staff were friendly and helpful rooms were spotless with beds you had to force yourself to leave i been here twice and look forward to another visit in the future,1
2055,spent the evening relaxing in the food was delicious and it was a very easygoing vibe to sit and relax had to wait a bit to get our servers attention easier to just go up to the bar and order recommend the crème brulee,1
2056,we booked here for three nights from calgary alberta canada clean spacious renovated rooms helpful staff and the best location close to temple bar but not so close that it was crazy noisy or busy right across from trinity college star hotel i would give it five,1
2057,decor is fun boutique from lobby to room stayed on floor executive quiet sleep while dublin has construction issues no noise from fire station but room has only sky light do temperature fine even with days we did have fan in room as pictured online bus pickup or just outsde while temple bar short min walk or book of kells did eat there but enjoyed the bar check in friendly concierge helpful with transportation on time,1
2058,trinity hotel located in the heart of dublinfood in the restaurant is excellent staff are very attentive accommodation is comfortable with a fun design theme this hotel is not an ordinary one decor is edgy,1
2059,went for meal with work colleagues very disappointed with reserved tables which were unsuitable asked for other options really did like the attitude of the supervisor well think she was and found she had a very smart attitude and a comment was a made that i did not like about the numbers for the booking service improved when another waitress took over but we were not asked if we wanted another drink when drinks came order was partially wrong after us having to ask for another drink the food was bland and deserts only ok i have eaten bar food in this hotel and it has always been really good so it hard to understand how the restaurant food was so bland overall stressful experience felt like we were high maintenance even though we are not definitely wo be back on a work team night out considering we were spending over euro one expects more and should be made feel welcome we were asked if everything was ok but i did feel this was genuine i will return to bar as service and nibbles always good but wont be returning with work colleagues as was unfortunately embarrassed for recommending this venue we had another corporate meal night out last week and went elsewhere your staff need to up their attitude to get repeat clients back as i say the waitress was actually friendly and nice but the supervisors attitude was not good the only positive thing about the night was,0
2060,i stayed here for nights with my partner for his start with the positives there is actually only one location the hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of grafton st temple lane st etc price poor value for money our room was small for the price we paid and the bathroom is in need of maintenance our shower had been cracked and glued back together shower power was also lacking what was particularly frustrating though was that on both nights we stayed the hotel was hosting private functions a retirement party and a wedding which restricted the guests use of certain parts of the hotel courtyard etc no reduction in price was offered despite this the noise from the hotel is significant also we had a room facing onto the courtyard rude and inattentive we had a problem with our room key card it would open our door when asking reception for help rather than just fix the problem we were told very clearly it was our fault as we must have had the key card next to a bank card or mobile phone which then affected the magnetic strip the lack of courtesy of staff continued at breakfast despite the extortionate room rate breakfast was not included however at check in reception had authorised euros on our card to make it easy for us to pay for any costs we had while staying in the hotel service upon arriving at the breakfast we were told,0
2061,after getting married abroad in december my husband and i held a party to celebrate at the trinity city can not recommend it enough this hotel is a gem it beautifully decorated with a fantastic garden at the centre that was perfect for a warm evening the staff are wonderful in particular mihaela for her amazingly calm organising and stephen for his attentiveness on the night the food was stunning and catered for all tastes and dietary requirements without both from dublin so the central location was perfect and allowed our guests to go out or get home easily after the party ended my husband and i stayed at the hotel that night assuming we would sleep after such an exciting night but the room was so peaceful and comfortable that we just passed out until our breakfast arrived the next living close to the trinity city hotel i will definitely find a reason to come back and stay,1
2062,i booked this hotel when i saw colplay we going to be at croke park the location is really good the airlink stops right outside the hotel opposite side of the road temple bar is only a minute walk away it only took us around minutes to walk to croke park you can get the bus right outside too which would take out most of the way but the roads were closed for the concert so it was quicker to walk there back the hop on hop off bus stop is also directly opposite the we entered i was impressed with the decor it has a very luxurious boutique feel about the arrived at about to check in staff on check in we waited around minutes were given our room keys for floor there was a wedding going on in the hotel so we had to walk through all the guests to get to the lift we struggled to open the lift area door with our keys someone else opened the door for us we found our room our keys would work my husband went back to check in by this time reception was chaos with lots more people checking in finally got our room keys sorted into our size no view very dirty windows i aware construction work was taking place on the upper levels lighting in the room was fine during the day but impossible to apply make up in the evening as there just one lamp by,1
2063,my travel tour agency recommended this place i have since told them to stop i am on my second and final stay of nights room came with air conditioning but it was broken mentioned it times and was assured it would be checked out i still have no air conditioning i have sleep apnea and cooler air makes my breathing easier i did request a fan and after second request it finally showed up could not sleep with windows open as i was next to fire house and road noise the first nights dinner took hours to show up and my wife lamb was cold my sons fries were old and stale not acceptable one positive is the morning breakfast buffet it has a great selection of foods they even offer gluten free bread i found staff to be dismissive with discussions about food and rooms i have a large family and will tell them not to stay here on their next visit to ireland i am unsure if problems stem from management or owners who do not care about maintenance and upkeep avoid it like the plague,0
2064,the hotel is very well located we stayed for two nights rooms are clean but despite the moderate temps in the it was uncomfortably hot in the rooms and the windows barely opened so did not provide much relief stay did include a very nice breakfast buffet,0
2065,the hotel is quite old but very clean it is set in the heart of the city and is opposite over the bridge to the temple bars lots and f bars and good things to do a great breakfast as much as you can eat for have live music every restaraunts which is open fronted so you can get into the swinging city while you eat,1
2066,me and my friend came here on three separate occasions throughout our holiday we had dinner one evening food was great drinks were good we had a night out in temple bar area and this was the last stop for us because we were staying right beside the bar there was a great band on great end to our night,1
2067,wife booked this as it cheap for the dublin city centre area you not know it are brilliant and ca do enough for you the room is up there with some of the best i stayed in massive comfortable bed our son looked dwarfed in the huge single slightly dated but well stocked and river view from our room over the was included and was very good,1
2068,we a great meal in the terraced area i wild mushroom risotto we chicken wings kids had ribs lovely friendly staff reasonably priced went in to main bar up to with kids as some irish dancing and traditional music was on i a lovely passion fruit and ginger mojito cocktail very good great atmosphere and interaction by band members would definitely go back here for their celtic dancing night downstairs which was fully booked looked like a quality and varied menu unlike the themed night menus you might see in spain which are would make a beeline for here again now that i know about it,1
2069,this place is in a perfect location not right in temple bar but across the bridge from it so you far enough away from the crazy but not too far the hotel is old but clean beds were comfortable staff was very friendly helpful breakfast was just ok it located on a very busy street so if you leave your windows open at night prepare for lots of shouting drunk people lots of traffic but i think that part of the charm of dublin i think it was a good value for the price,1
2070,absolutely loved the irish dancing however i have to give a shout out to shauna my server i work as a server in a hotel and i know the difficulty of serving customers when things are running through your head shauna was absolutely fantastic and she was so helpful and kind you never know lads i might steal her from you to work for me,1
2071,this is right on bridge so you perfectly central the room was nice we had a huge comfortable bed it was clean and spacious the only problem was that our room was up or flights of stairs and they had no elevator i would of minded it just that the person i was with has a disability but when we mentioned this to the staff they were more than happy to bring our suitcases up to the room for us we had one drink in the bar just one because it was pretty expensive for a single pint but that to be expected in a central city would stay again,1
2072,just stayed at the arlington for the concert we were greeted by maggie at the reception and she went over and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed this hotel had great atmosphere good food at great prices the staff was exceptionally friendly the arlington is located right in the heart of the city so everything you need can be within walking distance next time in dublin we will definitely book arlington cheers steve ocmd,1
2073,great location close to temple bar the hotel is old and could use some updating the beds were very comfortable there is no mini refrigerator or microwave in rooms which would have been nice since the portions at the restuarants are soo big it would have been nice to be able to bring back the leftovers to reheat for a midnight snack the steps to the room are a little tricky especially coming down be sure to stay to the left of the steps when coming down as the the right side of the steps cut short on some steps causing one to fall would be nice to have a railing on the left side coming down the steps as well overall the hotel was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful i would stay here again for the location alone,1
2074,i just checked out of here after staying nights i just did not feel comfortable as a guest here like i had at the other hotels i stayed at throughout ireland it was old noisy and the staff were not very friendly it also had no in the room and the bad ventilation in the room made it very warm in there even in the early morning the beds moved easily also and were not very comfortable the only benefit to this hotel is its location being in walking distance to many landmarks and places of interest,0
2075,stopped in this hotel for a drink it was about pm on a monday night and quite a few people already in and enjoying themselves live music meals the atmosphere was really good its was just a pity my wife and i were just in dublin for a couple of nights as we would have liked to have seen the irish show and have a we drank up and left to visit other certainly recommend,1
2076,i have just got home from a a hen weekend in dublin we stayed at the arlington hotel the hotel is beautiful and full of irish charm it looks a little worn in places but i personally felt this added to the charm the staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating when i first arrived the hair dryer in my room was not working however they sent someone up immediately to fix the problem the arlington hosts a celtic night each night which consists of a course meal a live band and irish dancers the evening costs around we attended this on the first evening and it was absolutely fantastic the music was beautiful the dancers were stunning and the food was delicious and they do not scrimp on the portions the leader of the band was funny and entertaining and i felt this was the perfect introduction to irish culture as i had not been there before the hotel breakfast was great and they had something for everyone after a couple of boozey nights the fry up was just what i needed to keep going the only criticism i have is that the pillows were a bit hard but that really is nit picking i thoroughly enjoyed my trip and my stay at the arlington and would certainly return,1
2077,just had one night here and loved it great little hotel slightly aged but with a great atmosphere brilliant pub and great live music staff were very friendly and helpful walking distance to most attractions the sun was shining the perfect evening and night in dublin if you are not seeking absolute star luxury this is a great spot saying that it is clean comfortable and well serviced all you need for a good nights sleep in a great location,1
2078,we spent one night at the arlington hotel bridge after arriving in dublin en route to westport we chose this hotel because of the location and it ended up being a great choice if you want to be close to the action in dublin this location ca be beat it north of the river so a tad quieter than being in the temple bar area but just as convenient for accessing restaurants pubs shopping and many tourist attractions from the airport the hotel is easily accessible from any of the city centre buses both the dublin bus and air coach stop on street just around the corner from the hotel although the stop is closer huge perk that we did even consider when booking is that this hotel has fantastic amenities of its own the hotel bar and restaurant are lively with live music in the evenings it is also the location of the celtic nights dinner and show which hotel guests can take in at a reduced rate we also took advantage of the hotel breakfast which was great as had a great stay and would definitely stay again when in dublin,1
2081,we arrived as a family group of adults for a birthday celebration for a arrival the welcome was very friendly and warm from the reception staff we arrived before breakfast had ended and were directed to take breakfast at the residential service level was evident throughout the hotel for our entire weekend nothing was too were large and well presented food drink service excellent with entertainment every night within the,1
2082,so many reviewers extolled the location of the arlington hotel in dublin that i be remiss to go on except wow it really was so easy to walk and grab the streetcar a block away that said the room was not the most luxurious i ever seen and i was glad for that it was clean quiet and comfortable maid service was good bathroom was quite spacious and nice and the front desk folks were courteous if it a busy place but if value and location are tops and you do want squick i would think twice about recommending this hotel and the irish facility was fun do check out govinda vegan restaurant a block away,1
2083,came across this hotel as we were on the way to temple bar we never got to temple bar fantastic night of live music it was a rock band the night we visited and it was so much fun great atmosphere and everyone singing and dancing mixed ages but more our age than full of youngsters food was available but we did eat drinks were cheaper than temple bar which means a lot on a night out in dublin it was about euros for a pint of guinness and a vodka and coke which was cheap after the band there was a dj with more dancing we left around and felt like we had had a fantastic night out great find would return,1
2084,arrived early in the morning and not able to book in yet which was fair enoughhowever staff very pleasant and helpful taking our bags and locking them up for later when we did check inlocation is perfect right on the liffey just off street yards from bridge and a minute stroll to the temple bar area over the river it an old hotel has real character the bar was huge and nice the breakfast area was also great there was a bus stop right by the hotel for the tourist loop buses all of them and we used them straight awaythere was loads of cafe shops and a cracking doughnut shop close to the hotel the location is fabwe arrived back later in the day to check in we collected our bags and it took no time at allthe room was as expected a double bed a window that opened fresh air bathroom tv and plenty of power points handy nowadays and hanging spacethe room was perfectly good very clean if there was a negative i say the bathroom was a little tired and i hate shower curtainshowever tired is acceptable when it as clean as it was so no issuesthe shower was hot and very powerful a major plus and i was glad the window opened as the rooms and the hotel itself was very warmthere is no air con usually not needed to be honest and as it a very old building it stays rather warmbreakfast is served,1
2085,the hotel location is excellent centrally located we arrived early to drop of bags to be greeted by friendly staff who gave us all the information we needed to get to croke rooms were very clean and comfy the food at the hotel was good and reasonably priced as well cheaper than temple bar which is totally a rip off the live music was excellent as well would have no problem booking the arlington again,1
2086,the fire alarm went off repeatedly early in the morning but the hotel made no attempt to let people know these were false alarms this is absolutely unacceptable otherwise the staff were very helpful and apparently students and understaffed the fault lies with the,0
2087,great hotel situated on o connell bridge entertainment was good food was good rooms were good if its a younger type of nightlife you want then its just a walk across the bridge to temple bar this hotel is very deceiving doesnt look that big from outside once inside its amazing,1
2089,stayed here for nights and must say what a lovely hotel this is our room was huge and airy beds just slightly hard but managed a good sleep i definitely recommend eating in the hotel too its really reasonably priced compared to the rest of dublin would definitely stay here again,1
2090,stayed in july with a friend hotel is excellently situated and has good bar food rooms are a bit tired but the price was reasonable for central dublin at night the room was very hot though that would be my only real complaint watched the traditional music and dancing show one night which was great overall a good place to stay and would stay there again,1
2091,we unfortunately stayed here three nights as our first stop in ireland we shared a twin bedroom on the first floor for one of those nights which was miserable the hotel is very dated but the location was great so we muddled through our stay but left very sleep deprived our shared room was directly over the bar so we heard music most of the night i would be shocked if there was any insulation at all in between the floors on top of that the room was very hot there is no so if you want to be cool at night you need to leave your windows open which means you will hear everyone walking home from the bars at and you will be awakened by the sun at in the summer there was no sheet which i learned is typical in ireland only a thick covered duvet one woman at the front desk staff was grumpy every time we went up there however the woman who sat us for breakfast every morning made up for the bad experience she was delightful cheery and remembered our large party liked to sit together the breakfast was typical and pretty good i ca say the same for lunch mediocre we enjoyed the fact that there was a large breakfast and lunch room where we could sit and play cards during down time the elevator was weird in that you had to insert your card every time you used it and it,0
2092,my husband and i stayed here for nights whilst visiting dublin on arrival staff allowed us to leave our luggage so we could explore the city before checking in the hotel is situated in the heart of dublin and sits right by the ha penny bridge we ca fault anything about this hotel staff are very helpful and welcoming the food is perfect and the bar is the perfect place for the we payed to attend the celtic night which is situated in the downstairs area of the hotel and i would highly recommend this for all people young old especially families the food and music really made our trip even more enjoyable,1
2093,my mother in law booked this hotel for a family trip i would never have booked this hotel in a million years on the face value however i had no choice but to stay the bare minimum i require from a hotel is its clean this hotel was filthy that enough to not to ever book it please see the pictures quick points was no ac the taps did work shower leaded and was wrapped up with tape noisey view from the windows in our room was laughable lovely roof covered in ac units that do work covered in mould sheets i could go on do not be fooled into thinking the location will make up for negatives of this hotel there are other hotels book those instead that the hotel the dinner show the table layabouts was rubbish the food was it was insanely hot the service was terrible it was so loud you could speak to someone next to you i watched another couple leave midway through their starter it was that bad it over priced and not worth it please i implore you not to book this hotel not waste your money,0
2095,lovely service from the team at reception including daniel evidently there are three daniels rooms are spacious a little dated especially the bathroom fixtures but clean bed excellent great location for national gallery of ireland and city centre attractions,1
2096,booked this hotel for a long weekend to dublin it was an easy stroll to grafton street and street it was the staff that made this hotel we arrived at and daniel on reception did a bit of shuffling and gave us a room straight away the same for the couple in front not many hotels do this this was a real bonus as we could get in immediately no hanging around and storing bags nice comfy lounge good self service breakfast with delicious yoghurts nice pub opposite called the ginger man just round corner from national gallery too,1
2097,stayed july room was pleasant and comfortable however at our expectations were not met i passed on breakfast even though it was paid for looking unappetising and poor quality dining room is very outdated a good morning how are you when greeted would be nice upon arrival to the breakfast room check in was very poor phone calls and visit to the hotel and the parking situation was still not made clear as the parking facilities for this hotel is not straightforward make use of your website trips back to the desk to get the room keys to work correctly staff need serious basic training at reception we feel lastly staff were friendly however the guy the area on the needs a proper talking to how he treated and spoke to the staff was shockingly horrific the swearing the tone he took the body language pointing fingers and raising of hands and physically rushing past me that i nearly dropped my drink actually unsettled me to the point i had to leave he is in the wrong job if he gets that angry i felt so sorry for the waiter out of order i wo be returning,0
2098,picked this hotel because i was going to be in dublin for one night after touring so glad i did the location is fantastic for the center of dublin close to bars restaurants and shopping the staff could be more helpful a pleasure to deal with the room was comfortable ample sized the only drawback is the fact that they are renovating so the smell of paint was in the hallway and there was scaffolding on the window but no noise,1
2099,trinity city is a very nice hotel in a great location they are building a floor so keep in mind that they start drilling pretty early during the week the staff was extremely friendly and helpful go see gary and radi at the bar,1
2100,we stayed in the rooms which was quite luxurious the beds were very comfortable lovely decor and lots of room for our three teenagers the location is excellent and was the reason we chose it as we only had one day to explore dublin the reasons for only stars the exercise room was closed and this was very disappointing we paid well over for one night and this was the price so not having really any other amenities was a bit of an annoyance the hotel has a partnership with trinity college to use their pool however this is an extra cost the breakfast the price for hotel guests is per person in this family budget dublin is a very expensive city we get that but at least have the gym available or offer a room discount if it not in use or how about a free pool pass when the gym is down tip for breakfast we went to sparta right around the corner and had fresh pasties yogurt and a stack of bananas for just over,1
2101,we stayed for a weekend and were very happy it is a bit pricey but you are right in the heart of the city so we expected to pay more the lobby is really pretty and different with all the purple décor and it was very comfortable to come back in the evening and have the couches in the lobby to relax and have a drink or quick bite the breakfast was pretty good and the staff was very friendly and helpful our room was big and had a separate sleeping area for our teens which was great we loved it and would definitely stay again,1
2102,as soon as you walk in the foyer of this hotel you are like wow there is a dog statue that i could help but hug the door man was so helpful you could ask him anything and he would help it is very central so when you drunk and trying to find your way back you lucky as temple bar is only minutes away also a heads up go to the doughnut shop on the bridge you will not regret it,1
2103,the davenport hotel is located near the center of dublin ireland just a block north of merrion square it is also located about a block east of trinity college and several blocks south of the river liffey it is also located next to the house were oscar wilde grew up it is now some type of small college the hotel is located about miles from dublin international airport or approximately minutes by taxi longer if you are in rush hour stayed here for nights in late may with my wife and youngest daughter and thought the hotel was nice and also thought it was in a great location near many major tourist attractions we paid a night for a triple room one king size bed and a twin bed which i thought was pretty reasonable breakfast was not included and was euros per day per person i thought the lobby and bar area were nice looking and i also liked my hotel room the carpet and furniture were updated in addition the room was above average in size the front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given only complaint was the poor breakfast service the main breakfast room was full so we had to go to the bar area where the guy working there was lazy and would not help us i thought he was a dishwasher or cleaning person we had to walk back into the other area and ask,1
2105,we celebrated our honeymoon in ireland and my husband booked a room at the davenport hotel from the outside it a beautiful hotel and when we checked in it was a beautiful lobby i was really excited and then we walked into the room when we walked there was an issue with the electricity within the room we called to the front desk who called several electricians into the room to fix the problem the electricians came in and out of the room for an hour and were able to fix the issue but we lost an hour of our time with no apology or compensation the room was comfortable but a bit dated and really needed to be remodeled the bathtub had wood on the sides additionally there was spots of blood on the shower curtain and the clocks were set at the wrong time which made us an hour late for a tour with all the hotels in dubin i would book this one again,0
2106,stayed here for concert friendly informative staff upon check in room was good size and spotless not the mist modern room but well maintained all the staff were great and had a good breakfast the next day very central location hairdryers in bathroom should be in a museum did ask if they had a better one we could borrow but never heard back overall good stay,1
2108,most reviews are spot on this hotel is small smelly and needs to be renovated it was not at all what i was expecting paying star hotel prices the biggest con was the did not work and when i called reception all they did was bring me a portable fan seriously do yourself a favor and chose another hotel,0
2110,i love this place just as well i had not paid for breakfast as i was generally sleeping to late in the morning this was the comfiest quietist and darkest room i have ever had the pleasure to sleep in i loved the vintage feel and would argue that it should never be updated our suite was the perfect size and offered us a comfy environment for a week of relaxation i am already planning another week at the davenport,1
2111,we had nights here on a sight seeing trip to dublin the welcome was warm abd service was friendly and efficient the twin bedded room was spacious and comfortable two local pubs made up for the rather brightly lit and unatmospheric hotel bar the hotel position close to merion square trinity college and the national museums was ideal,1
2113,this is an older hotel and we were with a tour group so our rooms were run of the house which usually means not as updated and sometimes without much view that being said it was very comfortable and clean everything was in working condition and beds were comfy wifi worked well and was free our breakfast had numerous choices that were well displayed and tasty the location of the hotel is great for exploring the airlink express bus the airport is just blocks from the hotel recommended,1
2114,whilst it is getting on in age the davenport was still very comfortable bathrooms a bit old fashioned but everything you need is there and the staff ca do enough for you buffet breakfast as good as the other hotels in dublin and belfast that we stayed location to walk to everything,1
2115,danilo was a friendly ahd helpful man who got us quickly registered and tried very hard to help us get registration problems sorted out he was back in the morning and promptly got us checked out and called a cab to get us to the train breakfast was good and it was filling the room was wonderful and comfortable we recommend the hotel to anyone who is going in this area,1
2116,this old classic hotel is a bit worn but worth it it is in close proximity to trinity college the newly renovated art museum and not far from the main shopping area the rooms are of adequate size and they hay have king rather than double beds always a good thing,1
2117,wonderful hotel at great price for dublin and for july clean bedrooms friendly staff very central for all your shopping needs dinner was lovely and served by a lovely waitress called amy problem in the kitchen with our order and chef was very rude shouting at her he made the mistake so everyone in the restaurant could hear amy was so professional and polite to us and apologised to us for his rudeness she even made time to have a laugh and joke with us breakfast not as good as selection limited but will definitely stay again,1
2118,i stayed at the maldron smithfield for nights whilst working in dublin i thought the hotel was hugely over priced up to per night the sink was cracked very basic toiletries a squirty bottle of lux poor quality towels cheap tv walkers not a make i am familiar with very limited channels on the tv of them colby trouser press and iron with a completely worn out cover i thought the breakfast was very average and understaffed kept running out of stuff and having to ask for it to be staff were the one highlight they were very helpful and efficientfor the money paid i would expect an awful lot better i am glad work was paying as i would spend my own money to stay here,0
2119,stayed her for three night is april as part of a trip with friends in a good location near the hop on hop off stops grocery store right next door with hot food available the rooms were clean and staff were very friendly had lost my charger and the front desk loaned me one for my stay had a little mix at check in but think that may have been the travel companies fault and not the hotels would stay here again,1
2120,well i would recommend the maldron hotel in smithfield certainly for the price that we paid for a room for four people sharing with breakfast convenient location away from the hustle and bustle of temple bar and its environs yet not too far away minutes walk from the centre of dublin of the dublin pass attractions is directly across the courtyard outside the hotel jamesons whisky distillery convenient fresh produce supermarket is situated next door to the hotel in case you need to stock up on fresh essentials for your day trips around the have no hesitation staying at this location again,1
2122,my family had several rooms here recently and for a night on our way to killarney the rooms we had included a double bed and a twin that worked well for my husband and i and our son the room was clean and the beds were comfortable as is the case in my places in ireland there is no ac so you need to keep your window open if it is a warmer evening when the windows are open you get a nice breeze we were on the floor and it is a quiet area so there was no problem with doing so next to the hotel is a large market with food fresh pastries drinks and other assorted good across the cobblestone way is jo burgers as well as a great breakfast place called sparks and the cobblestone a traditional irish pub is right across the street it was a perfect place to stay for the evening the one drawback is keeping the windows open on the lower floor where another family member stayed tends to be more difficult as there is some noise on the street also to put your car in the garage it is an additional euros a day and you have to pay every time you take the car out and return this is the reduced rate when you stay at the hotel the staff was so helpful and accommodating especially those working at the front desk and for the evening we stayed there it,1
2123,i stayed here for work my room was clean and spacious with an amazingly comfortable bed tv a little small for the size of room and distance from the bed but not a deal breaker free wifi lifts to all floors ability to check in online and print boarding pass for flights breakfast had ample choice and service good overall happy to stay at this quaint old charming hotel and would recommend,1
2124,when we first arrived there was a bit of a mix up with our room that the staff fixed as fast as they could our room was rather spacious the food was good but make sure you get down early out much of it will be gone,1
2125,we had planned to stay here for our whole trip but when we arrived we had to move hotels due to a flood on our floor we stayed a night at the alexander location the stephens location is definitely nicer of the two great location and walkable to all the sites it quiet at night and it was great to run around stephens green in the morning,1
2126,we had rooms both in the new part very nice rooms very upmarket hotel breakfast was a full irish but with a rocket salad on top which was something i was not used to but all in all a nice hotel in heart of you could park out side,1
2127,nice hotel in perfect location cozy and clean rooms and the staff is very friendly the hotel is located at stephens green park there are a lot pubs and restaurants around only ten minutes to temple bar the breakfast is very good and you can book three categories,1
2128,we stayed as part of a group our room was run of the house as per our tour it was nothing special with a view of a wall feet away however it was clean and functional the beds were comfy and the wifi worked well we had breakfast included and it was reasonably good with nice did have a group dinner one evening and it was very well done with hot delicious entrees and good in all this is a well situated hotel in dublin and is very near to the airlink express bus to and from the airport recommended,1
2129,hotel is in a very good location walking distance to many of the important places to see and things to do stephen green is right next door and is such a lovely place to wonder the hop on hop off bus stops right by the hotel there are a lot of hotels and around so you be spoilt for is friendly and efficient we had a room on the top floor which was nice and quiet windows can open which is becoming more and more rare in hotels nowadays so that was things like the toilet seat being broken and no hot water in the shower in the morning were great but the bathroom has both a bar and a separate shower which is nice and spacious beds were comfortable enough so i had a few good nights sleep which is always wifi no parking i do think a very nice stay in a great area and we come back,1
2130,stayed here july as we had tickets for river dance at the gaiety theatre just a ten minute walk from this arrived early but our room was ready so that was great reception staff were lovely as were the housekeeping staff when we got lost trying to find our room was huge the bed was huge and everything was a very good nights sleep considering you are just on the edge of busy grafton street and the were even able to have a well deserved as breakfast is served till on a was delicious cooked to order and while you are waiting for that to arrive you can help yourself to the well stocked continental breakfast meats cheese fruits pastries the waiting staff are excellent they make sure you have everything you need and then leave you alone so you can have a wonderfully relaxed breakfast at no point did i feel the need to wolf breakfast down for the next have stayed in many dublin hotels over the years and atlast i have found one i will return to,1
2131,only stayed in the hotel for one night the room was a big enough room for city centre hotel comfortable furnishings the windows were onto a busy road but we completely sound proof the bathroom was a little dated but more wear and tear than anything else it had a bath shower so not for those with mobility issues but fine for us the shower had great power did get breakfast so ca comment overall it good value for what you get for a city centre hotel,1
2132,so far not impressed poor service in bar only three tables of three and two bartenders and a manager behind the bar room has mould in the shower door in hallway squeaks sooo bad anyone have some definitely not a four star,0
2133,i am a big believer that a hotel serves the trip i do need fancy or endless amenities as i expect to be travelling the totally fit that bill the location in the southwest corner of stephen green made just about everything south of the liffey accessible within a minute walk the room was spacious and clean and the hotel bar was a good place for a final drink so long as your day was ending but midnight which was rare there was also an excellent food truck set up across the road after each night for a late night only issue we had was being there in july we found the room very warm and the ac not very effective opening the windows did he trick but we were on the front of the hotel with a busy street and team line below us that said we generally managed pretty well keeping windows open most of the day and closing them our few hours of sleep but the morning were warm all in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay again,1
2135,we were staying in this hotel for one week and loved clean and modern decorated room very comfy bed and location surrounded by best restaurants in dublin very close to the beautiful stephens park as well worth a daily walk recommended,1
2136,the service at this hotel was very polite and focused on customer satisfaction it was easy to deal with any of the staff the rooms and public areas are clean and in good condition nice breakfast and good food in the restaurant the hotel is within a walking distance from the city center and pricing was reasonable a nice innovation to have the gym in the sixth floor with a good view out,1
2138,the place is beautiful spacious and elegant the lobby is filled with amazing decor the staff are very nice and helpful the dining area is huge and has a great atmosphere the menu has a big variety to choose from the rooms are nice nothing special just plain and a little cramped there is a free shuttle bus to dublin airport every minutes which was very handy if you were in a rush you could just pop your hotel card into a box and they would come and check it out for you which in my eyes was a great idea considering the price and the standard of the room they lost one star but everything else was really good and i definitely recommend it,1
2139,the clayton hotel was a lovely base for our mid week break in was a minute walk into the city centre with bus stops situated outside the hotel there is car parking available at the hotel for a discounted rate of per day if you are a breakfast was nice with a good choice of cereals fruit and breads the cooked buffet was good considering how many they are catering for although for how much they charge for breakfast better quality sausages would go the exception of one receptionist the staff were friendly and helpful the concierge if you managed to find him was very helpful and knowledgable about the booking the room i phoned to book as i needed to request a cot in the room and could not do this online i was not given the best deal over the phone i could have saved more choosing my deal online but took the hit as i needed the cot which was provided free of charge upon checking in though this addition was not added to my room and we had to wait to check there was a cot available which luckily there was also the receptionist who checked me in did not give me any information regarding the restaurant times breakfast times check out times etc not a major problem but it is a basic requirement when checking in and certainly one i would expect from a star enjoyed our stay it was a very comfortable clean room,1
2141,myself and partner booked this hotel last minute and where not disappointed from the man on the phone to the check i a reception they where all so friendly and helpful we headed into town but came back to the bar for a few drinks which was relaxing breakfast the next morning was delicious and plenty of hot and cold food to suit all look forward to returning soon,1
2142,a recent one night stay was our first since the hotel was rebranded as to see the hotel has reclaimed many of the characteristics which made the old burlington such a great dublin were greeted by friendly professional reception staff and although we arrived in advance of official check in time we were allocated a room without room was well equipped spacious comfortable and which goes on until is excellent with a wide choice of fresh fruits cereals and hot area is quite large but the staff have no difficulty in providing an efficient location is excellent just a short bus hop into city centre but there are a number of very good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity if you want to give the city a look forward t staying here again,1
2143,loved the location and the staff we arrived well before check in time and our room was ready and we were allowed to check in excellent since we took the red eye from nyc the staff was very helpful with all our questions i traveled with my parents and each evening they had dinner and a beer in the restaurant the staff and service was also excellent good rates for a three person room the room was very nice clean loved that they had an american outlet in the room plus gave out adapters at the front desk free of charge,1
2144,on our arrival sunday evening the of aug we dealt with a blonde foreign lady who was very ignorant and did make us feel one bit welcome i also did understand what she was saying even when i said sorry could you say that again she would repeat what she said we were also told we would have to pay for parking for the two nights a bit ridiculous considering we paid for the two nights with just a bed the breakfast was also robbery for a fry and for a bowl of coco pops a bit crazy if you ask me there was no electricity in our room from about half monday night until we were leaving tuesday morning had to use a light on our phone to shower and go to the toilet we were woken up to building out the back too tuesday morning and you could also hear everything happening out in the hall as the doors do seem too sound proof poor stay overall,0
2145,staff was wonderful hotel was very clean we did have one glitch and when we told the staff about it they immediately apologized for the inconvenience and provided us with a free dinner hop on hop off bus passes by every morning at so you have no problem getting to great attractions,1
2146,came here for the first time excellent hotel staff friendly and helpful rooms spacious and clean this is a well run hotel food and drink excellent would definitely recommend to others and i will be back,1
2147,no longer a doubletree hotel very disappointed with this hotel it is modern in design but lacks character we found the front desk staff to be rude others in the hotel ranged from pleasant to unpleasant charge daily for parking and breakfast is euro it is away from city centre so you will need to take transportation into the rest of dublin a bus stop is outside the hotel but the staff was not at all knowledgeable about the routes rooms were hot and had poor ventilation there was a portable air conditioner in the room but it did not perform well enough to cool the room even opening the windows would not bring in enough cool air,0
2148,the hotel restaurant cafe and room was incredible we arrived well before our reservation and our room was ready and they let us up perfect for a quick nap before exploring we recommend if you are exploring a lot of dublin get the dublin pass we saved a lot of money and time this way,1
2149,i had to cancel a booking at very late notice but the burlington alanze in particular were so easy to deal with i have been there before for functions and the staff are always helpful quality of food is good and the hotel is kept very clean based on the level of customer service i will definitely stay there next time,1
2150,recently got the chance to stay at this hotel on business for nites food offerings in coffee bar and breakfast were excellent and staff at coffee bar and breakfast were warm welcoming and friendly we will be returning,1
2151,i booked my stay last minute on the day i was travelling the reservation person i dealt with stephen was so helpful and friendly we got a great rate for bed and breakfast perhaps due to how late we booked when we arrived the hotel was quite busy but they had every desk open we were checked in by a lovely duty manager unfortunately i forget her name on the day we stayed the weather in dublin was very warm this hotel does not have but when we got to our room they already had the blinds closed and a fan running to cool the air i hadnt stayed her before but i will definitely go back,1
2152,overnighted here after a late arrival into dublin airport with kids and adults we normally have to swallow the cost of rooms i was so impressed they offered a family suite beautifully appointed rooms and plenty of space it a gorgeous hotel the staff are friendly and kind the breakfast was incredible,1
2153,very nice room however the ac was out of order large room and the bed was very comfortable breakfast is good busy hotel just a minute walk from st stephens green and grafton street air coach operates from outside the hotel directly to the airport,1
2154,as you walk in the door a warm greeting from staff receptions staff them happy to help food great breakfast fast and no q dinner good food staff happy to help bar staff knowledge good nothing to much trouble general manager always available upon request and alway around hotel keeping eye upon the operation thank you clayton court the best so far this year,1
2155,great position for getting aboutclean and friendlygood servicerooms were stifling too warm with no aircon they bought a mobile unit but it was so noisya lot like a premier inn but twice the pricebreakfast option was fabulous with a full irish or a selection of cakes and pastries both if you want them easy access to taxis outside the hotel,1
2156,although is little bit far from downtown it can be a good choice clean silence good connection with airport bus in front of the hotel with a schedule for downtown you can find buses opposite hotel for different direction bed confortable and ketle for tea and coffee,1
2157,my husband and i stayed here on sunday th june we arrived at pm to check in but our room was ready which was fair as we were mins early we took a seat like we were asked and tried again to check in at pm unfortunately our room was ready so we were told to leave our bags with concerige and try later we left the hotel to get some dinner and returned and tried again to check in at pm we were asked to present proof of our booking by the young man on the desk as they had no record and then we were told for the third time our room was ready we were annoyed at this stage and he offered to get the manager he returned after almost ten minutes to say room was ready no manager we received no apology no welcome to the hotel that seemed to be only for the guests who rooms were ready and no refreshments while we waited we like a lot of the guests checking in we in town for the phil collins concert and the room prices were increased to reflect this euro plus euro for parking gate for the concert opening at pm so not giving us adequate time to refresh before hand we were the only ones having trouble getting our rooms on time and the manager should have come out to apologise but he left the young man on the desk to deal with,0
2158,stayed here several times when it was the burlington hotel and owned by the hilton doubletree group never had any problems always a very comfortable stay our room was on the th floor which had air con which i am led to believe not all rooms have it so it probably only a major factor when the weather is hot only a min walk to town and walking through st stephens green is a very pleasant walk as the grounds are kept very well there are always taxis outside this property so great to hop into and buses from across the road go to town we get the air coach from dublin airport to right outside this property and from across the road to go back to the airport the breakfast is great enough to set you up for the day a good variety there is a bar which serves food snacks too check times did use it on this occasion but have used it in the past maybe be different since the clayton group taken over this property there is also a fitness room which i walked past swiftly,1
2159,sadly this trip was disappointing due to his hotel rest of dublin great but avoid his place sewage coloured water in bath unresolved even though changed rooms and only comp offered was a glass of wine could drink or use water in my room and had to wash using bottled water like on camp manager lady pleasant but ineffective in sorting base issue have never complained before but added to false alarm at this morning too no breakfasts for that price value for money want single people off,0
2160,arrived at the hotel about after only booking about an hour before hand on and parked the car and went into reception got a really good first impression reception was lovely and the guy checking us in was very nice and welcoming he also told us the bar served food until which we were really happy about got in the lift and went up to leave our bags in the room before dinner room was was nice and clean but it was small and the shower had no power in it at down to the bar then to get food i got the chicken wings to start and my partner had the leek and potato soup both which were really mains my partner got the beef rib which he really enjoyed and i got the thai green chicken curry i would defo recommend not to get it it did not look appealing at all i have attached a picture of the curry it came out cold both the rice and the curry we said it to the waitress who was really nice and she took it back to the kitchen about ten minutes later it came back by a manager who did not even say sorry curry was hot rice was still cold i did not want to say it again so i had a few spoon fulls and then realised i could not eat any more it was revolting it was watery bland and there were no vegetables or,0
2161,if i could give it more stars i would as everything was wonderful from the moment we checked in and out our room was spotless on arrival they had even taken the time to leave a complimentary pudding with happy birthday written on it for my boyfriend as we were celebrating his birthday while stayed here for and cant grumble about anything every day the room was cleaned bins emptied towels and toiletries replaced i think the housekeepers do a wonderful job and i found it refreshing that they take the time to talk we ate in the hotel bar on a couple of occasions and found each meal to be made from good quality produce i liked the fact that all the sauces were is separate dishes instead of on the plates as not everyone likes to have their food plastered in sauce all the were friendly and took the time to tell us the best bars to go to in town for live was busy but the staff handled it brilliantly i do think i would have been that calm such a wide range of foods were on offer they even had plenty of gluten free the front desk staff from my observations they get the brunt of visitors complaints as check in does seem to be a bit of a nightmare at times due to this some guests were extremely rude to them granted there did seem to be enough staff on reception but that does give,1
2162,stayed here recently for a concert and i was really impressed with the place very easy to get to from the city centre by bus and taxi rooms were very comfortable now and had no problems with bar has a and avoids being claustrophobic like a lot of hotel bars by having lots of staff were brilliant and quick with the drinks shoutout to david who was really welcoming and recommended some great i enjoyed my stay and would recommend,1
2163,stayed here with a large group of colleagues for an awards event facility caters to as they have a very large well equipped conference center rooms were clean and adequate with no frills regular rooms which i stayed in do not have air conditioning so i had to keep the window open this made it hard to get to sleep because of the noise from outside hotel is within walking distance of stephen green min and grafton street min we felt safe walking this at night as well,1
2164,the clayton is excellent value for money modern and very clean rooms lovely breakfast but most importantly staff who is extremely committed we celebrated our daughter birthday there and they went out of their way to make sure that she is truly spoiled the city center can be reached by taxi easily but it can also be a pleasant to minute walk to st stephen green and not to forget the canal bank cafe is just one minute away from the clayton,1
2165,i returned for my third visit to this hotel last week for an overnight stay in dublin the first time i visited was when the hotel was a doubletree that was an excellent stay with a large room and good views i returned in april this year for the first time as the clayton and also enjoyed the stay although that time i had a much smaller room and a view of the buildings at the back of the hotel instead because of this i booked an executive king instead of the standard room for this visit as i hoped it would be for a larger room similar to my first stay you can imagine my absolute awe when i was out of the blue upgraded to the presidential suite upon checking in the member of staff who checked me in was so so lovely and i only wish i had asked for her name to be able to mention her directly in this review she even took the time to ask the next day how the trip had been and i left feeling most looked after thank for the presidential i was speechless it was beautiful with wonderful views a living area dining area kitchen two bathrooms two coffee stations a wardrobe a study area and the most comfortable bed needless to say none of the intended plans for the city that night took place as it was much more enjoyable to just have a few drinks in the,1
2168,currently in room on floor at am with the incessant thud of drum and base torn duvet cover on bed still at least i have no fear of actually being able to sleep book a different hotel if you actually expect to sleep in your room,0
2170,my wife and i stayed at the weekend very nice and comfortable room the hotel was busy with a nice atmosphere the staff were attentive and polite the hotel is in a great location for a dublin visit i would recommend,1
2171,comfy familiar and straightforward front desk was pleasant and helpful rooms and lobby were pleasant and clean maids were prompt and nice beds were comfy towels were big and soft plenty of hot water no in rooms window opens marginally fans available large bar that was under staffed but had great drinks and food bar staff was funny and friendly restaurant buffet breakfast was super with large selection dinner food was great but wait service was horribly forgetful with slow kitchen location is residential takes minutes walking to get to city centre some other sights within walking but most will require no view from rooms but that not what this hotel is about it one that meets all your requirements with good quality and comfort without any particular pizzazz warning lots of tours stay here they were superbly managed by hotel but some travelers do like to stay with roaming herds,1
2172,just left the burlington and felt i had to post this beautiful hotel and ca really fault it for comfort and appearance however we just spent the night in room and never slept a wink a domestic argument in room until the wee small hours put paid to that my partner was going to phone police it was that bad paper thin walls did help and we heard everything there was wall punching door slamming roaring shouting swearing what appeared to be slapping and lots of crying it was nothing short of a disgrace the management had already said the hotel was fully booked so no point i asking to change rooms it was before we got any sleep and only then because the female left i accept that this is no fault of the hotels but i paid for a bed to sleep and could it was cheap either i reported to the girl on check out who seemed wholly disinterested always liked the hotel but doubt i stay again going home completely wrecked after what was to be a comfortable hotel stay,0
2174,arrived late evening and was quick no issues hotel is nice clean and comfortable room is big with a comfortable bed and pillows we eat food in the bar on the first night and it was nice but limited enough selection breakfast was included in our room rate but there is a nice coffee dock in the reception area that serves lovely coffees scones fruit etc prices reasonable there was air conditioning in our room as we were on the floor but the unit was extremely noisy when it was on without it the room can become extremely warm and stuffy hotel is within walking distance of st stephens green comfortable shoes advised if walking overall had a nice experience staying here if in dublin again for a concert and prices were reasonable i would consider staying here again,1
2175,the hotel itself is quite nice and clean however when i arrived at my room was not ready and the staff took over an hour to get a room for me the staff clearly need training in customer service it is very expensive and in no way justifies the price i will not stay there again,0
2176,as usual this is written as a wheelchair room was quite a good size although i did find it a little neat for my electric wheelchair there is a separate section of the car park for disabled badge holders and this is opened by asking the concierge or reception to unlock one of the bollards so if you are a sole disabled traveller it would be worth having the phone number in your mobile so you can phone in and ask rather than struggling out of the car and then back in bathroom is very well appointed with a shower which has a height adjustable seat and what i thought were sufficient hand rails the toilet itself is raised with handrails on either side the sink is lower so is convenient for a wheelchair user the bed is level with a wheelchair there is one pull cord to summon help and this is in the bathroom i think another cord at the side of the bed might be lifts beside reception are a wee bit on the small side but there is a bigger lift to the side of the breakfast area and i found that one much easier to food in the restaurant is lovely but there a few too many dishes with or olives which cut what i was wanting quite a bit but i had a steak one evening which was staff were helpful and on the whole our stay was very pleasant,1
2177,on arrival at the hotel we felt we were inappropriately greeted at the front desk with an unwelcoming attitude in comparison to other guests checking in parallel to us who were provided with maps and received a friendly welcome on the first evening what should have been a relaxing bar experience after our journey was another disappointment the bar man focused his attention solely on mature american guests and ignored us when it was quite clear that we had empty glasses on our table and required service there was certainly no excuse for this as the bar was not busy in addition our bar dining experience was yet another disappointment having ordered and received our steaks they were both not done as requested in fact they were medium rare no service check was provided to enable us to easily rectify the situation one would expect this to be a natural part of the food service in a hotel of this standard worse was to come we attempted to order desert only to be told that the kitchen was closed again guests would expect to be warned of the impending kitchen closure whilst finishing ones meal so that any final orders could be fulfilled staff attitude and communication left a lot to be desired in this instance after receiving a lack of information at check in we approached a member of staff in the coffee area to enquire about hotel facilities however before he could ask him a question he stated,0
2178,stayed here for nights with family and enjoyed it a great deal the rooms are very nice and modern newly renovated clean the washrooms are very clean and newly renovated as well the location is a bit away from the city centre in a mostly residential area but only about a minute walk to the centre or a cab ride of euros or so if i had to come up with a complaint it would be the long walks from the elevators to the rooms aside from that everything was great i would certainly stay here again upon returning to dublin,1
2179,we have just returned from a a two day stay at this hotel this is the first hotel where staff do greet you and say hello no contact at all through the whole check in very clinical staff in the restaurant clearly had been trained in the same manner where is the warm irish charm the service was slow in the restaurant and the service was very disjointed the second night it was quicker especially when we asked for bill the bathroom was small the bedroom was clean and comfortable we had breakfast in the coffee bar in reception and it was fine sorry staff again ca take orders correctly and no interaction with guests would not be going back,0
2180,i absolutely loved this hotel the breakfast is just fantastic well cooked huge choices and set us up for the day we were also delighted by the bar the first night due to arriving late we ate in the bar so pleased we did as the food ambience and service was turned out to be one of the best and cheapest meals we had whilst in dublin it is unusual for a hotel restaurant to be so very reasonably priced we would have eaten there again if it had been our choice in a group as subsequent meals eaten elsewhere proved of lower or equal quality but far more expensive rooms were clean and spacious it was quiet the staff were polite and helpful i admit the initial impression was that it was a little in places but it turned out that the distressed glass near the bar is designed like that my fashion radar is obviously off kilter would absolutely recommend this hotel,1
2181,i stopped by here before my business meeting to find that the gresham has now been rebranded as hotel riu plaza the gresham it still as impressive as it was before and the selection of teas and coffees were second to none it a wonderful place any time of the day,1
2182,we stayed in lots of riu hotels all over the world mainly resort type properties for a couple of weeks this was our first city centre riu plaza hotel for a few old building that obviously had an extensive refurbishment the rooms are well finished with a roomy ensuite this hotel is right in the middle of the action on street and is therefore a great base to explore dublin the writer bar hankers back to a previous age of sophistication and was made complete by a group of guests dressed to attend a great gatsby event it felt very the service is just formal enough to feel a bit special but the friendliness of the staff stops any chance of an added bonus to anyone flying to dublin the express aircoach stops right think this now is our go to hotel in dublin really enjoyed our stay,1
2183,on the plus side bed very comfy room large and for the negatives accessing the hotel by car you have to park underground accessed down an alley way used by drug addicts you can not get directly into the hotel without a room card so have to walk found with all your bags we got lucky as a staff member was in the lift and took us to our room was fine and room itself was ok nothing extra special but the heat hit us immediately and the ac was not yet commissioned windows hardly opened and the noise from gulls and roadworks was unpleasant water scalding hot even on low setting then the shower made an odd scheeching little sleep due to heatexpected better for the price,0
2184,had a wonderful stay here back in july the location is absolutely wonderful and within walking distance of shops restaurants cinemas and bus tours the hotel was under construction during our stay which did affect the charm of the hotel whatsoever all staff were friendly and welcoming looking forward to coming back next year,1
2185,just terrible stay never wrote a review before but feel the room was so bad people should know no air conditioning in degree heat needed to leave windows open so sea gulls and other birds squawking sounded like something out of jurassic park inch tv about years old with patchy sevice could use the shower as it was broken honestly worst hotel room i have ever been in ca say anything about staff as we just went out as soon as possible oh and for parking a day do stay here,0
2186,this is my third year bringing a group to the gresham it seems to get better every year from the exceptional service to the superb rooms the location is great right on o connell street within walking distance to lots of attractions looking forward to returning next year,1
2187,the hotel upgraded our room and a bottle of wine on ice awaited us when we entered the room a thoughtful touch for which we were very grateful in spite of the ongoing renovations the hotel is very elegant but comfortable the writers bar very welcoming and the food served there was extremely that said it was the friendliness and easy professionalism of the staff which enhanced our stay our sincerest thanks to everyone there who made our stay so thoroughly recommendable hotel in the centre of dublin,1
2188,this hotel was recommended to us by the travel information booth at the dublin airport when we arrived they made the reservations and gave us a reduced price we wanted something in city centre that was walkable to sights this hotel has alot of history it has been renovated our room was clean and comfortable not a large room the proximity to everything we wanted to see in dublin city centre was perfect for us we did not eat here,1
2189,my sister in law contacted the hotel on tuesday july to inform the hotel that she would no longer be able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances she was advised that she would not be able to amend the date or be issued with a refund as she was under the impression that the booking had been fully paid for she offered me the room as she did not want to let the reservation go to waste i knew i would be travelling late and called the hotel to query the latest check in time and when the residents bar closed i was advised that pm was the latest check in time and pm was the closing time for the residents bar this was misinformation as my husband rang straight after and was advised that you could check in at any time and the residents bar in fact closed at a much later time we explained the situation over the phone and was told to come on ahead when we arrived we experienced the most unpleasant check in i have ever experienced we were met by an extremely rude member of staff who really should not be dealing with the public in his mannor judging by his dress code and age i would assume quite a senior member of staff as the first point of contact to the hotel please retrain this man in customer service when my husband was trying to explain the situation he kept rudely interrupting saying,0
2191,the hotel is sadly no longer the elegant good service place it used to be bad service and poor food in the restaurant but in particular nasty insulting baggage clerk in the storage room i checked out at am and then realized at am that i had left my belongings in the room safe i returned to the front desk and the helpful assistant asked the baggage clerk david to accompany me to the room his reaction was one of great anger at being disturbed although he was not busy and when i insisted and after more than hour he accompanied me insulting me all the way up in the elevator and along the corridor how could you be so stupid do you know how hotels work you are wasting my time i got my belongings as the safe was still locked but i am very disgusted that somebody like him could be employed there who else has he insulted i bet i am not the first and management does not seem to care dublin has many good hotels so there is no need for anybody to subject themselves to such insulting behavior,0
2192,we stayed for a night break july in the gresham is centrally located comfortable peaceful in the middle of everything you out the door all kinds of services are on this is so easy good atmosphere staff at front desk are helpful courteous the ridiculous price of hotel accommodation in dublin this was not too expensive i would need a really good reason to visit dublin and need to stay overnight though to pay these prices,1
2193,despite the ongoing renovation work the staff we encountered were all courteous friendly and very helpful we had a beautiful room in the college wing and we slept so well bed was very comfortable and room was warm hotel is in the heart of the city and we walked to wherever we had to go dublin castle temple bar and iveagh gardens to name a few we did eat in the hotel but only because we were out so much car parking facilities are great if a little bit of a hassle trying to get parked outside the hotel to check in first before you can access the car park you need your room key for the lift loved our stay,1
2194,this hotel is one of our favourites when over visiting dublin business and pleasure staff are very courteous and go out of their way to make one feel welcome rooms are very comfortable clean and provide all the necessities for a welcoming overnight stay room service was efficient and food reasonably priced for dublin city centre,1
2195,when i booked this trip i was a little concerned that the hotel would be much different now that it is owned by a new company i was pleasantly surprised that the things i really loved about the gresham on three previous stats have not the staff are still friendly and helpful there is a safe feeling about the property and the service is stellar there are some changes being made to the structure itself but it was not inconvenient at all the housekeeping seems to be magic i would leave my room in the morning and immediately my room would be spotlessly cleaned even if i was only gone a short time i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a convenient locations and a feeling of respect for their guests lovely visit,1
2196,we arrived two hours before check in and were offered an upgraded room straight away to compensate for the final week of upgrade works in the hotel reception staff extremely helpful in particular with regards to car parking under the hotel and how to access out of normal hours the parking was for the overnight stay there is a lift from the car park to the hotel just make sure to read the notices in the lift to check which floor to get off at we did not use the facilities as we had other commitments but both looked lovely our room was on the second floor lovely comfy bed immaculate no bath great nights sleep silent could not believe we were facing the corner of street upper so quiet plenty of taxis outside and other transport options available great location for sightseeing shopping nightlife etc will return here,1
2197,i stayed at the gresham hotel in dublin recently and was disappointed check in at reception went smoothly i was served by a lovely pleasant lady who gave me a complimentary room upgrade and what a room it was too overlooking street the room was absolutely beautiful and very clean we ordered food in toddy bar and it was as good as we would have liked it to be we were disappointed to find that the service was slow and the food was only warm when it was served with only small portions too when asked if everything was ok i did inform the staff of this but the only response i got was i definitely would eat there again as it not good value for money at all the breakfast was better though they claim to serve until but if you are down before that time most of the buffet has been put away and only a small amount of hot food remains available so get down early finally there is renovation work underway at the front entrance which is surprising for the time of year i would have thought that this type of work could have been completed early spring or in the autumn time not during peak season the workers are very noisy resulting in some difficulty hearing the very good reception staff they too appeared frustrated with all the noise from dropping tools and banging equipment all in all a great stay costly but then again,1
2200,we stayed here for two nights at the end of our circle ireland bus tour the hotel is very nice lots of services great bars and restaurant the location is absolutely fantastic and ca be beat you are right in the heart of the action and all kinds of eateries pubs shops are adjacent easy to walk to all from here the rooms here are large great wifi nice beds and comfortable only problem we had was air conditioning is poor or was functioning in our room the lowest we get the room temp was and it sounded like it was working but never cooled properly not really an issue though as there were there large windows that fully open so it was cool enough there are two pubs that are top notch within steps of the hotel madigans is right next door went here fro drinks twice nice place murrays just up the street a half block was an outstanding place we dined here on our last night with others awesome food service and live irish music there is lots of shopping near this hotel great stores for everything you need we thought this hotel was great and would stay here again without a doubt,1
2202,the hotel riuis a beautiful hotel located very strategically to the heart of dublin we could walk anywhere we needed to go wonderful staff and good food our only issue although minor was they never repaired the towel warmer after numerous request,1
2204,very well operated hotel with very good staff that are so helpful clean throughout breakfast is a good choice the room size is more than adequate some are very large the personal products are of quality,1
2207,we paid for a room for the concert on arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded to a suite when we arrived at the room it was quite small the only thing to suggest it is a suite was a larger bathroom otherwise the room was dark really hot and stuffy we put the air con on when we left the room and when we came back it was warm sleeping was unbearable and we could contact any of the hotel services in fact when we came back all we could see was security at the front lobby and nobody at we asked to speak to a manager the next morning he apologised about the air con and was aware they had a problem with it in the hotel no gestures were offered and guess what does not include breakfast it is disappointing to see these hotels totally rob people when an is will never be back here again the shelbourne is the place to stay,0
2208,the service here is exceptional so you ca go far wrong the first week i stayed they upgraded me to a suite hot but lovely and spacious the second week was a considerable step down a tiny room no road drilling just outside the window i complained to the duty manager and they had moved me to a quieter cooler bigger room within the i would recommend they work very hard to make their customers happy and most of the property is spectacular,1
2209,stayed in the gresham for one night before leaving the country paid euro for a room without breakfast for this price would have expected much better service arrived about knowing this was too early for check in but needing to drop luggage and enquire about possibility of room availability traveling on my own with lots of luggage and a very tired young child no room available fair enough but was told i would get a phone call as soon as possible when room available never got that call i left my luggage went to bar to order food found my own menu nobody served me despite waiting several minutes and i left to find something on hours later i rang hotel and was told no room still available child now asleep on top of me and i pleaded with receptionist who then found one i arrived back to hotel to lots of people checking in i queued with child asleep in my arms and looked around to see if chair in reception but none there nobody came to my assistance during that process despite me struggling to hold my little boy i eventually grew tired of receptionist chatting to a customer at concierge not checking in just chatting and i asked for my room key she then kept asking me for my luggage tag despite the fact my hands were completely full i told her my priority was child and room and i could worry about luggage later she finally,0
2210,very expensive for such an old fashioned place after paying as much money as we did you would expect a little more comfort quite disapointed on the plus side the staff were as accomodating as they could been,0
2211,the hotel is located in one of the few monumental buildings on o connell street was easy front desk staff was friendly and helpful although some were difficult to understand because of their spanish speaking background my room was on the street side overlooking o connell street the room was not big but clean and comfortable and well isolated i did not hear street noise an excellent breakfast was included in the rate i paid most of the city sights were on walking distance there is stop of the aircoach to the airport in front of the hotel,1
2212,very nice room wonderful and helpful staff and concierge two restaurants in hotel and terrific full irish breakfasts available daily its location is central to much of dublin tourist sites hotel is located on busy street buses and tour guides readily available,1
2213,stayed in the hotel riu plaza for one night for the coldplay concert at croke park chose the hotel based on its location but would gladly stay there over and over again we had a wonderful stay the staff were incredibly helpful from check in to check out and we had an amazing room in the college wing complete with a plate of cookies wishing us a happy anniversary really stunning room spacious and comfortable and fabulous bathroom too was worried about the noise from street but we honestly did hear a bar on the ground floor as well with an extensive gin menu in particular would gladly stay here again in fact we tried to get a booking for this weekend as it worked out so well but unfortunately they were sold out next time for sure though,1
2214,my husband and i stayed at this hotel after our day tour of ireland first of all the location of this hotel is absolutely perfect so if you want to stay in the city center then this place is for you you can walk down o connell street and you are in the city center there are multiple shops restaurants coffee shops and everything that you need as you walk out from the hotel also the hop on hop off bus has a stop right outside the hotel the aircoach blue bus also has a stop just right outside of the hotel i can not say how impressed i am with this bus service that is offered between the airport and the city center you can just purchase the tickets from the bus driver it is either or euros i do recall roundtrip to airport and city center per person so you can not go wrong with that and it is much cheaper than a the hotel was decent and comfortable the front desk people are very helpful and friendly the room itself was very small enough to fit a queen size bed desk and two smaller chairs the bathroom was decently sized and it had a towel rack heater which was a nice surprise the one thing i did like about our room were the paper thin walls i could hear when someone was flushing the toilet at but i got over that i would definitely recommend this hotel,1
2215,not great but nice helpful front desk staff but most were difficult to understand it seemed they all wanted to speak spanish with an irish accent not good for the vast majority of the good location clean rooms that are paid maybe euros each for the breakfast but had to get breakfasts for two of our three days there due to early tours and an early flight what we got with the breakfast was an apple a banana and a very small muffin no more that was a complete would not return there must be better options in dublin,0
2216,the location is perfect in the heart of dublin which means walking distance to all the main staff was super friendly the room was great and very clean excellent breakfast super recommended,1
2218,this was a great base of operations from which to start our ireland vacation it very central and within an easy walk to pretty much everything you might want to see in dublin rooms were clean and the bed was comfy staff was good and the restaurant breakfast were good as well,1
2219,a clean hotel in a nice location near to markets restaurants pubs shopping streets the personnel of the hotel is quite welcoming and available you can easily walk your way to temple bar and no need to catch a cab by night,1
2220,room was perfect one of the nicest i have stayed in large room and bathroom with everything i could need provided no noise at night and staff were friendly and helpful check in and out was done with no fuss location of the hotel is ideal for a trip to dublin and i would absolutely stay here again,1
2221,what a lovely christmas spirit in dublin the christmas lights are delightful especially grafton street and the buskers on christmas gresham is my choice of hotel every time i go back to dublin central classy and comfartable,1
2222,i stayed here recently with my husband it really has the wow the moment we checked in until we checked out it was staff can not do enough breakfast is fantastic with plenty to choose beds are comfortable and the rooms location is right on o connell street close to totally recommend the gresham,1
2223,this wonderful hotel is situated exactly at the first bus stop of the aircoach from dubln airport on the main thoroughfare of the city it is a short block from the gate theatre the staff were really friendly and helpful our room was perfect and the bathroom boasted a luxurious bath as well as a shower,1
2224,delicious meal i would recommend the beef rather than the hake however portions were very small for the price delightful surroundings with nice background music and friendly staff i will definitely return in the hope of larger portions,1
2225,very helpful staff security gentleman was informative and was willing to answer any queries i had could not fault hotel parking was easy and i felt my car was safe outside hotel room was clean and comfortable,1
2226,stayed here before flying out to bulgaria for a family holiday rooms were really comfortable and spacious was so comfortable and staff were so friendly breakfast was really good and an excellent price would definitely recommend it,1
2227,krystel found us a great room helped us arrange a shuttle directions to airport really appreciate that she understands family she was patient kind and helpful i have already recommended to friends flying into and out of you for a great stay we will definitely be back,1
2228,stayed here last week before early flight the next day really enjoyed it as staff so pleasant and helpful from reception to bar staff and the bus driver who brings you to and from hotel to the airport had a lovely dinner in the bistro with a very relaxing atmosphere best hotel food we have ever had so compliments to the chef room was very comfortable with great bed and spotless bathroom tv has best reception ever and wifi is fast got a great deal for stay and parking for the week will be back next time we are flying and highly recommend this hotel,1
2229,i had an overnight at the metro hotel to catch an early morning flight i needed dinner and the service there in the restaurant and lounge is fantastic waiter mario and bartender taylor were professional efficient and friendly i had time to sit at the bar after dining and had some nice conversation it gave me a good impression of the hotel and that the management was hiring good employees if i ever need to overnight again near the dublin airport metro will definitely be my choice,1
2230,enjoyed my over night stay from start to finish after my holidayon entering the hotel was greeted by most efficient friendly staff got to the room and discovered the bed situation was not for me it was late at night and the reception staff changed the room immediately greeted in the dining room next morning beautiful freshly cooked breakfast overall appearance of the hotel was lovely and very comfortable very happy with my stay,1
2231,used parking space for airport shuttle bus to dublin airport driver of mini bus excellent he is always so helpful with bags and children always so friendly and recognises us from previous trips he is a credit to the hotel and he is the reason we return time after time,1
2232,my boyfriend and i enjoyed staying at this hilton location which was near almost every major attraction we went to see in dublin the view of the river is fantastic if you can get it the rooms are quirky and modern and the staff is terrific our only quibble was that the parking nearby is ideal as it is difficult to navigate a car into the narrow spots and maneuver in the tiny parking building but that may be an unavoidable fact of staying in downtown dublin and the car survived just fine in any event we would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in dublin,1
2233,the service at the morgan restaurant was simply outstanding nina was extremely quick and accurate with all orders her enthusiasm was infectious and she sets a great example for all employees oat the morgan,1
2234,stayed here years ago we were impressed then and again this time our daughter had a bit of an issue with a plugged sink but other than that it was great located near the temple bar area plus a large shopping center staff treated us very well the breakfast was excellent beds were also very comfortable only there night but good preparation for the long flight home,1
2235,the hotel is located right in the city center walking distance from many service is really good and the staff were very helpful the rooms are decorated in a modern lite style which i really like,1
2236,great location to be able to get into temple bar and other areas of dublinbar is well stocked and bar team all know what they are doing good service same with the roomsparking is next door but easy to find,1
2237,our stay started in spectacular fashion we arrived exhausted around after traveling from the states our room was ready of course but we asked if another one was indeed a upgraded room was available right then so we happily paid the surcharge went to our spacious room and had a magnificent four hour nap we had a great bed sofa and tv desk area ample closet and kettle the bath was spacious with a strong swedish shower head quiet is extremely important to us we were right over the road by the liffey river so there was a little noise but the windows had pretty good insulation and traffic dwindled in the evening actually more annoying were the hardwood floors which creaked when we walked and when our neighbors upstairs had breakfast one morning thought it was good but not outstanding there is a pretty simple buffet of breads usually very coarse juices and cereals you order hot items off a menu standard irish breakfast omelettes pancakes etc then again we were never thrilled by any of our breakfasts over days this is france or italy the staff was friendly and helpful i wanted to print tickets for dublin castle and after i emailed it to them they said you do have to wait around we put the tickets in your room and they location was terrific easy walking to all the major sites but not in a crowded location we did feel the price was a little steep but,1
2238,great hotel very funky vibe rooms are generous and well laid out get one at the back as the noise from fleet st when it winds up late night early morning can be disruptive but goes with the location great staff particularly nina in the bar very attentive and helpful,1
2242,minutes from street wynn hotel is a great city centre location for business meetings conferences and training events the historic hotel provides a charming and welcoming working environment the friendly staff team are very accommodating and professional lunch is excellent and the venue is accessible by all forms of public transport,1
2243,the hotel has very high standards when it comes to premises and service a special thanks goes to claire for helping us out with the bookings and check in even going the extra mile by supporting us with info related to dublin,1
2244,my husband and i spent our first two nights in ireland at the wynn hotel on lower abbey street in dublin the staff was wonderful the bed was comfortable and the full irish breakfast delicious it is a lovely old hotel in a perfect location with both a restaurant and bar no taxi is needed to get everywhere you would want to go close to trinity college and street shopping pubs and restaurants,1
2245,traditional hotel in a great location just off st by the luas tram stop and minutes from connolly station dart services out to etc great bar free in rooms traditionally serviced nothing to dislike about the hotel at all was expensive for the night but i put this down to playing in town and all hotels were charging high prices nice traditional breakfast the next morning tip for visitors to dublin buy a leap card at dublin airport for i got unlimited bus including airport transfer luas and dart services well worth the money if you are travelling around using public transportation though dublin is a great walking city recommend malahide for a upmarket seaside village and bray to the south of dublin for a more traditional seaside resport,1
2246,we had a one night stay in a very comfortable and clean room at back so not a good view the hotel is well decorated and style befits its history staff very helpful and friendly we enjoyed a lovely full breakfast from a wide range of choices hotel could not be better located ten yards from street and a tram stop just feet away from door of hotel the dining room is lovely and bar has a good feel and serves good food one negative there is no lounge to to sit around in other than the bar which can be busy overall a great hotel if a little expensive,1
2247,such a beautiful place the staff were very courteous and knowledgeable about the area the bar and restaurant have both great service and fantastic food if you are planning on staying in dublin then this is the place to start your journey,1
2248,my husband and i stayed at the castle clontarf hotel on the last night of our day stay july we wished we had stayed here at the beginning of our trip it was amazing marcello was wonderful at check in upgraded us to a junior suite we absolutely loved the room four poster bed wonderful period furnishings and the bed was so comfortable the restaurant was wonderful as well our server karen was very friendly there is something to look at everywhere you turn i highly recommend a stay here while you staying in dublin,1
2249,this hotel was great from check in to check out clean comfortable and an amazing breakfast the castle features are interesting we got room service diner which was really nice we booked here to be nearer to the airport for our flight the next day will do it again,1
2250,staff excellent food excellent rooms are very tastefully decorated in keeping with the castle decor beds really comfortable definitely recommend this beautiful castle hotel to anyone we were surprised to be upgraded to a king suite stunning ca wait to go back,1
2251,we booked this hotel thinking it be cool to stay in a castle during our night day trip to dublin hotel was beautiful and it was fun exploring the building but after the first day novelty wore off and we wished we stayed closer to the city center the surrounding town is small with not much to see you would have to spend min or spend for a taxi to get to the city we took the bus the first morning to the city but needing exact change was a pain so we took taxi next two mornings hotel has a taxi on standby so that was nice later learned the red hop on and off bus comes near the hotel which would have been a great option but not knowing we purchase green hop on and off bus when we first arrived in dublin overall it was a pleasant stay and hot buffet breakfast was nice start in the morning but it was same menu every day,1
2252,what a gorgeous hotel it is filled with history and art all the nooks and crannies are full of surprises the room was very comfortable and the bathroom and shower very nice the breakfast is a buffet and offers many choices including classic irish breakfast choices the service at check in and in general are impeccable everyone very friendly and accommodating truly an experience in itself,1
2253,chose to stay here as a special treat to end our tour of ireland we opted for the dinner package which turned out to mean we were able to choose anything off the al a carte menu and the food was fantastic the staff were all really friendly and welcoming and overall the hotel did make you feel you come somewhere special our only criticism is with the room the dinner package came with a deluxe room this has been refurbished but it small details which slightly disappointed us in the bathroom the stem on the shower head was quite loose so the shower head could easily swing right over the shower screen it was clear that although there were new wall tiles and shower screen they had left the old bath in would have been so much better to have taken this out and had walk in shower instead especially as the baths are quite narrow the bathroom sink although a new modern basin had a crack in it in the room the bed was very comfy i can see that pillows could be a bit flat for some people but ok for us again just little details let the room down paint marks on the side of the mirror frame because someone had wiped it off when they painted round it poor workmanship overall though the food and the staff make this place and we would recommend for anyone staying in dublin,1
2254,had the pleassure of staying in this amazing hotel last weekend and what can i say only wow it was by far the most luxurious hotel ive ever stayed in the rooms were just fabulous and we enjoyed a lovely meal in the bar before heading out i would highly recommend this hotel if you ever travelling to dublin for a night,1
2255,the clontarf is a jewel my family and i stayed for one night while traveling to dublin from the us the attention to detail made us feel we were all royalty the castle itself is incredible and i would recommend anyone traveling to dublin at least go for a meal there it is an amazing experience to just walk in however if you have the time to spend a night or longer i highly recommend doing so the location and convince of touring dublin are worth the stay alone the talented and kind staff are beyond compare i so glad we found this hidden gem,1
2256,it has been remodeled to strengthen the walls and provide modern rooms without losing the flavor of the castle consequently there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies staircases and balconies to explore there are also several dining opportunities but the bar is very popular with a variety of food choices from small snacks to full meals it is a popular venue for weddings christenings etc it takes time to get a taxi so plan ahead when going into the city,1
2257,our family only had nights in ireland and the clontarf castle was a great choice the rooms were great the atmosphere was stunning and the food in the restaurant was awesome even our kids who are picky eaters found food they liked,1
2258,great food with great were not five star in a five star poster bed was to be a christening on the front lawn when we were leaving was just sorry i was not invited to stay am back shortly and cant wait,1
2259,stayed here on our last night in ireland a few miles from the dublin airport a wonderful experience i agree with all previous comments i was told that this was indeed the sight of the original castle supposedly a wall in the reception area was part of the original regardless it was well worth the stay,1
2260,stay there it is a wonderful experience they have air conditioning and the old style large bath tubs for soaking your tired bodies after a long day of sight seeing the breakfast room in the morning was the best catered one that i have ever experienced they have every type of breakfast food that you could want the bar area at night was also very elegant and comfortable the nicest thing about the castle is its history and inside decor they have a self guided tour to capture and explain all the paintings and artifacts,1
2261,we stayed here for two nights after a seven day drive around ireland i could write a great deal about things that are excellent and very good about this lovely unique hotel but very little about things that went slightly are very efficient and make you feel welcome whether it is the reception bar or catering personnel room was very comfortable and clean with all the normal support for the weary traveller we use the fahrenheit restaurant on both nights and have no complaints but plenty of praise looked after excellently by the staff there plus the food was very is located out of dublin but there are good access routes available by bus or taxi if you do want to or ca drive large car definitely use this hotel again if we are retuning to this area of ireland,1
2262,looking for a nice hotel for the last night of our trip in ireland the clontarf castle hotel seemed to fill the bill in fact it did just that the service apart from checking in was friendly and first rate especially in the fahrenheit dining room,1
2263,nestled in a quiet area the clontarf is a gorgeous mix of old and new uniquely decorated with both modern and historical elements and a staff that truly aims to please large knight room bar with excellent food and drink choices the small sized charcuterie board would be considered large at most other establishments many pretty seating areas to sit and relax and have a cocktail close to the airport and convenient to get to,1
2264,spent a weekend in dublin at this fantastic hotel full of was lovely clean and dinner in knights bar a lovely irish was self service with plenty of were very helpful,1
2265,this was a wonder place to stay for our first visit in ireland the hotel is outside the main city limits but it is a quick taxi ride from the airport about miles away the grounds are beautiful the hotel is beautiful the knights bar is fun great drinks especially the noble knight rooms are lovely front desk is very helpful and i have to say the breakfast in the morning is out of this world was a real treat you can also take a bus to downtown nice walk to the bus stop,1
2266,superbly located away from the hustle and bustle of dublin centre city but only a minute ride from it depending upon which area you want to go to the food in the knights bar is extremely good with great portions and a range of lite fare to hearty dishes the beds are comfortable but pillows are not the most comfortable though both are fine for one night the concierge and front desk are friendly and helpful and were able get us checked into a room before our flight landed at the tv in the room have internet and youtube as well breakfast in fahrenheit provides both full irish and continental fare and is the perfect start to a morning of exploring the only problem found overall was that our door handle was falling off besides that wonderful stay a,1
2267,i booked this hotel based on the great reviews from trip advisor and expedia it located about min away from dublin city center it quaint and quiet great when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city i have to admit that the decor is quite cheesy on the inside the hotel itself is overall pretty clean however i have to admit for a star hotel the bathrooms inside were what my friend called dingy they were clean but the lighting was off and the tile grout was black in some portions on another note the staff are very nice and helpful they have a restaurant inside that sells pretty good food keep in mind this is one of the only restaurants around the hotel since you are away from the city overall stay was pretty good,1
2268,very clean and comfortable staff treat the hotel as their own home they care deeply about the facility and services they provide everyone goes out of their way to help you wo have a better experience anywhere,1
2269,this is a must stay it is beautiful inside and out totally worth it i highly recommend you staying here it is easy to use the restaurant and the staff is amazing not right next to the city but very easy to get too lots of resources and information given when you ask,1
2270,the hotel is lovely and has very comfortable beds my only disappointing surprise was that the rooms were not actually in the castle the breakfast food was delicious and the bar was great the reservations team was mostly outstanding tina was especially friendly and thoughtful,1
2271,we attended a wedding here and the surroundings decor and atmosphere were all exceptional additionally every staff member we encountered were professional and friendly but special mention to lorraine who was our waitress during dinner she made sure that everything went perfectly including making special arrangements for our fussy eating son she a credit to the hotel,1
2272,stayed at clontarf castle for the better part of a week on business star all around room was wonderful food was wonderful and the castle is gorgeous would recommend it to anyone considering a stay in dublin,1
2273,this was the first hotel we stayed at in dublin and it was absolutely amazing not only was staying in a castle cool but the stay and service was excellent the rooms were very clean and we kept the staff was very polite and very attentive to our needs we only stayed days but we definitely stay here again when we come to ireland next,1
2274,i stayed here for a company offsite with my team for a week my entire stay was absolutely lovely and the staff was more than accommodating and pleasant they were able to check in me early which was greatly appreciated as this was an organized function sometimes things have gone awry or do run smoothly but at clontarf everything ran incredibly smoothly and the food and drink provided for breakfasts and lunches were fantastic the dinners were amazing and again i ca say enough of how lovely and accommodating the staff were aside from that the rooms were comfortable and the property was beautiful thank you so much for a wonderful stay,1
2275,located in a beautiful neighborhood just outside dublin great location loved the medieval decor friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast comfortable rooms that have all the modern conveniences including usb ports,1
2276,we started our irish holiday with clontarf in dublin am glad contarf is away from the hustle bustle of the typical touristy haunts clontarf castle is in a nice neighborhood and most of the old castle is preserved the rooms are modern and you will not miss a conventional hotel what makes it super special are the people who manage it we were welcomed and upgraded into a family room so we could have more space the chef even made a custom kids meal of buttered rice veggies for the kids one late night after our city trip kiddos were also treated to extra ice cream by the team at knights bar the knight bar serves hearty irish meals so go on and enjoy their lamb stew fresh haddock and even light eats you would find local families dining out here on weekends so its always buzzing with people breakfast is a good spread and the breakfast rooms are nice sunny the rooms are spotless and the housekeeping fantastic there a gym for diehards taxis are just one call away airport or train station about euros max if you hiring a car there free parking we would love to come back on our next trip to dublin tip hire your car straight from the airport or online before u arrive saves you a few hours of back n forth use a taxi or bus for travel within dublin,1
2277,i was here on a three nights sightseeing trip with my teenage son who had requested a comfy quiet room and good breakfast as mother and son we also wanted twin beds clontarf delivered on all points the room was not super large but large enough with a sitting nook comfy high twin beds that were cm wide lovely locally made toiletries and facility european and american power sockets were a nice touch the room was also very quiet breakfast was fresh much of it was and it was beautifully served in one of the castle characterful rooms travelling to and from the city did take some time around min walk to and around min transport time to connolly station leaving every minutes or so this was not a problem for us who did not mind walking and had bought leap transportation cards as one tour guide said there is no place in dublin that not noisy and clontarf was our quiet oasis after intense city strolls staff was lovely and very helpful but often busy this is a place where you carry your suitcase yourself i personally found the decoration of the hotel a bit kitsch but my teenager loved it,1
2278,we are just back from an amazing stay in the castle we had a brilliant time the hotel staff were excellent with us and the food was of the highest quality on the first night we ate in the knights bar and we well looked after and for our anniversary meal we booked the fahrenheit grill and it was outstanding this is one trip we will never forget highly recommended this castle,1
2279,clontarf castle staff made this visit a lifetime experience this was my first time back in ireland in years special thanks to marta who was originally from poland and took a special genuine interest in our brief visit over to kraków and then when we returned to clontarf castle where karen the irish waitress was also just as kind my apologies to all the other wonderful staff whose names i ca remember they made this trip wonderful clearly whoever does the hiring around here is a genius because i never seen such a group of and dedicated staff who genuinely take pride in providing their guests with a truly remarkable experience thanks so much,1
2280,only stayed in this hotel for one evening after an enjoyable week driving all over the lower half of ireland but it was a welcome ending to a wonderful trip the ambiance of this hotel is excellent considering the busy dublin area and it is only a short drive to the airport recommend just walking around the hotel and grounds to take in some of its history it is a quiet oasis within a busy city everything about this hotel was excellent and highly recommended,1
2281,i but away from the city center which is actually very good depending on your interests but close enough by a bus or taxi ride it a castle but also a pretty modern hotel with very good service will definitely be back assuming i would go back to dublin,1
2283,excellent stay at clontarf castle everyone was extremely friendly and efficient which made our first visit to dublin special the local transport is within easy walking distance so it is easy to get into the town centre or further afield,1
2284,we had a wonderful night stay in this hotel the staff was amazing and friendly the grounds room and hotel were absolutely beautiful and comfortable they were so accommodating as we were a large party who needed assistance with a private dinner golf clubs and the like i heard the shower turn on in the middle of the night during my stay it was much louder and longer than a slow drip i sleep through everything so it was very out of the ordinary i researched to find other guests who had similar experiences for anyone looking to experience an encounter we stayed in,1
2285,excellent service exceptional food have enjoyed at in some of the finest hotels in dublin incl merrion westbury and enjoyed the whole experience here more afternoon tea with a lovely difference,1
2286,a modern castle hotel much more live able and much much mores affordable than the other castles we stayed at during our plus weeks in staff here was simply amazing without being room with its bed was our last great memorty of our the lounge was fair priced were you were hesitant about ordering more than one drink,1
2287,the staff was friendly helpful and professional the bar made the best drinks the way they are supposed to be done the food was great prices were very reasonable and the castle was beautiful and well kept,1
2288,we spent a wonderful afternoon in clontarf castle as part of a work related family bbq afternoon the staff were attentive the space was clean and the food was delicious no detail is overlooked in this hotel and i could not recommend it higher,1
2289,i say castle because it really is more hotel than castle our room was not ready at and we were asked to come back hour and it would be we ate in the bar there at the hotel where the food was good albeit higher prices as any hotel our room had a small section of the existing castle wall in it which was nice but our window view was well a solid wall it is absolutely beautiful regardless and the service is unequalled we caught a cab to grafton street euro to go shopping this is a major wedding and wedding reception destination and there were weddings booked while we were there and it was no problem at all a beautiful place to stay but not the true castle experience i would have liked,1
2290,stayed just one night at this excellent and very attractive hotel found everything to be of a high standard from check in to bedroom with the most comfortable superking size bed i am fussy about beds but have to say this was the best sleep in a hotel bed for a very long time as the mattress was top quality my room like the hotel in general was very clean and well presented the extras you could wish for were present in the room including and it was nice that there was not just coffee making facilities but iron and ironing board decided to opt for buffet breakfast in the morning having had the cost added to my bill at check in to get a slight discount on the price and again i was delighted at the diversity of food beautifully presented in the breakfast room it was an excellent meal we stayed on a sunday evening and it was so wonderfully quiet room at rear of hotel and no noisy guests to wake us up last but not least it is a beautiful and characterful hotel just like the photos show and not boring and like so many other hotels it is one hotel that stands out for quality in all areas that matter and i plan to return again soon as great location not too far away from dublin centre and howth with its amazing seafood cafes and required though to get to city centre or howth good,1
2291,fantastic hotel with very nice and artistic decor rooms are maintained very well neat and clean staff is friendly and helpful only problem is not having enough option in dinner for vegetarians still very much recommended for overall comfortable stay,1
2292,upon arrival at clontarf one is amazed at the visual appearance it is a lovely property including interior which is state of the art but very reminiscent of a castle colors are royal purple fit for a king and a queen,1
2293,this was a surprise for my boyfriends birthday as soon as we walked up the drive we were both very impressed it looks amazing checked in by marcello there was a little wait as he was arranging a couple of glasses of champagne and chocolates waiting for us in the room lovely touch thank you we also had four mini cakes delivered to our room before going out that evening brilliant customer had a room at the end of the corridor and it was smaller than expected but it was too much of a problem still very comfy the water pressure in the shower was a little lacking but loved the toiletries smelled delicious the first night i struggled with the pillows as they are really hard i then read that they had feather ones so requested some only to be told they had run out disappointed by this the bed was comfy but the pillows let it had breakfast there which again was fantastic lots to choose from and very tasty on the second day though we gone up to get a little bit more and when we came back to the table the staff had cleared our cups of teams cutlery away so had to ask for we loved this hotel the staff were very helpful and the location was good we used the bus and train to get into the city and had a nice walk along the seafront,1
2294,the time spent at the hotel was so beautiful it has a cozy romantic atmosphere with lots of candles and classic music it also smells very good the candles and it has ac the staff are all very friendly,1
2295,my wife and i travelled with another couple from canada we spent the last night in ireland at clontarf after touring kms over days this was a great way to finish our great trip the castle has a mix of modern and traditional to the property which really makes this property work the way it does the pub and restaurant were amazing and the food was atmosphere was perfect as soon as we arrived and the décor suits their theme for a castle ca think of anything to improve this recommend to friends and would return when travelling back to you for a great experience,1
2296,if you want to experience afternoon tea with a difference i highly recommend clontarf castle fusion afternoon tea it is an unique experience and i was delighted to partake on sunday july as a final treat and to end a perfect few days stay in dublin with my daughter we had booked for and i was pleasantly surprised at the seating area were the tea was to be served it added to the overall experience large comfy chairs to sink into table at proper height and beautifully set glass was the theme and crockery was all glass not the usual vintage theme which is used in most establishments so different and refreshing cormac the bar manager approached our table he introduced himself in a very professional manner but he was friendly which is also important he helped us to sit back relax and look forward to what was in store he had wit him a wooden box which stored all the samples of teas in glass storage jars he proceeded to explain the origin of each tea and we were able to smell each one it was better than wine tasting he gave his recommendations but the final choice was entirely up to ourselves michelle was in charge of serving our afternoon tea and kirsty also helped michelle explained how the afternoon tea would be served savouries first and she described what was in each treat and she did the same for the sweet section she was very helpful and,1
2298,this hotel is fantastically placed to explore dublin bus stop just a minute walk the character and design of the hotel is fantastic and the staff were so friendly and helpful we were travelling with a month old baby and they were always checking we were ok and if there was anything we were lovely and breakfast was good although there was the occasional wait for tea during busier times the bar had a good ambience and having drinks served to your table was lovely after a busy a great stay if we ever cometo dublin again we will definitely be back great location for ferry port also,1
2299,on our first visit to dublin we chose the clontarf castle hotel because of its historic features and reputation for service once we arrived we saw that the hotel had nicely integrated modern decor with the castle walls and interior our room one of the few junior suites was warmly decorated and spacious with angled windows that overlook dublin also appreciated the helpfulness of the staff especially one who late in the evening tracked down and delivered to our room two long extension cords so my wife could plug in a medical device at her bedside staff in the restaurants were less attentive but helpful once we approached them with requests i recommend the clontarf castle hotel for dublin visitors with a proviso that visitors should be prepared to take a taxi ride from the hotel to get to attractions in central dublin,1
2300,arrived early to be given the warmest welcome by adam at reception who quickly checked us in and offered a few tips on what to do in advance of this gig including a map and directionssuite was beautiful bed comfy lovely toiletries and as we wee going out opted for lunch in the knights bar which as great too staff are helpful and knowledgeable hotel lovely and overall perfect for our stay adam seemed to be there for our every whim and really was the icing on the cake forour stay we will be back,1
2301,absolutely beautiful hotel a must stay if you are ever in the dublin area the customer service is excellent staff is very friendly and go out of their way to help in any way they can and will do whatever they can to make sure your experience at the hotel is above and beyond with everything,1
2302,we decided to add a stay in dublin to our layover on our way to london paris and rome clontarf was definitely one of the highlights of our stay it is extremely difficult to find a single room for a family of in europe so we considered ourselves lucky to even find one the room turned out to be larger than expected recently updated clean and luxurious the breakfast was fantastic and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful we loved the castle feel and beautiful artwork we will definitely be back on a longer trip to ireland sometime in the future,1
2303,state of the clontarf castle for days july through the had the bridal suite was absolutely spectacular frederica luke elaine all of them were awesome they made us feel like queens the food was spectacular the ambience was out of this world and the high tea was absolutely delightful i would highly recommend staying at the clontarf it a fabulous place walking around near the boardwalk by the sea is an awesome sight to see i will return to clontarf,1
2304,we spent three amazing days at the hotel as part of a business trip more than of my colleagues stayed in this hotel and we were all very well looked after the facilities were excellent the meals delicious and all staff very helpful i appreciated their help more so when i forgot to pack a pair of shoes and they found them and put them aside for me to pick up few days later on my return on the way to the airport i particularly liked the stylish decor and the perfect combination of old building charm and new and very tasteful interior design this place makes a superb wedding venue is perfect as a business venue too and it can also make a special day extra special i would not hesitate to come back again and bring more family and friends with me next time,1
2305,clontarf castle definitely exceeded our expectations the staff was warm and friendly the rooms were spacious and well kept and the grounds were simply stunning your close enough to enjoy downtown dublin yet also away from the traffic and noise i would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again someday,1
2306,i spent days here for a work conference including staying the night the staff were more than willing to go above and beyond with any requests the rooms were nice and clean and the hotel itself is in a stunning setting would recommend,1
2307,i organised a work conference here spanning days with international travellers the hotel could have gone out their way any more if they tried exceptional customer service in all areas of the hotel from the corporate side to the reception and maid service amazing catering and dining in the restaurants the hotel staff certainly gave us the that warm irish welcome they are famous for and they certainly went the extra mile the hotel is stunning and literally mins from dublin city centre and would highly recommend anyone considering in staying her to do so,1
2308,we stayed in the clontarf castle due to its proximity to the dublin airport nice accommodations including good i would recommend it for travelers who are seeking to spend their days in dublin city center since it is a bit of a drive or lengthy bus ride,1
2309,clontarf castle was better than i even hoped and my expectations were high it like staying in a lovely dream the building and grounds are stunning the food is delicious and the staff is wonderful marcello is a great concierge he worked with my friends and me on what exactly we wanted to do on our trip and every suggestion he gave us was hotel is located within easy access of the city center but it far enough away that it feels peaceful and serene book this hotel now you wo regret it,1
2310,it was the last day of our holiday in ireland and i wanted to splurge on a castle hotel i am glad i had chosen clontarf castle because it had all the elements i had wanted in a castle hotel grand and full of history and yet with the modern amenities incorporated we walked past knights armours on the way to the reception area which was uniquely decorated with all shapes and sizes of ancient keys for a moment i thought we were going to be issued one of those to enter our room the room itself blew me away it was spacious and luxurious and comfortable and distinctly star our only regret was that we were only booked for night stay as we had to depart ireland the next day we certainly ended our ireland stay on a high note,1
2311,just stayed at clontarf for two nights during july it is truly a special hotel and place to stay the decor is just as the photographs show ornate and quirky great art work through out the hotel the location is a bit off the beaten path from the city centre but the bus nearby will take you into town or a taxi ride will get you there and back in minutes breakfast is really nice and perfectly adequate with hot food breads yogurts fruit and cold cuts would definitely stay here again,1
2312,our stay here was incredible the lobby is maintained like an elegant medieval castle with plenty of fun photo ops to be had and the rooms feel like a modern luxury hotel breakfast was delicious in the morning and our only regret was not having more time to stay and explore,1
2313,cormac gave us a lovely welcome and introduction to the various teas and really put us at our ease the girls brought us lovely open sandwiches with a great selection of toppings the deserts were fabulous and we were encouraged to try different teas we loved everything but i think the orange and saffron creme brulee won would highly recommend the afternoon tea experience at clontarf castle,1
2314,we booked our trip through a travel website and selected to stay here on the last night of ireland trip the staff was very nice and helpful and the room was clean and very comfortable the food at the restaurant was also very good would definitely recommend this hotel to others,1
2315,love this hotels lobby built around the castle stayed one night while in dublin for room with a proper walk in shower not one over the bath breakfast was not included its a bit away from the city center would definitely stay here again,1
2316,my wife and stayed here last weekend while in dublin this was an amazing hotel and we both have no reservations in giving it the full five stars prior to arriving we got a bit lost and adam was most helpful over the phone in redirecting us adam was also very helpful and polite upon checkout too during our conversation he informed us that he was a newer member of staff having only been there a few months this did show and he is a credit to the hotel once we arrived we were greeted by luke who was professional and welcoming he could have done enough to help us for example we were very early check in is from and we arrived at but he managed to get us an early and a great room which in essence he had no obligation to thanks for this luke the hotel is amazing plenty of parking spaces if you are driving as we did we hired a car from the airport and good facilities the outside face of the building looks original authentic and simply stunning while the decor inside the hotel is equally as impressive as you enter the hotel you are greeted by knights in shining armour medieval type decor and a beautiful fireplace where we later sat by to who a delicious and gratuitously afternoon tea the rooms are also beautiful the bed was extremely comfortable and we liked the facilities such as the smart television in the,1
2317,we have had one of the most beautiful afternoon tea experiences in dublin we were offered a great selection of teas tasteful open sandwiches and decadent desserts the service is just top notch kudos to all the staff especially cormac our tea connoisseur and michelle our menu specialist who took great care of our table,1
2318,we were greeted by a small well kept garden and lots of lions the hotel is beautiful although we were too keen on our room decor it was an interesting place to explore with a last stop in the for an excellent meal,1
2319,everything you could expect superb service from check in to check out dining was fantastic rooms were spacious and immaculate the artwork on display was an unexpected find i would highly recommend to anyone,1
2320,stayed night loved the lobby area with wood paneling crests knights in armor tapestries and floral arrangements the restaurant was very good for dinner the hotel is not far from the center of dublin,1
2322,my wife and i stayed here last weekend as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations we were also attending a concert at the arena on saturday evening entrance we were particularly taken by the entrance and lobby of the castle hotel it was charming and authentic we saw a number of people enjoying afternoon tea which looked very nice indeed was incredibly smooth we were checked in by a gentleman arjun i think apologies for this is incorrect he congratulated us on our wedding anniversary celebration and gave us all the information we required room room the decor was classy with a twist and my wife and i really liked it the bed was incredibly comfortable and a good night sleep was had after the concert if i had to find a negative i would say that the bathroom was a little tired looking in comparison to the very fresh and modernised room although in saying that it was totally spotless and that the main thing food we had dinner in the bar my wife had the fish of the day and thoroughly enjoyed it i had the chicken burger and it was likewise very good portion sizes were generous definitely value for money and in line with other dublin eateries my favourite part though was breakfast the next morning a lovely buffet selection of cereals breads fruits and cooked breakfast little freshly prepared smoothies and juices were welcomed too i stay in dublin quite a lot for away and,1
2323,we booked a which was large the breakfast pancakes were staff is nice the house is situated a minute walk from the the was really disgusting everything looked clean,1
2324,i loved everything about this hotel the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed the concierge was absolutely great we were early for check in so she moved some stuff around and we were in our room within five minutes they have tea coffee cookies and cakes in the drawing room and the breakfast in the morning was delicious the appearance of the hotel is quite grand yet old school in the best way it is only about a minute walk to the oscar wild statue and the hop on hop off bus stop also it less than a five minute walk to the dart station train i would stay anywhere else in dublin this place spoiled us,1
2325,fantastic location very close to lansdowne road dart station which gets you into the city in a few minutes lovely old house with good sized rooms and a nice sitting room with tea coffee the bed is good but the quilt was much too hot in july so had to use the throw as a blanket the breakfast is excellent there is an amazing menu to choose from as well as a buffet i will highly recommend this place to our friends,1
2327,it really close to the stadium and stayed there while nothing was on there so was perfect the breakfasts were great quality i had a really early morning flight and they gave me a takeaway breakfast,1
2328,booked here after reading the reviews and enjoyed a fantastic four day break despite arriving very early we were given the warmest welcome our bags were securely stored and we were offered breakfast which was one of the best i have eaten the full irish is just that and worth every euro service levels here are way ahead of many top brand hotels and the friendly and charming staff always go the extra mile to ensure guests feel welcome our large bedroom was very comfortable and clean and the black out curtains ensured great sleep the hotel is a short walk from the light rail service dart which provides a very reasonable service into the city there are also a number of decent eateries nearby if distance becomes a problem overall a fabulous hotel which we look forward to returning to soon highly recommended,1
2329,we stayed one night at the ariel house which is located in a quiet area near the aviva stadium the place is very quaint and has a nice vintage vibe and style my only issue with ariel is the creaky floorboards which may disturb guests we had someone upstairs that moved around at night disturbing our sleep breakfast was great with a small buffet and cooked breakfast parking is available as well,1
2330,very nice rooms and great breakfast only issue is way too many stairs the staff did help bring them back up to the lobby and then down again to the street but there were a lot of stairs they were very helpful with directions and suggestions not a lot of restaurants nearby only we found and it was in another hotel near american embassy and buses,1
2331,the is a little gem of a hotel in a lovely part of the city with easy access to the centre of town if you time from dart train well you be in the heart of temple bar within minutes very easy to get to from the airport i got the aircoach and got off at the ballsbridge hotel stop but you have to use bus stop close to the us embassy for your air coach journey back to the airport just remember to get your leapfrog visitor pass at the airport they do day days and days pass to use on all the public transport in bars and restaurants close by searson is a great bar with a good atmosphere and they do great food as well if you fancy a curry you should try ravi kitchen really friendly staff and fantastic food also for bits a piece you need for your days out there is a tesco metro next to hotel is victorian houses joined together looks fantastic from the outside and they tried to keep as much of the old victorian deco on the inside the rooms are a very good sizes as it is an old victorian building there is no air con i am sure if you asked the might be able to supply with an fan for the room i am only guessing they could supply a fan as the staff were very friendly and super helpful i found there was only spare socket,1
2332,even after a stay in a city of words like dublin my vocabulary stretches to meet the challenge of describing our stay at ariel house we stayed for a total of six days bookending our travels to the west and northwest for family sightseeing the place is attractive and but the uniqueness of ariel house lies in the staff welcoming knowledgeable efficient thoughtful and gracious here management leads by example and the rest of staff is led to provide a hotel guest experience recommendations reservations and luggage handling were all handled with charm and efficiency the provided breakfast is excellent with attentive service in a very pleasant is a quick ride on dart transit to the stops in the center of the city and there are some good eating places in easy walking distance our room was clean and we utilized the drawing room and enjoyed the chance to meet other guests our one suggestion for improvement would be to strengthen the so that it reaches the further rooms we have been many places but ariel house is one of a kind,1
2333,a lovely traditional guest house with a cosy living room serving all day infusions and cakes limited but very helpful staff ariel house is away from downtown bustle in a residential area but only three train stations about one mile away from central dublin no dining after a long day we had to venture out to find dinner in one of the few pubs and restaurants close by which were extremely full,1
2334,expedia online reservation superior twin room at ariel house for received at ariel house in dublin standard and very poor twin room after minutes of talks i got a standard room slightly larger than the first one but not what i had booked the man at the reception was awkward and seemed even rooms are with worn and dirty furniture the curtain was caught with a string only linen and bathroom were clean the next day i got an invoice with the price of euros a lower price than the initial one the invoice was fake because from the expedia took all euros i say again that i will avoid expedia and i suggest you walk around this site for several reasons it is unfriendly it does not work with the speed of others it is limited and it does not give access to reviews which even demonstrates that it is exactly afraid of these reactions,0
2335,this is not just a beautiful hotel this is not just a hotel with charm and tradition this is not just a hotel with a great breakfast this is a hotel that will take care of you for the moment you arrive until you depart thank you brid cecilia and goran i sure that not spelled right thank you for going over and above the general warm welcome thank you for helping our large group out when the coach forgot to pick us up for the airport and thank you for helping me with my daughter and her hospital stay you gave us peace of mind and comfort love this place and those who work here i feel like you are friends,1
2336,my husband and i stayed at ariel house twice in july and were very pleased the beautifully converted victorian building is conveniently located near restaurants laundry and dart station the bedroom was small but well furnished and we had access to a comfortable drawing room for reading and afternoon tea an ample and varied breakfast with table service was provided in an attractive setting what made this hotel truly outstanding though was the extraordinary concierge service anything we needed from advice to ice for a sprained ankle was immediately provided with courtesy but no fuss i have traveled extensively for five decades ariel house tops every other hotel staff experience,1
2337,after reading other reviews we decided that ariel house would be a good place for our night stay upon arrival in ireland it was a bit longer walk into dublin town center than expected about minutes and we are not slow walkers however we enjoyed the stroll on several occasions light outside until pm in june and the quiet stay away from the noise and activity of downtown our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean despite the older bedroom carpet and decor a highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room traditional eggs benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads muffins fruit juice cereals coffee and tea we also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee tea with china cups saucers and mini cake bites there was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at dublin airport we did not use the car while in dublin but did not want to spend time obtaining it before starting our ireland road trip on day there is a steep staircase to reach the front door so do pack light,1
2338,pretty hotel that is an extensively renovated castle very modern rooms with only the entrance being part of the original castle close to airport bus service is within walking distance to catch bus to city center located in residential area with some restaurants within walking distance,1
2340,i went to clontarf castle hotel for afternoon tea was a treat for my friend and me all i can say is wow it was beautiful we were in work this morning and travelled by bus from the city centre perfect location our servers were erika and michelle such professionalism from both girls the setting our table was impeccable the servers were attentive without being intrusive the food was lovely and although it looked like small portions we could actually finish all the desserts we were told that this would be the case but we did believe them however what was left was beautifully packaged and given to us as we left we had purchased a voucher on and even at full price this would be a real treat i would highly recommend,1
2341,after an exhausting and disrupted trip from the usa my wife and i spent our first few nights in ireland at the clontarf castle hotel sans luggage for the first two nights the rebuilt castle part of the hotel was a grand and impressive welcoming venue and the staff were friendly and helpful our room was clean spacious and modern and was in a more recent addition to the rebuilt castle century reconstruction on an ancient site so one does not have the experience of sleeping in a castle room but the room was fine and as soon as you go to breakfast and dinner or have a drink in the bar you are back in the castle and have the enjoyment that comes from being amid a castle ambience based on two dinners at the hotel i would say the food was very good and the portions were ample the art and artifacts that adorned the castle and newer wing are impressive to say the least from a shining suit of armor of course to contemporary labelled artworks there is an impressive array that makes the clontarf castle hotel a most enjoyable venue and although it is not located downtown the hotel is a short cab ride from the heart of old dublin the cathedrals dublin castle and the site of the viking village it was a great place for us to begin our tour of central ireland and we would readily return and yes we were reunited with,1
2342,wonderful stay in the royal suite arden checked us in he was most helpful fahrenheit restaurant for dinner and breakfast was outstanding on all levels food service and ambience thanks to the entire staff for an enjoyable stay,1
2343,we felt like a prince and a princess the staff was very courteous and helpful the property is thoughtfully modernized leaving the old castle where it matters and adding a modern hotel with amenities destroying the experience,1
2344,here for the weekend between paris le tremoille hotel and london the mondrian beautifully appointed rooms charming staff fabulous art collection and terrific breakfast go to the shelburne for the lively bar but stay here,1
2345,the merion hotel in dublin is the absolute nicest place in all of ireland our stay there was a gift from my brother in law i have just finished a year of cancer treatment the staff were the best i have ever experienced the room the food the location were all beyond excellent,1
2346,just back from an amzing experience in the merrion hotel it was a great place to stay the staff were very welcoming the food was lovely and the rooms were tastefully decorated and comfortable,1
2347,my husband and i stayed here in march for one night as a special treat to celebrate his nomination for a teaching award from the moment we pulled up in the car we were made feel special our room was large elegant and spotlessly clean breakfast the next morning was just stunning we could have picked a better hotel to spoil ourselves we will definitely find another reason to return,1
2348,my exact specification was a quiet safe room however i received the opposite twice and a promise of rectifying it by the manager garrett but when i later asked he completely forgot the conversation i recommend anywhere else,0
2349,my second visit to this hotel despite being a little further from the centre than say the westbury it remains a favourite rooms are of a generous size and service is faultless the cellar bar makes a mean cocktail,1
2350,very stylish hotel in the heart of the city of dublin the different attached buildings are a little confusing and distracting rooms very nice and roomy staff was a little mixed up at times which shocked me for a high end hotel,1
2351,where do i begin my husband and i chose to celebrate our wedding here last year and it truly was the best day everything was perfect the team in the merrion made everything so stress free our family and friends still talk about how well they were looked after the service food and professionalism were outstanding thank you for making our day something we will treasure for ever,1
2352,stayed at the merrion for two nights in july this was our second time to the hotel and we were not disappointed the staff maintains a level of excellence that is found in very few hotels always warmly welcomed and professionally looked after our room was lovely and well appointed fabulous bed and linens everything you could think of is provided for you i ca imagine staying anywhere else in dublin,1
2353,from the moment we drew up outside the hotel the staff were very friendly attentive and helpful this extremely well appointed hotel is second to none and perfectly positioned near merrion square and green for access to shopping restaurants etc our room was very quiet overlooking the garden and beautifully decorated this was our first visit to the merrion and is is now our favourite stop in dublin very highly recommended,1
2354,we have returned to the merrion every summer for years and it is far and away our favorite hotel anywhere it is the perfect combination of old world glamour with modern accommodations the best part of our experience is always the people the merrion staff is by far the best we have experienced they are professional welcoming and kind there is not a request they ca handle all in all an amazing experience thank you bernie and crew,1
2355,my sisters and i stayed here recently for the weekend and we were pampered and spoiled by the wonderful staff from start to finish our room was gorgeous i love how the bathrooms at the merrion are so spacious and we received a free bottle of champers upon ate in the cellar bar one night lovely food and fab is one particular aspect of the stay that i would like to highlight because it was the highlight for me i booked into the tetra spa for a fitness massage my therapist was a truly wonderful and gorgeous lady called esther she was incredible and even spent extra time on my massage to get out all my knots she was friendly funny such a beautiful person and a real delight to be i would like to send my thanks to esther for a wonderful experience in the spa and for the lovely little sorbet at the end what a treat the merrion is luxurious it is plush it is in the best location but most of all it is the staff that make the merrion the best place to stay in dublin,1
2356,we stayed here on a couple of occasions attended a wedding and frequented the cellar bar countless times it has never disappointed we stayed once in the old house and once in the garden wing love the old house it character and rooms while the garden wing is modern and spacious if i ever asked to recommend a hotel in dublin it always the merrion excellent rooms excellent service lovely atmosphere am quite partial to their afternoon tea too,1
2357,not only is the merrion a gorgeous hotel in a central dublin location the staff are the most friendly and professional i have ever encountered and i travel frequently no request was too small and every effort was made constantly to ensure guests were treated with royal respect,1
2358,the merrion is in a unique location proximate to just about everything access to the dart is great and up around the bend is some of the nicest dining their concierge could not be more helpful and all the recommendations and advice were spot on,1
2359,from the welcoming bellmen in top hats to the warm front desk staff everyone at the merrion could not be more helpful our room was spacious as was the beautiful marble bathroom with separate bathtub and shower and sinks our bed was ever so comfortable with luxurious linens and down comforter the merrion robes are super fluffy and the slippers were staying at the hotel as part of a theater tour so enjoyed our buffet breakfast every morning in the private wellington room with spectacular high ceilings plaster work and chandeliers i felt like royalty while i enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast if you are visiting dublin the merrion is a must,1
2360,we stayed nights at the merrion was excellent from rooms to attentive staffcould not ask for better experiencemy family and i arrived in the we had rooms and we were able to get into one early to freshen up from redeye flight,1
2361,we finished our trip to ireland with three nights in dublin and happily we stayed at the hotel merrion located in three historic dublin townhouses one of which was the duke of wellington childhood home the hotel is luxurious in an understated way and very charming it location is excellent and the service is first rate we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,1
2362,this hotel is in a category that is hard to find these days you are greeted by white gloved and top hatted bellmen and reception at check in makes sure they accompany you personally to your room the hotel is understated on the outside and this adds to its charm and it is exceptionally classy on the inside blending contemporary and antique decor and furnishings however the art collection is a site to see in itself as there is a special self guided tour you can take with the brochure they have explaining each piece of art while we had a standard room the bed was exceptionally comfortable one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in and the marble bathroom toiletries were top notch the highlight of our stay here was the gourmet dinner at the hotel world famous patrick guillard restaurant,1
2363,this hotel in dublin is a beautiful place the staff could not be friendlier and the location is perfect for sightseeing in dublin the rooms are large and extremely comfortable we will not hesitate to stay here next time we go to dublin one of our favorite cities in the world,1
2364,this was our second trip to ireland and we knew we had to stay at the merrion again the hotel is under renovation and should be awesome when finished there was construction noise during the day but who spends time in a hotel room while in dublin overall we were as pleased with this hotel as we were years ago the beds are comfy the bathroom is large and the cellar bar is cozy with great drinks and staff we also love the fabulous location near great restaurants pubs and public places we will stay agin if we return to ireland,1
2365,hotel definitely five star with service to go with it the bedroom i had was in wonderful taste so calm and cool in a perfect state of repair as was the bathroom with very high quality asprey amenities the room was also a very good size and extremely comfortable the beds were superb quality as was the bed linen i shall return shortly,1
2367,have stayed at the merrion on four different occasions now and every time has been a truly five star experience every thing is smooth from arrival to departure have stayed in different rooms between the garden wing and the main house and although they have been different in size and amenities each have been luxurious with everything you need for a comfortable stay have dined in the cellar restaurant during each stay and have always found the food to be excellent and beautifully presented looking forward to when restaurant is moved to first floor so garden views can be enjoyed while dining the staff are always most pleasant and courteous and attend to your every is one of our most favorite hotels and we ca help going back again and again looking forward to our next stay hopefully soon,1
2368,on a recent trip to ireland we had two occasions to stay at the merrion and found it one of the nicest hotels we ever visited the staff was incredibly helpful the room was well appointed and comfortable the breakfasts were superb and the hotel was well located for walking everywhere we hope to return before too long,1
2369,started staying at the merrion many years ago and make sure that i visit at least once a year just returned from a day trip and not disappointed the staff are excellent from the moment you arrive until departure always great to have a chat with and will go out of their way to far we have only stayed in the garden wing as the view is pleasant at the moment there is building work and some noise from a new wing being developed opposite this wing however you are warned about his when booking and is only weekdays and should be completed later this year did not find this to be a rooms are very well furnished with lovely bathrooms good soundproofing and always great improvements include a new glass passage to the garden wing which has made the drawing rooms quieter and more private and has allowed extension to the terrace the best star hotel in dublin,1
2370,beautiful hotel great staff and excellent rooms could do enough to help us and even managed to extend our stay when the hotel was fully booked the location of the hotel is unbeatable we had a ground floor room but didnt hear any noise from outside next to quiet street the air con unit is individually controlled and worked special note was the complimentary shoe shining service i placed my shoes outside the door at and they had been thoroughly cleaned and shined by the time i woke up at indicative of the great service available,1
2371,this wonderful old hotel is located in the heart of dublin it is a short walk to shopping pubs and quaint restaurants the service at the merrion is almost over the top in terms of quality of staff helpfulness and efficiency our room was very nice and the bedding was magnificent breakfast was good and the drinks in the cellar bar were very well made by highly professional bartenders the desk and bell staffs were especially nice and friendly no request was considered too small or insignificant we very much enjoyed our stay at the merrion,1
2372,not only is the hotel top notch in every way but it is also located in a very central part of the city the square where it is located is one of the most beautiful of the dublin city squares i would highly recommend this hotel,1
2373,relatively unassuming from the outside but a joy to enter lovely traditional decor and artwork first class staff who without exception were a joy a very comfortable and well appointed room and not expensive what more could you ask,1
2374,you ca recognize the hotel from the street it charming centrally located and the first floor makes you feel like you are in a giant living room the staff is amazing the rooms are great the courtyard is so serene and the artwork is among the best in any hotel in the world,1
2375,i agree with a previous poster that this hotel does not respect its affiliation with fhr we arrived at the lobby is simple and beautiful and all the staff were amex platinum we have a guaranteed at noon at we were told there was no room ready we did mind at all said no big deal we have lots to do we are only here one night have to leave early so can we have a quiet room then we trotted off to walk around dublin had a ball on the trinity historic walking tour went to guinness and dinner and back to the hotel exhausted around to be brought to a room on the ground floor where the window is on ground level with a road um this seems like it is going to be a quiet no it is well of course it is ground floor it not a busy street noise and on top of that we were in the middle of a block of rooms of a family who are slamming doors and going into each other rooms and shouting down the hallways until surely management knew we were in their midst not sure what the morning will bring but i still up at feeling frustrated by not insisting on checking in earlier when we were here at the very least i thought our flexibility and cheerfulness would be a mark against us oh well a previous poster mentioned that they do like the amex platinum,0
2376,please take our word for it we have been fortunate to visit many hotels however none compare with the fabulous service professialism and sheer dedication of the staff we invited another couple on this occasion and they were simply astounded with the hotel not one negative comment fabulous rooms wonderful food great bar lovely friendly staff and great breakfast experience always a pleasure to visit,1
2377,the merrion hotel is a true gem the city world class accommodations presented with exceptional service and style a wonderful experience my family and i will certainly make this our dublin home away from home,1
2378,place is awesome do waste your time going anywhere else service is excellent and the staff is very attentive we ate in the excellent cellar bar and used the hotel as a hub for golf travel in the ne part of ireland,1
2379,everything is great about this hotel from the reception to the room service to the bar just perfect bed was so comfortable the shower has great pressure and the location could not have been better plus toners pub is just around the corner,1
2380,i have stayed in four different hotels in dublin around st stephen green that are all in the same price range last week i tried the merrion hotel it is my new favourite of them arrived in the morning and my room was not yet ready however they offered the spa to me to wash up and get ready for the day it was more than adequate they also took my bags and flawlessly had them waiting for me in my room when i got back in the desk service was impeccable the agents were professional efficient and friendly and provided for a terrific experience i did not try the michelin star restaurant but did have breakfast downstairs not bad a bit expensive rooms were large beautiful and classy premises are also elegant and relaxing i ate my takeout dinner in one of the interior courtyards which was very nice i would love to come back to the merrion if i ever bring my family to dublin it will be my hotel of choice i wish i had more time to spend at this hotel and enjoy more of what it has to offer,1
2382,really lovely bar food in cellar bar very well priced and wonderful staff great location for meeting with friends and a wonderful choice of drinks would recommend it for groups as a few lovely alcoveswill be back,1
2383,stayed at the merrion on the recommendation of a colleague who said it was the best hotel he ever stayed at after staying two nights i put in my own top this has a great location excellent staff sumptuous breakfast and overall of the charts experience highly recommend,1
2384,we love to stay at the merrion as it is a home away from home everyone is so welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate your every request it is also a very beautiful hotel the location is perfect with easy access to grafton street the national gallery stephen green and trinity college,1
2385,this world class hotel is an unexpected delight impeccably managed with discrete service and understated elegance the hotel is now undergoing a barely perceptible that is sure to put it in the same league as paris bristol and london connaught sumptuous indoor pool that rivals the pool at the ritz in paris quiet drawing rooms where tour groups mercifully would feel out of place for those accustomed to privilege who value tradition and luxury,1
2386,nothing ostentetios just pure class excellent location service and anything else you should expect to see in the star hotel nice beds excellent tea service and the star michelin restaurant next door,1
2387,outstanding star in city centre of dublin ireland excellent location close to all the important site seeing venues and there is a bank across the street the restaurant is also extremely good very good breakfast and the waitresses are very friendly and efficient,1
2388,we wanted a light lunch and found just the thing in the merrion lobby bar we had the number each which consisted of a small bowl of delicious soup a small assortment of crust less sandwiches and a small chocolate dessert it just hit the spot the surroundings are beautiful with some excellent decor and art just sit and de stress after a days shopping on grafton street,1
2389,we arrived in dublin at the end of a wonderful week holiday in ireland and the merrion was the perfect ending from the smiles and friendliness of the staff the care taken over every detail the simply beautiful accommodation the merrion truly manages to make you feel cosseted and privileged to stay there a real jewel,1
2390,this is a grand hotel in a perfect city location near stephen s green and merrion square this is the elegant part of old dublin and the hotel is understated in the way that only grand dames can be i was here as the guest of a dublin headquartered organization and they actually chose this hotel it was my first stay and i was very impressed i ve stayed at many dublin hotels over the years and i must say this is by far the most charming service style amenities and food are all first rate the hotel itself has won most every category in dublin hotels over the years and i am not surprised i look forward to my return do take some time and a brochure to appreciate the fine art here especially the paul henry landscapes,1
2391,went to the cellar bar for lunch service was exemplary very friendly but professional at the same time the drinks and lunch were delicious following this went for a drink on the terrace outside beautiful setting and a very enjoyable afternoon all in would highly recommend,1
2392,amazing place to stay absolutely gorgeous and the food is amazing very clean place to stay as me and my wife have gone travelling too class and would definitely recommend to friends me and my wife loved it,1
2393,we were welcomed like we were old friends and happy to see service was beyond works all of the help could not be moreupbeat and truly wanted to be helpful in every was lovely in the cellar and we had scones for breakfast in thelibrary the next morning unfortunately we were on our way to a like to have stayed another day or two,1
2395,this is a truly warm wonderful place where the staff are excellent and treat you beautifully the location is excellent for walking around and seeing the sights the food in the restaurant is truly excellent it is like a wine vault i loved the atmosphere very warm and comfortable the food was great and they easily accommodated my vegan diet with a gourmet healthy meal we visited both bars and loved both it seems the parlor bar is open for as long as you would like to stay how great is that but we did stay long just liked knowing we could it is a very traditional place i thought the rooms were very comfortable and traditionally decorated the funny thing i noticed is that if you want to blow dry your hair or curl it in the bathroom it really is possible this is common in england and ireland it seems the only outlet usually only accommodates a man shaver i look forward to going back if you are looking for something hip and happening this may not be the choice for you if you are looking for star everything you will be pleased,1
2396,this was the second time we had stayed at the merrion it was better the second time the staff and service was impeccable our room was great very centrally located next time in dublin we are definitely going to staff here again,1
2397,the merrion hotel is the best hotel in dublin and it deserves this title i look forward to staying there anytime i am in ireland the staff go beyond what is expected for them and they are very genuine in their wishes for you to be completely happy in the hotel i love the food it is beautifully cooked and of top quality the breakfasts are amazing the selection from the buffet if enormous and wonderful as are the cooked items rooms beds and bathrooms are sparkling clean i particularly like the room that looks out to the amazing garden if you are in dublin and appreciate a hotel that is one of the best you can experience then you must stay at the merrion it is one of the leading hotels of the world,1
2398,we enjoyed a wonderful night stay at the merrion hotel the staff was some of the best that we encountered they were top notch we had two connecting rooms for our family of five not exactly an ideal hotel for little kids but our teens enjoyed the luxury of this hotel breakfast at the cellar was fantastic and the excellent service continued beds were very comfortable and rooms were light and airy bathrooms were beautifully appointed and well done in white and grey color scheme one comment that i want to share was that the shower stall was very small and my husband and i are tiny people my other comment was that there was no dresser or shelves to store our clothing which is never a deal breaker for me but just a minor annoyance as it makes unpacking very tricky for two people the courtyard areas are lovely and if the weather cooperates it is perfect to sit outside in the afternoon and have tea or an early cocktail my biggest complaint was that we encountered two different guests who were very rude to the staff at the merrion once upon check in and the other time at breakfast my teens were actually offended by the rudeness of the guests and they claimed that there were too many high maintenance guests at the hotel in both cases the staff handled the situations very well and it is a good reminder that it is never acceptable to be rude,1
2399,this hotel has amazing california beds that made me so blissed out to collapse on each night it honestly the thing i remember about the breakfast and smooth no complaints there the location is just ok it is very convenient for the museums although a bit of a trek to guinness and the came down with something here which made me feel awful the turndown service maid was a godsend i felt bad about it but she was very kind when i was sick the cellar restaurant also kindly sent up our food to our room when i had to rush out of the restaurant and specially made me a plain salad to eat when i could stomach anything else i wish i could have eaten it me from giving it stars the pipes in the toilet are really loud every time we used them it would go on for ages afterwards this made for an unpleasant experience if you had to wake up to go to the the steam room and pool were nice but there is no sauna in the spa also the slippers they give you are very pleasant to walk around in in the we were told we got a room upgrade but i was very impressed our room overlooked the ceiling of the walkway below so almost no view to speak in all a solid and a nice stay in dublin although it did exactly have the factor aside from the beds,1
2400,fantastic hotel in a superb location service cant be falted and food met all expectations atmosphere was lovely perf couples our room eas worth the stay highly recommend no need to go past hotel restaurant,1
2401,this hotel is located across the street from croke park a hurling venue and one of the largest stadiums in europe we stayed over a championship weekend and the area was very busy but it was great to get a taste of what game day is like in dublin and the rooms were clean quiet and comfortable there free parking under the hotel and the service is truly wonderful friendly accommodating and competent,1
2402,as a family we stayed for one night in the croke park hotel as my wife and daughter were attending a cold play concert i must the staff were amazing despite the hotel being crowded with concert goers all staff members were obliging courteous helpful and professional at all room was perfect with a view of the stadium and room had all the amenities that you would would definitely recommend it,1
2403,excellent hotel this was my second stay at the croke park hotel ideal location if you have tickets for an event at the croke park stadium literally on the other side of the road and just a min walk from street i booked a twin room and it was wide clean and comfortable so was the bathroom with both bathtub and staff very friendly and helpful very good breakfast large choice of food for the irish breakfast maybe the choice could be increased a little bit for the continental an excellent hotel which i surely recommend and where i surely return,1
2405,chose the hotel due to its proximity to the croke park stadium where i was attending a concert it ideal for that purpose but would say if you want to stay away from the noise of the city centre this would be ideal as it still within a minute walk to the centre all the staff we encountered where highly professional but friendly and welcoming bed was amazing and i had a pleasant sleep with is rare for me,1
2406,we found the croke to be a very pleasent hotel for staying a few days in dublin we stayed there with our daughter and it was one of the very few hotels that offered a family room for the three of us the breakfast was great and we enjoyed the well equipped fitness room every morning we also appreciated the very knowledgeable concierge who helped us organize our tours in dublin it is located a bit outside of the city center but it only takes you a minutes walk to get there,1
2407,the croke park hotel is outside of the city center of dublin it is about a minute walk to attractions in the city the neighborhood is a mix of residential and small businesses auto repair plumbing and it felt safe during the day and early evening so we walked to and from the hotel each day as far as the hotel itself the rooms were very comfortable and have air conditioning the staff was exemplary and the food on the breakfast buffet was above average the hotel does appear to cater to tour groups there was a tour bus in front of the hotel each night we stayed but there was never any delay at breakfast or at the front desk in spite of this all in all i was extremely pleased with my stay at the croke park hotel,1
2408,staying here at the moment on a busy match day staff in restaurant and lady seating restaurant guests could not be more helpful to us a family with young children i hope management appreciates them other restaurants and hotels in dublin should learn to train their staff in a similar way i would definitely recommend this hotel to families with young children their zoo package is also very good value,1
2409,this is an ideal place to stay very clean friendly staff little extras and attention to detail leave this hotel high on our must return list though close to the city the noise level is low although there was nothing in the stadium the night we stayed free secure car parking for guests is another hotel prices are rising and this hotel is competitive in its call again,1
2410,nice place to stay again no air conditioning we had a very nice room along side the canal this hotel is just across from the stadium we were told that this a very safe area but the women on our tour was to sure of this the hotel is very modern and has everything that you would need,1
2411,seems reasonably new but has an established charm about it directly opposite croke park it might be wise to check if any major events are scheduled before booking here it also a minute walk to the more touristy areas of dublin and the restaurant precinct he rooms a good size they were quiet and there is also free parking and beds were comfortable but the saggy pillows were a disappointment the bathroom was huge with a long deep soaking bath greta after all that walking those not from need to be aware of safety latches on some hot water taps our showers were cool to cold and we could work out why especially as we could have scorchingly hot baths hotel staff were efficient and friendly with the exception of those we encountered at the a latte seemed to take an indication the croke park is similar in both style and price to a mid tier accor properties such as novotel but it has a little more character i stay here again if returning to dublin,1
2412,the croke park hotel undoubtedly would merit a star award the hotel oozes hospitality coupled with excellent quality in all areas including bedrooms restaurant and bar facilities as well as free which most certainly is very rare in dublin from the moment that guests step into the spacious lobby they are cordially greeted with a warm friendly smile from each and every one of the receptionists including the concierge staff we have been guests in the hotel on numerous occasions and thanks to all the staff we have enjoyed many happy stays over the years each time we arrive we are amazed how every member of staff can call us by name in such a friendly manner mr sean reid deputy general manager ensures that he is always on hand to meet and greet all his guests with such warm hospitality even though he is such a busy gentleman in every area of the hotel he always finds the time to have a cosy chat with the hotel guests especially on match days sean is a true dub supporter but it must be said that he is to be admired for the greatest respect that he has for every other county teams supporters his friendly banter with guests from all parts of the world certainly make everyone stay a truly delightful experience with sean we always find ourselves so warmly welcomed in opulent surroundings with such impeccable service and an incredibly luxurious stunning ambience no request large or small is,1
2413,this is a busy hotel because it is across the street from the stadium by the same name the hotel offers family and individual packages to stay during the sporting nice hotel with several areas for extremely comfortable big screen tv in the bar area the breakfast we had was very good with the buffet replenished as needed would definitely stay here again,1
2414,the hotel is just out of dublin downtown a at most minutes walk away from it this is no bad thing since the downtown is very noisy crowded and history apart not really stunning the hotel in contrast is excellent on all fronts friendly and professional staff absolutely clean and quiet lovely food for breakfast and dinner we highly recommend it,1
2415,family of three visiting dublin for the first time enjoyed our stay at the croke park positives included the clean and quiet room huge bathtub and bathroom we had double beds for a year old and two adults superior x doubles front desk staff very helpful and the free parking in a city that charges everywhere for parking was great we found however this location was not so close to too many food options we made a few walks of over minute for dinner deduct time if you have no children and walk at a far pace also proximity to city sights not so close as other hotels but again we felt the quietness and free parking out weighed this feet are good for walking we did not eat at the hotel,1
2416,my stay at the hotel we truly amazing i felt very special and that the hotel cared about me personally the hotel was clean food delicious staff incredibly helpful nice sweet and respectful i felt better then home,1
2417,this is a lovely hotel definitely the nicest one we stayed at during our tour de ireland the rooms are nice and updated and the bathrooms were very spacious i would say quality would be on par with a courtyard which is pretty good for a european hotel our room was on floor which is actually the second floor but it was very quiet even the night after a big match at croke one thing i did love was the location trade off it was a solid minute walk from downtown we timed it one night took to minutes to walk from christ church there not much around the hotel bleecker st cafe is a minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every min or so a can from temple bar costs to euros not a bad trade off for a quiet hotel,1
2418,modern comfortable great room great breakfast located within walking distance to all dublin attractions and great restaurants close to airport service outstanding will stay here again on our next visit to ireland,1
2419,title says it all best hotel out there value for money and staff are so family very made so welcome here and nice location for visiting city always clean and staff and serving staff always give,1
2420,we stayed in the croke park hotel for the coldplay concert which was taking place directly across the road from the hotel was seamless and hassle free on a busy day and the room itself was clean spacious however the area were packed as is understandable on such a busy occasion but there was no separate residents bar that afternoon we had to take a taxi into the city centre to get and in the evening we had to leave the bar area and order room service so that we had somewhere to sit down and have our food drinks it seemed like the hotel was keen to capitalise on the concertgoers but forgot about the guests who were staying in the hotel that i would stay there again but maybe not when events are taking place in the stadium,1
2421,we chose to stay at croke park hotel during our week honeymoon in europe it was the best hotel we stayed out out of all of the hotels this is a hidden gem that deserves a huge spotlight the hotel is literally right in front of the croke park which is an seat stadium where they play gaelic football we booked our stay almost a year in advance and lucky for us the gaelic championship was going on so we had the chance to meet with locals and travelers and get to know them it was an unexpected and awesome experience it is very close to city center about minute walk and very close to other places pubs restaurants tour bus banks the rooms and hotel itself was lovely super clean very spacious even the bathroom was spacious better than average furniture and actually an unusually comfortable bed with extremely nice pillows they had great amenities and more than just the had a lovely breakfast all kinds of pastries breads jams cold cuts cheeses fresh fruits different kinds of coffee yogurt and unlimited toppings like granola dried fruit nuts packaged granola and as a traveler i greatly appreciated the free bottled water it was really thoughtful of the company and hotel to provide this to guests that alone was amazing the staff was excellent when i think of customer service the ladies and gents from croke park were the prime examples and have set the bar very high for other,1
2422,we just stayed the night as a short city break and i chose this hotel from the reviews and the proximity to the city it about min walk from st and mins from temple bar but it far enough outside of the busy centre that it so quiet the hotel itself is fantastic very modern super clean staff were some of the best i had at a hotel and the room was very spacious tidy and not a defect in sight when we return to dublin we will be staying at this hotel again no question both me and my wife both agreed it more of a star than a great work guys,1
2423,the bar is well stocked the restaurant is excellent especially the seafood chowder and the smoked haddock and cod patties for starters were the best i had in all of need to mention how you like your fish cooked as they will bring it out well done i like mine a little rare in the middle the breakfast was abundant the ambiance in bar is is also a club lounge with tea coffee and fruit and continental breakfast on offer with some room types however we chose to eat in the large dining area well worth the extra to be paid the room is spacious and very reasonably priced when i booked i was not aware that were going to play across the road hence the hotel was booked out on one of the nights that we wanted to stay will definately stay at croke park hotel loved it,1
2424,here what we really liked about the hotel the room was comfortable the bed and pillows were comfortable the bathroom was clean and the toiletries the white house were quality the reception staff whilst not warmly welcoming ensured we had the information we needed they ordered our taxis on time the breakfast was excellent i love a hotel that provides great breakfasts and include coffees in the cost rather than an extra i love a breakfast that provides loads of fresh fruit yogurt seeds nuts and crunchy granola my husband went for the cooked bacon eggs tomato and toast option and he was very happy with the options the downside for us was that the hotel is not near the dublin attractions we wanted to see kilmainham gaol the book of kells christ church cathedral temple bar etc we needed a taxi to and from these each time around a cost of euros but thinking about that if we stayed at a hotel where we could walk to these attractions we would have missed all of the lovely and informative chats we had with the dublin taxi drivers all but one who was a of the taxi drivers where friendly and really up for a chat and happy to explain more about the city and about ireland history so when considering your hotel options factor the taxi rides into the cost of the hotel room the croke park is a comfortable hotel to stay in plus you get the bonus,1
2425,we were in town for so rooms all over were at a premium and charged at a premium we were lucky to get the only remaining room at the croke park hotel and given everywhere was expensive were please to fnd that our room gave us access to the executive lounge with free snacks fruit soft drinks tea and coffee available it also meant we had a bar before and after the gig the room was comfortable the mattress wonderful and all the staff unfailingly charming the tv was rather small and the room was soundproofed so we could hear the noise from the courtyard bar below us other than that our only criticism is that the hotel decor and furnishings look rather tired all in all it was a great stay but the hotel could probably do with a little refurbishment,1
2426,took bus from airport to about blocks from hotel hotel very nice very modern and comfortable some distance from the downtown commercial area however so wound up using taxis to get around got a two day bus pass which was very helpful in seeing the sights,1
2427,beautiful hotel with friendly and welcoming staff the breakfast was above and beyond what we expected and we left in the morning with our bellies full to the brim loved this place and will most definitely be returning thank you from the bottom of our hearts,1
2428,we experienced an exceptional high standard of customer care the rooms were clean and have good quality furniture beds mattresses and on suit facilities although the four of us were only staying for a concert we were attending we felt that the hotel worked well for both short brakes and business functions,1
2429,we had an executive room and could fault it check in was seamless and the staff were wonderful unfortunately we only had one night we would have loved more the staff in the bar and in the restaurant were also excellent and the choices on the menu for dinner were very good our room was lovely clean and fresh with a very comfortable bed we would definitely recommend the croke park,1
2430,we spent two nights at croke park and we were very satisfied with our stay we came about our reservations via a travel agency but they were experienced and knew about this particular hotel we had a great stay with no issues whatsoever,1
2431,my husband and i recently stayed in this hotel we were in an executive room for nights used this hotel as a base to do some was very clean and beautiful bed was extremely comfortable food in the bar and in the restaurant was lovely staff all very friendly and courteous hotel very clean have stayed here before and will definitely return,1
2432,i would highly recommend it it like a luxurious home from home staff are really friendly and nothing is too much trouble food is lovely rooms are great location is super it a good central place for friends to gather from many locations,1
2433,great place to stay in the near restaurants and college room was very well appointed with modern conveniences impressive beds were very comfortable in building restaurant was very good parking was complimentary unusual in the city easy access to the airport,1
2434,very good rooms with good size bed and great shower very professional and welcoming staff we he a dinner in the restaurant and food was excellent with very good choices on the menu rooms are very quiet so you can get good night of sleep did not try breakfast as we left very early but definitely will stay again,1
2435,last week i stayed in the croke park hotel from arrival to departure everything was done without fuss small issue with noisy was immediately addressed by a room change special thanks to sandeep and krischna and the front desk sophia for their help during my stay the executive lounge was fantastic and has all you need for a continental breakfast i basically nested there for the day as i had returned from a long haul flight the coffee machine is a little tempermental and may need a service as it was giving trouble stayed in the sam maguire suite for one night as it was a special occasion again krischna and the front desk were very helpful here the bed was extremely comfortable and the toiletries white company were excellent quality it was nice to have the space and also the stadium view which is impressive from this close proximity to the croke park stadium one can only imagine the view immediately outside the colosseum in rome when the roman empire was at its height see gladiator for nearest modern interpretation also on saturday morning we culd hear the soundchecks from coldplay which was for dinner in the sideline bar and service was a little slow as was room service so these are small things to correct i walked into the gym and it looked adequate and smelled fresh so it is being kept only thing missing to make this a must stay as a family hotel is a swimming,1
2436,we did a tour and stayed at a hotel in dublin the first and last nights this hotel was by far better than our other experience in dublin we would definitely stay here again at the front end of tail end of our ireland excursion,1
2437,stayed here for a week whilst working in dublin it about mins taxi ride from the city centre so usually a little cheaper than the large central hotels unless there is a big concert or gaelic football match on at the croke park stadium opposite when they get very busy reasonable cooked breakfast buffet helpful service comfortable room spacious bar not much around in the immediate vicinity so you need to get a taxi if you want to get out for a drink or dinner,1
2439,we wanted a hotel close enough to dublin to explore and to easily get back to the ferry as we only had night here this hotel was perfect rooms are very modern and roomy the white company toiletries are a nice touch we did eat here but had a drink in the bar in the evening the service was quick and the staff very helpful would recommend a stay here and would definitely return,1
2440,went to a concert here last saturday to see coldplay and the place was run exceptionally well the only downside was the cost of beer or wine as they have you inside they can charge what they will but it was very well run and with people leaving was no problem,1
2441,this hotel is in a really convenient location to the airport and downtown the restaurant and pub area served really good meals that were enjoyed by all the halls and common areas are clean and updated the room was very nicely equipped and clean a definite stay,1
2442,we enjoyed our stay the room was very large by european standards typical size about a mile from the city center it if you up for it or you can take a bus or a taxi very busy on game weekends but it did hinder our agenda,1
2443,i was down for a match and i was taken back by how well the staff here treated us nothing was a problem and all our needs were dealt with in a nice mannerly and helpful way rooms were spotless clean food was excellent staff brilliant what more could a guest ask for thank you croke park and my family look forward to staying with you again,1
2444,i was in dublin for a business trip the croke park was convenient as it was just across from the conference center although it s a long hike into the center of dublin for a business trip this hotel is simply great bar and restaurant superb service comfortable beds and convenient amenities and fast reliable wifi all in all a very positive experience,1
2445,we loved our stay here great price staff excellent with the kids lovely room delicious bar food and kids menu very peaceful despite it being full as were playing the next night were able to stay for breakfast as we were booked on the first ferry but we definitely come back,1
2446,peter orla and their staff were the best i have ever dealt with i have stayed at of hotels around the world and they were the best my wife and i have encountered the way this management group was involved in all aspects of the operation made for a remarkable experience,1
2447,arrived on sunday august hotel was buzzing with gaelic fans but hotel staff were so welcoming and friendly the rooms were spotless beds very comfortable we ate in restaurants both nights very reasonably priced meal was absolutely gorgeous as was breakfast both mornings for such a busy weekend in the hotel it was kept immaculately clean it about a min walk away from city centre on site parking is brilliant definitely be making a return visit,1
2448,we stayed to nights at the croke park hotel via a recommendation from a we were attending croke park stadium for our first time and as the name might relay the hotel was ideally situated rooms were of a good size good wifi we only used the restaurant once for our dinner and we were pleased with our mealsstaff could not have been more friendly and only mins walk to the city center,1
2449,being across the street from an arena it normal to expect a lot of loud noise causing lack of sleep although there was a huge tournament in town the room was surprisingly quiet clean good water pressure great breakfast and very friendly staff the only problem i had was my room was ready upon arrival but other than that i would recommend this hotel to families business travelers or anyone just passing through it in a central location and walking distance to shopping and dining,1
2450,from arrival to departure the family had a great stay in the croke park hotel aided by the view of thee croke park for all fans of stay play free car parking was a bonus while bedrooms were comfortable bar areas equally good,1
2451,fantastic hotel the location is the best all the staff always smiling and efficient and great quality of food rooms and service in general they can add a spa to their structure but a nice guinness at their bar also helps to bring relax energy,1
2452,lovely placewe went here for a small celebration after my son graduation we had delicious bar food in very pleasant surroundings the selection of deserts and cocktails were delicious a small problem with one meal was rectified easily all staff were very professional polite and efficient a delightful spot in the middle of a busy city,1
2453,stayed nights and days as it was my birthday on the first had an early flight so was tired and were allowed to check in earlier than a complimentary bottle of wine and birthday treat to the room the next day and stayed in all evening on the second night as i was so tired and the hotel room was so comfortable the food and breakfast was excellent the hotel lounge had a piano which mymusician son was playing and people and myself were enjoying but unfortunately was told to stop playing a more senior person,1
2454,if you are looking for a luxury hotel centrally located in dublin then stay at the westbury was it my favorite hotel in ireland not really while the decor was and service was excellent it lacked some of the charm that i had experienced at the older hotels in ireland it really is a lovely and romantic hotel great location near some good pubs and shopping comfortable room,1
2455,this was my second visit to the westbury this year the location in dublin is perfect in the heart of the city definitely a star location the hotel itself is lovely with super friendly staff in room dining was good nice menu caters for a wide range of tastes breakfast was stars,1
2456,came here for afternoon tea with my wife the food was brilliant the tea vibrant and tasty but above all else the staff were impeccable every single staff member greeted us with a pleasant smile and made us feel like we were dining on cloud the girl serving our table was particularly good service like hers would really makes us want to visit again great customer service like this is a true commodity to any establishment be back for sure,1
2457,had a fabulous afternoon tea with my friends recently we were told it was a hour sitting but we ended up staying a lot longer the atmosphere and staff were just lovely hard to imagine you are in the middle of dublin in there great attention and care even got more scones which were delicious pricy but absolutely well worth it for a special occasion or if you are new to the city,1
2458,stayed on friday and saturday night we had room on the fifth floor which had an amazing view down grafton street the bed was soooo comfy and the pillows were so soft had an amazing nights sleep we used the inroom coffee pod maker which was a great addition the staff were so nice and friendly breakfast was included in our rate and was top class excellent choices especially nice were the little granola pots filled with a fresh fruit puree yogurt and granola on the top yummy had the full irish breakfast which was cooked to perfection poached eggs were amazing filled me up for the whole day the staff were nice too they could not do enough for you the hotel is great for location right next to all the shops designer and non designer walking distance to all the dublin attractions short walk to trinity college which is nice to go people watching and see the old to stay again soon,1
2459,just returned from a stay at the westbury in dublin from the moment we stepped out of the taxi we knew we had chosen the perfect hotel the hotel itself has a contemporary elegance that was unmatched by any other hotel we stayed in on our day vacation the guest rooms are beautifully appointed down to the glassware and the food in both restaurants was extraordinary i can not wait to go back,1
2460,this is a terrific hotel gorgeous lobby and rooms with a location that can not be beat the staff checked us in with warm towels and cold water after a long drive which was an unexpected treat would definitely stay here again and i recommend it highly,1
2461,we had tea time at the westbury it was fabulous elegant and sophisticated great tea selection lovely sandwiches scones and pastries the only thing that threw me off was when the reservations were made we were told there was a dress code and yet we saw people there in shorts and ratty tshirts i not sure why they allowed them in the room dressed like they were pool side i still recommend doing tea time at the westbury and indulging in the surroundings the tea champagne and treats,1
2462,this is a lovely very elegant hotel just off grafton one of the main shopping streets in dublin and close to trinity college the rooms are super comfortable wonderful beds and the breakfast buffet is huge with top quality irish products sausages bacon smoked etc also great bar and separate afternoon tea room in addition to the restaurant,1
2463,been to the westbury hotel few times before and this luxury hotel always appointed rooms with the most confy beds i have ever miss the opportunity to go for their afternoon tea which is an institution in town,1
2465,stayed at the westbury to celebrate our wedding anniversary and while the staff were friendly our room was very disappointing i had stayed at the hotel before and had a lovely room so that what prompted my husband to book it we were visiting family in dublin and my husband booked the hotel as a surprise my husband paid euro a night for a deluxe king room and the room was shappy there were stains on the carpet and chair and the bathroom was outdated with mold on the tub we have stayed at numerous upscale hotels and have never had a room like this we had a view of what looked like ac units and a garbage area and he booked it directly with the hotel the door to the room was directly beside the bed which was awkward when paying these sort of room rates you expect a better experience we had to wait for the room to be ready which was annoying as we went in after normal checkin time sadly i will never stay at the hotel again,0
2466,to the westbury thank you after days up north that were great you somehow topped it all and left us happier than we ever could have expected from the moment we arrived we were greeted with the kind smiles of your welcoming staff never found ourselves with unanswered questions or wanting for anything afternoon tea was a wonderful experience our room was simply amazing comfy bed lovely sitting area wonderful view yet still quiet at night i was disappointed to leave dublin with only half of my must see list accomplished there is only one solution to this problem another visit to ireland and another stay at the westbury look forward to staying with you again in the future,1
2467,stayed here on final night of a minimoon round ireland we were blown away with the hotel the staff and the ambience in the sidecar bar a lovely lady and gentleman waiter brought us beautiful cocktails in a heavenly setting i ca think of a nicer place to sit and imbibe,1
2468,myself and my husband stayed in the westbury for one night over a busy bank holiday week end the receptionist jenny met us on arrival and was very friendly and personable she was very attentative to our needs our concierge was also lovely and did all he could for us we ate in balfes after check in and enjoyed a lovely lunch we had a lovely time overall and soaked up the atmosphere in town we had a very pleasant stay the staff were great the location is a bonus,1
2469,the best place to go when you in dublin the food is delicious and the service is perfect ca recommend enough great selection of restaurants and bars beautiful patio area with blankets when it cold outside lovely selection of good wine plenty of healthy options in menu fresh pastries provided everyday,1
2470,perfect location just off grafton street plenty of restaurants bars and shops around the corner a number of the city monuments and attractions including the temple bar area and trinity college within easy walking distance well equipped helpful and competent staff however rooms and bathrooms on the small side,1
2471,stayed three nights rooms spacious coffee tea maker free safe in room supplied with very nice bathroom products combination room checked daily kept orderly robe and slippers available bottles of water provided everyday staff very helpful out stay included breakfast which included ordering from a menu as well as an excellent buffet very high ratings for this hotel,1
2472,we had a super stay in dublin at the westbury prime location super friendly staff excellent service the room was perfect tidy and clean nice breakfast nice dining and a very nice afternoon tea will return here on our next trip to dublin,1
2473,bonny and i went through ahi travel they did it all for us the tour guide was fantastic the hotel was first class and within walking distance to main attractions great people at the hotel seamed they could not do enough for us,1
2474,this is our stay here absolutely perfect location and amenities comfortable rooms great bfast buffet awesome lobby bar and great restaurants great staff too highly recommend it a bit pricey but well worth it,1
2475,we stayed at the westbury at the end of our itinerary side note the train to galway is inexpensive easy and just a bit longer than driving after small rooms at other hotels the westbury was a nice and luxurious way to end the trip our room was spacious and nicely appointed the staff was helpful and responsive and the friendly bartenders at the bar make outstanding cocktails you can not beat this location a block from grafton but still quiet as a bonus for music nerds like me the hotel is near the statue of phil lynott we will return to the westbury,1
2476,always love to stay at the westbury when in dublin which is fairly often last week was no different just love to sit in the lobby with glass of wine in hand people watching the are all just perfect kudos to a job continuing to be well done,1
2477,great end to our dublin holiday at balfe at the westbury tonight exceptional service from gabriel our waiter who went the extra mile above and beyond our expectations friendly and welcoming perfect we will be back,1
2478,we arrived here after touring ireland for a couple of weeks and it was the perfect place to end our vacation the level of service is like no other upon our early arrival they noticed the ages of our daughters and gave them their own room connecting to ours at no extra charge they basically received a king room to themselves it busy season too so this was an amazing gesture the last few days here have been filled with the same kindness and hospitality i wish i knew the name of the woman who cleans our room she is the sweetest person derek who we spoke with before our morning trip to the book of kells was another stand out in my mind so sweet like he known us forever i could go on and on the location is just perfect near the best shopping and away from that awful temple area trinity college is a short walk as are many of the sites that are popular with visitors there is a pretty little catholic church almost next door where you can go for mass or have a nice breakfast and coffee in absolute peaceful quiet there are of course many great restaurants and the hotel can make reservations at any hard to get into place it simply one of the best sad we have to leave tomorrow,1
2479,beautiful hotel in central service and food for afternoon tea many thanks adriana and shauna attention to details and careful to cater one specific normally not a fan of scones but theirs are delicious very good and relaxing environment no for a special occasion or a little bit of pampering,1
2480,another first class experience at the westbury hotel it is really a staff is extremely helpful and friendly the fresh flowers in the lobby set the hotel is a short walk from the excitement of grafton street pubs restaurants and more the rooms are a little small but very nice i had a great bed plus two very comfortable chairs the desk allowed for work plus it had an american electrical bar was an experience elegant is the only word for it,1
2481,this is the first place we stayed the beginning of a month journey in ireland the we booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early we wanted to be sure we had the room apparently there was a miscue the hotel thought we were a no show well this amazing staff jumped right on it had us in a room in no time they were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way it went uphill from there they recognized us when we were in the lobby asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable we were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our night stay we booked the room through virtuoso we use them or amex platinum program which lists a room upgrade if available upon check in the hotel did have the upgrade the first night but called a day later moved us into a junior suite really lovely each every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel make every effort to make guests feel special joseph is the guest relations manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome rory is the front office manager who we are still talking about wow does he love his job we watched him interacting with guests spending more time with us than he really needed to an affable manager who wants,1
2483,as a huge lover of cocktails i went to the sidecar bar ordered their special the sidecar signature cocktail and really enjoyed staff is very friendly and polite i know iva the waitress and that why i wanted her to make the cocktail a barman cathal helped her make it great and handsome guy i ended up having three glasses and a tray with nuts in front of stars for a reason,1
2484,i booked a deluxe room for my mothers as we entered the hotel the staff set the tone which was one of warmth and sincerity the room was upgraded and checkin was swift the room was large albeit proportionally the bathroom could have been bigger the view was facing the front of the hotel and certainly no noise floor was served with he same flair and certainly you wo leave hungry and the setting in wilde is bright and it is expensive but as long as the hotel hits your expectations and in this case exceeds then it is worth it,1
2485,the westbury has been my home from home for almost five years now and remains my first choice for overnights in dublin centrally located it is convenient for shops restaurants and most business venues alike the rooms are decorated to a high standard although some can be a little small which is to be expected when you are in city centre locations the gallery bar and dining areas all tingle with a magical atmosphere especially during the latter half of the week and there can be few finer places to meet for a drink at the sidecar bar for a touch of gatsby in dublin front of house food beverage and concierge teams are all first class they usually anticipate my needs are prompt courteous and efficient so well done all the only minor downside is that the gym is a little small so if that matters to you plan for another activity like a city walk highly recommended,1
2486,our first visit to the westbury and this will be our hotel of choice in dublin joseph the front desk manager and mary front desk agent went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable our guest room was luxurious and the breakfast room looks over a lovely street which leads to grafton street incredible shopping trinity college and the gaiety theater just a short walk from the hotel fun pubs an dining this hotel is truly in the center of everything,1
2487,very pleasant and friendly staff and great central on top floor unit on roof was noisy at night no facilities which you would expect for this caliber of hotel rooms a bit small,1
2488,the westbury is a grand hotel located in the heart of activity in dublin just a few steps off main pedestrian shopping mall and surrounded by restaurants and pubs rooms are very comfortable and service was excellent,1
2489,their afternoon tea is wonderful and our room was spacious and spotless i sometimes meet people for meetings in the upstairs lounge staff are friendly and seem to respect privacy too,1
2490,stayed here one night for a business trip the service was top notch and the room was nice but not over the top a little small but typical for europe the rooms were clean and well appointed and while i did hear some noise from other rooms it was reasonable the hotel is in a nice restaurant and bar district so you can walk outside and find pretty much any type of food or bar you are interested in i did not get to try any of the food service as my stay was short the price is a bit high but this might be typical for downtown dublin so if price is not a factor this is a nice place to stay,1
2491,comfortable clean close to bars and shopping after sightseeing day this may be a review for dublin or ireland as much as the westbury but we found the irish people to be warmer and friendlier as a whole than perhaps anywhere we traveled must i leave a balanced review the only negative i can come up with is that the breakfast room is small and crowded relative to number of rooms,1
2493,i often pop in here to meet friends for a glass of bubbles the view overlooking grafton street is brilliant although pricey a really lovely treat service is top notch and they have a great selection of drinks,1
2494,the westbury is in an excellent location on grafton street near trinity college upscale and souvenir shops gardens museums and churches the staff food and services are incomparable and the rooms are well appointed and immaculate highly recommend you stay here if you plan on going to dublin we will be back,1
2495,we only stayed one night at the westbury before moving to the intercontinental the location was great the rooms were small but comfortable service was impeccable and staff super friendly not pretentious for a star hotel i have to give it only stars because it way over priced the rooms were really star worthy and aside from the public areas it no different than a nice hilton or marriott property i recommend for the location but honestly how much time can you spend on grafton st,1
2496,we had our lunch in this hotel last july pm after our civil wedding the hotel is gorgeous elegant and the staffs are very friendly especially the fello who is in charge to serve us in the restaurant the restaurant name is wilde the service is fantastic they looked after us really really enjoyed the food very well presented and tasty i had rib eye steak and the best steak ever they gave us a memorable experience and was so fully satisfied and thankful we booked there esp that day we got married,1
2497,stayed at the westbury on the weekend of the concert while understandably busy a couple of relatively minor issues had the potential to cloud our judgement of the hotel amazing service from ashley on the concierge desk and eimar in guest services not only resolved the issues but ensured we return,1
2498,having stayed on a few previous occasions you could certainly get quality for a little lower price point in dublin but location is interaction very good food options in hotel very good extremely enjoyable experiance,1
2499,chose this hotel as is ideally located to be able to walk to croke park there are loads of shops bars and restaurants within minutes no taxis needed as is so central we arrived at our room was ready until which we expected we were able to leave our bags go and have lunch in cafe en seine then do some shopping on return our room was ready we had a queen room excellent facilities hair dryer safe full size mirror nepresso coffee machine kettle toiletries bathrobe and slippers we went to the concert and when we returned housekeeping had been that night and had left more toiletries and chocolates the bed was the most comfortable that we had slept in for a long while for breakfast we had a mixture of continental and full irish both were excellent and the table was cleared away quickly wonderful hotel great location,1
2500,very disappointed with my recent stay at the westbury woke in the morning to find all electricity in the room was not working called reception at who said they would send someone to sort one came before i checked out at not what i would expect for a euro a night room excluding breakfast very poor,0
2501,a great location great to arrive to valet parking very central shops bars restaurants the location is the best part is nice rooms are a little on the small side breakfast of eggs benedict was lovely,1
2502,had a wonderful stay here such a gorgeous hotel with great staff room was fantastic and such a comfy bed the hotel is so close to main shopping area in dublin so no need for getting a taxi food in wilde restaurant is delicious and afternoon tea in the foyer is bliss worth a stay here ca wait to go back,1
2503,the westbury hotel is a luxury hotel in the heart of dublin close to great restaurants pubs and tours the perfect location the beds were comfortable and the service a treat especially the delicious chocolate left on our pillows,1
2504,nothing is too much trouble to the staff in this first class hotel we were attending a concert in the aviva stadium and the staff were happy to provide directions provide details of public transport or arrange a taxi for us the rooms are spacious spotlessly clean and very quiet there is a very friendly atmosphere within the hotel and as stated the staff are always available to assist in any way they can it is slightly expensive but it is an ideal hotel for that special occasion and worth every penny,1
2505,a very special thank you to the staff at the westbury for a fab afternoon tea food was gorgeous and we were treated like royalty all the staff were extremely attentive especially tin who made us feel very welcome i would highly recommend afternoon tea at the westbury for anyone who wants to spend a special afternoon in the city,1
2506,we visited today for afternoon tea got a fabulous table with a view of grafton street the staff were excellent the food and service were fantastic our waitress ecatrina not sure if spelling is correct was professional friendly and efficient she could not have done more for us had young daughter with me and she also loved it the fantastic service star service thank mc hugh,1
2507,this is a very nice hotel with large public spaces and outstanding service staff are exceptionally gracious and go far beyond what is asked for to accommodate guests my room was comfortable but the bathroom needed updating although the heated towel rack was much appreciated in dublin s damp weather there was a tub with rain shower but no separate shower stall so entering and exiting the shower required climbing over a high tub my room had plenty of lighting a large desk and comfortable easy chairs wifi was fast and reliable there is nightly turn down service breakfast was above average with a buffet of fruit yogurt and breads and a variety of egg dishes that were very well prepared however the dining room was unpleasantly crowded at breakfast most of the week because of a large pharmaceutical company floor bedroom had a large window that looked out over rooftops soundproofing from the hallway was good but rooms on lower floors have windows that face directly into other buildings in the back or onto grafton street in the front which is very noisy the hotel is in the city center surrounded by bars and shops this makes for a noisy environment particularly in the front of the hotel which faces down grafton street with its rows of bars and hundreds of patrons standing in the street and drinking throughout the evening you would hear some of this noise if your room faces that street but my room faced the,1
2508,family of thoroughly enjoyed a stay here booked rooms using points i was hilton diamond at time of booking but only gold as of arrival date arrived at hotel approx am rooms were not ready as they were connecting rooms and one of the rooms had a very late checkout for the previous kept us posted as we snoozed the time away in the lobby room was ready at room still was ready as of but staff had offered us the use of a different floor room until was ready this was necessary so we did take the hotel up on the offer the signature doubletree chocolate chip with walnuts cookie tasted a bit different was it a double chocolate dough instead of the usual in the us cookie dough good cookie just not quite the same as i had in the states the staff at front desk were excellent giving us good advice on sites and hop was high quality honeycomb was a great surprise baked goods were very good we received buffet and also ordered from the menu at no location meters off the river liffey and near lots of the action minute walk to halfpenny bridge rooms very well done this is branded as a boutique hotel under the hilton umbrella and that exactly what it felt like in a good way smaller property not a high volume tour bus type were very comfortable as one would expect of a property in this a great stay one,1
2509,the hotel location is perfect for anyone on business or is on holiday it walkable to all major attractions the rooms are large well equipped with everything you would need and are very clean my only gripe would be that the shower was that powerful but if i came back to dublin i would look to stay here again for sure,1
2510,the whole experience at the morrison was most were clean with a modern design theme and we found them very from learning about dublin and seeing the sites we attended a wedding just over the border in co staff darren in particular were most helpful in organising taxi to and from the event and we were told to contact them should we have any problems as it happens everything worked out morrison overlooking the river liffey is in a very good position for seeing all the sites just minutes from street and temple bar and about minutes from grafton are good hop off bus tours on grafton street which allow a flavour of the city and sites,1
2511,we had a great stay here not only was the location fantastic right across the bridge from temple bar but the staff was very helpful and nice in particular we landed very early in the morning from an overseas flight hours prior to being able to check in and they were able to provide us with a freshen up place to shower so we could get started on our day prior to even being able to check in,1
2512,great location nice rooms and good restaurants i stayed here several times and continue to come back to this hotel whenever i in dublin starting to get a little pricey but still good value just be sure to get a room on the upper floors because it can be noisy on the street especially on a weekend,1
2514,started out with a snafu hotel was supposed to have car service meet us at airport but it never came so after waiting over minutes we took a cab to hotel when we got to the desk the chap there asked who arranged for that car and it was him he was quite embarrassed and to make it up to us paid for a cab to a restaurant later in our stay the room on first floor with a view of the river was a bit larger than other rooms and so worth the extra money paid to include breakfast and that was well worth it if you ask for them to make eggs a certain way they accommodated it so that was quite nice for us as americans the biggest drawback was the bathroom the flush for the toilet is a metal bit sticking out of the wall and to push it into the wall for a small person such as myself meant standing and leaning over toilet to push full body weight on thumb and then you got a pretty weak flush so you had to do this multiple times for not a great result and the tub again for a short person was a challenge to get into to take a shower it was up too high and quite a step over and down to reach back to the floor maybe if they have a shower stall in a room that is safer and easier it was,1
2515,we researched a lot of hotels on line and we found the morrison checked all our boxes an easy walk across the bridge over to the temple bar district the morrison is close enough to have fun yet far enough away for a quiet night sleep modern decor is fun and inviting staff was super worth the price,1
2516,stayed at the morrison found it to be very central for shops restaurants and bars the hotel is located very close to bridge and across the river from temple bar it was very clean and modern the staff were all excellent and really helpful especially darren at reception we received cookies on checking in which is apparently a doubletree thing though i stayed at other doubletrees and never received them and they were amazing the breakfasts were also really good would definitely stay at this hotel again when back in dublin,1
2517,the hotel is in a busy part of town but there is no noise insulation so you wo get a full nights sleep very expensive and poor choice in restaurants bath will not fill more than inches and there are no seats in room to relax on,0
2518,my sister and i stayed a night here when visiting dublin to attend a concert in vicar st and were very impressed loved being able to walk out on the quays and temple bar and grafton st just a bridge away lovely room great breakfast and friendly helpful staff very enjoyable night away,1
2519,we wanted to stay at a hotel that was close to the temple bar area but not too close that it would be too loud at night this place was it easy walk to the jameson distillery and all the pubs we wanted to check out close to where the tour buses did their pick up for day tours plus it had air conditioning which was important to us the food at the downstairs restaurant was really good try their fish and chips and the manager really went out of her way to make sure that you have a comfortable stay the only down side was that they seem to be a popular place for wedding receptions and we could hear the guests when they were out at the area but we were exhausted from all the day activities that the noise did not keep us from sleeping i stay here again,1
2520,clean friendly and unobtrusive but efficient service lovely bright room with all amenities and in a great location for town nice presentation of food and drinks i hope i get the chance to stay again,1
2521,i was in dublin visiting family and friends once again the staff looked after me very well i was in a smaller room this time but it was quiet comfortable and everything was great it is close to everything great food bars and good times,1
2522,this hotel is beautiful it is located within walking distance to several restaurants pubs local neighborhoods and attractions the rooms are spacious and well kept they have a wonderful breakfast buffet or you can order from the breakfast menu they do a happy hour in the bar as well the staff was extremely friendly and helpful we would highly recommend this hotel,1
2523,checked in today first time in dublin very well located walking distance to the bars and restaurants nice friendly staff the bar needs extra staff though just one guy trying his that not good minor rang room service for milk carton to make it on its way one hour later nothing i got fed up of waiting and went a restaurant called into front desk to ask them for the milk still waiting on this is a nice hotel ultra clean and well maintained but i got a feeling it under staffed will try the breakfast in a he if i do comment take it as good,1
2524,i often stay at hiltons but not as regularly at doubletree hotels this hotel though was fantastic modern clean very good staff who were helpful and courteous at all times great breakfast an overall thoroughly enjoyable stay,1
2525,location is great right on the river across from key visitor sites staff was friendly and helpful very service oriented hotel is modern and nicely decorated only down side is that it was a little noisy seagulls and street noise i would definitely stay there again,1
2526,it not the first time i was in dublin seen a few hotels already and found the hilton double tree a very good hotel in perfect location with very friendly and helpful go back next time i in dublin,1
2527,beautiful comfortable and well appointed the rooms are generous in size the beds are comfortable and the linens soft the breakfast in the morning is fantastic i love the location right by a pedestrian bridge over the river liffey across from the temple bar area dublin is a great city and the morrison is a perfect place to stay,1
2528,great hotel great location modern room are a bit small for north american standard but with in the standard of the european city a little bit expensive but worthwhile if you want a premium hotel in a premium location,1
2529,overall our experience here with a family of in rooms was great rooms as small as you might expect in a european city but they are nicely decorated with plenty of outlets and lighting etc the staff was amazing particularly when the city experienced a sudden power outage one morning while we were at breakfast it seemed like every staff member ran around the floors of the hotel physically guiding people to stairs and generally offering any and all help that they was buffet style but you could also order additional items from the wait staff food was good and prompt and on our very early departure morning they offered to go bags so you could pack up some food from their buffet to take with has air conditioning which in an unexpectedly warm july was a great relief from our hotels in smaller towns in ireland hotel is a few blocks from a bus stop you can buy tickets at the front desk and walking distance to the temple bar give this if that was an option because i am to think of any complaints other than small rooms with no fridge but that last thing is such an american expectation,1
2530,i would stay here if you are cabbing it in from the airport and you want to be in a lively nightlife are if you want to drive in park and rest i probably pick somewhere else my room was very nice and all of the staff i dealt with were friendly and informative,1
2531,we were in dublin with a travel group and arrived a day early to tour the city the staff was very friendly and willing to help with any questions we had hotel is in a great location to walk and take in the city room was clean and plenty of space for two we would stay here again if we come back to ireland,1
2532,the location while being able to use hilton points was the main incentive for us staying here during a long layover in dublin the location is ideal the hotel is within walking distance of most major attractions including the temple bar area just across the river however because it is just off the main tourist drag the location was quiet we took the bus in and back to the airport and the street stops are within a few blocks of the hotel the room was decorated similar to the photo in a modern style while comfortable and containing all the amenities we needed i found the room somewhat spartan but this did not affect our high opinion of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and provided some ideas for dinner locations outside of the hotel very satisfied with our short stay if we return to spend time in dublin i would plan on staying again,1
2533,we stayed nights in dublin and enjoyed the city the hotel is very nice central and quiet you can walk to the city center and make excursions the river is just nearby and nice for a walk the breakfast is recommended,1
2534,if you want a great leisure or business location in dublin do not hesitate to consider this property for your stay rooms are very modern and comfortable staff was extremely accommodating and the breakfast was outstanding with a choice of buffet or hot breakfast we were able to walk most of dublin and see what we wanted to see including patricks jameson distillery and most of the pubs in tavern bar area we also walked to the train station to see howth and enjoyed a pleasant afternoon by the sea will not stay anywhere else in dublin when we return,1
2535,booked king room with river view a bit pricey very clean and smart imaginative decor but bathroom disappointing shower over bath i would have thought a smart hotel would have made bathrooms as smart as the rest of the clean tidy cleverly decorated and furnished public areas staff equally smart and breakfast a la carte choices such as eggs benedict were best i ever had well done chef,1
2536,my partner and i along with two friends recently enjoyed a day holiday in ireland we started just north of shannon in doolin and then drove south along the coast towards kinsale then we drove north east towards dublin our last stop before heading home to boston we stayed the the morrison by double tree hotel we initially thought it was an older hotel especially by outside however it is quite modern and fully furnished with everything a hotel guest would need we loved it here and will definitely be back,1
2538,fantastic hotel exceptional service great location stylish without being over the favourite hotel in dublin from a wide variety of options a different league from hilton general rooms worth the extra exceptional view of dublin skyline,1
2539,used hilton points to stay at this location room was really nice very clean bathroom was minute walk to the ha penny bridge and across to the main area of walk to trinity college book of kells and grafton street plus the national is a nice place to eat and bar in the hotel but lots of options within a min desk staff very friendly and helpful with questions car parking is at jervis which gets a discount from the hotel and now has a day staff on hand,1
2540,amazing location right in the city centre beautiful view of the river small window in the room and a little noisy are my only complaints food is good considering it ireland so great chefs but not my favorite menu items felt very safe and i was traveling alone,1
2541,stayed here for one night for a work trip great location staff helpful and knowledgeable and then beds weresuper comfy just what you need when away for work one point the air con was not great so the room was hot but if that the only problem your onto a winner definitely stay here again,1
2543,this hotel could be better extraordinary location withing short walking distance of the city centre and yet not in the middle of crowds the rooms are impecably clean and all the staff makes you really feel at home the breaksfast is superb especially by the warm welcome of the staff and the delicious home made style food,1
2544,the staff was friendly and helpful we were not able to have an early check in but they held our luggage while we explored dublin the room was clean and nicely decorated would be nice if the room had a fridge the hotel is in a great location we were able to walk to the temple bar and many other places without having to call a taxi,1
2545,the dublin doubletree morrison was very well located for seeing dublin the staff could not have been more welcoming helpful accommodating they bent over backward to make us feel welcome offering suggestions for sightseeing and simply making sure our stay was superlative the rooms were very nice clean with good beds and good pillows one morning the electricity went out in that section of dublin for a period of time the staff was scurrying around making sure that everyone was safe apologizing profusely for the inconvenience and trying to help as much as possible we were extremely impressed by their actions we were a family of adults and one child age with rooms,1
2546,we wanted a great hotel right along the river liffey and we found it we arrived at from the airport and they graciously let us check into our room right away the room was very modern clean comfortable and you walk out the front door you are right on the street that runs along the river liffey you can walk to the temple bar district easily in a few blocks or hop on the belfast city hop tour bus just right down the street from here we walked to the bus stop boarded a bus to galway for under would definitely stay here again,1
2547,good location friendly staff wonderful breakfast we stayed here for two nights i left my sunglasses behind and they helped mail them to me at my home in the states thank you they arrived today in perfect condition,1
2548,we arrived in dublin at in the morning and the hotel staff was very accommodating they provided a place for us to freshen up and stored our luggage until our room was ready we hit the sightseeing trail and the front desk texted me when our room was ready we returned after lunch and they had put our luggage in our room throughout of three night stay the staff was very interested in our trip and provided very suggestions and directions the location is convenient to everything and the full irish breakfast prepared us to take on the day,1
2549,i have just returned from a two night stay at your wonderful hotel where nothing was a problem to resolve i must mention in particular anne kinsella who looked after us so well and marvin who very kindly walked us to the gaiety in case we got lost the restaurant staff were excellent and all our requests were met i look forward to returning and will be recommending it to all my friends in cork and elsewhere thanks again kay,1
2550,my husband and i spent nights at the brooks hotel in late june i would say this is one of the best locations in dublin for sightseeing without a need for a car on one side of the hotel was a starbucks and the other side was a typical irish pub with great food and friendly staff we walked to most of the sights although several days is needed to see everything the weather was cool and wet but the room was very spacious nicely decorated and comfortable with and a pillow menu it is close to temple bar but far enough away to avoid the met barry the manager who was very friendly and helpful as were all the staff on any future trips to dublin i would certainly stay here again,1
2552,from the moment we entered the hotel we were welcomed by professional and friendly hotel itself is situated in a great central location walking distance to bars and food in the restuarant for evening meal was gorgeous and breakfast was moreish we will be back,1
2553,the best part of our night stay at brooks was the staff rory who helped us with our bags helped us with booking a dinner reservation and was just about the most positive person we met during our week stay in ireland the ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and accommodated our requests the folks who cleaned our room and provided us with extra pillows were so very kind the breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and the location of brooks is perfect for sight seeing,1
2554,the brooks is an excellent star nice sized room comfortable bed all the expected amenities it has a great location we were able to walk to almost anything we wanted to see and do and there were numerous restaurants and pubs right in the area recommend the hairy lemon on the corner one other big plus we arrived about am maybe even earlier of course our room wasn t ready but the brooks has a lovely residents lounge separate from the reception area where we were able to just relax and recover from the flight if you arrive on an overnight flight this small amenity plus the location make the brooks are real winner breakfast was excellent as well,1
2555,we stayed at the brooks for two nights while touring ireland it is centrally located just steps away from george market lots of coffee houses and restaurants as well as attractions like grafton street stephen green and trinity college the rooms and beds are very comfortable and breakfast includes a cold buffet or you can order hot items the staff was very friendly and welcoming highly recommend this hotel and am looking forward to coming back for our last night in dublin,1
2556,brooks location is centrally located with a lovely breakfast included and a great bar too staff is helpful but was a bit surprised that they were friendlier since our trip was filled with so many lovely and friendly people this is a must stay if convenience is important starbucks and a yoga studio and hair salon next door,1
2557,we arrived at the brooks hotel after a hour flight from the states absolutely exhausted and a nice young man at the desk greeted us and informed us of places to visit on the map he gave us he also said there was a lounge downstairs for guests who wanted to take a nap before their room was ready or just to relax my dad wanted some coffee so he asked at the front desk and they brought it down to him on a platter what amazing service we were able to get in around as the young man had put us as a top priority and the room was fantastic and clean the room staff was super friendly and the head maid actually checked on us to make sure we made it to our room okay breakfast was the only part of this trip that could use some work simply because the head of the separate restaurant where breakfast is served is quite stuck up however the restaurant as i said it separate from the hotel so does not take away anything from the hotel great staff who are friendly and always on hand would absolutely stay again we were absolutely spoiled in great hospitality and the rest of our hotels for the rest of our trip in europe had high bars to reach to come close to the brooks hotel,1
2558,this is an amazing hotel with wonderful and friendly staff it is walking distance to the temple bar and other attractions the hop on hop off buses are about a minute walk with many bars restaurants and food stores only minutes away the free breakfast is amazing and the restaurant and bars are very comfortable the bedrooms are very homely with comfortable beds and really quiet for a good nights sleep i highly recommend this hotel and ca wait to go back again one day,1
2559,i am in this hotel on business at least once a month i do always stay but usually conduct meetings in the bar area staff are absolutely outstanding and let face it that what makes a place great they love to see regular clientele and always make me feel welcome to be back at brooks excellent coffee and a varied lunch menu the rooms are super clean they are small but well equipped this is an excellent location for a hotel about a minute walk from grafton street i look forward to my next visit,1
2560,nice hotel quiet and peaceful with good location breakfast was that good but for the coffee you have starbucks next to the hotel wifi worked nicely and you could rely on that during working hours,1
2561,my husband and i stayed at the brooks hotel immediately upon arriving in ireland the hotel was a great welcoming to the beautiful country first and foremost the staff was wonderful and very friendly it was also centrally located to all the main attractions which we loved being able to walk every where one down side to our experience is that our hotel overlooked a roof with a generator so not really what we were hoping for but we did spend much time in the hotel anyways the only thing holding me back from rating stars is that this hotel was a bit overpriced in total my husband and i were in ireland for and a half weeks and this hotel was the most expensive one we stayed in however not the nicest the price may be in large part due to it being in dublin however there were far fancier hotels we stayed in across the country at a better value overall great staff and wonderful location,1
2562,brooks for the quality of hotel is good value we were checked in speedily and the room was a good size and we were asked whether we wanted a quiet room this we did certainly get the room was very classical and well furnished the breakfast was excellent served by attentive and experienced staff in fact many of the staff were with long time service and knew their subject the concierge was full of good ideas and routes the restaurant staff at breakfast were always smiling the front desk were helpful but a little remote and spoke to you as children all other staff were excellent we used the residents lounge for our drinks and it was like a week designed library in a private club and very roomy and comfortable there is a cinema but we never found it except for the picture in the lift when we wanted a taxi the hotel always called friendly and knowledgable drivers we hired a car for our stay in ireland but quickly realised that taxis are better and cheaper the car park across the road was well situated and there is a waive of fee for the hotel but we could never find anyone on duty in the car park the car park is not run by the hotel we would certainly stay at brooks again all the attractions are very close by,1
2563,we stayed here for one night for a long layover in dublin the hotel is pricey but the location and service ca be beat the hotel is within walking distance to almost all the major sites in dublin the rooms are beautiful and clean shower pressure is amazing the reception and wait staff are so very welcoming and helpful quick to offer recommendations for restaurants provide maps and orientation to the area make change etc no request was too big or small for them and all were accommodated with a smile i would absolutely return,1
2564,great location within walking distance to shops restaurants trinity college tourist sites temple bar comfortable rooms though the view of the parking garage is great service is very good lounge on ground floor is a great place to relax in house is restaurant and bar is more than adequate for a quick bite or drink,1
2565,excellent hotel in an excellent central location in dublin professional polite and welcoming staff both on reception and in the dining area very clean room comfortable bed and high standard furnishings probably the best breakfast i have enjoyed in a hotel the full irish breakfast was hearty and set me up for the day,1
2566,travel party of my time in ireland my wife second and my year old son first really enjoyed brooks we drove but found the hotel and car park with only a little difficulty front desk and valets were friendly and helpful room was clean we had a queen bed with a twin bed and had plenty of room for the of us bathroom and its amenities were great only complaint was the shower curtain liked to join you as you cleaned yourself included breakfast of buffet and hot breakfast was very good with great selections the hotel is right in the middle of dublin and makes sightseeing very easy we did a with the green bus team and it worked out very well only caution is that while all the stops are visitable you need to buy tickets in advance maybe a day or more for kilmainham gaol easy walking distance from multiple pubs ssg temple bar trinity dublin castle etc we would stay here again,1
2567,wonderful hotel in a quiet neighborhood yet within walking distance of most attractions great food friendly servers and very accommodating hosts would definitely stay there again has rooms plus lifts,1
2568,stayed here for a few days b b lovely restaurant and bar perfect for a relaxing night cap following an exhausting day of location for exploring by foot historical places of interest around dublin friendly staff and very clean would definitely return and would highly recommend did get around to using their gym and hot tub,1
2569,we loved the location of this hotel just a few minutes walk from temple bar and trinity college and the hop on hop off tour buses the staff are very friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet is tasty and there a lovely resident lounge downstairs with cozy sofas and a fireplace the bed was comfortable and there is even a menu offering different types of pillows we enjoyed the hairy lemon pub and super miss sue awesome fish and chips both of which are literally around the corner from the admittedly minor the website photos are misleading the lobby was darker and had just a couple of armchairs no sofas the classic room was much smaller than it appears in the photo we could barely walk around the showers were less fun because the shower curtain was hung less than inches from the wall a curved shower curtain rod would transform the whole the shower was in a deep bathtub and there was no grab bar on the wall my had difficulty stepping in and out of the tub they tried holding onto the towel rod but found it was already disconnected from the wall apparently previous guests had the same problem and pulled too hard on the towel bar hotel gets the major things right and is a good value i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and to stay here again on our next visit to dublin,1
2570,we recently traveled to ireland for a two week stay and spent nights in the brooks hotel the rooms and bathrooms were a nice size for a city hotel with space for toiletries and luggage all staff were pleasant and helpful especially helping us with information and timing for leaving for the airport for our departure back to the states they were even able to tell us how us customs worked at the dublin airport which was different than my previous trips to the and europe the breakfasts were i lovely great variety and quality i would return,1
2571,we have stayed at the brooks hotel twice so far and feel that it is one of the best places to stay while in dublin the rooms we stayed in a deluxe are decent sized for a european hotel they are also spotless and comfortable the bathroom had a nice tub but i would have preferred a better hair dryer ours was of cheap tube kind attached to the wall it is close to george arcade which was interesting the gaiety theatre is a minute walk away in case you feel the need for an extra layer there is also a good patagonia outlet shop nearby within walking is grafton stephen green and a store good deal on visitor sims to use in your unlocked phone i made a birthday video for a friend and asked many people to say happy birthday to my friend stuck in the states the front desk staff played along and were delightful the chocolate brownie in the bar is worth a stop also,1
2572,this hotel is a stone throw from temple bar and the main bus routes for tours and airport transfers nice clean room comfy bed good shower bit noisy of an evening if you have the window open because of it location but the hotel kindly provide ear plugs for the lighter sleepers amongst us friendly staff good selection at the buffet breakfast nice cocktails in the bar,1
2573,i just want to give a star review simply for the service of your venue i have always been a fan of the morgan but the bar man rui gives exceptional service is extremely friendly and despite it being extremely busy he makes very good cocktails despite the busy athmosphere he always has served us quickly and to be honest makes us want to return to the venue so i feel like he deserves some recognition the venue itself is very classy which we love and the music is always on trend stars from me,1
2574,giving stars because this place is my favourite always top class service and standard whenever myself and my boyfriend visit sexy clean and quirky and right in the centre of everything saw some reviews about noise issues from the street and i must say out of many visits we never had any complaints about noise from outside maybe we got lucky the reception staff are so helpful and welcoming and it so beautiful in the rooms would definitely recommend for couples and gal pals getting away in dublin x,1
2576,this hotel is in the temple bar district i was disappointed with the price of the hotel and the size of the rooms when we first got there i was given an room that was already occupied than was given a room that was so small you could hardly move in it is in the temple bar district it was very noisy at night until am due to the night club in the hotel and clubs on the street the breakfast in the morning was wonderful i would recommend this hotel for the young at heart,0
2577,nice place in dublin david on the door sold us even got all food and drinks reasonably priced and the interior was class food came out quick just like the drinks would go again when we return to dublin,1
2578,staying at morgan made me feel like home amazing place the rooms are nice and with all comforts perfect position but the best thing is the staff at the bar nina was very professional and lovely i will come back for sure thanks,1
2579,as you know from my previous reviews staff are most important to me when visiting a the staff at the morgan and especially a young waiter called david are second to none in my a very hot walking around a packed city centre we decided to drop into the morgan for a bite to eat and a cold glass of food and champagne we delightful but our waiter david was a delight funny charming and very very again to the morgan and we will be back again,1
2580,funky hotel and quirky friendly staff in a great location really enjoyed our stay here with a party of was a breath of fresh air as was marija so helpful rooms small but clean comfortable and had is a really nice boutique hotel with lovely fruendly staff and central to everything in s,1
2581,what a hotel excellent location being at the heart of temple bar next door to the hard rock cafe and a min walk from grafton street the manager was more than friendly and helpful in fact he could have been a better manager greeted with two complimentary cocktails which were amazing food was lovely rooms were perfect with everything you would need the hotel also has an amazingly cosy smoking area which seemed to be where a lot of people chilled out as it has heated sofas and it just lovely the hotel is super busy on a friday and saturday night as it is a popular place for drinks so the vibe is great also very close to many and food places i really ca fault this hotel could have asked for a better stay,1
2582,on a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the morgan for three nights the location of this hotel is excellent for those wishing the fun atmosphere of the temple bar with convenient walking distance and to bus routes to dublin were so tired from our daily excursions that the nightlife noise did not bother us too much and the hotel provided earplugs which were included near the bathroom amenities our room was on the second floor facing the street so with windows opened it was a bit noisy we shut the windows the next night and put on the ac and that solved the noise problem we booked this hotel through tripadvisor which was easy and allowed us to get a better rate we opted for breakfast to be included which offered a great selection of fruit pastries eggs sausage bacon and typical irish breakfast fare breakfast wait staff were great and attentive in fact all staff members were helpful and friendly shout outs to sonia who directed us to a local vendor who helped with our computer issues and to david our personable server at breakfast the morgan is part of the intercontinental hotel properties i would highly recommend this hotel for tourists,1
2583,stayed there for a couple of nights in august during high tourist season and must say that the friendly staff the bright and spaceous rooms made our stay worthwhile also the very convenient location is super however it can get a bit noisy at recommendable,1
2584,my partner and i were very pleased with our upgrade we received at the hotel the morgan was decorated with beautiful and quirky details everywhere which i really liked the location of the hotel in the middle of temple bar was also a wonderful plus we enjoyed a fabulous afternoon and night in dublin i highly recommend the morgan,1
2585,stayed at the morgan august bank holiday weekend the hotel is amazing very chic and stylish our room was great huge bed with floor to ceiling windows which made the room so bright the bar downstairs is very lively during the evenings which suited us fine the staff were absolutely amazing so helpful and friendly they were quick to recognise each time we approached the bar to make sure that we were waiting too long even though it was packed anna was very lovely and tolerated our drunken behaviour she deserves a medal definitely recommend the morgan and ca wait to stay again,1
2586,there was an error with our booking when we checked in and we were both a little confused nothing to do with the hotel though it was an outside booking agent and the staff went above an beyond to make sure it was taken care of we want to especially thank mariya the front desk agent who was amazing and so kind we would definitely come back just because of her excellent service the hotel is also very hip and modern and a fun place to unwind after the busy streets of temple bar start to get too busy could not rec,1
2588,this is a fantastic location and lovely hotel but we arrived at as we had a mad hatter afternoon tea organised i explained that we all had an over night bag with us that we needed to just needed to drop off as we could check in here yet he told me he could take small bags i told home we had stuff planned and we were taking the bags with us eventually he gave us a boardroom but told me we could leave them there all day we picked them up at and he gave us a lot of attitude again half of us got bags and while the other half held a table in the bar where we were buying drinks he told me he could leave the room open we only went to the bar and the other half went back and they got told to hurry up raphelz i think was his name he is a bad first impression all other staff were lovely mad hatter tea party was fantastic and we had dinner in the hotel that night it was great and the were very accommodating to the celiac in our group the rooms were lovely but very warm there was a fan in the table but one of the blades was loose so u could turn it on cos it was soooo loud and u could sleep with it on we also found last tenants boxers behide the curtain as we opened the window,1
2589,hotels decor is modern and stylish the staff are friendly and prices are reasonable did realise the hotel had a nightclub on the ground floor so weekends are rather crazy i called it a night at but the party continues way past and your in the middle of it apart from the noise which can be blocked out by copious amounts of alcohol the hotel is awesome,1
2590,had a fantastic stay here the hotel was plush and had very high standards we ate out mostly but had breakfast and room service and were very happy with quality would have no hesitation in returning or recommending great night life,1
2591,the hotel is located right in the middle of temple bar all the visits can be made walking and you get a plethora of choices in the evening if you want to listen to music in a nice pub the hotel has a very nice design with large cosy and comfortable rooms and good bathrooms wifi is free and quick the breakfast has a good choice and is of good quality warning however if you come during the week end the bar becomes some kind of trendy night club and the whole hotel becomes extremely noisy,1
2592,just come back from a long weekend great hotel ideally situated to get around made to feel welcome and well looked after by the staff would stay at this hotel again next trip to dublin would recommend,1
2593,we were greeted by friendly staff on arrival speedy check in rooms were spacious modern and clean only fault would be the bar prices downstairs were very expensive the atmosphere of the bar at night is amazing great location at the heart of temple bar,1
2594,the rooms themselves are nothing special although well equipped and the beds are very the bar and restaurants are very trendy and busy which makes it a place to stay are very friendly and the place is very is of course ideally placed with a car park just opposite offering a discount rate of euro per night if u stay in the hotel,1
2595,my wife and i spent the first of our european trip at the morgan our cab driver brought us to the morgan straight from the airport we were tired when we arrived and were happy to learn from the front desk person that our room was available for early we brought our pieces of luggage with us onto the lift and went to our room to freshen up the room was very tiny basically enough room for our double bed there was no ac but luckily a fan which would come in handy later the bath was even smaller with a shower so small i almost needed to stand at attention while inside the room did have a closet area and nightstand and a wall mounted tv one other quirk was the power in the room my phone needed charging desperately and i plugged it in mid day and again overnight it only charged from to i thought perhaps something was wrong with my phone but when we picked up a car during our second day and plugged the phone in it charged normally not sure if it was just the room or the whole hotel but that was definitely strange i have seen pictures of other rooms in this hotel that look great so i think we just happened to get stuck with one of their the good news the hotel is located right in bustling temple bar a fun place to be for dinner and nightlife in dublin,0
2596,the hotel is beautiful my mom and i had no idea what to do while i dublin but david saw us reading pamphlets and was incredibly helpful in offering his opinions of where to go and what not to do he the best,1
2597,stayed for a short break in july room was up in the gods and a bit compact and bijou but all looked reasonably fresh a very different approach to the decor which you will either love or hate but we found it comfortable being in temple bar and at the front of the hotel there was a little noise from the streets but a guinness or two soon sorted that out or the ear plugs that were provided could be buffet was okay but juices seemed thin and watery no real passion in the staff and no space from your neighbours who do not always want to speak the reception team were all very helpful and the housekeeping team polite who we spoke would not have an issue going back to stay,1
2598,the staff especially nina on the restaurant floor and josh behind the bar bettered my experience at the hotel as they were extremely friendly and accommodating we felt really welcome in this hotel and would highly recommend as the facility in the hotel make your stay as comfortable as possible,1
2599,we just spent one night here and really enjoyed it found the staff great all round very friendly tapas drinks good quite reasonably priced ate out elsewhere then returned to a fab evening in the bar which was like a nightclub great dj and atmosphere overall really enjoyed ourselves and would hesitate to return at some stage many thanks,1
2600,wanted a change from the usual hilton type hotel and chose the morgan because of ta reviews and location this is a small boutique style hotel with luxe fittings and furnishings however all is not what it seems if you look closely the place is starting to look tired the phone in my room was of the euro variety and the carpet in my bedroom is beginning to look grubby amongst a whole host of small things this place needs a little time and attention spent on it by the owners complete with a new lick of paint otherwise they will kill off what is essentially a lovely funky place to stay oh and one final thing the buffet breakfast needs to improve frequently running out of sausages and bacon an omelette stations would also not go amiss,1
2601,a very cool vibe from this nice hotel bar jazzy music clean modern seating extremely nice staff shout out to nina gorgeous eyes david our favorite irish actor and mark at the bar for delivering excellent drinks and tapas recommendations we would definitively stay here next time steps from the temple bar bustling streets,1
2602,came into the morgan for a quick pint or two the young barman josh was so nice and charming had myself in stitches the whole time i ended up having an extra pint great service great ambience and the decor is outstanding highly recommend,1
2603,david in the bar makes a damn good coffee on top of that he was very engaging and friendly pleasant atmosphere in the bar area music not too loud so conversation over a coffee or beer is great seats are plentiful and comfortable,1
2605,called in for a light meal and cocktails loved the outdoor area and decor food was delicious and david made the experience great for genuine friendly and passionate about his work thanks and will see you on return,1
2607,i stayed at the morgan in april and came back to stay there in june simply because of the amazing treatment received it located smack in the city center amazing restaurants and bars simply stepping outside of the hotel got an upgrade due to overbooking and got the celebrity penthouse it got a huge terrace with camping van up there and is super cosy and got breathtaking views never ever stayed at such an amazing suite the next time i got back i got a regular double room and it was superb comfy beds all rooms have complimentary fruit in them and it fresh and has an almost gothic design highly recommended this place,1
2608,i would have given the this hotel a star rating if not for a few issues improvements the hotel staff on arrival were not particularly friendly although some of the staff were very good i booked a love room directly at least a couple of months in advance but was told it was overbooked and not available we were given a suite instead but this was at the front and was too noisy and no air con and would say the decor was a bit tired this hotel is quiet so if you are looking for something relaxing do go for this the bar is lively until very late and lots of outside noisegood love room is excellent quirky and perfect for a couple location is spot on as everything is within walking distance good toiletries from white company given a discount for the room on the night but i would say they should have contacted me in advance to say there was an issue with the room love rooms at the back of the hotel are air conditioned and much quieter,1
2609,absolutely great spot for cocktails really great bartenders got served by josh great cocktails and such friendly service from staff david was lovely and great craic if only more bars had staff like this in dublin will definitely be back,1
2610,i was in on sunday july your waiter david was one of he most helpful genuine people i ever met so helpful cheerful and definitely made our experience one to remember a trust gentleman and made us smile a trust asset to your team at morgan bar ca wait to come back,1
2611,beautifully decorated comfortable rooms in the perfect location for walking to shops temple bar district restaurants and to tour the town staff was very helpful with providing directions and offering suggestions on what to do and see would recommend this area for families with children as it is in the heart of the bar district but definitely ok for older teens and couples,1
2612,lovely hotel big modern room but small bathroom it was very warm at night ths lack of air con and a busy street outside meant we could not leave the window open as a regular swimmer i found the pool far too warm the warmest i have experianced,1
2613,we enjoyed our one night stay on a saturday night in july the hotel is large and in the newer part of dublin so it lacks some of the charm of a boutique hotel however there are plenty of amenities vending machines with drinks and adapters and a nice large restaurant where we had a nice dinner and enjoyed the very large breakfast buffet not included in our stay no air condition that i could find so the room was a bit stuffy opening the slider helped it is a bit of a walk to the center of town but it is pretty to walk along the river the area is a bit deserted on the weekends but it is nice to get away from the hustle bustle,1
2616,was great service the location was great for my work and as a tourist walked easily to the special services from the reception by a lady called printed for me many things that i needed and got answers to all my room was large and comfort,1
2617,upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and the appearance of the hotel was to very high standards the check in staff were very friendly and eager to help we had arrived far too early for our check in time which we were aware of anyway but they allowed us to leave our bags in a safe room until it was time to come back the hotel is located within about a minute walk from the city centre including countless bars restaurant and shops the room itself we could fault at all everything was clean tidy and very spacious the beds were comfy the bathroom was a nice size and it had everything we the last day of our visit we had a flight that would leave us hanging around for hours so after taking a walk to the shops we went into the hotel bar and took the weight of our feet for a couple of hours to which we were approached by derek who was very friendly and made us feel very welcome with being in the bar absolute pleasure to talk to and chat with the rest of the staff in the bar all seemed hands on and in all the clayton hotel on cardiff lane is definitely somewhere i would recommend someone to stay at it a modern classy hotel with everything you could possibly ask for in a hotel,1
2618,took my mum to see aerosmith for their final tour and found this hotel through we managed to secure a great deal the hotel is very clean and decorated lovely all staff members which we spoke to from reception through to the bar were very welcoming and a meal before the mum had a burger the best burger i have ever tasted and i had the thai curry great value for money and great food with a great was clean and pleasant no complaints if i was to return to dublin would definitely visit this hotel again,1
2619,we stayed here for one night perfect location really nice rooms clean and tidy the hotel staff were really friendly and a big shout out to the bar staff in vertigo bar ryan and ivan brilliant service really looked after us a really great atmosphere i would definitely recommend this bar,1
2620,recently my wife and i spent nights in clayton hotel cardiff lane the location was superb a short walk from the shops on grafton street and with the bord gas theatre next door the staff were friendly and the food was excellent the chicken stir fry was something else no need to go anywhere else to eat in the evening we made full use of the clubvitae leisure facilities well the pool and sauna so we really enjoyed our short break,1
2622,shared a family room with my wife and beds were fine plenty of outlets and decent sized bathroom room was warm but the entire hotel was due to the weather being warm was able to get a fan which helped,1
2623,me and my friend came to dublin for a few days away and we were not disappointed the clayton hotel is in good walking distance to the centre with lots of bars to visit whilst on the way we were dropped off by the airlink which was just across the bridge so it took us mins to get to the hotel with no messing on our last day we sat in the hotel bar and was greeted by derek who was polite and welcoming he told us we could stay and relax until it was time to leave for our flight i would highly recommend this hotel as all the staff were helpful and friendly,1
2624,the hotel was beautiful and the service was superb we were particularly impressed and touched by the personal service provided by guest relations officer derek burke who upon hearing that we wanted some authentic irish scones made it his personal mission to surprise us with them when we were leaving his personal service and attention to our needs were typical of this wonderful hotel we look forward to visiting ireland again soon and we definitely plan to stay at the clayton thank you derek,1
2625,of us stayed at the carlton hotel cardiff lane the hotel is very clean bright and cheerful derek burke and his staff are amazing a pleasure to be around they are so helpful and nothing is to much trouble for them we had the most wonderful time in dublin and at the hotel the food was great morning and evening this hotel is a credit to the city of dublin i ca wait to stay again a lot of hotels do cater for big parties but nothing was to much trouble for the staff here a big thank you to you all,1
2626,very good experience with our children excellent service to give plenty of references for visiting dublin comfortable rooms plenty of space and clean the swimming pool and the gym are perfect for starting an energetic day,1
2627,so made our way to the clayton before our show at the bord gais theatre food and cocktails are the best here my year old show we were beyond got chattin to the lovely derek about our show he was so friendly and the conversation was flowing when he realised we were a year early for our show wicked devastated is an understantment not to mention embarassment thats when derek stepped in and arranged for us to see angela ashes knight in shining armour saved the can not thank him enough,1
2628,derek was so kind to help us when we had a mishap and saved the day he was so kind and sweet enough to help us we had an amazing day thanks to him if it was for him our day would have been ruined thanks derek,1
2630,june june hotel is located in the docklands opposite the bord gais energy theatre do know if it been recently redecorated but everywhere looked and smelt new and fresh i visited dublin quite a few times and this has to be my favourite hotel due to its high standards and about a minute walk into the centre of dublin which was ideal for us as we did have to wait around for buses or taxi and it also means that you away from the hustle bustle during the evening ensuring a nice peaceful sleep after a busy day i found all of the staff to be friendly room was spotlessly clean the beds were very comfortable and there was ample storage room wardrobes etc also enjoyed the breakfast have to agree though with previous reviewers that the only downside was that there was no air conditioning so the room was hot stuffy i return here without up the excellent standards,1
2631,party of stayed at the clayton hotel cardiff lane dublin we had the most amazing time the hotel is really well run very clean excellent food staff are so friendly and helpful nothing is to much trouble the manager derek and brian are wonderful they could do enough for us they made our staff perfect the hotel is perfectly placed for everything you would want to do in dublin we will certainly be going back,1
2632,great hotel in the docklands ideally situated for attending the theatre in gand canal square the convention centre lansdowne road sorry the aviva and the arena short walk into the city centre and also on the direct bus routes to the breakfast each morning buffet style also noted gluten free options and rooms were all very clean and everyone seemed to have pride in the hotel all staff were exceptionally friendly in particular the bar staff during the day at first floor and also the older maitre d at breakfast who all treated our daughter like an floor bar was ok for a few drinks but perhaps the best facility is the large swimming pool sauna and steam rooms never really used these type of facilities on other short holidays previously but made good use of them we go back yes we would,1
2633,we stayed in an executive king room which was a decent size and we appreciated having a mini fridge and small table with chairs staff was responsive and helpful when we could not get the tv to work and some of the lights also when we stopped at the front desk with any questions the bed was comfortable as well we managed to use the fitness center of our mornings before setting out for the days tourist stuff which was nice to be able to only problem we ran into with the hotel was when on our or of nights we had bottled water chocolates and the newspaper appear and we had not had those things the first nights we then checked more info on their website and determined we should have been getting those perks all along we mentioned this when we checked out and had a discussion with the about this and that we expected a reduction to our room rate for those nights we had not had the perks she did take off for nights and gave us a big box of chocolates to take with us and said she would contact us once she had a chance to explore what went wrong and when with the housekeeping staff we never heard anything further from her however we would consider staying here again as it was a comfortable hotel,1
2634,i deal with this hotel on a personal and professional basis i find the staff extremely friendly and welcoming whenever i have an issue i use the clayton hotel for my catering needs and the service i receive is next to none from presentation to delivery i go to club vitae on a daily basis and this is due to the fantastic service i receive especially from the trainer ciaran ryan ciaran is passionate about achieving members fitness goals and always does with a smile and some cheeky wit which makes new members feel at ease especially in his classes he a fantastic asset to the clayton brand and has helped me achieve many of my personal fitness goals,1
2635,i stayed in the clayton on wednesday night with a group of people from wicklow with intellectual disability we were headed to see funny girl in the bord gais theatre the personal attention we received from derek was second to none he sat and chatted to our group and made us feel very welcome and at ease he had two waiters attend to our every need during dinner and gave the lads complimentary chocolate boxes he saw us to the door to wave us off when we were heading to see the show his interaction with our group was so appreciated and made what was a very special evening to our group even more special thank you derek you were wonderful we will definitely be back again aisling geoghegan kare baltinglass,1
2636,this is the first review i ever done but think its well deserved i am a member of the gym club vitae at this hotel and a very happy member the staff is always helpful and friendly and happy to see you i have been training almost all my life in sweden before my move to dublin and just recently decided to have a pt to see the difference in my training and get better results so i have jakub gawor from club vitae as my pt since month and he started by asking me what my goals are and what i wanted to achieve with my training after that he helped me and made a meal plan that i follow and also training with him at the gym he is a great positive and knowledgeable pt that i highly recommend to anyone who want to achieve good results thanks to him i have already seen great results in myself with his program he really understood my goals and motivate me to every time give on each training lesson i highly recommend jakub and the club vitae as your gym in dublin happy member,1
2637,we reserved a table in stir restaurant prior to attending angela ashes in the bord gáis energy theatre there was a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant and the service and food offering was excellent for our main course we had the roast chicken haddock both were delicious see photos attached we ordered eton mess for dessert and it too was divine would definitely recommend will be back,1
2638,the stay was really lovely great facilities and friendly staff breakfast had a wide range to choose from all the vending machine charges are made with your credit card upfront so make sure to have one with you ireland also has different charging plugs so make sure to bring one or you can buy one from the vending desk for,1
2639,our trip to dublin was spectacular and clayton hotel cardiff lane was a sweet addition to our adventure i like to particularly point out alessia at the front desk for going above and beyond in helping me i was heading to the concert on saturday night and alessia was super helpful in helping me print out a hard copy of my ticket we chatted about teaching and the beauty of ireland it rare to meet someone who is so authentically interested in conversing and helping in the service industry it is a stretch to say that when we return to dublin to stay we will choose the clayton due to alessia hospitality all the best dan and rebecca,1
2640,the temperature outside is and there is a tiny window in a room for four if one person takes a shower the room is too warm if two take a shower it a sauna for the rest of the night i have encounter the little window phenomenon throughout ireland but his huge monster of a hotel is hot throughout sleeping happens after he room has cooled down around stick to airbnb most homes and flats have actual portals to the outside air,0
2641,room was clean and quiet the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel is located across the street from a hop on hop off bus that allowed us to get around to most of the major sites very easily the hotel is also located within walking distance of several good restaurants and eating options,1
2642,lovely room and leisure centre staff were very pleasant and we had a nice breakfast we had a very relaxed hotel is within walking distance to lots of sights it is located near bord gais theatre and epic museum,1
2643,great room super location friendly staff can walk almost anywhere in city centre from here lovely breakfast with a big selection of traditional and healthy warm pool great showers,1
2644,this is a large modern hotel with good facilities you can walk to trinity college in a leisurely minutes so it is outside the city centre but within striking distance the theatre opposite means the hotel does a theatre dinner and the bar can be busy before the show starts the reception staff were very nice and got us our room before check in time the breakfast has a healthy option and there is a lot of choices it was busy and i have to say after some donegal home cooking the food was not so great nothing wrong with the quality just it felt like a canteen rather than a restaurant with the food being a bit tired there is an pub close by but like so many in dublin they do not do food after lunch time the room was an executive one which meant something significant i suppose but it was spacious and the bath was big enough for a good soak just watch out for the hot water it was really hot when cranked up to warp was not any water in the room which was a little disappointing overall a nice place with predictable business type accommodation,1
2645,a well run and clean hotel with excellent amenities it was a pleasure to find a hotel with local irish staff whom true to form could not be more helpful room quiet and quality furnishings,1
2646,every aspect of this one night stay was flawless i would happily recommend the reception desk is efficency professional and friendly whilst not being stuff at all the room is well sized with all you would expect in the form of iron and safe in addition to usual coffee making facilities i also had a meal and was really tasty along with great friendly service,1
2647,traveled to dublin for the liverpool fc game in the aviva at the start of august we arrived around and were surprised that our room was ready and we were able to go straight to it we were then surprised to find the rooms were massive then have plenty of free space enough to fit another double bed if they wanted rooms also include a big bathroom although the shower is not as powerful as i would like a refrigerator and tea coffee making facilities free wifi is also included in the room did not eat or use the leisure facilities so i can not comment on bord gais is directly across the road i found that there is not much around the hotel except bars and is a decent walk to street so a bit out of the way aviva stadium is also roughly a walk away location is the only let down i had but it really was a fantastic hotel i would stay here again not problem especially if there was something on in bord gais,1
2648,the experience was wonderful the people are excellent very helpful especially hotel management from derek and brian who always greeted us with kind hospitality and humour which we will always remember about the professionalism and a class service of this beautiful hotel and its staff many kind regards frank agnes david,1
2649,the staff here is the best derek burke went out of his way to make my stay the best it could have been and i could not imagine how he could have improved my stay his friendly attitude kept me entertained the entire trip would fly back just to stay again,1
2650,had such a great time staying at this gorgeous hotel the staff was so welcoming and helpful especially derek who entertained us through diner and drinks the food is great the staff is even better ca wait to stay again,1
2651,spacious room very nice decorated good quality linen comfy in the restaurant super professional the food was delicious many choices is the menu good ambient in the bar nice food there distance to city center right in face of facebook officesthe only suggestion would be to increase maybe the spa staff i mean we been there for nights and it was very difficult to get a free spot for a massage and a manicure it true it was easter time we had a great stay we would definitely come back,1
2652,my partner i stayed at the clayton for one night and could fault a thing the reception checking in was faultless all the staff on reception were extremely helpful and friendly our room was lovely big with a comfy bed nice bathroom good shower the location is great a min walk into the centre along the river the airport bus drops off picks up right outside the hotel as well as the hop on hop on bus does which is ideal we did have a meal in the vertigo bar which was very good although the service was a bit slow it was particularly busy but we still had to wait for over minutes for our food which came within minutes of complaining how long we had to wait but all in all it was no great hardship the breakfast was very good good choice something for everyone nice hot,1
2653,traveled to ireland from canada for a weekend jun arrived in dublin at at hotel by room was booked for plans were in place prior to leave baggage at front and go about our day staff was amazing stated room was ready and that we could put luggage in room stunned when walking into room large clean wonderful front desk guided us to the city centre to begin our day tour finished that and returned for a much needed snooze advice on what to do and where to be friday evening assistance on a bus tour of dublin saturday the most amazing pool in the basement walked along canal and such saturday evening canal days sunday shown a route to take to aviva for the match sunday evening ate at the hotel restaurant sunday after the returning from football travelled home monday simple terrific hotel,1
2654,easily my best hotel stay ever the staff especially derek burke was so welcoming and friendly definitely recommend based on my experience the bar has amazing food and drinks and the rooms are beautiful,1
2655,stayed five nights with my wife during a professional nursing research conference hotel public areas and room very clean and comfortable was a bit hectic with many conference attendees checking in at same time hotel is in docklands area but has restaurants pubs etc within short walk epic museum a short walk property is a good minute walk from city center temple bar area trinity college bed very comfortable restaurants and bar all good but i would rate breakfast buffet as average at best noise level a problem in our room late night guests or i can not compare to other hotels in dublin but i would suggest review of a wide variety of dublin hotels prior to booking to get a sense of other properties,1
2656,my husband and i stayed nights at the clayton cardiff hotel it is a great location on sir john rogerson quay near the theatre walkable to good restaurants the hotel offers a nice restaurant with good breakfast buffet and gourmet dinner options clean rooms good health and fitness center the staff is friendly and responsive i lost an item and honest staff returned it to me promptly,1
2657,my mother and i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel during our visit to dublin the staff is extremely friendly and helpful from the bar supervisor ivan to the ever so helpful customer service director derek burke i would highly recommend it,1
2659,visited dublin for a short family stay to go to an event at the aviva stadium from the moment we walked through the door of the hotel right up until we checked out the staff and facilities were fabulous every member of staff we encountered was polite and courteous and could not have done enough for us nothing was too much hassle even on returning from the stadium along with quite a few other guests quite late in the evening staff were fantastic and very helpful even though evidently very busy our room was spotless and very comfortable food was excellent and lots to choose from i will definitely be returning to clayton cardiff lane on my next visit to dublin my only complaint is i did stay for longer,1
2660,really friendly staff and a wonderful atmosphere at this clayton hotel within walking distance of everything i needed going to the aviva stadium took me minutes heading into town for shopping took mins loved this spot and the food was to be a never mind a i be back,1
2661,located near downtown walking distance to local attractions large comfortable rooms excellent food with a wide selection for breakfast lunch and was a perfect size for our year old daughter not too shallow or too deep,1
2662,i love this club i have been going here for the last months and i cant speak highly enough about it you are always welcomed with a big smile and friendly chat the staff are always on hand to help especially clodagh the pool is the perfect place to relax and unwind,1
2663,we had a lovely relaxing stay at the clayton hotel the staff were very helpful room was lovely very clean and were greeted by complimentary fruit and chocolates in our room breakfast was delicious great variety of food,1
2664,the clayton is in a great location near the river our favorite pubs and restaurants are within minute walk bruxells mc daids keoghs all about minutes friendly staff and management rooms are clean comfortable and spacious would definitely stay here again oh and they have room service,1
2665,i would like to say what a fantastic hotel this is i am a member for the gym for the past or years and i have nothing but god things to say abut the staff and facilities everyone is so welcoming and accommodating especially receptionists sarah and andrada the classes are great and intense and the jacuzi is gym is also great at organising social nights out all year round,1
2666,my family room was grand and accommodating spacious the staff were very helpful and warm the central location was a bonus and within reach my daughter enjoyed the pool whilst i enjoyed the full use of the gym the only downside is the construction next door to the hotel but then the windows shut off the noise,1
2667,really impressed with this city centre hotel walking distance to most city centre attractions reception staff very friendly and informative breakfast only which was delicious and again staff very attentative room was spacious and very clean facilities first class and again staff were great highly recommend staying and will definitely be back,1
2668,while traveling in dublin we stayed here for one night the place was a few blocks from trinity college and about a ten minute walk to temple bar area nice hotel with restaurant and bar located inside clean room and modern hotel,1
2670,i am a member over a year now and my experience what a gym is really staff is always helpful and friendly and always ready to help the gym has a good set up months ago l decided to get a pt to help me achieve my goals so i ask for jakub gaworas hi made me a working plan and also training with him at the gym after a month and a half l saw great results in me with his program i highly recommend jakub and the club vitae to everybody,1
2671,absolutely amazing hotel nothing was too much trouble and got great recommendations from the staff for nights out cocktail bars and restaurant choices also enjoyed a manicure in the spa located within the hotel and could be happier for people going for the nightlife the bar also has great deals for cocktails and they do the trick would return great place,1
2673,the staff was so friendly and the room was lovely it was in the business district but there was still a double decker bus stop for touring the breakfast bffet even satisfied my kids i would recommend the hotel,1
2674,this was my first trip to the clayton hotel and i was very impressed from the moment i walked into the lobby i knew that i was going to have a great stay and i was right the bedroom was on the floor and was stunning comfortable and spacious the beds were comfy and big we ate in the vertigo bar the nights and the food was amazing the breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choices of fruit cereal fry bread juice and toast i had a very enjoyably stay and will definitely be back thanks to all the staff that took care of us from repection to leisure center and all in between especially erika who organized our stay i be back,1
2675,this restaurant is situation in the clayton hotel opposite the bord gais theatre and offers a pre theatre menu that where the conveniences end apart from one efficient waiter the service was slow and disorganised there appeared to be a total lack of communication among the six or seven members of staff who came to our table over the course of almost two hours a group of work colleagues all ladies arrived for our reservation before for a much anticipated evening out this was the third visit for some of the group minutes later the manager noticed that we were still sitting waiting for service and was most apologetic he gave us two bottles of prosecco which were very welcome although given the heat of the room we would also have appreciated the jugs of water we asked for on arrival they arrived at around an hour after arrival we finally got starters and drinks and it was close to an hour and a half by the time we got our main courses at we had to make the decision to cancel the rest of the order and leave for the theatre for those who had decided to skip the starter and enjoy dessert this was a big disappointment the icing on the cake however was when the manager ran out onto the street after us and accused us of not fixing up the bill despite the fact that we had paid his colleague in cash and left a tip,0
2676,the staff at the hotel were very friendly to my children and i along with our friends who were also travelling with us the hotel was booked well in advance and although i was given the disabled room i had requested for my friend this was quickly dealt with my daughter needs to have some medication stored in a fridge and the staff were kind enough to have a mini fridge delivered to my room on the second day to stop me having to constantly run down to reception for it and the food she required for attending the riverdance summer school the restaurant staff were very friendly and my son made friends with the restaurant manager all staff were helpful ensuring our food was cooked correctly and that we were happy with it the club vitae was open to us as guests and the pool although only metres long was adequate for my son to practice his swimming the gym facilities looked good although we did not use them the only gripe i had was when i wanted to book an additional room for the saturday night the room rate quoted was very expensive and i felt they could have taken into account the nights we had already booked and paid for car parking is available at a secure public car park a minute walk away and a discount ticket is available from the hotel reception however like all car parks in dublin it was quite expensive,1
2678,double and single bed in the room pleanty of space to move about tea coffee and kettle iron board bath hair dryer good breakfast very clean most of all good friendly staff all over the hotel,1
2679,had a fantastic time here we were upgraded on arrival by the very welcoming receptionist derek one of the managers was great for welcoming guests recommending restaurants and making sure everyone was looked after will definitely stay here again,1
2681,we based ourselves here for nights during our stay in the city and the although not right in the centre it is only a short walk away check in and out was efficient and without any fuss the family room we occupied was huge with everything you need there including a basic ironing board and iron and making facilities what sold it for us was the quiet and relaxing atmosphere there was very little noise from other guests on our floor room but some from the street to be expected we did eat in the restaurant or use the pool so ca comment but cheap eats are available just around the corner see munchies review parking is available nearby but it is expensive eye wateringly so after unloading the luggage i put the car in the connolly train station car park ok it about half a mile north from the hotel but at per hours it great value and safe on the walk there you see lots of other places to eat and even nearer in the square off misery street behind the bord gais theatre are more restaurants and cafes the clayton is a comfortable modern hotel and we would be happy to stay again,1
2682,we recently revisited this superb hotel which is just a minute walk to grafton check in was simple and having a car park was great our room was very spacious and comfortable the breakfast was very plentiful and the service was excellent i highly recommend this hotel and i look forward to returning here,1
2683,quiet understated superbly located lodging with warm and gracious staff the perfect dawn reception following a flight a short walk across the canal to parks aka squares shopping and trinity college just lovely,1
2684,my wife and i are enjoying our stay at the mespil the rooms are clean and well kept breakfast was quite good offering a really nice variety of hot and cold items the equipment in the gym was new and well maintained also a very reasonable walk min or so to city centre there are good restaurants right around the hotel too thanks,1
2685,i lived in the baggot st area years ago so when i came back i wanted somewhere close to the city centre where my wife and i could get to by walking the mespil is the perfect place to stay in a lovely part of dublin the hotel is clean spacious very central and has very friendly staff the free parking is a real bonus but breakfast is a little pricy so we got coffee and a breakfast roll nearby for a lot less overall it a lovely hotel and is recommended for a stay in dublin for night or more,1
2686,arrived after a cramped cold trans atlantic flight to be warmly greeted and told our room was available at am excellent staff quiet well appointed rooms and a lovely walkable neighborhood with a wide range of restaurants pubs and parks within walking distance of stephens green city centre and trinity college highly recommend and will stay here again,1
2688,lovely hotel has been updated lately lovely furnishings bright and spacious rooms clean and was efficient breakfast is buffet coffee and toast served breakfast area is bright and staff are friendly and helpful would definitely very good location for dublin perhaps only could be parking we been lucky every time we stayed early afternoon to get parking at back of hotel however not sure if there is a lot of parking in this car park or if you would have to pay for parking,1
2689,mespil proved to be a nice hotel while on our trafalgar tour we have nothing to fault with mespil rooms were comfortable clean and our breakfasts were tasty the location is ok to downtown dublin we do mind walking so the minute trek to temple bar was bad a working canal is between the hotel and the city,1
2690,lovely hotel in good location staff were very friendly and helpful room was a good size and breakfast good the only negative was the fact that there is no air conditioning in the room and it was very hot once the sun came up in the mornings our room was also very noisy each morning with bin lorries just below we had to have the windows open due to heat,1
2691,really nice place near the grand canal welcoming staff team and good dinner my room was nice and quiet but odd as it had beds nice breakfast also would recommend good for business or leisure did get chance to try the gym,1
2692,for visiting golfers this hotel is very good parking for hired car close to pubs and shops service friendly staff and extremely helpful reception warning tucker after,1
2693,nicely presented hotel near to a canal comfortable rooms very clean nice walk in shower mins walk to the bord gais energy theatre and mins to the national gallery food in the bar was ok not great breakfast was good but not exactly staff were very pleasant easy to park one of the better hotels i have stayed at in dublin,1
2694,triple family room very spacious three full single beds which is a treat as many hotels provide a sofa bed for the third guest very clean good quiet nights rest left hotel too early to have breakfast in a quiet area with plenty of choice to eat and relax,1
2695,i stayed in june for a week while on business great place very clean and the staff were really lovely and helpful i would recommend but be aware no air conditioning in rooms only a fan which i am sure is ok bit we were there when it has really hot breakfast had alot of options and very good,1
2697,stayed here recently with friends hotel is much bigger than expected and the rooms were spacious enough although not overly plush the bar area was however beautifully decorated and was extremely easy to relax in the guinness was perfect and the staff were attentive located a short taxi ride costing about euro from the city centre i can recommend this hotel as a place to explore dublin,1
2698,hotel had large rooms with good sized bathrooms there was no but hotel provided fans and the nights were cool for sleeping their web site says they are air conditioning some rooms but when i asked i was told that this is not happening as yet it was unusually warm when we were there was very good and the staff friendly and helpful were only about from some of the downtown sites and they give you a map which is easy to follow,1
2699,it a beautiful location right on the canal and close to downtown but not too close the staff were very courteous and efficient we got to ireland quite early after a long flight from canada and the young man at the front desk had the housekeeping staff get our room ready within an hour despite the fact that we showed up about hours before they also helped us figure out just which bus to take to get downtown the room was comfortable and clean and there are several lovely dinner places within walking distance from the hotel if i ever make it to dublin again i would absolutely stay here again,1
2700,wife and i stayed here three nights the room was spacious and the bathroom was large as well great location right next to the canal with walking trails service was also exceptional free access to business center was great for us to print tickets to attractions and boarding passes the hotel also set up our taxi ride to the airport for a flat rate of euros if i ever back in dublin i stay here again,1
2701,location is excellent as the luas stop is directly outside the door the hotel is just off st ideal for shopping sight seeing or business the hotel is in existence since and retains many of its old world qualities its an ideal central location for social or business meetings the double room was quiet and peaceful with a good shower and tea making facilities the bar food was very good and good value a most enjoyable stay,1
2703,wynn hotel never fails to please this historic hotel is steeped in irish history yet the updated rooms are very comfortable the breakfast which was unremarkable before has been revamped to a delicious spread the fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious the staff remember us from visit to visit and it certainly feels like a home away form home a safe comfortable gracious place to stay in dublin,1
2704,we recently stayed at the wynn hotel and we were very pleased the staff was very helpful and friendly our room was clean and comfortable the free breakfast was delicious and there was lots to choose both hot and cold items were available,1
2705,from the moment we entered this grand old building we were welcomed efficiently by the reception staff the breakfast was star in a beautiful dining area the room was small and had a musky smell i think due to the age the location was perfect in walking distance to everywhere which you need as the traffic in the city was pretty hectic however tram stop right out front i would definitely stay again,1
2706,a very nice hotel comfortable beds are important to us and the bed was wonderful they even had king size bed for us we had to arrange for this ahead the location is prime centrally located close to what we wanted to experience in dublin i would highly recommend jurys inn it was a great stay,1
2707,great location warm room needed bathroom amenities and bar area was nice to relax in after a busy day in the city we did care for our room location because it overlooked the dumpster of the apartments nearby,1
2708,love staying here when i visit dublin great staff comfortable hotel rooms and great location i did notice that toiletries were very sparce this time shampoo and soap but call to reception if you need shower caps surely cut backs should result in lower prices not so i afraid breakfast has improved i think fresh bread and hot food even for latecomers what really disappointed me this time was the bar food we were in a hurry and just asked for sandwich and some chicken wings the sandwich was smothered with mustard and arrived in a box with no garnish whatsoever the chicken wings were inedible i afraid no taste at all so pale i wondered if they were cooked right through the batter they used had no seasoning and tasted of taste on chicken either blue cheese dip was not pleasant very expensive too not a very good impression for our tourists really ought to step up and offer a bit more great hotel otherwise,1
2709,we really enjoyed our visit here pros include cleanliness comfort and convenient location near many attractions and hop on hop off tours we also liked that we could buy bottled can water for our day at the front desk cons include the cost of parking the rental car in the nearby lot view of the alley from some rooms,1
2710,the hotel was recommended by a friend and confirmed all we expected the location is wonderfull opposite christchurch cathedral and within walking distance of most of the main attractions of dublin the staff was friendly throughout the room spacious and very clean the breakfast plentiful and of excellent quality a strong recommendation if you want to stay in the centre of dublin,1
2712,hotel well situated in the heart of dublin and close to the nightlife of temple bar i found the hotel itself to be a little tired with signs of wear tear in some of the public areas having said that the bedroom was more then adequate with a good selection of both hot cold food for breakfast and hotel itself was very clean large tight car park to the rear which if staying at the hotel you get a discount on the cost,1
2713,this hotel was adequate for a one night stop on a recent visit to dublin apart from a great location there are limited amenities throughout although my room was a bit small it was clean with a comfortable bed and free wifi,1
2714,the hotel is in a great location close to the buzzing temple bar area walking to the main attractions such as trinity college grafton street street etc was easy from the were very friendly and helpful with all our questions the hotel is across from the christchurch cathedral which is beautiful view from the rooms at the from of the hotel breakfast was plentiful with a lot of choices and perfect to start the day i would definitely stay here again and i would recommend this hotel if you come to dublin,1
2715,i can not in good faith recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the area our room was dirty the floor was not vacuumed so there was hair all over the floor there were stains on the wall our bathroom was dirty moldy and a moldy shower curtain,0
2716,we have now visited many different jury inns throughout the uk and our stay in dublin at the christchurch site was just what we expected it to be from the efficient signing in process through to cleanliness of the room the politeness of staff through to an excellent choice at the breakfast bar everything was just as we would have wanted it to be the hotel is close to many main visitor attractions and is but a short walk down to the main shopping streets and even closer to the evening entertainment a great place to stay to enjoy the people and sights of dublin,1
2719,we stayed here our last night of our night trip to ireland and wished we had stayed here more nights convenient location easy parking comfortable beds clean rooms and bathrooms and friendly helpful staff,1
2720,stay at this hotel if you need a clean room in a good location but it does offer much else great location next to christ church dublinia museum and temple bar area near hop bus stops hotel had a very limited area aside from bar and restaurant breakfast was good but food quality in restaurant for dinner was poor no fitness center staff was not very friendly and most seemed like they did like their job rooms were standard and clean overall we just did find the hotel very inviting and comfortable as a family we just did want to hang out there,0
2721,our family stayed here for two nights at the tail end of a trip around ireland it was exactly as described rooms are clean and modern the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the location ca be beat directly across from christchurch cathedral walking distance to temple bar trinity college and many tourist areas the room was small but comfortable we did not eat in the restaurant or bar except for the included breakfast which was fresh and convenient we would stay here again,1
2722,arrived to find that executive rooms which were booked were unavailable but were offered two double rooms at a discount and included breakfast in the deal one of rooms was unavailable for at least half an hour but this did not prove to be a problem an hour in the bar with the amount of time spent in the rooms it was a win win deal would highly recommend this hotel,1
2723,great service from the front desk we arrived very early in the morning after being awake all night and we were checked in right away our room overlooked christchurch cathedral this hotel is in a great location to walk almost everywhere in dublin the only thing i would mention is that although we were three booked into the room we were given towels for two on more than one night and had to chase down an extra set otherwise we were very pleased,1
2724,our room was not ready when we arrived dublin so we went out lunch pubs dinner and more pubs we walked everywherel we did not check in until we over slept and ended up checking out late at reception was very understanding and courteous ask for a room with a view christ church is across the street,1
2725,we had a lovely day stay at dublin jury inn christchurch my boyfriend and i wanted to book a nice trip away for new year to have a special closure for and beginning for hotel is very if you do mind a little the hotel is within walking distance of the temple bar street with the famous temple bar guinness storehouse kilmainham goal penny bridge etc the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything you to my opinion they offer real comfort with an ironing service we had a room with a view towards the christenchurch which was a big pro only thing i missed was a little mini bar i do want to point out that most hotels who provide breakfast have a small offer but here it was a big breakfast with a lot of variety and normally i do speak very highly about breakfast because i do love my breakfast and it not easily to please me with that but this one just ticked all the boxes everything is also very clean and hygienic furthermore i also would definitely recommend to visit bar and elephant castle restaurant bar is a perfect typical irish pub with live typical irish dancing and they have a food buffet bar with great food and a variety of beers available i had the best chicken wings at elephant castle ever never ever did i have such good wings try them both out i ca stress enough about,1
2726,i would definately recommend this hotel myself and three cousins stayed there and we were very impressed for the money we paid clean room cleaning staff were lovely and friendly and alway wanting to please how can you not leave them a little something breakfast fantastic and looked after my coleiac need well i would always go back for the right price also wel positioned for seeing the sights and experiencing the culture,1
2727,my husband and i stayed here last night july while attending a concert in the iveagh gardens check in and out was friendly and efficient the hotel foyer is very pleasant and the fruit infused water is a lovely touch it really well situated as a base to see dublin and close to some lovely bars and restaurants our room was clean and relatively quiet for city centre we were very happy with our stay and we would definitely use this hotel again,1
2728,this was my first visit to dublin and my first stay at a jurys inn hotel the location was great for us it was a short walk from the christchurch location to trinity college stephen green patrick cathedral and the temple bar the guinness storehouse was less than a mile away we enjoyed dinner at the steak restaurant across the street from the thought the jurys inns was a great value it appeared that most of the guests were like us holiday travelers the room was clean and comfortable but modest in size the breakfast buffet had a variety of hot and cold offerings all of good quality and well presented i was especially pleased with the attentiveness of the staff in helping solve a problem that had arisen during the stay they were helpful with a genuine customer focus i was favorably impressed,1
2729,this hotel was clean the staff was friendly and it was central to all the restaurants and entertainment areas the view out of my window was stunning of christ church cathedral i really did want for anything,1
2730,great spot in dublin in the middle of temple bar and the guinness factory all within walking distance clean staff is very friendly tub is a bit high for older folks give or take fabulous,1
2731,we had the executive rooms on the rooms were not big but were adequate and clean the beds and bedding were comfy our rooms were facing the street so i was worried about noise but we were high up enough that it was not a problem the church bells opposite the hotel however do ring but it did not bother us breakfast was great a full buffet irish breakfast with lots of healthy options fruit smoothies and porridge too the only issue was lack of air conditioning as dublin was unusually hot during our would book again,1
2732,friendly efficient clean great breakfasts good location close to temple bar area guinness storeroom and city attractions cultural experiences the restaurant menu looked good and was competitively priced,1
2733,great location for walking around staff was wonderful rooms are spacious and clean if booking in summer be aware there is no ac they do have fans and the windows open so did get too warm however we had a room facing christchurch and with the window is open we heard the church bells all night i highly recommend the hotel but if booking for the summer i recommend a room not facing the church,1
2734,on a trip with my mom and sisters and we stayed here for nights because of the location and good reviews staff were friendly breakfast was good rooms were clean though a bit small price was good and the location really was fantastic walking distance to temple bar and other touristy areas and bus stops right outside the hotel my room had views of christchurch which was just lovely though a bit noisy at night from cars and people in the streets with a very clean room updated bathroom and a nice breeze through our window we were very comfortable the others in our group were in a triple but they felt very squished and thought their room was a bit stuffy overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel,1
2735,arrived to the hotel and there was some confusion with our reservation a quick phone call and it was cleared up the registration staff was attentive and helpful to get us checked in got to our romm and we wwere hotel is close to a lot of attractions and historic sites walking distance to trinity college where the book of kels is housed and the brazen head ireland oldest pub was helpful in directing us which way to go and about how long it would take and after your walks upon return to the hotel there was a fruit flavored water dispenser which tasted awesome to quench your was a great place to stay in dublin,1
2736,i am very proud of my experience in jury inn dublin i never stay in hotels and my interactions here were exceptional thank you to the staff for making it extra special for me cheers slainte thanks,1
2737,we stayed at jury inn dublin recently the room was excellent clean and very comfortable breakfast was good although we followed the traffic light system but still managed to go when the restaurant was extremely busy and the food needed replenishing so a bit of a wait food and service in the bar area was great the staff at reception were friendly and efficient this hotel was good value for money and is in a very convenient location for a walk around dublin city centre,1
2738,perfect hotel even for person in person room quiet room great and friendly staff great location maybe a little bit too full breakfast room and maybe a little too soft pillow on bed terrible we been many times in so called star hotels but i think this star hotel is one of the best where we have ever been we are absolutely coming again,1
2739,beautiful place and good service good stuff nice room beautiful unbelievable view from the windows very good location near some minutes from the center of dublinnear christian church and dublinia and other famous places,1
2740,service was excellent great location plenty to see and do people were very friendly and happy to help i would stay there again and recommend to friends and family traveling to dublin room was very clean,1
2741,we love this hotel its quietness its closeness to historicl buildings its cleanliness its modernity the room was amazing the view the comfort very cosy clean so was the bathroom the staff was very lovely we felt at home,1
2742,great location good service hotel clean and very comfortable beds but room hot only had a fan and window restrictors on windows provided hardley ventilation next time i would book some other hotel with air con,1
2743,excellent facility and helpful front desk staff great breakfast location for buses taxis restaurants near dublin castle smock alley theater the cathedral bells are frequent ask of a room that does face the bell tower,1
2744,this hotel has one of the best locations in dublin we could walk almost anywhere or easily get on public transportation for more distant locations we also had a car and this hotel has one of the easiest parking places in all of europe yes we have driven all over with sometimes disastrous results they also had a fabulous cleaning crew that respected our privacy while keeping our room very clean and unlike most breakfast places they offered link sausages i practically teared up upon seeing them having been touring for almost a month and seeing only european bacon which is nothing like american bacon there were also plenty of healthy choices the room had everything we needed except wash cloths and a fridge dang americans need a fridge the desk was sometimes overwhelmed and so no one called me when my laundry came back i had been told it would be back at waited until went to the desk and they produced it from a backroom immediately oh i almost forgot our room had an amazing view of christchurch see pic,1
2746,my family i stayed here twice on our recent trip both times they were very accommodating to our elderly member and helpful to us all we had to arrange the rooms between in our party the staff was helpful in accommodating us all the location is very close to the hop off buses as well as the public bus walkable to most major sites in dublin city center directly across the street from christchurch,1
2747,friendly helpful staff great central location with most dublin attractions in walking distance or taxis outside and bus stops close by including airport bus clean functional rooms value for money excellent breakfast would definitely recommend,1
2748,a very clean hotel with friendly helpful staff and excellent attention to even free waters and candy in the fridge the location was perfect for touring the city by foot or bus recommend adding the optional breakfast buffet it was very good,1
2749,nice hotel in a good location rooms are basic but that all you need for a weekend away the breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice dublin itself is sooo expensive a round of drinks for was around,1
2750,this was a really great location it is only a block away from the airlink dropoff and pick up point and perfect for taking the public transportation we had the top floor quad room and were really surprised that we got free bottled waters sparkling and non and a whole bunch of flavored walker shortbread cookies i did not know that they even came in other flavors kitkats and some killer hot chocolate sean at the front desk was super nice and showed me where the sites are on the map and was patient with me when i realized i did need the breakfast on all of the days of our stay the breakfast was really good though i was able to sleep very well as we were far enough away from the madness of temple bar the bells of christchurch were really awesome too my only gripe is no ac so we opened the windows,1
2751,although the hotel needs a little refreshing its location near christchurch cathedral puts it near most of the major attractions in dublin the hotel is very clean and comfortable the breakfast buffet was wonderful a great way to start the day but the thing that really made the stay a great one was the staff they were very helpful and accommodating loved my stay there,1
2752,stayed one night while visiting for a concert hotel is well located for the temple bar area friendly front of house are quiet clean and tidy nothing to stand out as exceptional or worth the price asked though room was average size nice bathroom plenty of tea and coffee comfy bed did eat at the hotel so ca comment on the food bar was good good in all just average for the price charged,1
2753,the hotel is located on several bus routes so it easy to get around the city the staff are friendly and helpful the rooms are very comfortable and pleasant the hotel is located near the temple area there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby would recommend,1
2754,took the kids to the panto at the olympia this was the perfect location everything was fine staff was fine family room plenty of space however the family room stunk and my wife found an old sock at the foot of the bed the bathroom however was so smelly did even bother with a shower before we went home we took it to the managements attention they did offer us a different room but would never have fit the of us,0
2755,stayed here for nights days and we could fault any part of the hotel from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out every staff member was polite courteous and very friendly the receptionist sharzazz in particular was very good at her job and nothing was too much trouble for her she was very happy and friendly but also professional at the same time she clearly knows the hotel industry inside out the hotel itself was great room was clean and tidy and towels were changed every day breakfast is a buffet with all the usual cereals fried food continentals etc we did eat in the restaurant so canny comment on that the hotel bar was priced reasonably compared to the pubs and bars in the city centre a pint of guinness was from memory one thing i thought was a nice touch was vending machines on each floor perfect for those midnight snacks we definitely stay at this hotel if we ever visit dublin again,1
2759,the price was reasonable when considering it in the down town area the rooms were clean and well maintained the staff at the front counter breakfast area and house keeping were all definitely return when back in ireland,1
2760,the location of the hôtel is perfect just between temple bar and the guinness storehouse however you must try to speak an other language for the the foreign tourists the real issue is the food at the kitchen expensive and not good,1
2761,we loved staying here our view of christchurch was amazing and we loved hearing the bells it in an area where you can walk to bars attractions and shopping there are also plenty of restaurants we also felt safe in this location the staff is very friendly and helpful i loved the fresh herb and fruit water they had out daily as a welcome,1
2762,this hotel is in the best location once we arrived from the airport by bus we could walk anywhere in a relatively short time plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from too the room was clean with nice view of a little garden staff was friendly and breakfast was terrific they even made me my breakfast in the kitchen since i have celiac disease and was concerned about cross contamination at the buffet,1
2763,our trip to dublin was very nice the hotel was pretty good the city is very nice the weather was great and the concert was extraordinary we also went to bray kiliney where the beach is beautiful and dorkey where we had great lunch at the corner note,1
2764,really nice rooms love that we can open the windows and get fresh air the staff was really nice and accommodating its perfect to have a pub connected to the hotel where you can even charge the bill at the pub to your room only thing that was a little high price wise was the breakfast but it was convent as heck so we ate there each will use the hotel when we are back in dublin,1
2765,arrived on sunday morning at at was greeted by friendly professional staff it was to early to check in so we were prepared to leave our bags there and look around dublin while talking to the lady at the counter i think it was the supervisor who came over and said there was a room available and we could check in straight away after only two hours sleep this was excellent and little gestures like this would make us stay here room itself was spacious clean and very pleasant to stay in and the beds were was excellent and the chef did a good job overall an excellent hotel in a great location with excellent stay here again,1
2766,lovely dublin hotel in a good location in dublin city centre pleasant bar and restaurant next door called the gas works express restaurant in lobby very good parking also available outside front of hotel,1
2767,my dad and i stayed here in june for the phil collins concert in the aviva both of us were very impressed by the hotel the lobby was clean modern and inviting upon arrival was speedy and the reception staff were friendly and courteous our request of a twin room was met and the room was very spacious clean and well appointed all round if i had one niggle it would be that the bathroom was a little tired in comparison to the room itself i can not comment on the gas works bar my dad and i headed down with the intention of having a there but it was so busy we just could be facilitated breakfast the next morning was very good and is certainly one of the better breakfasts i had in a dublin hotel overall i would certainly stay here again when in dublin and if you have a in the aviva this is the place to stay as it can not be beaten,1
2768,i have stayed at the grand canal a number of nights over the past year and have been pleased each time the rooms are clean staff is very helpful and attentive and the breakfast buffet or made to order is excellent the rooms are of average size and there is a comfortable chair and a desk chair in the room there is no air conditioning but they did provide a fan when we requested the hotel is a bit off the beaten path down by the grand canal but is less than a min walk to st stevens sr or even less to merrion sq i like the location as it gives me a chance to walk and see dublin vs coming out your door to a crowded scene like at some of the other more city center or temple bar locations there is an attached bar which serves good pub fare and you can get a pint of guinness or a local craft beer the prices in the pub are reasonable and their is plenty of room for a group i will continue to return to the grand canal when in dublin and look forward to my next stay,1
2769,stayed here for nights on a short visit to dublin check in was smooth with everything explained to us staff were very was very spacious it had every thing including an espresso coffee maker also tea and instant coffee facilities ironing board and iron terrific hair dryer bath robes and a free digital my wife and i thought the bed was really comfortable and we both had good nights was good with everything you could ask for full irish or continental cereals were plenty as were fruits once again staff were courteous and more than was within easy access to all transport buses and trains the walk into town was a bit much for us as we are in our seventies so we took the train a min walk from hotel it was only two stops and was well worth the each to the busy and lively part of the city overall we enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend,1
2770,clean comfortable hotel while in dublin for one night easy minute walk downtown full irish breakfast in the morning was outstanding i would hesitate to stay here again the old schoolhouse around the corner was one of the best dinners we had while in ireland and great atmosphere,1
2772,very nice hotel within easy reach of plenty of bars and restaurants close to dart station and about minutes walk from connolly are well kitted out and comfortable nice coffee machine and mineral water rate did not include breakfast so we went out for brunch plenty of choice little way out of the centre if you are staying for a few days and want to be in the heart of the action however excellent for events at the stadiums nearby,1
2773,a little way out of the centre but ideally suited to the aviva though i prefer the pringle i prefer to stay out of the hustle and bustle and you get far more for your money that way too there still plenty to see and do in this area and it no more than a twenty minute walk to grafton street etc very clean comfortable beds and tasteful decor there even a beneath it though our room was peaceful when we stayed,1
2774,great time here what a bar great food and beer and especially great service is the best waitress ever as soon as we were at our table she had drinks in front of us brilliant and then we got unbelievable food it was amazing x,1
2775,this large hotel offers an excellent price for value ratio probably one of the best on this side of the city nice staff good breakfast with table service for hot drinks and buffet for the rest pretty high standards in the bedroom and bathroom i really liked their orla kiely soap shampoo and body lotion this hotel also offers a rather quick access to the city centre min walk or appropriate for business trips i have stayed there many times over the past year maybe less for a romantic stay as this is mostly a business one issue the restaurant downstairs is specialised in burgers and beers not the ideal place if you on a diet,1
2777,very nice and super friendly staff we had a concert at the stadium so it was perfect walking distance the breakfast was a little crowded and they had run out of a few things but other than that it was great,1
2779,we stayed in the skylon for nights in july and had a lovely experience we were very well looked after by the manager colette who made our stay even better than expected the hotel was really easy to get to from and also only a minute bus ride into the city or minutes in a cab we stayed in king suite and it was perfet for us clean bathroom big comfortable bed nespresso machine always a bonus and complimentary still water on arrival it the little things the breakfast was lovely and staff were very accomadating i really could fault this hotel and we will definitely be back again next time we visit dublin thank you colette for a wonderful stay at the skylon hotel,1
2780,wanted a place that we could dive to that would be convenient to everything without driving too fat into dublin this place was great large clean rooms helpful staff stores restaurants pubs buses cabs all convenient to hotel,1
2781,nice very clean room nice sceenery good food in the bar good value for money take bus to the center and to the airport nice area with small pubs or bars very kind service we will come if ever in dublin,1
2782,from the moment we entered this hotel our stay was perfect room was beautiful and had everything we needed all of the staff were extremely friendly accommodating and were willing to go the extra mile a special thank you to hazel who found out we had just got engaged and gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco this made our stay extra special we did eat in the hotel so ca comment on the food but the bar area was lovely and the afternoon tea looked amazing although the room was incredibly hot we were provided with a fan without even having to ask this hotel is in a great location with lots of shops and restaurants on the same street number bus from the airport it takes about and it drops you right outside the hotel it is also a short bus trip to the city centre and buses are very frequent i will be recommending this hotel to all friends and family and wo hesitate to return when i dublin next,1
2783,myself and other ladies went to the skylon hotel for lunch which would be a regular occurrence as we enjoy the hotel and food when we drove into the car park we were greeted by a very rude man who looked into the car and said it was resident parking only i explained we went there a lot and would only be about hours and he refused to let us stay we noted about or empty parking spaces but still had to leave,0
2785,i just returned from this hotel after staying with of my friends for my hen such a stunning well run hotel the bar on friday night was fabulous atmosphere amazing and everyone was so happy rooms were beautiful and beds sooooo comfy there a bus stop right outside that takes you to temple bar for taxi from the airport was and from temple bar was and there a dominoes pizza across the road too open until a real godsend i would definitely stay here again if i came back to dublin thank you to the skylon,1
2788,i visited the skylon at the weekend for lunch with family we were heading to a big game in town so the skylon is an obvious choice for lunch have been visiting the skylon for many years the food and service was always great however a number of months ago they decided to no longer provide a carvery option for lunch that in itself is not an issue as long as the kitchen and servers can work together efficiently to get orders taken and food delivered you may have seen on my previous review since the upgrade that the service and food was very disappointing overall we hoped for a better experience on sunday but it was to arrived at and met friends who had got there before us their lunch order took minutes to arrive the food was only warm not hot our lunch took minutes to be delivered we almost had to cancel it as it was simply taking too hard to know where the problem is because there are lots of people serving in the restaurant my guess is that the problem in the kitchen the fact is the food was taking far too long to be delivered to lots of tables not just mentioned the skylon is well located to capture trade from people attending games and concerts in croke park however they do seem to be aware of this and are certainly not taking advantage of our food eventually arrived it was fine certainly no,0
2789,stayed with a group of friends and family for my hen do hotel is lovely and rooms great the location is a bit far out from centre of town but is easily reached by short taxi ride the hotel breakfast is lovely and staff helpful and kindly provided complimentary drink would recommend,1
2790,i dropped in on saturday for a meal with my wife and was attended to immediately by a very pleasant young girl who unfortunately disappeared just after taking our food was served no more than minutes later my wife wants one of whatever it was they used she claims it would save her numerous hours standing over a cooker with everything piled in a heap on the plates topped off with not very inviting my glass was picked up on two occasions before i had floor staff were dressed in short sleeved emblazoned with a picture of on the front and boasting team skylon on the back wearing runners dirty with some showing their ankles on the way through the lobby to the toilets i was confronted by a cardboard image of staring after me as i passed which was all i needed to p me only good thing about the visit was the two girls that supplied the entertainment to an unappreciative audience full marks to them a previous reviewer referred to the skylon as a star that should be a star there must have been something in that visitors drink whoever is responsible for overseeing the dress attire of the hotel staff should be forgiven for having no finger nails due to an ongoing nervous breakdown girl on the floor in my local should be considered for the job should the vacancy arise,0
2791,came and stayed at the skylon friday july to the not a bad thing to be said my partner bought me here for my birthday and upon arrival a nice polite lady called hazel checked us in then upgraded us to a king suite we also got breakfast vouchers free of charge and a complimentary bottle of champagne thanks hazel on getting to the room we were loving how clean and tidy it was bed was so comfy that we hated getting in our own last night house keeping cleaned and gave fresh towels breakfast was delicious and our evening meal on the last night was just as nice staff are friendly and hotel for those not wanting to stay far out as it just a bus journey in to dublin centre bus stops right across the road and taxi service second to definitely stay here again,1
2792,coming to dublin for a gig our main priority was a hotel near to croke park hence the dublin room was probably but that was the only downside everything else was were upgraded to a family room on arrival so the room was spacious and very comfortable good amenities and an excellent night sleep with a good shower in the morning that most of what we look for in a hotel room straight next morning was great ok so that not unusual in ireland but still exactly what we wanted after a big night at the sets the skylon apart though is the team and their service they claim to be and that just what it feels like really welcoming friendly and professional with a bigger hotels could learn how to do it from the skylon came for a great show we be back at the skylon next time we in dublin whatever the excuse,1
2793,first thought as i walked in was is this an old people home not up to date quite shabby beds comfortable majority of staff were quite rude not worth euros for two nights per family breakfast was cold and an amazing hotel would stay again definitely not a four star needs re checking,0
2794,stayed at the skylon for the coldplay concert last month my only gripe with the hotel was the price it obviously costed to the fact its within walking distance of croke park over for two nights and didnt include breakfast at this price we had a king room which was considerably smaller than it looked on the photo the room was clean very warm though fan provided and the usual facilities i will echo other comments in that the staff were extremely nice all dressed up in their coldplay tshirts and really welcoming if you are travelling from the airport i would get the bus from outside the airport and it drops you over the road from the hotel and same going back make sure you have the busfare in coins as the driver can not give change euros each way you can also get the same bus into dublin city takes around mins for the same priceyou do a great cocktail too recommend the bramble,1
2796,we had a family celebration in this hotel july we could not have picked a better hotel service from check in till check out was faultless and very friendly and professional rooms were very clean and modern food was excellent with very friendly servers nice bar area with good drinks at reasonable priceslocation is the best you can get in dublin if you do the want to pay ridiculous city center rip off prices location is min drive by taxi from airport costing no more buses from airport stop outside hotel to city center is approx minutes walk or local buses outside hotel gets you there in mins there are some lovely pubs across from the hotel and places to eat but food in hotel bar is very good in our group were people from canada scotland holland all were very impressed with all of above thanking all the staff at the skylon hotel for their friendly banter and serviceand surely people will use the skylon on their next visit to dublin,1
2797,this hotel is in a great location only around mins from the airport and mins to the city centre the breakfast was amazing and the staff friendly and helpful the lobby area is a little dated however the room was a really good standard and we always had a peaceful nights sleep for the nights we were there there are a couple of places you can eat across the road from the hotel as well as a fish and chip shop and a dominos buses run from outside the hotel and only cost euros taxis are expensive but dublin is expensive overall anyway so it is expected overall a nice comfortable hotel in a good location,1
2798,stayed here for one night and thankful it was only one night the rooms have no and our two rooms were so different although they were right next to each other on the same floor because we had to sleep with the windows open we heard a barking dog all night long since the back of the hotel backs to some backyards of a residential neighborhood the breakfast dining room was extremely warm as well to the point that unless you wearing shorts and a you are sweating,0
2799,this hotel is clean comfortable and conveniently located near enough to the airport and to the city center always have water available staff work hard to meet our needs good shower quiet rooms pretty much everything you want in a hotel staff helped us make our way around dublin with good suggestions worth the price you pay,1
2800,just had a friends hen party in the skylon last weekend from the moment we emailed the hotel to book our stay right up to checkout the staff were fantastic our hens were made to feel really welcome and the hotel had left a complementary bottle of bubbly in each room as a special treat our dinner was in a private dining room and again the staff were so attentive and helpful the hotel is really central and easy to get to thanks to all you made our stay extra special and we came home with some fab memories of our night in dublin,1
2801,we had a hour dublin layover and wanted to be withing easy reach of the airport my parents and teen age kids with us the rooms were clean the beds very comfortable we enjoyed a pleasant breakfast in the dining room and the staff in all areas were lovely to work with the location is excellent easy from the airport and the bus outside the hotel goes to all the key dublin locations local restaurants and pubs were great taxis were easy to get i recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay again,1
2802,this hotel is by far the best hotel we as a family have stayed in r frequent travelers so helpful welcoming accommodating we managed get a free parking space the front another bonus the afternoon was just so cute we got it complimentary as we stayed on a sunday nite we had reschedule a few things over r stay and they were v patient understanding we will def b back jade isaac r the stars of the show the room was comfortable although sum ac wud have been good in the rare irish heat thank u all skylon so much,1
2803,we have just returned from a great night stay at the skylone hotel we were attending the cold play concert at croke stadium and the location of the hotel was a short distance from the hotel the hotel check in was quick and the hotel left a birthday card and bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise and gesture the rooms are clean and tidy and had everything you need as well as extras like bottles of the hotel and staff provided an excellent service and we will definitely be staying at the skylone hotel on our next trip to dublin,1
2804,stayed here for an early flight lovely and modern and perfect for early flight left car here for nights also and it cost approx euros including the night we had to stay abroad for an extra night due to unforeseen circumstances and i emailed hotel about car and extra night they were fantastic and responded straight away with no extra charge for the night will stay again book directly through their website for a better deal,1
2805,the room was very clean comfortable and spacious the main reason i stayed there was because of its location the hotel has a service that brings you to and from the airport at no charge they are very punctual,1
2806,i been staying here since june and have to say it brilliant kate and the team work hard to ensure that we are happy food is good value and well cooked taylor in the restaurant is super enthusiastic and always working hard shuttle bus to airport is handy have used other hotels around here this is the best by miles stars well done guys,1
2807,once again we had the pleasure of staying at the metro and once again the staff was excellent our luggage did not arrive for three days and the front desk did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable they constantly helped us contact the luggage department and even brought us to the airport three times so we could check on our luggage the shuttle bus driver was fabulous and even let us borrow some of his sports equipment so we could enjoy a game of golf near the hotel our room was perfect and every effort was made to make sure we were content and comfortable back there again next year for sure,1
2808,hotel is under renovation but did interfere with stay rooms are clean but on small side no but they did provide a fan as it was warm there is a shuttle from the airport but they charge euros for a round trip which was fine but it was advertised that there was a charge was first hard to find where shuttle picks you up and it is a short walk from the airport staff are friendly and very helpful and accommodating restaurant in the hotel is good the breakfast is an additional charge from the room there are no other restaurants or stores near the hotel as it is more of a residential area overall stay was comfortable and convenient for our purposes,1
2809,had an overnight stay room was a bit small but very clean and had everything you need dinner in the bistro was excellent all staff very friendly and helpful car park facilities very handy and courtesy bus to the airport,1
2810,very nice hotel very clean and room was spacious breakfast in the morning was basic however was nice overall good experience buses into town minute walk shuttle bus on request to and from dublin airport which proved very handy,1
2812,located only min from the airport and a shuttle available to get you there and back on arrival the check in was easy and fast we let them know we needed a shuttle back in the morning so they wrote our names on a list the room was a little bit on the tiny side the dresser drawer opened and hit the bed before it could be opened all the way its a little inconvenient when the blow dryer was attached to inside of that drawer just a weird set up we had to put the room key in a slot in order for the lights in the would come on just a small room overall had to jump over the bed to get back and fourth with people in it along with large suite area is large and it was very busy that night the service was still very good it was already late so we did try any food only dessert we ended up bringing our second drinks to our room,1
2813,newly refurbished rooms a bit noisy but proximity to dublin airport makes up for service restaurant wide choices on menu full breakfast or continental breakfast available at reasonable prices,1
2814,this hotel is fairly modern with nice amenities rooms are nicely appointed and the hotel is in a great location for any tourist activities on foot some say the rooms get loud on weekends this was not our experience if you are visiting dublin this is the place to stay it is also attached to a nice,1
2815,loved this hotel it newly renovated modern comfortable clean great customer service plus some little extras like ice cream at check in location was can walk anywhere from this in temple bar minute walk to dame street trinity college shopping on grafton st walk to stephens green although temple bar area is loud at night we could not hear it from our was very quiet best hotel of our trip,1
2816,we stayed two nights at the temple bar hotel as part of our trip through ireland the staff was very friendly and helpful we were able to check in early and were even given an upgraded room we were at the back of the hotel which was good since it shielded is from the noise of this rowdy district the location is very convenient,1
2817,good quality accommodation in a very busy and noisy street ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you do want to be kept awake by boozy youngsters and very loud music in the hotel staff were very helpful even going to a lot of trouble to print our boarding passes for our flybe flight the day we checked out we did not eat breakfast in the hotel during our three night stay as it would have added to the cost of our short break there are plenty of places on temple bar to get a full breakfast for half the price or coffee and a croissant for just a few euros try centra a convenience a couple of hundred yards from the hotel where they sell excellent croissants for and a good cup of coffee for less than take away or eat got the bus from the airport to dame street a couple of minutes walk away from temple bar a briliant service which runs every or minutes and cost us each return,1
2818,got it for its location absolutely right on temple bar area and walking distance to molly malone statue where all the tours start in the morning can also walk to grafton st and shopping area you barely stay in the hotel being that its so close to so many things first room had an outside facing window into a street but due to some construction noise in another building we changed to an internal facing room with no view but room was fine everything worked well i would say its a bit on the small side but probably the case with city hotels has all amenities ca go wrong choosing this unless you have a lot of luggage and need larger rooms,1
2819,this hotel is at the west end of fleet street in what is called the temple bar district of the dublin the significance of fleet street is the this the main happening area of the city with countless restaurants and pubs one after another from the end that we stayed for a half a dozen blocks in other words if your vacation involves wanted to plenty of food and drink options within an easy walk of the hotel this is a great place fleet street is one way and only allows some cars and taxis out front further only the first two blocks are open to a few cars otherwise it is pedestrians only as suggested in advance we took the airport express bus from the airport euro one way or euro round trip the bus lets you out on the street bridge from which it is maybe an easy quarter mile walk to the hotel since this bus is an express few stops from the airport street bridge was the second stop maybe minutes walk easy depending on the traffic lights on the way back to the airport we also took the airport express the return pickup point was even closer just around the corner off fleet street maybe a yards and less than minutes arriving at the hotel reception could not have been more pleasant we arrived around am and they allowed us early check in which was nice as we dropped bags and were off immediately into,1
2820,if you want to hear music loudly until early hours of every morning temple bar inn hotel is the place for you i am not that kind of music fan so i was really disappointed about the noise that came to the room from bars in this building and around the fleet street i have to say that the location of this hotel is great near shopping areas and hotel staff is doing good work but those are all the positive sides of staying room where we stayed nights was really basic and small it even lacked elements like soap tray in the shower and hangers for jackets that we had to ask separetly there were no ventillation so you had to open windows for fresh air to come in and after opening the rhythm of bass drums was even louder until or of this can be experienced in budget style hotels but not in hotels that cost over euros per night my advice is to go somewhere else if you are not wealthy bass drum rhythm lover,0
2821,lot of great restaurants nearby walking distance i prefer the beauty of ireland more than the party areas temple bar hotel room was great the double windows kept street noise quiet and it was nice to have a place that had air conditioning it was humid the hotel has a great location not too close to the party scene but close enough to walk there i only stayed one night and had to leave early so i did get to use all the amenities,1
2822,great location right in the heart of the action amazing front desk staff began with tania helping locate lost airport luggage before during and after my meltdown she was and kind and helpful ending with her blonde counter part sorry i did get your name recommending a great coffee shop the next morning quick to smile and ready to help thanks for all your help,1
2823,upon arrival i was greeted with free ice cream which was perfect since i was in a hurry to get to my room change and head out to the convention center which i walked to every day comfortable clean room i enjoyed the free little cookies and even the candy bar on friday night yes you are in a lively loud area of the city as mentioned ear plugs are provided to use while there was a fan in the room i did not use it the room comes with all amenities except conditioner which is okay as i packed my own upon reading a previous post i could walk to many locations in the temple bar area including the locations of tours that i signed up for i appreciated the free map and directions since well google maps had me going in the wrong direction,1
2824,in terms of value i would give this hotel mainly due to the service the cleanliness and the location the breakfast could be better for the price it is not included in the cost as the selection is minimal however as stated the service was good they offered a special irish dinner and show with the neighbouring my girlfriend even got asked to try irish dancing which she did to her dismay the experience was enjoyable and memorable however more so for me i think it is located in the centre of shops restaurants and attractions and i would definitely recommend getting the euro bus pass as it enabled us to go everywhere for the days we were so much easier than paying for a ticket each time i would also recommend going to the guinness factory and the hotel is very close to this attraction as it is in the centre we assumed it would be noisy however they provide ear plugs to help sleep overall it was a great trip and we enjoyed coming back to this hotel at the end of a busy day,1
2825,my wife and i stayed for a night in the hotel and found its location to be super convenient to visit the various sightseeing locations around dublin its proximity to locations such as trinity college about mins walk christ church cathedral walk and dublin castle about min walk makes it easy to visit especially if you have a short time further its not too close to the main part of temple bar hence the noise was bad,1
2826,great hotel clean modern comfortable located in the heart beat of dublin very friendly and professional staff serve real scrambled eggs at breakfast delicious staff was very helpful in planning sightseeing around was a blast with tasty pub food provided free shuttle bus round trip to concert,1
2827,stayed at christmas ideal location rooms were great for girls although alittle cramped when getting ready free hot drinks on arrival was a nicw touch would stay again bur maybe in the deluxe suite,1
2828,we stayed nights at this hotel during our recent trip to ireland and we are so glad that we did beautiful and comfortable hotel right in the heart of dublin the hotel staff was amazing especially mario they really went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one we had booked several tours and the hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage for us while we were on the tours they went out of their way to accommodate us we will definitely stay there again,1
2829,this hotel is in the middle of downtown just above the action that means that if you go in a weekend night you wo get to sleep unless you wear the earplugs that the hotel provides for you but honestly they do not serve much the view from our room was to the air condition machinery another noise to add when we checkin we were offer a room with air conditioning even that in dublin does go over the with an over price of euros so we said no that s what we got staff is friendly and the room was clean the location is very good you only have to put to the noise level at weekend nights,1
2830,this hotel is right in the heart of temple bar although the streets were very busy with hen and stag parties we couldnt hear any of this from the hotel room lovely decor and spotlessly clean children received ice cream when we arrived and they were delighted to find mini crunchie bars on their bed the breakfast is very good we will return again hopefully,1
2831,i chose this hotel for its central location and it paid off it was really easy to get around the city from this spot the hotel was modern and clean and my room was well appointed and functional and we had two bags of welcome snacks the only downside was the lack of air conditioning which meant i had to sleep with the window open surprisingly the street noise was not disruptive the best part was the staff from our greeting at including free ice cream through our the temple bar team were pleasant and super helpful i definitely stay here again,1
2832,this was our first trip to dublin so we wanted to make sure we were centrally located while the temple street area may be considered touristy and we usually prefer to stay off the beaten path we wanted to make the most of our short day stay in took the airlink shuttle bus from the airport which was about a minute ride and the fleet street stop was about a minute walk to the hotel really easy we arrived early in the morning and were offered complimentary coffee they did have a room ready but offered us a upgrade to check in early which we opted to do so we could freshen up after our flight and explore the room was clean and spacious we were a little concerned since we were given complimentary ear plugs but we never had an issue with noise even on friday and saturday night my only complaint is that the toiletries provided were shampoo and body wash this is a total nitpick since i usually pack my own but this time i did and i could have definitely used some conditioner especially with the misty and windy weather in ireland the hotel is really perfectly located it toward the end of fleet street so only a minute walk to bars and restaurants but it just far enough removed not to be super loud we really enjoyed how central it was and had a great visit overall,1
2833,between london paris the temple bar hotel topped the list both in location friendliness of staff and a great room no fridge no worries they carried a bar fridge in for us nothing was too much trouble the irish are known for their friendliness and we now know that to be very very was a great size and tesco just across the road let alone the buskers bar next door where we watched the irish singers on their last night and the irish jig great noise worries whatsoever robbie the bouncer was more than helpful and advised us to take an outing on the dart to a seaside village called howth which we did and enjoyed we could do the long haul from australia would be the only place i would want to go back recommend this hotel to everyone,1
2834,hotel was just a block from the heart of the temple bar area surrounded by good bars and restaurants yet was happily a quiet relaxing spot as well room was fine breakfast was great and the staff was very helpful,1
2835,we only had the pleasure of staying at temple bar hotel for one night but we were very pleased with our short stay temple bar is the touristy area but we wanted to be in the heart of the action with restaurants and pubs everywhere you turn we were disappointed was easy and the free and delicious ice cream was a nice touch our room was modern and spacious but had no air conditioning typically this would be a problem in dublin but we visited when the weather was quite warm i discovered on tripadvisor that some rooms had ac so we asked at the front desk we were able to switch rooms for euro best money spent that trip our new room was just as nice as the first only cooler the ear plugs on the nightstand with a note saying the area could be noisy it is temple bar after all made us a little nervous but our room was quiet and we did hear a sound that rate included breakfast which was delicious with lots of items on the would definitely stay here again,1
2836,stayed here saturday july for the coldplay concert the hotel and room was very clean and staff was friendly the hotel had put on a free biz to and from the concert which was good when checking in i was told that an extra would be added as a deposit for the room but would be returned on the card as soon i we checked out now this shocked me as the room cost i would have thought that would have been enough the room was overly big we stayed in did hear any noise which was good and slept fine the receptionist had offered breakfast at a discount of which we declined personally i thot after spending there would be more than a discount reading through other reviews i see the hotel offered ice creams little extras in the room which did seem to be the case in our experience for location wise and cleanliness yes i would go back to the hotel but maybe think about little extras for all guests and not just some,1
2837,stayed last minute at this hotel in a triple room the room was great value for money very clean and decorated lovely very spacious too and nice big tv staff friendly and helpful would definitely return,1
2838,during a recent visit to dublin we stayed at the temple bar hotel since our last visit to ireland three years ago the hotel has been completely refurbished the reception spaces are both welcoming and stylish of course being in ireland means that most people are very friendly no exemption here the staff was excellent our room was clean and very comfortable what important about this hotel is its location right in the middle of temple bar several streets of restaurants music filled pubs and shops it was great fun to walk around and enjoy the sights and sounds the only downside to the hotel location is the noise the streets are busy with throngs of people well into the night fortunately the hotel windows are well insulated and guests are provided with earplugs if needed we had no problems whatsoever it a great place from which to explore amazing dublin,1
2839,the only thing positive about staying at this hotel is the location otherwise skip it no air conditioning in most of the rooms and the room was stuffy and cramped we asked if we could get an aurcondioned room and was told it would cost euro you can hear the noise from the honkey tonk environment in the street and the service was wildly inconsistent my friend was offered complementary coffee and the next day i was rudely told to buy a cup for us from a machine,0
