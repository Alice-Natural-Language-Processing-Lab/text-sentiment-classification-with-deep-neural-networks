0,we booked to stay at this hotel via a travel agent who told us it had a flat entrance and a lift she failed to mention the steps about to actually get to the lift the hotel staff were very efficient friendly and helpful and let me use the phone to try to sort out the mistake another hotel could be found nearby so we ended up is a lovely hotel and so convenient for the museums etc the room we had was a bedded room large and roomy with comfy beds and the most comfortable pillow i have ever laid my head on smart shower room and quality toiletries we got a complementary welcome drink voucher for the bar,1
1,we stayed for nights had rooms booked staff are friendly and helpful our person was very very good knowledgable efficient friendly room sizes were of the rooms one had a very small short shower if over you would have a problem other room air conditioning not working well had an odor and thus we had to open up the windows thankfully it was cool during our stay location is close to amsterdam but away enough to be quiet and more residential close by bakery was great for breakfast simon something albert heijn market close by as well for snacks found a wonderful laundrymat nearby powders laundrette they have self service machines and will also do your laundry for a very reasonable price first time i have ever had my laundry done by someone else while traveling and it was marvelous and well worth it,1
2,very nice quite hotel located close enough to dam and various other sights very clean definately will be back again the staff very helpful definately will recommend this nice tidy hotel for travellers for a quite stay,1
3,we stayed here for nights and were disappointed there was nothing we could fault about this arrived right in the middle of the gay pride parade unaware it was on and i was a little worried however the mercure is tucked away and was very safe and quiet breakfast was included which was awesome normally free breakfast is just continental however was pleasantly surprised to see eggs bacon and sausage too you wo be disappointed as there was plenty of breakfast hired bikes here which cost about a day was convienent for sized rooms and bathroom plenty of space for our luggage too beds are comfy good location walk to the heineken experience and maybe to mussuems to the centre staff were really friendly and all spoke english which was very helpful for definitely stay here again,1
5,great location quaint bedroom with nice relaxing breakfast friendly staff through the stay rooms very clean the room did not have air conditioning but with the windows open and room stayed comfortable would recommend this place to stay,1
6,the hotel nadia is in an excellent location very close to all the history and sites of amsterdam the room was clean and plain with an incredible view of the canal and westkirk the staff was so nice even helping with our laundry for a small extra fee and after two weeks traveling europe i was so grateful do miss the charming breakfast room and great breakfast one note very steep stairs up to the lobby and rooms are not for everyone but they did bring our luggage up and down the stairs for us which was very nice we would stay there again in a,1
7,we stayed here july we paid for a standard room and were upgraded to one with a view over the canal the room was very clean and small which we expected but had plenty of well designed storage and shelves etc the windows opened but the location is quite noisy at night there was no air conditioning but a good sized fan was provided as hotel oozes a local staff were always very helpful knowledgeable and friendly as many point out the stairs on entering from the street up to the reception and rooms are a sight to behold steep curved and narrow with short steps oxygen is not provided the staff at the hotel always offer to carry everyone bags from street level to room and back out if you want them to so the stairs are not really a major issue the only problem would be if you ca physically cope with difficult was continental but always kept well stocked as people came and location is perfect for a city centre stay it is within easy walking distance minutes max of all the city centre attractions there are many very nice bars and restaurants within a short you want a basic reasonably priced city centre hotel with of local character and can climb steep stairs this should be on your list we have no hesitation in recommending it,1
8,we stayed here my wife and i booked a standard room for night it was the middle of the week and they upgraded us to a balcony room we probably would have booked this room had we been there more than one night it was amazing if a little small the balcony was nice had a great view of the canal and allowed us a nice cool place to people watch there were a few quirks here when you leave you leave your key with the front desk and pick it up when you get back i assume this is so you do lose the physical key while visiting the city smart the stairs to the rooms are a bit steep and narrow i a big guy and still made it just fine even loaded with bags the bed was comfortable but not overly we loved it the staff were nice and friendly and spoke perfect english as do many many people here the location was close enough to everything we wanted to see so we could walk everywhere i would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return if we ever make it back to amsterdam,1
9,this is a very small hotel staff are very you have to be quite fit to go up all the stairs with your luggage i also missed breakfast as i was mins too room was small but clean and the balcony was hotel is in a very good location,1
10,this hotel has it all it is historic yet modern it is beautiful in design and has artwork worthy of a museum the staff is friendly and attentive but not intrusive we discovered no major flaws in the hotel operation the front desk and the rest of the staff were great the restaurants and lounge were wonderful with superb food and great service we would not hesitate to stay at the grand on future visits to amsterdam,1
11,our expected view of the canal was more a glimpse but as the staff had been so helpful in getting us into our suite really early i did not mind the room was beautifully appointed and furnished we found ourselves sleeping much longer than usual due to a combination of the peace and quiet of the hotel the blackout curtains and the superbly comfortable bed service was exceptional from all staff members particularly paul thomas and margeurite breakfast offers a wide is an historic hotel and its location is superb as we could walk to most attractions amsterdam in summer is very crowded and busy but all this disappears as you turn off the street to the haven of the courtyard and the hotel buildings,1
12,minutes for checking no respect of platinum member profit room dirty and old bathroom of and all of that for eur but the most terrible part is this hotel are not clean will not come back,0
13,the location is close to everything the service was excellent everyone was friendly and extremely helpful the breakfast was great full breakfast with a huge selection they make anything you request our room was five stars amazing one of the best rooms we ever stayed in and we travel a lot i would highly recommend this also took the tour of the hotel and learned a lot about the history of the hotel,1
14,we loved our large room with wonderfully comfortable bed with cotton sheets and a nice canal view the front staff bellmen concierge desk at this hotel is wonderful and very well trained the restaurant staff needs a lot of work and training there seemed to be no training or supervision at all when we were there and it seemed the food was sent out of the kitchen without a chef checking it out for example three people at our table ordered the same dish and the inconsistency was remarkable but not in a good way the location of this hotel is fantastic right in the heart of everything and so much fun walking or biking around any time of day or night the pool and steam room were a nice treat during all our travels as well it would have been even nicer had there been a spray bottle of eucalyptus in the steam room maybe next time hope to stay here again,1
15,love this hotel staff is top notch professional and warm our room was love the big tub with a to watch although did work who cares the tub was divine great service delicious european breakfast my one complaint is the less formal dining room has food the waiters and waitresses are great but the food was although they are kind and accommodate special requests which i appreciated special dietary needs and they have a low calorie option menu,1
16,this hotel is truly located almost dead center in old amsterdam a minute walk to the anne frank museum minute walk to the rijksmuseum the breakfast buffet is one of the best i have dined in the omelettes superb the staff was the best it could be the concierges were very friendly and quite helpful the receptionists were also very friendly pleasant and smiles smiles from all the staff really help my thanks to the morning staff in the bridges restaurant for starting my day off right,1
17,i have never stayed at a hotel with friendlier staff who were more eager to help especially the concierge staff they were very patient always with good advise very beautiful facility in walking distance from many destinations in central amsterdam we upgraded to have breakfast included which was one of the best i can remember anywhere our bedroom had too many different lights and light switches to figure out and my coffee maker did seem to work right but overall because of the staff i give this place stars without hesitation,1
18,had a great stay at the sofitel the grand in amsterdam it well located a stone throw from dam square that is the heart of the city not far away from the central train station amsterdam central but if you carrying a mid size piece of luggage it advisable to take the tram or bus the service is impeccable and the breakfast is the best i ever had this hotel is highly recommended,1
19,reception professional staff warm welcome welcome drink accompaniment to the clean so confortable bed huge tv wifi in the room turn down servicebest breakfast ever i barely saw such a variety and quality and healthy food on a hotel buffet breakfast you also have a lot of choice included in the breakfast service is ok,1
20,best star hotel i have staid in many many years the rooms are nice and modern the ambience was welcoming warm and professional the biggest asset however is the staff starting from the night shift to the breakfast crew all the way to the bar tender everybody is extremely down to earth friendly helpful and competent the location is very central rent a bike from the hotel and explore the city i can highly recommend this hotel,1
21,the grand sofitel is truly regal very nicely maintained in that era that many of us can not find anywhere other than in these preserved hotel classic rooms are too tiny and do cause discomfort if used for double mention the excellent service of mr luca at the bridges fine dinning efficient front desk and tarnish is a public open defecating loo right outside the grand entrance of the hotel the council should remove it it sends a stink all around that area and the excreta is sometimes visible from the street it is a shame on the amsterdam council for having left is unattended and open it looks so very ugly,1
22,i just returned home from an absolutely sensational stay the staff were lovely efficient welcoming and gracious we were upgraded to a phenomenal suite with butler service plenty of space and creative daily snacks the breakfast buffet was wonderful and the location was perfect it was extremely close to the most sites and within a very short walking distance from just about anywhere worth going in amsterdam the courtyard at the front entrance provides an area of tranquility comfort and security i could not possibly recommend this hotel with greater enthusiasm and it is the only hotel that i would consider staying in at my next visit to amsterdam,1
23,well located charming entrance up scale service canal view room well appointed but noisey saturday night canal traffic terrific breakfast buffet customer service and front desk were very polite and attentive,1
24,sofitel grand is very well located it is minutes walk to the dam square the staff was very polite and courteous i was given an early check in at am which was a great gesture the room itself was quite big and mention to the concierge for helping me out with all my requests highly recommended for a stay in amsterdam,1
25,brought my family for a second trip to amsterdam and to stay at the sofitel grand i love the staff the amenities and the location great breakfast best michelin restaurant and terrific rooms you will love it,1
26,this is a stunningly beautiful property with well appointed and spacious rooms we stayed in a one bedroom suite that was very spacious fully renovated overlooked the canal and was very quiet the bathrooms even had towel warmers it is in a large historic building where queen beatrix was actually married it is an absolute must stay in if you are in amsterdam and looking for luxury and superior service we had the pleasure of being greeted and accommodated by a well trained guest services manager roel backus who extended himself graciously to my family and especially to my daughter to ensure that our stay was perfect which is was the buffet breakfast is a must try even if you are not staying at the hotel the variety is plentiful and quality is very high there is even a nicely sized swimming pool steam room and sauna which is unusual in european hotels but added an extra level of privilege and relaxation yes it is expensive but it is well worth the price you will pay from top to bottom and i highly recommmend a stay here a special thank you for roel for taking care of us and making us feel welcome at his property we hope to have the privilege of returning here some day,1
27,a great restaurant a great bar great concierge wonderful staffhad booked a double room with my wife when we got there the mamanger gave us a suite at no extra was incredible felt really central in the midst of the city with bars cafes and the special coffee shops,1
28,chic lobby and lovely outdoor space in back of hotel staff was outstanding brought me a complimentary coffee as i waited for my room to be ready and provided a range of restaurant recommendations outstanding location on the prinsengracht canal just a minute walk to the anne frank house,1
29,my husband and i drove to amsterdam from germany for a day trip but decided to stay the night so we booked a room at the andaz on short notice and was very pleased we also stayed at the andaz in san diego but the amsterdam location is much more magical with the beautiful lights and an enchanting garden the bed was extremely comfy and the staff was very accommodating we will definitely stay there again,1
30,we have just completed nights at the andaz and found it to be spectacular on every level the interior design comfort of the rooms and buffet breakfasts were all outstanding but what truly put the experience over the top was the incredible customer service every andaz employee we encountered went out of their way to be polite and helpful and meet our every need sera was the first person to greet us when we arrived and continued to serve us impeccably throughout our visit patricio calvin and patrick were all friendly and gracious as well as was everyone else at the andaz whose names we did learn we loved our stay in amsterdam and look forward to another stay at the andaz next time we visit,1
31,loved this hotel boutique feel with great service and beautiful decor they have a wonderful restaurant and bikes you can borrow to cruise around the rooms are well laid out with everything you need would definitely visit again,1
32,andaz is beautiful modern hotel by the prinsengracht service here was exceptionally warm and you can only love the staff complimentary bikes are quite close to russian tanks heavy and can take small nuclear bomb but they work well and unless you are planning to have tour de france they are good enough sauna is also had a room with a canal view and it was simply fantastic mini bar could have been bit colder just my personal preferences,1
33,staff are so warm and caring place is a work of art and in the absolute best location so happy i discovered it vibe they have created is elegant but so comfortable and cozy i would ever want to stay somewhere else,1
34,never seen a hyatt run hotel like this one alice in wonderland with a sexy dark edge very artsy with glamorous chandeliers stylized chairs and sofas and eclectic art i loved it but it wo be everyone cup of tea not my parents sort of hotel the staff are great and the cookies and coffee at reception were welcomed the gym is adequate a couple treadmills a stationary bike an elliptical machine dumbells and a weight machine it clean and nice with stylishly painted walls but pretty cramped free bottles of flat and sparkling water and apples at the entrance add to a spa ambiance hotel has free bikes but they were gone when we wanted to use them,1
35,a really lovely quirky place with great service and a lovely breakfast quite pricey but they often do deals well designed quite eccentric and the rooms are perfect very cleverly laid out it in a great position hard to fault and genuine value for money considering the quality,1
36,this is a very comfortable ultra modern buzzy hotel we were greeted by very friendly professional staff upon arrival and this continued during our stay soft drinks and snacks are available free of charge and wine is served in the library from pm every day very pretty garden spacious bedroom comfortable bed and pillows but the design of the bathroom did not do it for us robes and slippers supplied excellent buffet breakfast could not better the central location being within walking distance of most attractions very pleasant sitting in the bar at dusk watching the boats go by on the canal,1
37,as soon as you walk in this hotel you are treated like you are supposed to excellent service rooms are comfy and hotel has a great location room was good size for yes bathroom is not separated from bed with a door or wall but that called creativity different modern this hotel is elegant yet hipster fancy i found it to have great location went walking everywhere even at night breakfast is worth it great service too never seen a complete team to be able to work together and provide excellent customer service you dont see this in any other hotel i do recommend this hotel,1
38,outstanding really this is one of the best hotels we have ever been too since the check in we both felt really welcomed manuel and all the staff were very kind our room with canal view was more than we expected plus the garden and bar were also one of a kind the hotel is a complete experience i just hope i can be back again soon,1
39,we stayed at the andaz hotel as we wanted to be in central amsterdam the location is fantastic people were very helpful rooms are small but so well designed they do seem small everything is modern and clean definitely would stay here again when visiting amsterdam,1
41,modern hotel and very beautiful stylish decor very good restaurant open kitchen with excellent quality modern rooms but not very practical for those who travel with children only negative is the reception that counts on the official to check in check out help with the bags need officials for these functions,1
42,if you want a fabulous amsterdam hotel on a beautiful canal with excellent service and accommodation you will be very pleased with the andaz we have been to amsterdam a number of times and have enjoyed each visit but the location and ambience of this hotel are very special between the atmosphere of the jordaan district the nine shopping streets and with a short walk to the old center of the city you could not ask for a better location wonderful buffet breakfast free wine in the library an incredible open concept bar lounge serving carefully made cocktails and comfortable although somewhat quirky rooms not a problem and a very helpful group of young staffers should put this property on the top of your list,1
43,amazing design former public library which has been transformed into a star hotel in the heart of amsterdam overlooking the canal i love the creativity of the design which defines this hotel on the practical side staff are stars in the helpfulness and friendliness ranking rooms are not very large but large enough to accommodate my yoga mat and swinging hands around shower is amazing toiletries are all luxurious balenciaga,1
44,this is an average of two stays once in december and one recently in july in december everything was perfect we were truly impressed for a great christmas stay when the hotel was fairly empty the design location perks and happy hour comfort and service were exploring the garden is a must the above were true this month except for service as this visit had a few issues we requested early based on an early flight but it ended up being late day the other things were anything to do with room service took extraordinarily long and housekeeping could have done a better job of cleaning under the bed from a previous guest all of these might be explained by the hotel being fully booked and especially busy and the front desk was appropriately apologetic when notified upon checkout we would stay again but would hope it is more consistent for a five star hotel,1
45,great hotel beautiful surroundings comfortable beds extremely friendly staff free happy hour free mini bar for snacks in the room free bottled water no other hotel offers these great recommend this highly,1
46,great hotel hip hyatt we stay here when in amstrdam have connecting rooms with kids breakfast is fantastic buffet but a classy and serious buffet although the wait is sometimes too long for the coffee order think housekeeping can also be more proactive in putting new soap we stay at least a week when we are in amsterdam shampoo and cleaning up empty bottles etc if the hotel sends up for example a piece of and you take one bite they will leave it in your room for days so housekeeping needs a bit more attention and please please please do turn off my air conditioning by taking out the room key from the electrical trigger thingie i hate coming back to my room and having to wait two hours before the temperature is back to where i want it,1
47,we were guests at the andaz the first week in july the first thing we noticed is that there is no obvious front desk you instead find a comfortable couch and are greeted by one of the hosts and are checked in from where you are seated the property is very well taken care of and the rooms are spacious and modern the staff is most helpful friendly and do go out of their way to be sure your stay is as perfect as possible i recommend this lovely hotel,1
48,a cross between allison wonderland and some famous dutch architect and artist turned into one of the coolest hotels we ever stayed in from the moment we walked in we were greeted extremely kind leave by the front desk team and as our rooms were quite ready we walked over to the bar and the bar will likely become one of the top in the world next year in my opinion all members of the staff go out of their way to do anything they can to make your stay more enjoyable more comfortable and more fun without question this will be the only place we stay in amsterdam going forward,1
49,very nice hotel fell in love at first sight such a great atmosphere and amazing design inspired by alice the wonderland food was very good too would recommend staying in the hotel as well as coming for aperitivo very cool,1
50,i recently stayed at the hoxton during a celebratory trip to amsterdam with my boyfriend from the very beginning of our stay the staff made everything special we arrived at the hotel waayyy before and the man at the desk offered us bottles of water and a friendly conversation considering this was our first real contact with someone in this country he made us optimistic about what we were to experience they were able to watch our bags as we set out for the day when we checked in later on they made the process smooth and quick our room was incredible a roomy canal view on the third floor and they even left us balloons for our celebration our view was wonderful and made our vacation really meaningful one thing i might suggest planning ahead for is the breakfast bag my boyfriend could eat the yogurt so all he had for breakfast was orange juice and a small banana for some it would be perfect but we needed to find some other options overall a wonderful experience would absolutely stay again,1
52,we loved it super friendly people location is min walking to everywhere they provide snacks fresh orange juice min free international calls each day and free bottled water we took two rooms one was ok size the other one was small our room seemed to be beside the room house keeping which was noisy,1
53,when we return to amsterdam we will certainly book a room in the hoxton again thanks for the service all the tips and tricks and above all thanks for your kind help with the wheelchair this was a rocking amsterdam on wheels truus hannah belgium,1
54,i love the london hoxton to meet up with friends this time we met in amsterdam in the lobby with great interior déco the atmosphere is good the staff is very attentive but i miss the extra excellence of the london branch for dutch standards it above par,1
55,i do think we ever had a better check in before at any hotel even at fancier hotels at check in the attendant offered tips on his favorite restaurants in town the cool spots to he marked a map for us that we used all weekend even though we been to amsterdam many times before but the leads gave us great intel into the city as it is at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the entire weekend and to top it off they left a note and dutch cookies in our son room welcoming him back to his birth city i must have mentioned it over the phone because i was trying to get a specific set of rooms and online they were sold vibe of the hotel is very cool and reminds us of the ace hotel from our home town style and amenities are on point hour mini bar at the front desk free calls overseas wifi bagged breakfast to go hanging outside your room in the morning they had a dj both nights we were there and the bar was a great place to be however the sound did carry at all so sleeping was would absolutely recommend staying at the hoxton and will plan to stay there when we fly through amsterdam again in a few months,1
56,we stayed for nights in early july overall the hotel has a hip vibe and is clean and very had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine the front desk staff was attentive and careful what you ask for my wife wanted a tub so we requested the tubbie room one of the only rooms with a tub it is on the top floor in the back building and requires a flight of stairs to get to once you are out of the elevator inside the room there is a very small entry that is dark and the light switch is hard to find and another very narrow spiral staircase up to the attic where the room is so no matter what you have flights of stairs to get to this room in the room there are several beams going across it at a height of less than if you are that tall you will have to duck several times when walking across the room the tv is obstructed by those is no closet or dresser only an open structure with of pole space and a couple of hangers there is no place to put suitcases the lighting in the room is door to the bathroom is translucent and unfortunately the toilet is right beside the door so anyone in the room has a full if cloudy view of whoever is on the toilet and what they are doing the bathtub is a claw foot type and is out,1
57,i stayed in many hotels in amsterdam and nothing come close to the hoxton the staff are amazing the rooms are amazing and the location is just perfect the last time i stayed the food was good but nothing to write home about i decided to eat there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had upped their culinary game i went for the baby octopus which was incredible and recommended to me by mindy who was rad and made sure i was left feeling like a billy whilst eating on my own the stroopwaffles left on my desk in my room was a real touch ca wait to go back,1
58,it was our first time staying at the hoxton hotel and what a fantastic hotel nothing was too much for them staff were all very helpful and efficient especially stephanie on reception we ca wait to return,1
59,we chose the hoxton mainly for the location which meant we could walk everywhere we had a top floor roomy room for nights with fantastic canal views with a very nice shower and a comfortable bed but i suppose overall the room was quite basic the interior style was very much along the lines of soho house a basic room and the pig chains with fewer frills and nothing wrong with that our only real negative was that our roomy room wasn t particularly roomy as we were in the eaves we had restricted head height on one side of the bed which became a bit annoying after a while overall though this hotel has a very happy and relaxed vibe with a sense of fun you can t fail to have a nice time in amsterdam using this as a base and we d definitely be very happy to return,1
60,we had a nice room that looked over the canal spacious could use a dresser but it did really matter the staff was excellent especially dominique at the front desk she steered us in the right direction for food and local who took care of a lot of the dining room service was also stellar the food was very good especially the bitterballen the bar stayed open late and had a very nice vibe the clientele were very cool and well mannered to you could walk anywhere within minutes time,1
61,stayed here for three nights with family of four and absolutely loved the hoxton we had a canal view room and our teenagers had a twin both rooms seemed positively huge compared to similar priced places we had stayed in rome and paris and the fittings fixtures and decor were more five star than many actual five star hotels i have stayed in the attention to detail is amazing with beautiful linen and towels excellent roomy bathrooms and very stylish decor location is great just an easy walk from central station and right in amongst great places to eat and shop saving the best til last the staff were amazing genuinely friendly and helpful stephanie who checked us in was so welcoming and of the top end hotel operators need to come and stay here and learn about real hospitality i can not recommend the hoxton highly enough one of if not the best hotels i have stayed anywhere in the world,1
62,we loved everything about this hotel but have to give a special shout out to evelien who took so much time and care preparing a list of wonderful suggestions for us we were the couple heading to iceland i have never experienced better service in a hotel our room was perfect and the location of the hotel could not have been better little touches like the complementary bottled water were much appreciated,1
63,oh the hoxton how i will miss you this was a wonderful hotel experience how you might ask maybe it all began with which was quick and efficient we had an early and the room was ready and then lovely room a large and tastefully decorated room with massive floor to ceiling windows overlooking the herengracht canal and romantic century burghers homes across the way this has to be the best room in the hotel with both the bedroom and gloriously large bathroom overlooking the canal and with a small juliet balcony off of the bedroom the king bed was firmly comfortable and covered in luxurious white cotton sheets the room has which is important in the humid summertime and a flat screen tv if you like that sort of thing bag breakfasts arrive at your door with yogurt and bananas in the morning and there is coffee in the room but the part that makes it special a pint of fresh milk for your coffee why does every hotel do this there is also unlimited bottled flat and sparkling water again every hotel should do this downstairs there is a fun and lively bar and restaurant with reasonable prices that seemed to be a hot spot for hanging out the hotel location is also fantastic not far from the trams and shopping oh i almost forgot they have four free bicycles available for their guests to use ilovethehoxton minor complaints to get to room you get off of the,1
64,we stayed here for my graduation trip and dominique who helped us check in not only spent time giving us suggestions and information about amsterdam she also left me a mug and a sweet hand written postcard in my room to congratulate me the entire staff was very friendly the atmosphere in the hotel was great and it is located in a great location right on one of the canals we would definitely stay here again,1
65,imagine you are on a destination amsterdam consisting of only the groom best man for days we did and chose the hoxton as our hotel recommended by the groom himself who had stayed there before this is a hotel review i just keep it at that a few days before we arrived i sent an email to the hotel requesting the groom be given special outstanding service and a few bits and bobs for the groom including a plate of curry and chips which i felt were symbols of some of the unique quirky aspects that reflected our year friendship evelien was the first to respond and did so with such genuine enthusiasm that i got an immediate insight to the warm hospitable culture there the email correspondences from the various rostered staff afterwards carried on the attitude from evelien so when we arrived and the groom sauntered into his hotel room there waiting for him were the curry chips sitting on a tray and piping hot with the other items which had been arranged between the hoxton and i we were blown away and the groom was treated like a king for the duration of our to the hoxton team evelien micha yorinda karim lennart diego you are a credit to your hotel we will remember our stay with you for decades to come so if you are looking for a hotel with a fantastic central location with a cool buzzy vibe funky decor with quirky detailing friendly and,1
66,we arrived to the hotel very early and the receptionist still tried to get us a room although she could they were very helpful in taking our bags and recommending places for us to visit she really went out of her way to help which was a great start to our trip we had the smaller of the rooms but found that there was plenty of room for us it was very clean and put together excellently the hotel bar and restaurant were also very nice not the cheapest but good value for the quality you get,1
67,the hoxton has just the right blend of shoreditch cool mixed with friendly knowledgable staff i would definitely stay here rooms are a little bit eclectic but brilliantly thought out the only negative if i had one is that i find the hoxton brand menus a little bit short and controversial but overall i love this joint,1
68,on first arriving you ca miss the general and continuous buzz of hotel guests lounging eating drinking talking and generally enjoying the public areas of the hotel artsy and funky this gem is right in the canal district centrally located they are very concerned about your comfort and offer extras like a breakfast bag you put your bag on your door and in the morning they provided basics like a banana oj yogurt and granola we had a canal view room and really enjoyed our stay it definitely has a shabby chic and super hip vibe,1
69,loved the hoxton and was very much looking forward to our stay there very hip with all the amenities great staff and service and in a great part of town would highly recommend based on issues regarding check in though that wasted about mins on arrival trying to find our reservation and was only compensated with drink it was extremely stressful to go through that process and repeat ourselves to levels of top of that we came back to our room one day to find it open major concerns regarding security as anyone could walked in and stolen something,1
70,everything about this hotel is just lovely great staff great location food and the room defiantly worth upgrading to a canal view it really sets the amsterdam mood love the breakfast bags in the mornings and the bar makes the best cocktails especially their old fashion it our second stay and definitely not our last,1
71,i met a girlfriend and her daughter here for a birthday weekend for the year old and we all enjoyed our stay immensely the hoxton was recommended by some friends of theirs and with no expectations i was thoroughly impressed by this hotel and had a wonderful stay we had room between the of us and both were completely happy with the rooms we had the staff was helpful and friendly they were very knowledgeable as well they helped up book a few things and ensured we knew how to get to the places we were going the staff in the bar was friendly as well the rooms were clean and both my friend and i had canal views that were just gorgeous the bed was comfortable the bathroom was big enough to maneuver in and the room was spacious enough to manage in even though listed as cozy it felt spacious i need to mention the view again totally worth ensuring you get a canal view the breakfast options and delivery to the door as well as the water and mils sticked in the fridge are nice touches that we really appreciated we are still talking about our stay weeks later and how much we loved this hotel and get back to amsterdam i will be staying here,1
72,enjoyed the location and helpful staff the hotel was within walking distance to everything and very trendy restaurant food was delicious and the bar was a popular area to hang out front desk staff shared many helpful tips and recommendations,1
73,recommended by a friend we spent four nights at the hoxton the staff is superb everyone is friendly and helpful and full of great recommendations for restaurants and things to do around town the location is in the canal section of town and second to none in terms of centrality and the ability to walk wherever you had breakfast at the hotel restaurant our first morning and like most other meals in amsterdam it was perfectly cooked plated and presented by a great wait staff the room we had faces the canal and though small has everything you need as well as an incredibly comfortable bed i having a hard time thinking of a negative aspect to this hotel but if there is i say the ac in the room could be more consistent some nights it was great other nights not so good aside from that this is a terrific place to stay when in amsterdam and we would definitely stay here again if we return,1
74,we loved this hotel it had a cool vibe with an artistic edge the staff was helpful our room was very nice they have a very nice bar area and good food it was in a great location walking distance from most attractions like ann frank museum,1
76,my husband and i stayed here for four nights and will definitely be returning on our next trip to amsterdam aside from the fabulous location on a beautiful canal within walking distance of all the major sights the hoxton anticipates all a traveler needs comfort good cheer cleanliness strong wifi quiet rooms and a quick breakfast delivered to your door to jumpstart your morning free cold water botttles as you going out the door for the day and an worth of free phone usage international as well are the frosting on the cake although there a lot going on downstairs in the evenings we never were disturbed by noise upstairs a special shoutout to michaela sp at the front desk who was so helpful and friendly we already looking forward to our next stay at the hox,1
77,a really lovely hotel in central amsterdam just fat enough from red light area easy walk to all museums and loads of bars and staff are all helpful and enthusiastic the rooms are modern clean and very comfortable the novel breakfast bag was a really nice idea and allowed a relaxed start to the day we did decide to have the cooked breakfast in the restaurant one morning and the food was excellent the only reason i have given top marks is that they forgot my croissant but i do hold it against them they are human we went to the beach on our last day a short train trip and we worth it the bars on the beach are fabulous makes uk seaside look very with grown up kids and partners to celebrate husband birthday and had a top weekend,1
78,i really enjoyed staying at this hotel the staff is very helpful and food served at the restaurant is very nice and i had the chance to taste cocktails made at the bar the frosé is delicious i highly recommend this place,1
79,what a great find in the heart of downtown amsterdam this hotel is quite old but has been done up marvellously into a chic and hip building we stayed in the cheapest twin room which was affectionately called the shoebox room by the lady who checked us in yes it is small but we never felt cramped or like we needed more space the bathroom is actually really big with a good shower the beds were comfy and the tv was a good size with a range of channels to pick from the walk to the dam and red light district is about mins while a walk to centraal station is mins a cute little breakfast bag was delivered to our door each morning with a delicious granola yoghurt banana and orange juice the staff are super friendly and spoke perfect english we loved our stay here and would highly recommend,1
80,very nice cute hotel with great location guys from reception desk karim and valentina are amazing so nice and friendly room is not big but stylish and pleasant service is good so very nice choice to stay here,1
81,we stayed in the hoxton amsterdam from july thru july the hotel is clean modern and comfortable the one caveat being that the cozy rooms are very small indeed we had requested a quiet room and early check in and got both the staff were extremely friendly and helpful a special thank you to william who was at the front desk early on a sunday morning when my wife became very ill and we needed advice on medical care he told us our options then at our request called a cab told the cabby where to take us and we were whisked off to a wonderful modern hospital where my wife received excellent care at a reasonable price later that evening hours later to be precise william was still on duty and noticed us dining in the hotel dining room he sent over complimentary drinks since as the waiter put it we had had a rough day then he came over to chat and asked us how we were doing service with a warm human touch thank you william the hotel restaurant and bar are great by the way with the bar known locally for its innovative cocktails the one thing to be aware of is that the cozy rooms are a tight fit for two people still this is central amsterdam right on one of the main canals within easy walking distance of dam square so you have to expect some all in all a wonderful hotel with outstanding,1
82,this fantastic hotel is an excellent spot to stay in amsterdam the staff is very friendly and went above and beyond to be helpful and welcoming our room was very trendy and they even provide a little breakfast yogurt banana fresh juice to your room each morning the attached restaurant was bustling in the evening and had a great vibe we would return in a heartbeat,1
83,i stayed at this hotel several times over the years it a fun hotel with a perfect location for tourists close to the action but without being directly in the madness that is central if you want that only walk a few blocks the streets area where it located is quiet but has many shops and dining opportunities and the location on a canal is i return to this hotel because of all this the friendly staff and frankly it a bargain compared to the high prices in amsterdam thanks for another nice stay,1
84,i paid a lot for my room i was happy to do this because i value soon discovered that this hotel lacked service average rooms poor breakfasts i cringe when i think about wasting a night on a bad nights sleep the staff the service the attitude all that of a lower priced you get a good deal go for it if you paying over you can do better,0
85,really the hoxton is like the person i want to marry thoughtful beautiful smart anticipating of my needs fun to be around we only have known each other for four nights but i think it could work out seriously it like someone interviewed me and designed a space around my preferences retro energetic and staffed with thoughtful staff i recommend the hoxton to any adult traveller seems less ideal for families valentina was an enthusiastic and informative front desk attendant a among of hip attentive staff the bar area has a bit of a buzz and and prepared cocktails it kind of reminded me of a trendy nyc boutique hotel without all the attitude that often comes with that in amsterdam over a four night stay the hoxton was located in an ideal location that felt intimate and was a close walk to all the large tourist areas the streets around it are like postcards for amsterdam recommended without reservation until i make my next one,1
86,this hotel has a very cool vibe even though it is located within extremely old buildings we stayed for just one night between the cruise ship and flying home our room was a shoebox room which turned out to be very spacious especially after being two weeks in a stateroom the bathroom was huge we had two meals in the restaurant downstairs and both were very good very friendly helpful staff being able to call the us free of charge from the room phone was an unexpected delight free continental breakfast and bottled water also an unexpected extra,1
87,hotel has a really nice atmosphere when you enter the lobby bar area is bustling with people having a good time the rooms are decorated in a unique sort of vintage hotel is really well run some good ideas excellent service and rooms are very you can book a room with a canel view have the lovely reasonably priced breakfast in the restaurant and on one evening enjoy the jazz in the lobby with a cocktail,1
88,cafe bar and restaurant seems quite trendy place to hang out it is always bustling with internationals and amsterdammers amazing location right on the canal artsy magazines in the rooms and the complementary breakfast bag are the cherry on top,1
89,friendly staff and a very warm welcome this hotel was gorgeous had a room on the fifth floor and they had also allocated our friends a room on the same floor which was thoughtful loved the little touches in the room from the crap drawer to the fantastic hairdryer the bar upstairs was a perfect spot to unwind after a busy day and the spicy chicken wings were amazing super comfy beds with massive pillows and all this in a wonderful location which is close to everything thank you x,1
90,what a great hotel and great people the rooms lobby and restaurant added to the overall feel get the pancakes if you eat breakfast in the restaurant i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there was an enjoyable visit,1
91,the lobby has a great vibe trendy and inviting we enjoyed a fabulous breakfast upon arrival and later that night had tasty treats in the lounge we stayed in a cozy room and it was perfect had everything we needed staff was friendly and helpful brought us up some complimentary champagne as it was our anniversary would stay there again in a heartbeat,1
92,walking distance everywhere dam square red light are very close also close to transport for example tram bus train the last stop of the train from the airport is within walking distance in my opinion one of the rare quality and friendly hotels in the center,1
93,my wife and i had the most wonderful experience at the hoxton had a cozy room which was plenty big for the two of us and our huge suitcases had just come from paris and the hoxton room was much bigger in comparison the hotel itself was also very cool great music and drink scene at the bar downstairs and the breakfast and lunch offerings were some of the best food we had in amsterdam everyone at the front desk bar and restaurant were very helpful offering recommendations and were generally incredibly friendly location is also a huge plus right on the canals and plenty quiet at night but walking distance from all the restaurants and the city center the breakfast goodie bags they deliver to you each morning is a really nice touch will be returning to amsterdam in large part to our amazing experience at this hotel and we could imagine staying anywhere for such a great weekend,1
94,a group of visited for nights with of us per room the rooms varied in size and though some were perhaps on the small side my friend and i were fortunate enough to share a larger room which included a large bathroom plenty wardrobe space and a nespresso machine all of the rooms were very tasteful and clean and tidy being a large group of scottish girls we were rather noisy when getting ready for our nights out so we were advised on a few occasions to be quieter but staff were very pleasant about it which makes all of the difference the majority of time we got taxi into the centre though the heineken experience and some lovely bars and bakeries were close by would highly recommend this hotel and would consider returning again providing it was only to a room,1
95,my mum and i recently stayed in this hotel as a belated birthday celebration for nights on arrival i was greeted with amsterdam cookies and a souvenir mug as a birthday gift which i thought was very sweet we stayed in a ground floor room near reception the room was very small but i liked the modern decor and the bed was very comfortable the hotel is situated in a beautiful part of town i liked that the street was residential as i enjoy seeing how locals live it is a bit of a walk up to the top end of the town red light area especially for us as we got lost a lot the on hop off boat is good to use during the day but both nights we struggled to find our way back to this hotel as the streets look very similar at night we should maybe have looked into using the trams all in all this is a great hotel that met our needs i would stay here again as the part of town is picturesque and a lot nicer than the top end of the city we did eat in the hotel so i ca comment on that but all staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful,1
96,standard mercure hotel nothing special the location is good tucked away in the center of amsterdam near the canals the room is quite small but that is not unusual for typical hotels in amsterdam worth a visit,1
98,this is such a stunning hotel stayed there for nights in july and loved it the style the architecture the location and the service everything was up to the highest standards i did have the chance to try the food or the breakfast here but based on the hotel grounds and room i will definitely recommend it,1
99,for those interested in architecture the conservatorium is a feast for the eyes the blend of old and new is masterful even unique for a hotel it was exciting to walk through the portal and anticipate a luxurious experience did happen that way the room was extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient the corridors are gorgeous san ac that omission was a mistake maybe the ac was on the blink watch your step as you leave the room as a is not marked or illuminated i had a deluxe two floor suite with a view of the street a bit noisy but tolerable after climbing the steep stairs to the bedroom and having my luggage carried upstairs i went to unpack surprise the closets are on the first floor back down the steep staircase with my luggage in tow but how do you open the closets or turn the lights or even the tv my remote did work even the bedside lamp required instructions when using the desk it was inevitable that you hit your head every single time on the light fixture that hangs over the chair and my knee got a bruisin from hitting the desk drawer when trying to avoid the pendant light the furniture is low to the floor a trip factor comfortable to net the experience the designer thought about clever unusual or even and not guest convenience yeah there is a user manual to explain it all but who wants to read a manual for normally,0
100,located near most of the museums amazing architecture and lovely way of integrating multiple buildings into one hotel my room had a living room down and the bedroom was via a staircase rooms were large and the layout made it seem bigger i would definitely recommend this hotel a unique design and worth the spend,1
101,rooms are absolutely gorgeous had a deluxe room on the fifth floor with soaking tub and it was ultra modern and roomy front desk service was excellent as was breakfast location near museums was perfect for us highly recommend everything about this hotel was luxurious,1
102,this hotel is stunning architecturally inside and out and the service was great as we walked into the atrium upon arrival i was in amazed by the modern atmosphere while checking in we were all offered a glass of either water or apple juice and to have our luggage taken up to our building apparently used to be a music school so there are some nice heritage elements of the hotel such as the dimmer lit hallways with concrete pillars and mosaic floors and a violin chandelier just past the main to the lobby area the hotel room was very bright and modern we were four people in a suite which had two levels a lower level and a mezzanine i heard many rooms have steps so it be a good idea to ask the hotel for a room with no stairs if you have trouble climbing them the lower level had a bathroom television closet kitchen table bench mini bar and nespresso machine and couch which converts to a bed since we were four people we asked for an additional cot the mezzanine had a couch chair television king bed closet and a the aesthetically pleasing decor the advanced technology caused much frustration among all of us including millennials the day and night curtains are operated by a switch on the wall which did make sense to me when you can open the curtains manually twice as fast and decide how far open you want them the lights were,1
103,advised by my dutch chairman i decided to try this relatively new hotel in amsterdam located in the museum district near vodelpark it is an amazing place worth a visit to the lobby even if you are not a guest the lobby restaurant is amazing for light dinners and breakfast but the real gem is the gym incredibly equipped from technogym unica to trx and roller bring your swimming costume as the amazing deserted pool is worth it,1
104,i stayed here whilst on a business trip and glad i selected this hotel i was lucky to be upgraded to a two floor suite which was very comfortable hotel has a range of different features which you expect and was well positioned from what i know of amsterdam highly recommended if the price is in your range,1
105,everting was great the hotel is wonderful moderm and very well located very calm location near from museum and parks they have a very nice japanese restaurant inside the hotel breakfast is nice,1
107,very happy with my choice excellent location excelente rooms the hotel is very beautiful love the architecture everybody is helpful the gym and wellness center are perfect the room is impeccable love it recommend for everyone,1
108,recently stayed for two nights in a floor junior suite we were very pleased with our choice in terms of hotel facilities location and location is a good walk to the main canals and mins to the old city centre several meseums are within a walk and there are several end shops nearby the lobby and atrium areas are great the pool and spa equally so and not overcrowded despite a nearly full hotel as we were told our flight was early in the morning and we arrived at around at the hotel where we were pleasently suprised that our early request had been acommodated and we were immediately note that we booked through the hotel room was excellent great sound proofing quite with a flawless bathroom our junior suite had high ceilings and an exposed wooden beam frame plenty of room around excellent seating choices writing desk and lovely was good but we were not as enthusiastic with the choices or tastes as in other similar properties around the was impeccable throughout in stark contrast to some earlier comments here the staff went out of their way to assist in any way the could doing so with a genuine desire to please not tip definitely by back and have already recommended the conservatorium to friends visiting this great city in the future,1
109,nested in the angle of a canal in the heart of the old town the hotel de is pure class you really feel that this hotel is special not part of a chain or franchise privately owned by the heineken family and indeed originally used as the special venue to accommodate the founder guests the service is exceptionally charming the concierges really knowledgeable and willing to go the extra mile the food is superb and the waterside venue stunning the rooms are individual and stylish after years in different places in the city i have now unquestionably found my in amsterdam i would want to stay anywhere else,1
110,wonderful location dinner on the patio overlooking on of the canals was nice room was quite and comfortable morning breakfast was also very nice great selection the staff was top notch my wife forgot one of her prescriptions and the concierge arrange for her to see a physician who was able to prescribe what she needed we do keep pictures of our prescriptions on our phones,1
112,this hotel has everything great spa great food great service so very comfortable which was great after days in warzburg we walked in and although our room was not ready we had a drink at the bar and were taken on a tour of the hotel tom was our go to guy he is phenomenal and can help with anything the room was beautiful and comfortable we never waited for anything loretta gives a fantastic facial in the spa the staff at this hotel makes everything easy i wish i could give this hotel stars,1
113,we spent nights in this delightful hotel for us it combined the best of old europe with modern conveniencies ie a stunning water view and a state of the art staff was professional yet friendly and always achieved results,1
114,michelin starred restaurant closed for vacation not mentioned when booking concierge did not follow up when promised on a reservation we had to follow up on status they were unable to obtain a reservation day lost along with any chance to obtain a restaurant booking a street restaurant for us turn down service hit and miss omg the basics had to ask for that also in fact had to ask twice each time for the simplest of requests this hotel is living on a reputation and most certainly do not understand that a star reputation has to be earned every day that is why we pay so much who knows it may be your turn next to have our experience,0
115,hotel de has established a unique identity together offer a array of contemporary arts and classical had a pleasant stay at the penthouse the classic design and the modern design were mixed together and the result was the european modern classic interior design the furniture was not very modern but still comfy it was simple and has less carving on it the amenities were fantastic and so the bed was very comfortable throughout the penthouse carpeted flooring and a big painting on the wall help warm up the interior and white emphasize the clean lines of furnishings a warm earthier color set the tone on the walls of the living room area serving as an upbeat yet interesting background for furnishings in accent colors inspired by the outdoors a balcony with breathtaking the canal views illustrated a historic view of amsterdam sunsetting from this balcony was so relaxing this is what it is like imagining of living classical way in urban society my dinning experience at was perfect and spotless i highly recommend a business lunch at a romantic dinner at hofdstaad brasserie an dining experience offers a wide selection of chef specialities i would suggest to experience an authentic afternoon tea at hèt terrace and to chill out at freddy bar with friends or truly enjoyed everything that the city has to offer benefiting from the hotel perfect location touristic attractions like rijksmuseum and heineken experience are on walking distance i suggest to go for biking in the city,1
116,me and my husband booked for nights in may this the moment we arrived we felt relaxed and looked staff were amazing and polite our room was beautiful and had amazing was start to finish we loved every second so much so i couldnt wait to come back and bring my daughter are booked in for july and im really hopeful we will have the same experience,1
117,i was fortunate to stay here for one night this week and i was very impressed it i a beautiful hotel old but well maintained and very comfortable a great breakfast and the views of the canal from the terrace are fabulous,1
118,stayed here for nights great location terrace bar and restaurant lovely in the heart of the city with plenty of things to see and do would recommend boat trip from hotel euros each worth every penny hired bikes from hotel good rates overall lovely only small moan room service not the best dirty glasses not picked up some items not replaced or restocked,1
119,this hotel rocked if you are looking for rooms with tremendous size then you are not being realistic as that type of space does exist in amsterdam on the other hand the staff was very nice and accommodating we enjoyed the enjoyed the location we were able to walk everywhere would love to stay there again,1
120,this ranks as one of the biggest travel disappointments of my travel experiences i travel extensively and know what grand elegant service is like may have been a destination hotel in the nineteenth century but now it is tired stuffy dark dreary and flat from the poor food on the outdoor terrace to the roaches in our bathroom nothing about this is experience has a silver lining the woman at the bar acted like this was the last place she wanted to be even the housekeeping staff dropped the ball as towels were not refreshed and soaps not replenished when you add on top of this nose bleed prices it is time to retire this property the heineken family should know there is no fizz left in the bottle run do walk away for amsterdam has much better alternatives,0
121,not only did the hotel wow us with their amenities and comfortable accommodations but they really saved me i tell you how they went above and beyond what any hotel would do anywhere in the world i left my including my license work badge and debit card in a restaurant on our last night in amsterdam we were leaving the next morning before the restaurant opened at in the morning niels packaged up instructions for the morning staff to call the restaurant retrieve my belongings and then ship it back to our home they did all of it within hours or so and i safely received my package days later i will always stay at hotel estherea when i am in amsterdam customer for life,1
122,wow we were so impressed with our stay at hotel estherea the location is great the staff is lovely the rooms are clean and beautiful they offer complimentary tea and coffee the hotel is lavishly decorated the staff will help you book tours and they will hold your luggage if need be i plan to stay here again when i return to amsterdam,1
123,hotel estherea is a great hotel the location is perfect right on the singel canal and close to all the attractions markets the old fashion room keys with tassel classy the breakfast buffet was delicious we had it every morning the staff was so courteous and helpful with information about amsterdam i highly recommend hotel estherea for the perfect classic hotel,1
124,a small family run hotel rooms overlooking the singel canal at the front was the base for two nights in amsterdam for my daughter and self we chose a canal view room quite a good size beautifully decorated each room is i understand a different colour scheme nothing bland or neutral here the foyer lounge and library yes are just gorgeous with constant access to coffee hot chocolate and treats as well as options with water all self serve the best thing about hotel estherea is their attention to detail and willingness to accommodate their visitors needs nothing was too much trouble even though we arrived hours before time we were invited to enjoy coffee and treats while our room was made ready,1
125,we just spent nights at the elegant hotel estherea and were positively overwhelmed by everything this small hotel is lovely rooms are wonderfully appointed and uniquely decorated staff is quick knowledgeable and delightfully helpful the value for the price is awesome the tea room has all kinds of tea coffee fresh juices and gourmet light snacks available as is their beautiful bar the drinks and bar food were delicious and affordable too i recommend their mojito we found we liked their bar better than any other bar around and this hotel location is primo close to everything but on a quiet canal in a lovely neighborhood just one block away from restaurants shopping public transportation and two blocks from the amsterdam museum blocks to the flower market please do stay there we do want it to be booked solid the next time we try to make a reservation just kidding but we will always stay at hotel estherea in the future,1
126,i never written a review before but this hotel deserves it we have just returned from wonderful nights at the estherea having found the hotel after research on trip the moment you walk through the door you realise this hotel is something special all the staff are friendly and attentive and simply ca do enough for you there is a real sense of opulence and luxury about the hotel and attention to detail in both the lobby and rooms is fantastic nothing was too much trouble and the room we travelled as a family of adults and a child was amazing the beds and pillows are so comfortable and greatly appreciated after a tiring day exploring the city everything you ever need is in the room from hairdryer to nespresso machine others have commented on the size of the bathroom but ours was very large with double sinks and mirrors and a large bath and shower our room faced the orange courtyard but was quiet and very hotel is superbly situated and although we planned to use the trans to get to places this was necessary as everything was within walking distance even central station is only fifteen minutes walk with cases we took breakfast every morning and again this was superb wonderfully fresh squeezed orange juice hot food buffet selection of breads and amazing fresh fruit and chilled cheese and meat selection yummy something fir everyone the restaurant staff were so polite and extremely helpful we loved our stay,1
127,stayed nights with two rooms canal view room with small sitting area second room looked into what in nyc is called an air shaft the canal that the hotel is sitting on is not the prettiest of the central canals so the view is so so the canal view room has a tiny tv whereas the interior room has a large tv i suppose the idea was if you ca look out the window you can at least watch tv limited cable by the way good spot near the old city and the fashionable western canal rings you can walk to museums and central train without bags breakfast full on buffet was great nice staff they had to put up with so many complaints usually about nothing very nice canal ride from right in front better than love boats that a dutch name and the big tourist boat operator many good restaurants in area,1
128,we stayed in a junior suite as our daughter was travelling with hotel is on the canal and central for all the main city interior is sophisticated and well light with exotic plants and is a small koi pond by the bar is inviting and well is a free coffee facility in reception and there is always cakes and treats on the coffee reception staff are very room was excellent with a small balcony overlooking the would definitely recommend the hotel for a city cheap but worth it,1
129,my friend and i were put up by airbnb at the last minute in the orange suite due to trouble with our original host and we literally could not have been happier to be here i spare you the details and suffice to say that from the moment the hotel staff member opened the door to our room we could not keep our cool the hotel is within a five minute walk to dam square and a short twenty minute walk to the rijksmuseum the breakfast was well worth it with fresh squeezed orange juice and prosciutto staff was friendly and always willing to help us out it also right on the canal and very tastefully decorated our only complaint was that the suite was located on the ground floor and the foot traffic can be a little loud but we were so exhausted we barely noticed,1
130,couples stayed here for nights after finding on what a beautiful hotel decor is stunning rooms are typically narrow but lovely and treats staff are brilliant and will help with maps tickets tours restaurant bookings and airport a little on the pricey side but well worth to walk to from centraal station and very close to dam definitely stay again,1
131,this is a wonderful small boutique hotel in a great location in amsterdam we stayed here years ago and found it to be warm friendly and comfortable the have enlarged the bar area for evening enjoyment now and added a bar and goodies it only made the hotel better this is a great location we took the train from the airport where we stored our big bags and walked to the hotel with backpacks,1
132,due to the reviews from tripadvisor we booked this hotel for three days definitely well worth it the staff was amazing and went out of their way to help book museums restaurants and give us directions the staff spoke fluent english the hotel bar was magnificent plus beautiful and well decorated in a very unique and elegant way the hotel is located in a perfect part of town where you you can walk to all the attractions museums and restaurants,1
133,elegantly decorated friendly service good bed good breakfast because of construction under my apartment i stayed a night in this hotel near my place i was pleasantly surprised how nice this hotel was also good value i booked direct with the hotel which saved a lot of money compared to the booking sites,1
134,we had a deluxe room overlooking the canal the room was luxuriously appointed with a small chandelier over the bed and a nice sitting area the bath was compact but nice the lobby is very inviting and always had pastries cookies or sweets out great breakfast and service,1
135,stayed in august a very well located hotel with beautiful rooms and helpful staff the free cakes and tea are that little touch that makes the stay even more memorable it was also great value for money would recommend,1
136,after disembarking our celebrity silhouette cruise ship we checked into the hotel estherea i thought we must be in the wrong place it was so beautiful elegant and luxurious it very small being three townhouses combined but it is gorgeous warm and friendly the staff was wonderful and we loved every minute thank you for a great stay,1
137,we had a wonderful four nights at hotel estherea and i would highly recommend this hotel the cleaning staff kept the rooms wonderfully clean the concierge staff were all super helpful and could do enough to make sure the stay was excellent the coffee and afternoon snacks is a wonderful treat the morning breakfast was of great quality and enjoyable each day the rooms and common areas are all beautifully decorated a truly wonderful hotel,1
138,we booked into the hotel estherea in amsterdam at the start of a long european adventure it was pricey but so worth it first of all on checking in we were informed we were being upgraded to a superior room which turned out to be a room what a pleasure to open the curtains in the morning to look out on the singel canal with its canal boats tied up below one abiding memory of this hotel is the decor completely over the top but it works our room was like a tropical pleasure garden all yellow green and orange the bathroom was tiny but functional the staff were pleasant and best thing was the hotel proximity to the entertainment shopping and restaurant area as well as easy access to the main attractions and the railway heartily recommend hotel estherea for an enjoyable stay in amsterdam,1
139,highly recommend i spent nights here touring amsterdam and other areas the hotel is on a quiet street within walking distance to most attractions tons of shops and restaurants nearby yes the first day i was annoyed to leave my key at the desk when you leave but that subsided what a treat to walk and tour all day and come back to a beautiful lobby with hot chocolate etc and treats to eat as others have said lobby has chocolates and treats cake cookies out for the taking breakfast was lovely and delicious bathrooms are very small but completely updated we had a canal view room it was quiet and bed so comfortable frankly this was the perfect hotel for amsterdam and i highly recommend,1
140,this is a beautiful and elegant hotel in a great location in amsterdam the interior of the common areas is stunning with its old world elegance the bedrooms are nicely appointed there is a great bar with pleasant service people,1
141,i was in amsterdam alone for a week and split my stay here and at a more modern hotel this hotel was gorgeous one of the best beds ever and gorgeous bathroom products opening windows cakes and coffee complimentary throughout the day just gorgeous i recommended it to my friend months later in peak season and it was x what i paid just goes to show what it is stay again,1
142,we stopped in amsterdam after a day cruise i had found hotel estherea by doing research and would highly recommend to anyone traveling to beautiful is centrally located tastefully decorated has beautifully appointed rooms with comfy beds and extremely courteous and bar are a plus and lobby area is spacious with to rooms with everything in ur living room computer printer and books they always had water refreshments and snacks on hand during the will definitely be back book directly with hotel when you reserve way you get later checkout vs and cheaper breakfast rates,1
143,hotel was fantastic we started in a patio room which was over looking a light well view was very poor had to keep the curtains closed at all times the room was change at no additional cost to one one the fifth floor a room with fantastic decor light and airy the whole hotel is decorated to a very high the range of food was hotel staff were very helpful would recommend this hote if we return to amsterdam we will,1
144,beautiful hotel with decorations worth a stop to appreciate courteous staff that is always there with a smile comfortable rooms including the bed with nice view of canal they offer an airport pickup that we were unaware of but will try next time,1
145,stayed two nights at the end of a long river cruise and loved it centrally located and within easy walking distance to great restaurants the spui tram stop is a min walk depending on how many time you must stop to dodge bicycles making the museumplein a cinch to reach our room on floor level was beautifully appointed and faced the canal the bed and linens were first rate and the bathroom was extraordinary lots of nice touches like candies and cookies available all day in the lobby the staff was uniformly charming and helpful staying here is the perfect antidote to mediocre tourist hotels do yourself a favor and give it a try,1
146,stayed here as our daughter was working in amsterdam and we were visiting for a long weekend and had things to see before we met up with location walkable to where we needed to go and well known enough to ensure the uber drivers could pick us up and drop us appointed room but due to the age of the building a slightly unusual layout but the bed was had just refurbished the bar area which is very nice when we were there and husband and daughters boyfriend watch the rugby in my ipad while my daughter and i sampled the cocktail menu which was very good unfortunately due to the layout the nice big comfy table could be seen from the bar but once you got their attention they were friendly and hotel would go back,1
147,this is a beautiful hotel on a lovely elegant charm is mixed with modern convenience most travelers would expect my husband and i stayed in the hotel for nights before boarding our viking river cruise was quick and easy all hotel staff we encountered during our stay spoke english and were quite helpful the huge brass room key is accompanied by a key card that unlocks you room door if you leave the hotel you drop your key by the front desk and retrieve it upon returning to the hotel we had no issues or long waits with this we had a room on the second floor overlooking the canal i would recommend a canal view room it was quiet and one of the expansive windows opened to allow for fresh air to come in the system is a mini machine by us standards but the temperatures do not call for a turbo there was a large duvet and a rather rough bed spread on the double bed in our room i would have enjoyed if a flat sheet was included in the bedding otherwise the bed was not only beautiful but also quite comfortable despite its diminutive size two water bottles are replenished daily in a rather large wall beverage fridge it seems like a rather large system to fill with two measly bottles of water the bathroom in our room was extremely small but well equipped and it appeared to have been recently renovated the combo was tight,1
148,we loved everything about the hotel there was nothing to be a bit unfair to name two of the staff members they were all so good but martin and eric on arrival and check in stood had a fantastic room on the floor the room was larger than we expected and it was really great to have a separate bathroom shower and bath and breakfast was superb and well priced for the buffet full selection of hot and cold breakfasts at bar is so eclectic and very beautifully hour access to the coffee hot chocolate machines in the lobby with biscuits and other snacks is a bonus we did use the nespresso machine in the room hotel is perfectly positioned within easy walking distance to any of the major sites it about m from dam there are numerous good restaurants within to m from the is one of the best hotels we have stayed in we prefer smaller boutique hotels to the larger chains and estherea fits the bill perfectly,1
149,singel canal is an amazing location with flower market at one end and central station the other has red light brothels cafes and restaurants churches and arts eclectic like all of the netherlands our delux rooms were a decent size some with spa ordinary rooms you would struggle to have two suitcases open at the same time staff are brilliant decor is extravagant old world charm elevators minute taxi service ca fault the place,1
150,my wife and i booked three nights at the love boutique hotels but hotel estherea was perfect it starts with the service and attitude of all the staff always welcoming pleasant and at a high level of room was beautiful and decorated and the bed was very coffee and cookies area in the lobby is really pleasant and the breakfast is very you want to enjoy amsterdam and not just the city then this is the hotel for you,1
151,right on the singel canal and right opposite the sts shopping precinct this hotel is in a great spot the decor is exceptional and every room is beautifully appointedit is actually a treat to hang out in the lounge or bar where you can have very nice cocktails breakfast is excellent but the coffee pod machine makes horrible coffee which is such a pity for an australian visitor can buy good coffee around the corner though,1
152,we stayed two night at the hotel estherea it is located in the heart of amsterdam and we walked everywhere the hotel lobby was gorgeous and the bar and restaurant were very good they have a free machine in the lobby that was great and made really good coffees and lattes etc the room was quaint and beautifully decorated the bathroom was large and updated the only negatives were the free wifi and the noise outside on the street the wifi dropped constantly and very frustrating to our room was on the backside of the hotel ant the street was quiet when we checked in that changed dramatically in the evening and was very noisy late into the night i recommend a room on the front or interior of the hotel,1
153,my friends and i stayed at hotel estherea for three nights as a stopover prior to visiting africa the hotel was lovely they serve coffee lattes and tea in the foyer along with delicious biscuits the hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk everywhere on my first night a group of people decided to have a party on the street below my window so my first night was not restful although the room was lovely the following day i requested a room change and the desk staff could not have been more accommodating the hotel also provided me with an electrical adaptor as none of the three i had with me were compatible i would certainly return to this hotel in the future highly recommend,1
154,a fantastic star hotel in the hub of amsterdam above the usual crowne plaza standard with spacious comfy quiet and clean bedrooms bar and restaurant were friendly nice atmosphere and varied menu and drink car park is for the night as i was on a family trip could put on business expenses this was a real shock when checking out so moral of the story is fantastic hotel do take your car,1
155,very nice approach of the hotel staff nice clean and quiet hotel even if not in centre easily to get there by metro minutes ride direct line zuit station you can buy tickets at the hotel reception ticket for rai exhibition centre is about minutes by metro min walk to metro min in the metro minutes walk to rai by taxi it is about min there are offices area nearby the hotel quick snacks restaurants food shop schiphol airport is about minutes drive taxi,1
156,my husband and i wanted a quiet getaway but unfortunately on saturday the construction started at am i had asked for a quiet room and indeed inside the hotel it was but the construction noise is very loud the bedroom was comfortable and the only downside was the safe that did not work and we found the towels not up to a star standard staff around the hotel very friendly,1
157,it vey good hotel and our room was suite it very nice and comfortable some help desk staff was very bad and they do have customer service skills hotel managers should look for this pointe,1
158,stayed here in may for two nights saturday and sunday check in was quick and efficient and the staff could not be nicer the room on the floor was large with a very deep tub and excellent bathroom nice touch of aromotherapy sprays for the pillows we went for my birthday and was given a small treat of waffles and some chocolates which was very thoughtful left bags in the afternoon until the flight home not in the centre put the train from the aiprort took ten minutes ten mintue walk to the hotel from the zuid station from zuid the number metro took you all the way to the centre excellent option if the centre is too busy or expensive breakfast was shocking at per person per day so we did try this out would recommend,1
159,really good hotel staff very helpful room and facilities excellent lunch buffet could offer more varied options but overall excellent hotel good location but taxi needed bar exclellent facilities for gym although i did not partake,1
160,i stayed in this hotel for nights with my family it was very clean and big hotel the room was big and clean enough the breakfast was very good but the worst point about this hotel was the location it is out of city and you should use train to get to city center which is difficult,0
161,we were so glad we chose this hotel just out of town and in a business district that had plenty of good restaurants and bars and was very handy to the station it also gave us easy access to schipol airport and the keukenhof garden,1
162,the crowne plaza is located in a quiet neighborhood in amsterdam zuid good place for sleeping and decent breakfast easy to get around the city by public transport and convenient location for getting to and from the airport good service,1
163,the hotel and the staff exceeded our expectations during a night stay in the area the rooms are spotlessly clean and well appointed located in the business district just minutes from the local train metro stations ideal for travel both to the city and airport the breakfast was amazing and evening dinner was exceptional highly recommend,1
164,great hotel and very helpful staff room was clean and we were well taken care of i had issues to get the in room coffee machine to work breakfast was nice and the restaurant had a nice view over the channel i would only hope they kept the food preparation area cleaner that was not hygienic at all,1
165,as a ihg elite member we have been lucky enough to stay at a number of crowne plaza hotels and i really have to say amsterdam south is our number one following our family weeks stay from the july until the july rooms on the and floors were perfect had everything we needed were quiet and were impeccably cleaned and made up every day when the hairdryer broke just one call to reception and a replacement was in the room within minutes a crisis diverted the meal choices were all you could ask for with breakfast and dinner within the hotel providing excellent choice and quality of food presentations it surpassed even our high expectations congratulations to all of us would very much like to thank everyone on the front desk and housekeeping for providing great customer service and those little touches that mean so much to a guest we would like to highly recommend angela cindy and annelieve hovenor for exceptional service at every breakfast time and michael behind the hot plates they deserve individual recognition miss not certain why other contributors have criticised the hotels location yes its outside of the city centre but you know this before you make a reservation it is perfect for the peace and quiet it brings and its location within the business district gives one a great insight into the modern architectural building designs being brought into the five minute stroll from the hotel in one direction and you can catch the,1
166,we were visiting amsterdam to celebrate some special birthdays and chose a this hotel to treat ourselves we were disappointed the rooms were very comfortable with everything you could need to enhance your stay what made it for us though was the attitude of the staff all were friendly efficient and very helpful we would definitely recommend this hotel,1
167,a lovely hotel outside the main tourist area but connections are really easy we had access to the lounge too which was nice a lovely breakfast too we hired bikes which was great fun and easy to use,1
168,stayed here on a weekend break absolutely loved the location and our view overlooking a canal our room was spacious and nicely furnished the bathroom the same the public areas were very nice serre restaurant was great for a light lunch and the breakfast was one of the best i ever had at a hotel a visit to twenty third bar is recommended if you get the chance,1
169,our tour company choice this is a sleek luxury hotel but further from central city than we choose though there a tram stop almost opposite and we used taxis to save time our room was as stylish and tastefully decorated as you expect and windows with electric blinds onto the bathroom gave the impression of even greater space the bed was perfect and the large picture window gave us a lovely view of a small canal staff were very helpful and the buffet breakfast was excellent,1
170,this was our second year we stayed at the okura and we were not disappointed the hotel is impeccable the lobby is beautifully decorated in a subtle asian influence we stayed in the executive level and had the most amazing canal view room and had no problem drinking the good wines and japanese beers from the lounge after our long walks through the city and my crazy fun shopping escapades the hotel is located in a great location that has a lot of along with amazing bars and restaurants they have a really nice and modern gym along with very knowledgeable trainers we really enjoyed adinia this gal was beyond fit and great to chat with we can not wait to go back one to stay at the okura and of course to visit my dutch family the highlight of our return trip was meeting up with michael who works in guest service man is the absolute best he has the best restaurant recommendations and knowledge of the area we will miss him,1
171,we stayed here one night as our main hotel we were spending a few days in was booked out for the first night this hotel was really a great surprise we thought it would just be a corporate business hotel feel but the service was warm and welcoming rooms spacious and the japanese restaurant a must try,1
172,lovely hotel will definitely come back staff very helpful and knowledgeable about local transport and attractions the room was exceptionally well equipt the bed was turned down and slippers provided along with a bookmark the room had a great city view,1
173,i arrived in amsterdam on my first trip to europe and stayed for three nights in this wonderful hotel it conveniently located close to major tourist attractions i like to have a healthy breakfast and my needs were met with a buffet selection of an extensive variety of cereals seeds fruits and vegetables,1
174,we stayed here for two nights before we joined our river boat vacation and it was wonderful attentive staff well appointed rooms with very comfortable beds huge breakfast buffet two other restaurants close enough to the old city to walk and an interesting area ask for a room that faces the canal and you really feel like you in amsterdam,1
175,we stayed at the okura for the second time in july for our wedding anniversary this year we first visited three years ago and had such find memories that we thought we try it so pleased we did it such a beautiful and stylish hotel and in the best location the surrounding area has numerous bars restaurants and coffee shops and a tram line almost right outside so you do have to go right into the centre if you do want to we emailed the hotel to tell them it was our anniversary prior to going and they could have done more to make it special for us they upgraded our room to a suite which was absolutely very large with living room area and fabulous bathroom with tv huge shower and bath they also left a cake and fresh rose in our room which was a lovely welcome having an upgraded room allows you access to the lounge which is completely worth upgrading for lovely lounge room with great views complimentary alcohol soft drinks snacks tea coffee papers and internet very welcome after a long day or sightseeing the concierge were absolutely brilliant and recommended the perfect restaurants attractions and provided us with tram bad to say about the okura at all really lovely hotel brilliant location amazing staff and a very special place ca wait to go back,1
176,hotel is average with decent sushi restaurant but reception has no manners when i was checking in the reception worker was chatting with someone not working in the hotel and mentioned my nationality to the friend in dutch i do know what else they were talking about but i felt they were mocking me for some reason,0
177,this hotel has everything from three restaurants with together michelin stars to excellent service we had booked two rooms at the executive level with access to the lounge and everything was nearly perfect so why not dots the two rooms were very different one had a big bright bathroom overlooking the city and the other a dark small one the two rooms had everything you need including the latest technology but to be picky the curtains did shut out the light and i wish for a more soundproof room would i stay here again yes on business or with kids but not as a couple next time in amsterdam as a couple i will be closer to the old town in a old charming hotel,1
178,although it was a bit further away from the center we were extremely pleased with the hotel the room was comfortable clean and they checked us in early in the day we used the pool a couple of times and found lots of great local places to eat nearby the breakfast buffett was out standing with so many items both hot and cold to choose from we would definatly stay here again if we returned to amsterdam,1
179,de luxe room on floor very spacious with view across city and a beautiful bathroom breakfast was excellent and service was also top notch staff all friendly and very helpful with directions and trams stayed nights and would recommend this hotel,1
180,my husband and i spent three nights at this hotel in july of everything about this hotel was wonderful we arrived early from the united states around and we were given a large corner room with a king size bed two large picture windows a huge bathroom with a shower and bathtub and there was a small table with two chairs in our room the bed was comfortable the room was cleaned every day there was a coffee maker in the room the front desk staff was very helpful showing me on a map how to get to certain locations and what bus to use to get to specific locations this hotel has an indoor pool and gym which are both great there are restaurants in the hotel one of the restaurants overlooks a canal and it was enjoyable to have dinner there and watch all the boats on the canal this hotel is within walking distance of the museum distance and some nearby parks we had an early airplane flight and the front desk staff arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport when in amsterdam again my husband and i would stay again at this hotel,1
181,this is one hotel that definitely deserves its rating the facility is beautiful my room was so comfortable and the extra amenities like a bathrobe and slippers were great i loved the turndown service they definitely made me feel like royalty it not the most exciting part of amsterdam but it beautiful i really enjoyed going for a walk in the late afternoon along the quiet canals that front their property and you can get to some more bustling areas with a decent walk or a short tram or bus ride not hard to get to the airport either i was only there one night so i only got to experience one of their dining facilities i could afford the two michelin star rated restaurant on the top floor but i could get some of their appetizers at the bar some of the best food i have eaten in my life take advantage of that option if you ca go to the restaurant itself and there are three other restaurants there that certainly seemed like they were the best choices in the area so if you have a long stay take advantage of this fantastic hotel,1
183,i just had one night in this lovely hotel with my lhw membership i got a really nice room on floor fantastic view of the city nice top floor bar and two highly recommended restaurants fantastic service 感謝,1
184,while the amenities rooms at this hotel are all very good especially the pool and sauna area of the spa the real winner for this hotel is the arrived after a ordeal from sydney where both my son wife had suffered some level of flight sickness etc so we were pretty was also but the reception staff were so polite helpful in sorting out our needs that we felt like we had come there was no room ready they took care of our luggage checked us in so all we had to do was wander back in at midday when they promised they would have a room ready and that is exactly what hotel staff throughout our stay continued this level of good humoured helpfulness made this one of the most pleasant hotels we have ever stayed guys you were great,1
185,i stayed here and i was surprised how the staff treated us they were outstanding and very welcoming it by one of the cleanest hotels i have been to the rooms where spacious and very cosy i stayed for two nights and loved every minute while i was here thanks to all the staffs,1
186,my sister and i enjoyed a very pleasant whilst visting amsterdam we found it easy access in to the city centre and tram services room was clean light and comfortable staff very helpful and hotel facilities make it extra special,1
187,the okura amsterdam is well though not totally centrally located in amsterdam this is not necessarily a bad thing because you are a bit away from the tourist crowds that the city and get the chance to explore quieter streets around the hotel in any event there are various small restaurants and stores within a hotel is modern well kept and clean it stands out a bit as it the tallest building in its neighborhood but that can also mean good views for are sized right certainly not too big but i did not feel constrained in any way either the nespresso machine with six daily capsules are a nice front desk was a bit slow for my taste but that may have to do with my checking in and out at peak times and receptionists taking their time to make detailed explanations to other guests maybe an automated process would be a good idea for those just wanting no further information,1
188,it what you expect from star hotel nice and quiet very close to the pijp area which we enjoy for the center it a bit of a walk the michelin star restaurant is nice but for me a bit over the top we had a super somoliere and waiter he really made our evening thank you,1
189,what a great hotel staff was top notch location perfect and the hotel restaunts are michelin rated for a hotel is a nice walk along the canal to the museums and shopping there a whole bunch of local cafes and such around the hotel spa was booked but the pool was be back,1
190,our hotel recommended the lobby restaurant at the nesplein hotel it was a delicious way to start the day in a lovely and comfy living room style space as always the service in amsterdam is top notch,1
191,love the boutique feel of this hotel great location and room was great stayed i stay nights per week in amsterdam and the staff here far outweigh all the other hotels i stayed in attentive friendly and very efficient breakfast was outstanding really enjoyed the change from the usual buffet style the eggs benedict i can highly recommend,1
192,the hotel is very well located just off the busy dam square but down the quiet and more refined nes plein so best of both worlds the staff are young and trendy but friendly and very knowledgeable and happy to siggest places to visit restaurants or lend you a brolly we had a designer suite that was a good size quirkily designed though slightly inconvenient shape but proved comfortable and quiet for a day stay the bathroom was very smart a very powerful shower and unusual black toilet the restaurant food was superb and again staff here and in the bar were fab my only criticism was that it was a shame more seats werent available outside and were often marked reserved so everyone was too crammed together and one evening we went to the bar next door a very stylish comfortable and luxurious stay,1
193,i stayed here on a family europe trip from july i found this hotel to be great and it exceeded my expectations we picked this hotel because we heard boutique hotels are great here and this one had really good reviews this hotel is very small and i love that it only has about rooms and only floors including the lobby this hotel is also within walking distance to just about all of amsterdam attractions there is also not to much foot or bike traffic where the hotel is since it is a little off of the beaten path it is good to come back here and have a break from all of that our room was clean and very nice the staff was also great this hotel also has a good on site restaurant i have no complaints on this hotel keep it up hotel v i would totally recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to or through the amsterdam area,1
194,location excellent a ten minute walk away from the heart of the rld but secluded street the hotel exists in shields you from the more rowdy quaint little hotel with glitzy little touches the decor will not be to everyone taste i personallyprefer a more traditional approach to interior decoration but that is a minor my experience is that the hotel was extremely clean when i visited both the common areas as well as the rooms including the as coffee available in the iron and ironing board upon fantastic highly evident that judgement of the staff attitude has played its part during the recruitment process elena in particular requires a special mention her extremely pleasant attitude and readiness to help with minor queries and requests impressed me quite a bit both the morning staff did their bits as for money i am not exactly sure in terms of bang for your buck just a shade too expensive is my i return gladly the overall experience ensures it is worth i recommend the place based on everything but the of course,1
195,this welcoming boutique hotel is located in a quiet side street just off dam square combining tranquility with a truly central location the hotel team was friendly and efficient and the food in the lobby restaurant truly delicious,1
196,we had a wonderful time the design of the hotel and the location in the center of dam was great hotel staff are very courteous and ordered breakfast in advance breakfast is from the menu and it was hotel restaurant is wonderful we loved the atmosphere and the food everything was extraordinary,1
197,was amazing they even rmoved crusts from my toast very attentive staff could do enough for it was a it noises outside during the night but that not the hotels fault,1
198,right at the heart of amsterdam walk from rembrandt square and from dam square you have it all boutique hotel centrally located but very away from the stylish good amenities the bonus ask a room at the fifth floor preferably a corner room you get your own balcony with amazing view of the city,1
199,my friend and i had stayed there for days definitely will come room is clean and comfortable their staff are nice and friendly they tried every effort to help us to solve the travelling problems and give us advise the hotel is just beside the canal and you can enjoy a good view from the view but please note it may be a little bit noisy at night at there are bars nearby overall this is a good place to stay in ams,1
200,i visited nh collection amsterdam doelen the hotel was a lot better than other hotels i had stayed at in amsterdam the hotel is very stylish it central and close to all major attractions the breakfasts were concierge was not very attentive and not always available when you were looking for them book a superior room with a view without a view they face the street and are a bit noisy,1
202,i stayed at the nh collection amsterdam doelen from july july it was centrally located in a nice part of amsterdam the staff was helpfully and friendly and the hotel was extremely clean and well taken care of apparently renovations to the hotel were recently done the only drawback was the room which was small even by european standards there was no place to put my suitcase very little around the bed the wash basin and bathroom were in separate places i stay there again if the room was more like what was in the trip advisor pictures,1
203,holiday trip with kids i ordered rooms for nights reading all the reviews i was certain i had a great place to night aircondition did not work the staff are well trained to apologize coz all they said was we could get you a fan for tonight is that why i am paying full price we moved rooms the next it the fifth night and yet again the airconditioner is not a nightmare this hotel is and as nice as the staff is it is completely not what is your time holiday and money is dear to you do not approach this hotel,0
204,charming hotel great location friendly staff and lovely view got off on a bit of a bad start as we took rooms and although our kids individual rooms were fine our room that was bigger had everything fine except that it was very very hot trouble with the air climate the next day we were moved into a much bigger and better room a suite i think with a beautiful view and a perfectly cool and crisp atmosphere no more complains from there on the staff were nice and friendly breakfast was served in a beautiful restaurant with a lovely view again downside maybe was the noise at night from the young holiday makers over the it did bother me much i loved the view and the ambience,1
205,beautiful hotel modern rooms with air conditioning clean but cosy room with lovely canal view excellent position near the flower definitely stay there helpful and friendly staff,1
207,i can t even start to express the most beautiful experience we had this short day trip thanks to gillian and sven i have no words possible to express my gratitude towards them the hotel so gorgeous the employees so sweet making you feel part of the family helping us out with site seeing tours tickets to museums anything we needed during our stay making my birthday the most memorable one the room with gorgeous sites of amstel canal and their typical houses making our window room into it a magnificent postcard the bed was delicious to get into and not wanting to leave clean clean over clean the hotel surprised us with a birthday cake that was absolutely delicious my fiancée asked gillian and seven fully trusting them to reserve a romantic dinner to celebrate and end our escape birthday trip to surprise me we found the reservation in our room on top of our bed surrounded by silk rose petals daadler restaurant oh my oh my oh my delicious yes course i literally cried of happiness of this surprise trip thank you so so much gillian sven for making and being part of my birthday i will cherish forever we are already planning our return trip here,1
208,chose this hotel because of its location price and previous reviews i was disappointed we walked all over the downtown area the canals were amazing lots of shopping sights and restaurants nearby the hotel was clean and really decorated nicely breakfast was great and plentiful the staff were all helpful they gave us directions to sights restaurants and even offered us breakfast when we checked in early they were a huge help carrying our luggage up the stairs whenever we needed yes the stairs are steep but the staff was always there to help i would definitely stay there again,1
209,we stayed in clemens hotel for days in july the location was awesome near all sites the staff was friendly and very helpful they are available all the day for any stairs were many and very tiny but the staff take our luggages room was narrow but we enjoyed the weather in the small recommended,1
210,no regrets with booking this one great location great staff great bed room great breakfast definitely very happy the staff insisted i had breakfast before i even checked in for that night as i dropped my bags off in the morning i experienced some star hotels not let you have breakfast except for the morning after you stay fantastic service,1
211,staff amazing very very very clean great breakfast lovely atmosphere perfect location nothing to fault the staff clearly have great pride in their hotel just a note re the stairs they are steep and if on the floor its a great free workout probably not for the elderly but do not let the stairs put you off as this hotal is absolutely perfect there was one lady who ran around doing breakfast and cleaning rooms she was fantastic i would go back if i revisit amsterdam in fact i would go anywhere else now loved it,1
212,we really enjoyed our day stay at the clemens hotel the staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was amazing we loved the balcony connected to the lobby and the breakfast was quite filling the long stair case leading to the lobby and the street noise on saturday took some getting used to but overall we were very pleased and would stay at this inn again,1
213,i was dismayed to see the huge set of stairs when i walked through the front door with my bad knee but the receptionists immediately rushed down to take my bags and they remained just as helpful for my whole stay the single room was tiny but clean and comfortable the house is well maintained the room on the back side was quiet i like the balcony just off the lobby a nice place to hang out and the location in the canal neighborhood is just perfect,1
214,excellent location min from the nieuw kerk about a min walk from the station as others note rooms are small and stairs are steep but staff is very helpful including carrying luggage up the stairs my single room had shower only no bath and fixtures in the room and bathroom mirror towel racks were designed for people taller than my small fridge in room was very nice,1
216,i came here as a student looking for a place to live when i go and study my msc the hotel was very nice the rooms were very clean and well decorated the location was amazing and the staff were very helpful i would stay here again and probably will in the future,1
217,this hotel is in a great location to get to the main attractions around amsterdam the rooms are sufficient for your stay and the breakfast and terraced area are stairs are steep but the staff are more then happy to help you with your bags the staff were very friendly and always asking what they could do to thoroughly enjoyed our night stay and would return here again without hesitation,1
218,this was possibly the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in smaller even than inside cabins on cruise ships that said the room had everything one would need including air conditioning a comfortable bed tv and a central location we might have been less happy but for the consistently friendly service we experienced from the entire staff this place is not handicap accessible there is a long and steep flight of steps leading up to the hotel which is on the second level of the building one of a series of small hotels within the same antique structure there is a nice reception and breakfast area the included breakfast offers breads cheeses cold cuts and scrambled eggs definitely sufficient to get you moving in the morning overall a reasonable value in an expensive city,1
219,the hotel was simply amazing the stuff very friendly with great city tips through them we found great locations such as the best gin bar in town as well as delicious restaurants and cool will always catch this hotel when going back to amsterdam thanks sir adam and amsterdam form the great trip,1
220,i knew the was told the hotel is so hip and the concept is young and fresh and it is so much so however it not that kind of a place that leave you feeling old like some trendy young type of hotels lobby is amazing the layout is so cool it calm yet hip if you can have both they managed to find the balance we had a fabulous guy serving us a great drinks here he is ellissio from italy in the hotel bar and he was friendly and knew how to care for guests ride to center station is a minute free ride with a fast ferry loved it will come back,1
221,friendly welcoming staff at reception helpful in explaining different areas of amsterdam enjoyed every minute of our stay here easy to find from airport to train to ferry across the river to the hotel comfy rooms especially enjoyed the view across the river watching the people go about their daily business each lift up to the room had a different theme full size complimentary toiletries so you have no need to bring your own and a good powerful hairdryer also the cafe nelson mandela just by the river short walk from hotel nice to sit and enjoy the quiet whilst watching the boats only disappointment was that there was not enough umbrellas on the day it rained hard so go early if you need to borrow one,1
222,this place is fab i have been in star and star hospitality in australia and the guest arrival experience at sir adam is exceptional friendly enthusiastic efficient room was ready even though we arrived early thank you erwin sp the room is v cool concrete glass leather and fur gibson les paul on the wall crosley record player on the bar records on the bar so we turned up patti smith and checked out the art and music and dance tomes in the room then went exploring having been taken down stairs by the saturday night fever lift c from memory bed is v comfortable and room is dark at night so we had a good sleep shower is great overall a lot to recommend at sir adam,1
223,this hotel is one of the best i have stayed at in amsterdam easy to get to using the shuttle ferry at the back of centraal station did know this at the time of booking at took a taxi the long way round very easy check in and shown to our rooms by a knowledgeable guy the rooms are great i had a lovely view out the window with complimentary binoculars good selection of records for the record player as well the lifts were a fun experience as well different themed ones my favourite was the disco ca comment on the food but it looked good bar prices we reasonable for the location look forward to staying here again,1
224,definitely would stay here again exceptionally great location quiet close to all transportation removed from of tourist areas staff was extremely helpful in all aspects of our stay always seeking to provide great advice and direction with every question presented fun atmosphere bar area below lobby was crowded every evening and full of activity hotel was peaceful heard no noise at all during our stay despite a relatively full hotel rooms are comfortable but not spacious clean crisp and and well maintained,1
226,wow this place is brilliant we stayed here for the weekend as we were meeting friends who had flown in from america the room is on the smaller side but perfectly fine for people plus how much time do you spend in there anyway the record players in each room were a nice touch decor was great shower nice and strong slept so well i looked online and i know i can buy the bed but i want to know where to get the duvet and pillows from totally divine and felt like a princess would definitely return and have already recommended it to friends might try the one in ibiza next,1
227,the hotel location is very nearby from amsterdam centraal just took the boat and walk a bit then there you go and whenever you reach the main station you can continue going to city area great room with roll theme and best view to the ams centraal staffs are friendly and very helpful breakfast is great and can also hang out in the resto call the butcher play overall very recommended this hotel will be our choice next time we back to amsterdam,1
228,the staff were amazingly helpful especially nok and sandjay always ready with some recommendations happy to check dinner bookings and full of smiles the room was stunning with full panoramic views of the water front lots of nice touches including a glass of prosecco on arrival a funky disco lift and i especially like the addition of a record player in the room location wise i was a bit concerned about this when booking but i should have been adam is just five minutes away from centraal station by a ferry that runs all night long but make sure you get on the right ferry we made that mistake and ended up extending our minute trip back to minutes we did have a couple of gripes which they did their best to sort out and which i was satisfied were taken seriously the first was a weird low pitched buzzing noise on two nights which seemed to come from the central air cooling system we turned off the air con in the room and it was still there when a staff member came up he checked out other free rooms and said the noise was also bad in those and so there was little point in changing they did provide us with ear plugs though which did the trick they did seem aware of the problem but unable to do anything about it other gripe was that our room was cleaned on one day we asked reception to sort it,1
229,super levels of service very helpful and polite staff we asked for the gibson and they very kindly gifted the hire cost food good fantastic all in breakfast but otherwise fairly costly very relaxed atmosphere quite loud at times and would overwhelm some who like peace and quiet my son and i had fun there is a special upstairs part which you can get discount tickets for at the hotel the lift ride up is truly spectacular really great stay and i deffo go again ferry across to main city is every five mins free and runs all night brilliant stay only gripe room was a bit small and the ac was poor,1
230,very classy quirky venue that has so much to recommend it wonderful rooms stylish and comfortable a shower to die for extremely helpful and friendly staff we would recommend it without hesitation,1
231,just take a quick ferry across to center of everything great hotel very cool vibes beautiful views wonderful people clean friendly and easy access to center i stayed in many hotels in amsterdam this is one of my favorites,1
232,we visited amsterdam for a weekend in were a little lost on arrival which ferry to take how to enter the hotel and then finding the actual reception desk once we sussed that it was a wonderful experience we were welcomed by friendly cheerful staff given a glass of bubbly and then shown to our had a corner city view room looking straight over the water i loved the decor the original quirks though i did use the record player or try out the guitar and my husband loved the concrete walls and ceiling the bed was perhaps the most comfortable i ever slept in and the rain shower was a delight some people have commented on the window in the shower stall but it not a problem at was also fascinating to think that not so many years ago our comfortable hotel used to be someone office someone people have commented that the rooms are small there were two of us staying two nights and it was perfect for our needs the bathroom was enormous but you just have to take it in turns to use it it really was an issue for ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant downstairs it was delicious i highly recommend the breakfast pancakes finding out how things worked where to order was not immediately clear straight away but it all went fine our first meal there was actually dinner on a busy saturday night so perhaps that would explain our initial hotel,1
233,we stayed at the sir adam during our trip to amsterdam the staff there is so friendly and helpful everyone treated us like they really cared about us having a great experience as a previous reviewer mentioned our cab driver also could not find the hotel and in retrospect we would have just taken the train from the airport and then the ferry right across the river to the hotel i highly recommend this hotel for the fun and funky atmosphere and the excellent staff the rooms are small but the views are excellent,1
234,sir adam is so new opened in december that the cab driver didn t know how to find it of course i should have taken a cab i should have just taken the ferry from the train station right across the harbor which runs constantly i ve stayed in lots of boutique hotels but this was among the best in terms of design also during the checkin process i experienced something new the person who checked me in offered me a drink and then when we were done with the registration process they personally escorted me to the room with plenty of explanations along the way my room overlooked the harbor with big picture windows and the view even from the floor was great the was room was overflowing with storage so even two people shouldn t have a problem finding places to store their luggage and clothes i loved that the shower and toilet were in two separate spaces and the bed was super comfortable on the weekend it can get to be a bit of a scene down in the lobby but it gives you lots to look at my experience with the restaurant there was mixed so my advice is not to stray too far from the burgers and chicken wings one weird thing is that all the seats at the bar have their backs to the beautiful harbor views and instead look into the kitchen weird my only criticism is that the hotel service did always,1
235,one of the most amazing hotels i ever stayed place oozes class from start to finish the ferry over the water from the station showed the lookout which has everything you could ever need and the hotel was part of the complex two bars three restaurants europe highest swing and a brilliant lookout point then there was the hotel the check in was stylish the rooms were uber stylish the bed was so comfy i fell asleep for hours one night the shower was lovely and the little things in the room really made it feel like home worth the upgrade to the rooms overlooking the river and back towards the centre of butcher food is top class and breakfast lunch and dinner here are recommended i actually have no complaints about anything little touches of class everywhere and the record player was brilliant belting out old school hits on records whilst getting showered the staff were friendly and helpful the bar area was buzzing and bright and the outdoor bar was great also i want to stay here every weekend,1
236,so close to central station free ferry over river cool lifts and decor in rooms vinyl player and nice artwork so close to city center will be back great views onto city very friendly staff stars,1
237,we had an amazing but tiring time in amsterdam and we were glad to have the sir adam to come back to the room was perfect the bed and pillows were among the most comfortable i ever slept in cosy with a faux fur blanket that was beyond soft it had all the extras you need cold drinks and climate control the black out blinds meant i got a great nights sleep the air con is a tad noisy but we quickly got used to view from the room was beautiful and we could watch the cruise liners come in and out it was just a sort walk and a free ferry ride to amsterdam centraal there are a number of nice bars nearby the sir adams own restaurant the butcher provides tasty burgers and a nice outdoor seating area to eat them in whilst watching the world go by we would definitely go again,1
238,ideally located in the new toren tower across the ij river from centraal station thanks to the ferry service hotel theme is music each elevator in a different style and music one even has a disco ball in the ceiling and checkered in different colors flickering floor rooms styled in leather and pop walls jam sessions at the groundfloor open space area and best of all a gibson guitar and crosley turntable in the rooms to use at your discretion you can even browse through the record collection at reception and exchange whatever you up to yes it vinyl records also the view from the room is just amazing wonderful and that true for the view from the bathroom shower as well dvery friendly and forthcoming service included,1
240,stayed here while at a conference hotels which try to be different can often end up just being odd and lose sight of what matters nice stay but not here on the other side of the main canal from centraal station getting here involves using the foot ferry a great way to start the hotel itself is in an old office block but brilliantly converted the bar area is a club with dj relaxed atmosphere and amazing burgers and beer reception staff very lifts are all themed including a disco lift complete with light up floor and glitter ball on the ceiling the rooms are a little small but packed with everything you need mine had a guitar hanging from the wall and a turntable next to the minibar plus a choice of vinyl very comfy beds powerful shower and dark curtains so once you wanted to sleep you could block the world of the best hotels i stayed in,1
241,what a hotel this was and its truly the best hotel i have ever stayed in the style of the hotel as a speakeasy feel from the outside because if you were aware you would know this was a hotel from the very beginning the hotel staff were amazing so friendly and did little touches for my husbands birthday which we were expecting they also showed us to our room which is the first time any hotel as done this which was really nice touch from rooms were so amazing i never stayed in a room like it before very urban industrial and rock n roll with little touches like a crosley record player and a fur bed throw and do get me started on the lifts they are so unique and quirky i do want to really give too much away but you will love a certain one if i could live in a hotel this would be the one i would choose and i will definitely be staying here again when i revist done sir adam on a fantastic hotel with super friendly staff,1
242,sir albert was definitely by far one if not the finest hotels i have ever stayed in the hotel decor itself in the reception corridors bedroom are very modern and chic with a touch of class we were offered complementary prosecco on arrival the staff were more than helpful when we were checking in another day we asked for directions to the van gogh museum and the man at reception went out of his way to help and assist us with directions and offered umbrellas to each of us as it was a rather dreary day the room itself was very edgy and modernly decorated and felt very personal and welcoming with complimentary messages on the mirror and my name on the tv to welcome me it took maybe walk to get to dam square but there are lots of lovely bars restaurants shops and markets on the way which was nice to experience there was also a tram about a walk away that can take you to dam square i would recommend this hotel to every type of passenger and hope to return to it once again in the near future,1
243,price for this hotel is not low but you get what you will never get in other hotels beautifull view from room to small harbour and the hotel is very near city center only few minutes of walking rooms are very clean and modern and look more expensive than you will pay people are very friendly breakfast is not for stars but everything else is for more than stars,1
244,the first thing you notice when you enter this hotel is that they really trying to make a warm and welcoming yet modern and different atmosphere i didnt book a room but i went to the lounge to get some coctails first thing i noticed was a very handsome bartender and since i was going by myself i decided to sit there i didnt know what i wanted so instead i gave him three questions that he would answer with his drink the bartender was charming and took the challenge making me one of the best drinks i have ever drank i highly recommend tiago whiskey sour both of the bartendes were very charming and took the time to talk to me when there were any customers friendliest bartender i have ever met stars,1
245,my sister and i stayed here for two nights and could not have been happier with the hotel the reception staff were so professional and pleasant especially jacqueline who is fantastic the room was very spacious and absolutely spotless there is a very good rainfall shower and some lovely products in the bathroom including shampoo conditioner showergel and body lotion the hairdryer is very poor with an extremely short lead so i would advise you to bring your own there is also a secure safe located in one of the presses in regards location it fantastic you take the train from schipol to centraal station it costs for a one way adult ticket and it takes about minutes once you get to centraal station take the exit towards the river turn and keep the water on your right hand side the hotel is no more than a to minute walk from centraal station you can get the hop off bus so from a point of view the hotel is ideal if you do get breakfast in the hotel there are or small eateries directly across the road no more than steps away from the hotel exit all in all a super hotel that i would highly recommend for your visit to amsterdam thank you to all room mate aitana,1
246,this hotel was perfect for me and by boyfriend we hired bikes and it was only a min bike ride down the river to get to the hotel from the station so easy its located in a new complex with a lovely bagel shop opposite that we went for breakfast a few times the hotel was very clean and had great decor and staff were very friendly and helpful,1
247,this hotel was an easy walk from central station and to city sights very quiet clean and modern staff was friendly and very helpful comfortable bed and nice view of the city from my upper floor room,1
249,we loved our stay in room mate aitana the room had a wonderful view of the river the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was very good the breakfast buffet was complete the hotel is a short walk from the center of town and the tram system would stay here again if our journeys bring us back to amsterdam,1
251,the room mate aitana was a very nice place to stay the staff was very welcoming when we arrived and also very helpful when we asked questions about the local area the hotel is located close to a river the central station is a short minute walk away and easy to find with it many shops and restaurants ultra modern in style the hotel also features good security be prepared to use your room key card to activate the elevator when going up to your room our room had a window the full size of the wall so there was lots of light coming in that made the room seem so much larger the bed was very comfortable and the room was well appointed breakfast the next morning was included with the room and was excellent with many tasty dishes including a whole table of various kinds of breads we arrived a day early for a cruise and this really helped us to acclimate to the time change,1
252,the location may seem a little far away but this comes with a reward this place is absolutely quiet and you can get the best rest after a long day of walking amsterdam streets the beds are and the rooms do catch any external was good though not sure it was worth the unusual expensive price it has the advantage of being open until noon so one can fully recover after a wild night all in all i fully recommend this place,1
253,the mate aitana hotel is right in the entrance of amsterdam super close to the train station and to the centrum of the city we walked there everyday and getting an uber to go to the attractions a bit farther like the heineken experience was super easy rooms are clean modern with a great view and staff is super nice the big plus is if you are driving to amsterdam you do need to go thru the chaotic city channels and parking is available right under the hotel for a euro daily fee could have been for free or at a lower rate for hotel guests but all things considered it was great would definitely stay again,1
254,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the room mate aitana check in was smooth and staff were friendly the room was large and spacious with good storage for all of our things the king size bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom was clean modern and spacious the hotel is located on ijdock and is a short walk about minutes to either central station or the jordaan area there are nice views of the harbour from the hotel and also a couple of cafes beside it overall we were happy with everything and would definitely stay again,1
255,fantastic hotel at a fantastic location very close to the central train station on foot according to me ideally located excellent service spacious rooms wonderful view and lovely breakfast strongly recommended,1
256,great and modern hotel with good service and in the center of amsterdam the view of some rooms could be better but the staff and also the rooms are amazing and modern really liked the concept and the ambiance,1
257,we arrived early to the hotel after a long flight from the to be warmly greeted by the staff because we arrived so early our room was not available yet and we were told it would be ready by the hotel kindly kept our luggage for us while we toured the city although when we returned at our room was still not ready yet unfortunately our room was not ready until because the previous occupants had smoked in the room and they had to prepare a different room for us the hotel staff was gracious and pleasant throughout the process understanding that we were very tired from our long room itself was a good size by european standards we were in a family room which included a large bed and a small single bed which was fine for my teenage daughter i appreciate the small details like plenty of electrical outlets a variety of english speaking channels on the and extra pillows the air conditioning worked adequately and is controlled directly in the room our room faced the front of the hotel and therefore we heard some early morning vehicle noise but because the hotel is somewhat isolated it was overall very quiet noise from inside the hotel or from adjoining rooms was the beds and pillows were more on the firm side for those of us from america but standard for what i have experienced in hotel is located along the water with scenic views from several locations in,1
258,this hotel is fabulous we were in room for nights the views are spectacular in directions the hotel is spotless with a star staff we were stunned by our room when we entered and saw how spacious it was the only negative we felt was that the restaurant menu is lacking so we ate out at nearby places everything is in walking central station the ann frank house included we would definitely stay here again,1
259,i prefer not to be in a cramped noisy hotel in centre of tow i prefer my comforts in a peaceful setting which is a short walk from where i want to go we could walk into any of the interesting areas in minutes lovely clean hotel with great friendly staff tiago in the bar is the man for serving the gin of your choice whilst the rooms are not large they are big enough with great views over the boats in the dock a quiet refuge after a lengthy day touring amsterdam,1
260,hotel is at prompt place near the central station walk around minutes across the bridge arrived and room was ready well trained staff and smiling and very warm welcoming staff are assisting for those who came first time and providing all the info to new travellers was good too roomare clean and bathroom too only missing part to go beyond the current level is to add water bottles of compliments for tea coffee thank you for the service,1
261,the room was great and the front end service people were courteous friendly and helpful we found the lobby music to be repetitive and at times loud but the staff turned it down on request we tried the restaurant late on a saturday and that was a disaster no service at all we ended up leaving without ordering,1
262,we located just minutes away from centraal station or from dam room mate give us very good conditions to stay in the city modern with good and large rooms in the middle of the water simpatic team,1
263,i have been staying at the room mate aitana for four days last week and really enjoyed my stay rooms are very spacious as well as the room bathroom and nicely designed the bed was very comfy too breakfast is absolutely great one finds everything one could desire having for breakfast in a very good quality and it was never too staff were very friendly one felt welcomed i would say the room mate aitana is an excellent hotel for a to amsterdam if you want to be close to the city centre but away from those huge tourist crowds,1
264,the hotel was clean and comfortable the rooms nicely furnished the bathroom had a nice large shower the gym had great treadmills ellipticals and bikes also weights balls and water and towels the gym also has a nice view of the staff was not competent at the front desk and did not know the answers to the questions we had as we was delicious along with dinner the lighting system was terrible you have to use a key card and it makes going to the bathroom in the night a challenge we had a beautiful view this hotel is close but away from city centre,1
265,we stayed at this greatly located hotel twice while doing viking river cruises in a day period the first stay we had really bad connections and arrived at amsterdam airport at pm without a hotel to stay our viking ship was due in the next day so got taxi to the aitana and was presently surprised the service desk found us room for the night just before my wife was ready to throw me in the harbor the hotel was a minute walk from where our viking ship docked the stay was when we returned on the viking ship and had a day to do downtown amsterdam min walk really nice rooms and amenities nice view of the city from our room on the floor this is a star hotel with star service second visit we got to hotel at am and just new we could probably not get a room until late that afternoon so what a fabulous surprise when their customer service desk got us a room right away so we could walk to the city they even have a wireless hot spot available to use as you do the city room mate hotels has now become my european choice,1
266,hotel was clean and modern staff were friendly minute walk to train station less than a minute walk to dam square and to great restaurants in the jordaan loved the location quiet new a little bit away from the hustle and bustle but not too far away good coffee place across the street we really enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again,1
267,the property is nice and it in a great neighborhood the rooms are exceptionally clean and the bed very comfortable unfortunately the hotel does not have parking so you need to park the car in the parking garage next door additional a day the staff did not really pay attention when we walked in or out the hotel even at we had to wait a while until someone noticed us overall i think this hotel is a little overpriced,1
268,this hotel is located on the west dock behind the central station about a minute walk reception staff were friendly and helpful i was given a choice of rooms and opted for a view away from the dock but bigger and higher up the bed was comfortable with a good duvet the room had a digital safe iron hairdryer minibar and tea and coffee facilities the shower was powerful and large a good range of toiletries was supplied in the room everything was very clean the hotel bar does good cocktails and has an outside area on the dock breakfast was a very high quality buffet really liked this hotel and would stay again,1
269,this place is fantastic we booked a junior sweet as a little treat and we not disappointed from the exceptional welcome from two young ladies on reception one in training to the fantastic views you not beat this hotel it central location is fantastic just far enough out of all the city noise but five minutes walk and you in the thick of all the action top tip book the breakfast we did it on arrival and was worth every penny a massive selection from cooked breakfast to fruit and everything in between do miss the pancakes amsterdam has so much to offer and this hotel is the perfect base to explore,1
270,a lovely warm welcome awaited us on our arrival in this beautiful glassed reception area overlooking the canal and the river spacious bright interior with a modern décor gave us a feeling of being somewhere special and different the rooms were bright with lovely views overlooking the river location is excellent for touring amsterdam unfortunately our trip to amsterdam was too short for us to enjoy many of the great sights or enjoy the cuisine of the hotel and surrounding areas however we got to savour a lovely breakfast in a little café across the road and enjoyed tea and cakes in a quaint little cake shop until our lift to the airport wont be sorry to choose this hotel for location and ambience,1
271,very nice hotel with great deco nice views and nice rooms large and clean with all the necessary equipment whatch out with the boilers though the quality of service of the staff at the desk is fluctuant from great adel to average,1
272,i stayed at the room mate aitana for nights in july this year and it was perfect with the is located at the beautiful ij dock it in the heart of amsterdam but it gives you the solace and peace you need to wind down after a night about a minute walk to the centraal station and a max minute walk to everything else if you do feel like walking there is a bike rental across the street amsterdam is one of the most bike friendly places in the are nice places for breakfast if you wish to skip the hotel breakfast a couple of other cafes and a fresh food store as well just across the on to the property the rooms are airy and spacious a large window with plenty of sunlight coming in which is a huge plus point for me bathroom is well equipped and well must mention that the cleanliness is top notch now last but not the least the staff they were excellent from the reception desk to the housekeeping they were so warm and friendly they have a whatsapp number that you can text them on while you are out for any suggestions or directions i thought that was nice personal touch they added to the hotel a perfect hotel i would definitely stay here if i visit amsterdam again,1
273,we stayed in a junior suite definitely worth the extra money one of our favourite hotels very much our type of hotel modern perfectly clean and stylish hard to believe it is an accor hotel as it is so distinctive staff were friendly and the restaurant downstairs was very good for dinner also the deal of a latte and a croissant for a few euros for a light breakfast was perfect for us we would hesitate in recommending this hotel and will be back next time we are in amsterdam,1
274,this is a hip modern and minimalist do not expect features however it is very well decorated and furnished the position is also fantastic great for tourists who need a home base,1
275,just come back from a night stay at ink hotel amsterdam absolutely amazing interior from the minute you step in to the hotel and check in was quick and helpful our room was spacious and had views to a side street despite the central location we did not hear any noise from the roads which was good we loved the wallpaper on the feature wall which was a map of parts of amsterdam and the interior of the room which has a separate waterfall shower and toilet the room was clean and the king size bed was amazing not just two singles pushed together the room has air con or heating as well the hotel is in an amazing location and everything is walkable roughly min walk to dam square min walk to the red light district and about a min walk from the train station there are plenty of restaurants bars and cafes right near the hotel too during our stay the hotel became p ink for amsterdam gay pride week they were hosting a lot of pink events over the week which looked great overall we would undoubtably stay here again when visiting amsterdam thank you for making our stay so great,1
277,we absolutely love loved our stay the service was excellent and very helpful the room was comfortable and very stylish not a lot of natural light but what there was served ok loved the murals with sights of the city very clever the only drawback was the musty smell in the halls it was a little intense but the rooms smelled perfect breakfast was delicious if a little pricey but that to be expected in a high end hotel i definitely stay here again and probably will as i love amsterdam,1
278,i been visiting amsterdam regularly for over years and have always stayed along the nz voorburgwal in various hotels after a disastrous experience at my last place i was searching for a new hotel for this summer and was intrigued by the design amenities and location of ink what a perfect choice the room was spacious and pleasant with high ceilings stained glass windows and great city art on the walls staff accommodating and welcoming the hotel pressroom was a great place to have a glass of wine and a nibble before heading out for the evening the little disappointing quirks no iron or hair dryer in the room poorly maintained fitness equipment in the tiny gym were more than outweighed by the overall experience i think i found my forever hotel and look forward to staying there again next summer i will even request the same room,1
279,ink is in the central tourist area yet if you walk a few blocks away you are in a wonderful neighborhood that is more residential and filled with shops and restaurants lots of fun design touches throughout the hotel the lobby bar and restaurant as well as lounge areas that are comfy and a nice place to hang out with a drink or check your email our room was a superior room and it reminded me of the cabin on a nice cruise ship it is very small but filled with thoughtful design touches to help with storage and comfort room was quiet and bed very comfy we slept well but it small so if that is a concern upgrade to a larger room staff is young and caring they responded to requests and even went out and purchased a mat for us to use in the stall shower when i expressed a concern about safety they were not as knowledgeable about local restaurants think that is something to address but we did follow a recommendation for a canal cruise all in all our three nights in amsterdam were a little more special because we stayed at the ink,1
280,really love this place located in the city centre close to main tourism points it look a new hotel the room is big clean and provided with very nice toilets recommend special for solo travel,1
281,naturally ink hotel amsterdam appealed to me as a retired journalist and the venue delivered in many ways largely focused around the theme of communication but in the sense of paper ink linotype typewriters and words ink is centrally located just a walk from the big train station its public spaces feel unique and intimate from the sloping entryway that brings you down a tad below street level where it is cool and quiet to a very casual desk employees stand behind a wooden table to work it feels like they could have been printsetters in another time the bar and restaurant with their attentive help are inviting and casual so much so you might not want to leave even though the city beckons rooms upstairs carry on the word and story themes in each an artist has sketched a map of the city on the bedroom wall and written favorite spots to visit it actually a big help rooms are small tight even but nicely appointed and the bed comfy and after all the point in amsterdam is to get out and explore staff were extremely helpful in suggesting trips especially an excellent canal boat ride i loved for the evening hour and the champagne served i think the company is called friendship a good name,1
282,fantastically thought out and appointed hotel for amsterdam tiny architecture and interior spaces the room was small but cleverly designed making it functional while cozy and comfortable reception bar and dining areas are well laid out connecting spaces and style successfully hotel staff are friendly lively and eager to please located close to central train station it an easy walk to hotel and central to everywhere else,1
283,the hotel is in a good area to stay within the canal ring the street is too busy compared to other areas of the canal ring but it still so close to everything the service was good and the rooms were clean but very small we enjoyed the breakfast it was a good selection but i would suggest that the waiters start writing down the orders we were there days for breakfast and on days the order was wrong and on day we had to order times for tea and coffee and waited about an hour i would recommend this hotel if you going to amsterdam it a really good choice,1
284,spent four nights at ink hotel in july this boutique hotel is really very good charming staff comfortable room good restaurant and bar also the location is first class would definitely stay there again on next amsterdam trip,1
285,stayed here at the start of our honeymoon for from check in you can tell this hotel is a nice one very professional wish i got the name of the staff who helped as they were very room was excellent the map of amsterdam on the wall was brilliant great wee wish i could say the same for amsterdam itself was in long only stayed one night after getting the ferry over but it was not for me,1
286,stayed here just one night on business smooth check in large room great restaurant downstairs and good bed was comfortable with a nice coffee machine shower and also loved the ink theme throughout the old prints on the walls added a nice be back,1
287,the writing is on the wall literally loved the maps and history found by looking at the walls in my room informative and interesting hotel was very nice modern spacious and in a good location close to central train station lobby was nice as was lobby bar,1
288,my husband and i absolutely loved ink hotel amsterdam the rooms are a bit small but this is standard in europe once you step into the hotel the interior is absolutely amazing each room was decorated with a comic map of the city i had a blast reading the commentary the artist had on the walls my one pet peeve was how cramped the shower area was and how water would leak out of the door on the had to be careful to make sure the shower door was always fully arrived to amsterdam quite late but the train dropped us off from the airport straight to the front of the hotel just around the corner there were various late night restaurants location is always key and this hotel was perfect we were away from the noisiness of the city yet just around the corner from the hustle and bustle of would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back,1
289,second time visiting this hotel and it will certainly not be our last we will continue to stay in this hotel when we visit amsterdam it truly is remarkable the staff the food the rooms five star great location also highly recommend,1
290,great location easy walk from amsterdam central and lovely quirky hotel in old town plenty of staff around to help if needed rooms are a generous size clean and have everything you need breakfast was nice each morning ours was included in our booking but do think it would be worth the euro price tag though usual breakfast fare both hot and cold the front desk sell tram tickets for days and are very helpful with ideas of places to go and also orientating you with the area coin operated laundry just around the corner had a great stay here,1
291,staff were very friendly helpful from our arrival to checking out great customer service during breakfast dinner or just having a relaxing drink by the bar recommend having dinner at the ink hotel the food wine was fantastic,1
292,stayed at the ink hotel in amsterdam for nights the best hotel i have stayed at the room was awesome the staff were exceptional especially the bar staff breakfast and restaurant is fabulous great central location would highly recommend,1
293,ink was the last hotel stop on our europe trip definitely lived up to the saying the best till last comfortable bed of our trip and it not one of those two single beds pushed together fluffy pillows in a modern quirky room the rain shower head and the size of the shower was pure luxury the room literally has everything you could ask for completely water sewing kit shoe polished vanity pack shampoo conditioner hair dryer fluffy towels robes and magnifying mirror not one but full length mirrors we had breakfast at the hotel every morning and it very well stocked freshly cooked pastry fresh bread fruit cereal yogurt eggs bacon mushrooms and sausages the list goes on the coffee was also quite also had dinner here one of our nights and it was fantastic we had the tar tare ravioli and chesses could fault anything wines and drinks were also spot on staff also added to our experience extremely helpful and so lovely our waitress for dinner was wonderful so friendly and up for a chat it also refreshing as someone who works in the industry to receive spot on high quality rave enough about this place definitely would recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam position is also perfect coming from the train station and to get to everything,1
294,well kempt trendy spot great but expensive breakfast room was a little smaller than i would have liked but was very clean staff was friendly and was easy good location which justified the price would book again,1
295,great stay in an excellent location near to shops and main sights breakfast good with choice of a few cooked items and lots of cold choices nice bar with reasonable price drinks that all come with nibbles our room was a superior room and was nice with great comfy bed,1
296,we loved this hotel the staff was helpful and hotel is located in the middle of the city and right in front of the tram it was easy to get anywhere the restaurant in the hotel is four star and that includes the breakfast i would recommend this hotel watch out for the leaking shower though we used a towel against the bottom of the door to prevent it leaking out into the the entire bathroom is in a public lot and the hotel gives a slight discount,1
297,interesting hotel of very contemporary design with a theme which continues into the bedrooms the staff were very nice and happy to help and the location is excellent for transport links or for walking into the centre we did not have breakfast at the hotel as it seemed overpriced but enjoyed the bar area and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of drinks on offer including cocktails,1
298,i spent last weekend at the ink hotel with my partner and other we arrived i was impressed with the contemporary design of the hotel check in was relatively quick and as of the rooms were not ready then some of the party were given upgrades we decided not to pay for breakfast in the hotel because at per person per day we thought it expensive there are plenty of places nearby to get food in the morning the hotel is in an ideal location and is one of the main reasons we decided to book would say the rooms at the ink are on the small side but they have everything we needed and the bed was one of the comfiest i experienced in any hotel i stayed we went to check out on the sunday the hotel tried to charge the couples that were given an upgrade this was just a misunderstanding and was cleared up without any extra money being taken the check out time was another big of the staff were friendly and helpful and if i was to return to amsterdam then i would definitely consider staying here again,1
299,we had no reservations and asked at the hotel information booth at the airport and got the name of the ink very close to central station mins walking and surrounding activities room was well appointed and serviced staff was fantastic jasper at the front desk was most helpful with directions dining recommendations and just a fabulous positive attitude if you are looking for a very comfortable place that is up to date you will find it at the ink in central amsterdam thanks for a great stay we will be back,1
300,i travel weekly for work and there is no other hotel which compares to the high standards friendly service great atmosphere stellar drinks and luxury beds and room as the ink hotel amsterdam the staff are so welcoming a really great experience and the location just ca be beat at ink you are in the center of amsterdam with all attractions and amenities at your finger tips if in amsterdam there is only hotel for me,1
301,hands down the worst value for money ever i paid euros for a night stay and the room could have been worth more than a night i stayed in a travelodge in london weeks ago that knocked spots off this place absolutely tiny room when we got the ironing board out we could get round the room we literally had to climb across the bed queen sized bed was more like a normal double toilet right next to the head of the bed not pleasant for the mrs the following morning after a night on the guinness staff unhelpful one in particular very rude,0
302,i was visiting amsterdam for a days during the open gardens weekend booked this hotel using some of my accor hotels points the ink hotel is connected to sofitel who are part of that loyalty program with the discount that brings i reserved a junior suite it was really lovely quietly tucked away at the back of the hotel overlooking an inner courtyard the ink hotel is in a historical old building which used to be the home of a dutch newspaper so enjoys a nice stylish quirky design with typewriters and interesting typeface on the walls etc the suite was a really good size large luxurious shower bathroom corner sofa and lots of storage and a nice big comfy bed i did get much chance to hang out in the room but when i was there it was a joy to be staff were super helpful and friendly the buffet breakfast was around euro extra a day i think but well worth it really good choice of fresh fruit cheeses meat cereals bread and bakery goods as well as lots of hot food the lady who seated and helped me there deserved a special mention did catch her name but she was really friendly and smiley too the hotel is in a good location around minutes from dam square amsterdam is a really beautiful walkable city and all the canals where i was visiting gardens was around a minute definitely stay here again if i ever back in amsterdam,1
303,showers are elevated which often results in water leaking onto concrete floors so it a high skip hazard my wife slipped and almost sprained a knee they could be sued for that if we were room designs are poor the shower basin was in middle of room so everyone in room watches younger ready never seen that before was location central to tourist spots fine for a day or two overpriced for what you get and better value at euro is fine but cheaper cafes al bother eating too close to hotel as it surrounded by really dodgy tourist trash cafes seems the so called cafes exist to sell dope and not really sell food except to stoned tourists who do know any better recommended that you get away from hotel area to eat tripadvisor has many recommendations on good places use that i am unlikely to stay here again given the safety issues and pricing and tourist trash food in the area,0
304,spent two nights at the ink firstly the negatives i had had an email to say of we checked in online in advance the key to the room would be ready we arrived mid morning to be told it would be ready until i queried it and the girl on reception said there was an extra quite high charge for early access i was not told that so pointless checking in in advance as i had expected to be able to freshen up and change my clothes before going out i then had to spend the afternoon in boiling hot weather in unsuitable clothes not a good other thing i had done in advance was to ask if they had a private bathroom as i did not like the look of the clear glass in the pictures on the website i think they had tried to accommodate this as the glass in our bathroom was opaque but you could still see through it and i was not comfortable with the room we had was very dark and we had to have the lights on constantly as it looked out onto a solid wall the service in the restaurant was not slow considering there was only one other couple in there also they could do with more staff and a bigger check in desk as there were always long on the positive the staff were lovely and friendly the room although dark was very clean and modern and quirky with the,1
305,friendly clean neat trendy great location to stroll through the city and only just over mins from amsterdam central station where you can go direct to the airport in the breakfast too,1
306,using trains warehouse convenient location good dining unique interior attached with de hallen annex with library shops movie theater food court nearest tram station three minutes walking distance watch out is no windows to open in the room,1
307,we stayed at this hotel on our last night in amsterdam and it was the perfect ending to the trip hotel de hallen is truly unique a transformed space with creative decor and design so fun for young couples and families i have stayed at a number of hotels but this one is truly unforgettable i loved every piece of detail the vibrant colors trendy atmosphere and convenient amenities i wish we could have stayed longer the staff is very helpful and friendly the hotel is minute walking distance to central amsterdam and the hotel rooms are perfectly designed modern amenities clean comfortable and upscale the pricing is perfectly affordable i actually could believe how wonderful the hotel was for how much we paid i will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting amsterdam and i can not wait to return one day a wonderful stay,1
308,trendy and modern design the rooms are clean and have a spacious bathroom with a tub and shower the toiletries were also of nice quality the is right by a restaurant type of market with many vendors of different types of food the food is great the hotel is also off of a trolley route easy to get to from the airport on public transportation,1
309,pretty disappointing my partner and i have stayed a few times and even though previously there were a couple of things that we considered not up to scratch we had relatively pleasant experiences after the last stay we wo be returning the first issue is the staff not true of all the staff members but most were generally rude entering and leaving the hotel was uncomfortable as some of the staff at reception did not make us feel welcome i do really appreciate being silently stared down as i walk to my room another issue was the relentless mini bar check while we occupied the room not a practice i expect from a four star hotel the problem with attitude among the staff became really evident when someone who came to check the mini bar while we were busy entered our room without making himself known there were a few times where someone entered our room without permission which was real invasion of privacy and then proceeded to move our belongings with his foot to gain access to the fridge all without saying much to either of us we made this incident known at the end of check out and they were obviously apologetic but during check out we were not asked how our stay was or if there were any issues and we were told we used an item of the mini bar when we had not which you think they know we did seeing as they checked so,0
310,there was so much we loved about this hotel we found the rooms pleasantly quirky and were not bothered by the lack of windows we were there just to sleep after all although the ground floor rooms line the main foyer they seemed at least as quiet if not better than other rooms we have stayed in the décor throughout the reception area and foyer is really funky and we enjoyed just sitting there and having a reception was very helpful at and they have nice cool water on offer all day which we helped ourselves to regularly with one exception detailed below the service standards were the location is a tram trip from the main tourist spots it is a picturesque tram route and they run regularly the added bonus of the location is the adjacent food hall which we ate at on both the last night of our stay we spotted a used coke can lying under the bed we could have just disposed of it but felt the reception would want to know their cleaners had missed it they told us they would come down and remove it straight away but nobody showed up we had to contact reception again minutes later at which stage a different person said he knew nothing about it he did come down and remove the can but by then it had turned into a larger issue for us then it should ever have we were happy with hotel de hallen and,1
311,small rooms but to be expected at a hotel in europe very nice staff and great dinner at pressroom pressroom breakfast buffet is not worth the at all go to a nice restaurant down the street like greenwoods instead for breakfast nice boutique hotel in the middle of everything in centrum but a little pricey,1
312,we stayed at the ink for the first time recently it was and therefore short but we were impressed with the front desk service and attitudes our room was modern comfortable and well laid out with enough room for too much luggage the hotel is in close walking distance to the train station shopping restaurants and the main square the museum square is a quick tram ride and the tram stop is steps from the hotel door we had an issue not related to the hotel and needed the hotel assistance after we left the staff was extremely cordial and helpful responding to our telephone calls and emails we can not thank them enough for this courtesy we look forward to staying with them again on our next trip to amsterdam,1
313,we stayed at the ink for a short stay in amsterdam the location is excellent and practical being a minute walk from centraal station or a stop tram it is not on one of the prettiest streets in amsterdam it is within easy walking distance of the main sights and has a tram stop directly outside for a trip to the main in was easy and no fuss and we were given rooms on the ground floor the rooms did have a view but were not overlooked and were size was ok what you would expect from a standard hotel room but the only quibble was that there was limit space to store our cases once unpacked we only had carry on cases but they were too big to put under the bed or under the sofa i guess the hotel would store larger bags if was plan to the bedroom which may put some off but no problem for was very clean and well equipped coffee maker kettle hair dryer robes and slippers and loads of soaps gels shampoos in the bathroom bathroom has plenty of space for his and hers toiletries the room was decorated in a large scale querky map of amsterdam so you could easily get a idea of where everything was breakfast buffet included in our deal was very good loads of choice for all tastes and very pleasant was excellent for after dinner drinks with friendly and helpful bar staff,1
314,ink amsterdam is trying to live up to the new definition of cool in the fierce competition of modern boutique hotels and is successful in being in with too much luggage the ambiance of the hotel once we were inside was an immediate calmer on a so far stressful was personable kind and the room was great value for it price a notch ahead of similar concepts i experienced in other parts of europe from bed to bathroom to power outlets we felt that a lot of smart design and through interiors had gone into the process take for instance the wallpaper which actually gives a pretty good and fun guide to amsterdam and what to expect and experience during the stay moreover the room offered well airconditioned quiet and uninterrupted sleep and the room felt as private as should be expected from a the hotel is built in a way which values its secluded though transparent spaces and we registered that both a birthday was celebrated and business meetings were being held without anyone distrubing one came back several times to the hotel rather than staying out late simply because of the bar and lounge area which added on to the experience the signature ink drink picture as well as the artichokes are recommended breakfast was a bit busy but still worth the additional price,1
315,been there this week for the second time first time was august hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the city to min walk from the are nicely decorated with handmade maps of the city and funny descriptions on it rooms are not very big but there enough space to feel comfortable wc and shower are in the same room no separated bathroom which can be disturbing at first but it a concept breakfast is expensive but worth the price impressive buffet of warm cold dishes english breakfast different sorts of bread salmon cheeses ham salami fresh fruits jams yoghurt viennoiseries fresh fruit juices and warm beverages and the restaurant is very definitely will come back on our next visit,1
316,very friendly staff welcomed us we enjoyed the executive rooms with jacuzzi bath location was great as we wanted to visit rijksmuseum and van gogh museum high end shopping street pc hooftstraat is paralell street plenty of restaurants at walking distance we parked our car at the byzantium parking at min walking great location for a city trip as you can walk to all city highlights,1
317,we loved our stay thomas at the front desk went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and welcome loved the honor bar in the lobby and the eclectic decor the lobby cafe was trendy and the food was delicious the rooms were modern beds were super comfortable and the long jetted tub was a welcome site after a full day of sightseeing located just a few blocks from the major museums and canal cruises as well highly recommend it,1
318,from the moment of our arrival which was a bit late around to be exact my daughter and i felt welcomed by the staff at hotel jl the entry is quite bright and charming the desk representative was quite lovely and gave me all the information i could possibly need for my stay the room was beyond my expectations with a full jet stream tub and steam shower and tv the bed was plush and comfy and the robes were quite the plus the daily breakfast was delicious and plentiful the staff was amazing i honestly have not stayed at a better hotel their service and accommodations exceeded my expectations and i am a travel blogger i travel quite often please do yourself a favor and stay here,1
319,the room was lovely the location perfect everyone who works there is exceptional in their customer service friendly attitudes i have already recommended your hotel to friends will continue to do so,1
320,one of the best hotels we stayed in all of most comforting factor is the location it is bang in the min walk to tram a min walk to the canal the square its located in never great comfortable stay,1
321,summarized when we told the young lady at the front desk we did enjoy our stay as we found the hotel outdated with old carpets beds small and dirty rooms we simply got the reply it an old building definately not worth for tourists this hotel is not the dutch standard not a recommendation,0
322,this was our fourth stay here and our best we had a room on the fifth floor facing the square we loved it as we could watch everything the hotel provided earplugs if you found it too noisy room was clean extremely comfy had a fridge and coffee machine lovely toiletries extremely friendly staff who could do enough to help we loved the style of the hotel the art deco style paintings lift etc it was exciting to see the tv show being filmed each evening a fantastic hotel in fact our favourite nh hotel in the area,1
323,we arrived for a night short break for my birthday upon arriving in room there was a very thoughtful gesture left by the hotel manager which was much appreciated thanks again the room itself was a fair size and nicely presented this room overlooked the vibrant rembrandtplein square and it was good to open the bay windows to soak up some of the atmosphere you could argue that later in the evening this position could be a bit noisy but this is to be expected and the hotel do kindly provide earplugs if required this wasnt an issue for us however the hotel generally is clean and tidy and we found the staff to be polite and helpful we agreed that we would both come back without hesitation,1
324,the staff were very accommodating breakfasts were great and the location was in a fun spot with easy access to trams and canals we enjoyed our stay very much rooms were very clean and comfortable we would definitely recommend staying here,1
327,the hotel is in a good location but they have charged my credit card even if the hotel accommodation was paid in full months before the actual hotel stay i had to wait and contact few people before they even refund the money also they did not refund the full amount and i have been sending follow up emails with no response at all do not book this hotel,0
328,we enjoyed staying here our room was small but modern the bar was great for getting a beer before heading out they looked after our bags all day before we flew home the only problem is the painfully slow check in and out,1
330,all other rooms were good we had total rooms and we were promised a triple for the same price just added for an extra bed the staff was excelent and the breakfast was very good of course we will come back another time,1
331,awesome location just walking distance to museumplein ledseplein and vondelpark we wanted to stay a decent distance away from city center and this was the perfect place much closer to schiphol airport than amsterdam centraal the hotel offers transportation to the airport but it a fraction of the price if you take an uber staff was very friendly room could been a lot cleaner but it had the essentials like coffee pot and water kettle semen well what else could it be lol stains on the curtains,1
333,small rooms and bathroom confused service at the reception only good thing is bed bathroom smells noise from hall in the morning breakfast was also poor for this money,0
336,in parts the hotel looks tired but i have to say we quite like it and it is clean as a base in the museum district it is ideal and you do need to use public transport as just about anywhere in town is a walk some longer than others room which is a standard twin on the third floor with a rear view is i suppose bijou the two beds probably cover of the floor space other furniture includes a wardrobe two bedroom cabinets and a desk with chair with shelf beds themselves are extremly comfortable and the only issue we have is the squeeze to get into the one nearest the window however you are not doing it all the time so why corner bathroom contains one of those modern round basins that is difficult to wash your face in but the shower is has to date been lovely and clean and the towels feel nice and is good with a nice variety of rolls with all the usual continental breakfast for the staff well they are probably the highlight of the hotel they could not be nicer and it has been a pleasure to interact with them from getting cups of ice from behind the bar to getting extra pillows to just getting good responses to the random questions we have asked them we have yet to encounter a can really recommend the hotel if you want a decent stay in amsterdam,1
337,very good location of the hotel is great trams and busses near by in case needed the breakfast was amazing and plenty museums and city center are close by everything you need is within reach thanks,1
338,loved every bit of my stay at apollo the staff remembered my name and my birthday throughout the weekend i was very pleased with the location very close to vondelpark and the shopping center of amsterdam,1
339,stayed here for nights in july the location is next to museums and across from the canal which i could see from my room i was able to pick up a canal cruise across the street it is also on the same block that holds the most expensive strip of shops in amsterdam good for window shopping even though the street is a bit busy the hotel is quiet the rooms are a pretty good size for europe the bar is open all day for snacks and drinks breakfast is just ok but plenty if you are not looking for fancy and want to just get your day started the staff was friendly and check out easy,1
340,this hotel is in a great location but they have a lot of problems connecting online payments and paying at the hotel i paid double at the hotel and online and nobody wants to refund me even after they promised they would i am really disappointed,0
341,this hotel is really close to the museums as well as the paradiso venue canal cruises are also right behind the corner we stayed only one night in june but even though the room was not so big it was modern and comfortable and clean the shower was nice however be careful so the water does run down to the room we arrived earlier in the day and it was a relief that we could do early to leave our luggage in the room and refresh before going out can recommend this hotel for its convenient location modern and compact rooms and very good breakfast,1
342,excellent location and easy to reach by tram or bus as one of the great advantages tramlines and buslines with numbers should be mentioned prominently on the hotel homepage or booking sites great breakfast room very small and should also be redone very friendly staff,1
343,we had prebooked a taxi from the airport online before we travelled this was a little trickier than first thought as the airport is vast and we found ourselves wandering around for a while looking for the wtc world trade centre pick up point the wtc is located behind the sheraton which you can see when leaving the airport and not really visible from the airport also no signs however this was not arranged by the hotel but thought its worth mentioning for anyone else who pre books a taxi and are given the same we arrived at the hotel check in was quick and easy and off we went to our room i enjoyed the fact there were fresh apples on reception for you to have whenever you liked yes the rooms are small but when in a city knowing we were going to spend much time in the room itself it did not bother us at all nice room coffee making facilities hairdryer aircon perfect my only gripe is that the bed was a little hard and it did need a lick of paint in places but it was did drink or have breakfast in the hotel so can not comment on prices there are so many nearby shops to pick up a hotel is situated on the outskirts of the which is where we always prefer to be as we always discover lots of things on the walk into the centre dam square it is right next,1
345,excellent location to walk to lots attractions or take the tram and the price is reasonable people working there all are very friendly and helpful our group had rooms most of them were small and the beds were not that comfortable,1
347,perfect location friendly staff rooms just need a bit of tlc we were very close to museum square and a multitude of bars and restaurants were a short walk transport system in amsterdam was first class just watch out for the bicycles,1
348,hotel is room is very small breakfast is good but they put me and my friend um in a floor room and no stairs we had a luggage each i have back problems and it got worse and we are just starting our trip,0
349,great location and very helpful staff i return because the management and quality of the staff is consistent over the past years i do eat at the hotel but observe that other guests enjoy their breakfasts and drinks at the bar,1
350,the location is perfect very close to rijksmuseum and van gogh museum tram stop is nearby the room was rather small but quite adequate and clean tea coffee making facilities in the room comfortable beds you can have a good copious breakfast though with several days stay you find the food range a bit narrow this was our third stay at the hotel and if we visit amsterdam again we will definitely choose this place once more,1
351,staff are rude they charge you twice my account was debited without being told and then i was charged on arrival not helpful check in was hours late after requesting early check in we did get our room until,0
352,this hotel is in an amazing location it away from all the tourist shops and is real amsterdam i only have one negative and it a bit of a pet peeve rooms listed as two beds do really have two beds it two singles pushed so close together you basically sharing a double everything else was fantastic staff is superb,1
353,good hotel with friendly personnel close to rijksmuseum and van gogh transport nearby good shopping facilities for high end access to central amsterdam rooms a bit on the small size but good for a few days stay,1
354,no elevator to my room floor and the carpet was disgusting bathroom not well designed with water want characters and there nothing i can say more so i just put words like that,0
355,we travelled as two couples for a long simple and spacious deluxe rooms shower was a bit strange so got quite wet in the bathroom on the provided in the bedroom however no milk when we asked reception for milk they said no bed was huge and really comfortable so happy with our must admit we were all extremely disappointed with the service from the staff here did seem very happy to we arrived to the hotel we were advised we had to pay per room all together we knew to be aware of this after looking at previous reviews however we still find it shocking this is not made known to you at the point of booking locationwell after looking at some reviews and the name of the hotel i thought this was pretty much central but it about minute walk to dam square around minutes on a tram we had to get a tram travel ticket for the duration of our trip because the walking was too much for will not be staying here again and would really recommend this place to anyone booking to go amsterdam,0
356,we stayed here for days and it was a great choice wonderful location we could walk everywhere rented bikes from the hotel one day and it was a great value room was small but all that we needed since we did spend much time in it staff was friendly would recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again,1
357,despite being reassured that a previous bed bug problem had been resolved we arrived to find bed bugs which were large we booked through and they refused to help us find a new location because it was in the morning there was no manager on duty to refund our money thank god we were not a family with young children the whole place is dated and needs to be renovated,0
358,stayed here for nights with family members for my nieces birthday reception staff were friendly and helpful location was very dated and bedding ripped completely different to what is advertised on the website we had a mouse in our room on the first night spoke to reception and was moved to a room on the second floor the bedding in that room was more ripped than the first also found the following morning that also had mice and bedbugs i have taken photos of the bugs in the beds and the state of the room as we all ended up with bites and one of the girls in our group has ended up with very painful and infected bite i would defiantly not recommend this hotel and think the owners need to improve the standards i would not stay here again,0
359,we did not recommend this hotel at all even the staff was friendly and it is in front of amsterdam central the hotel is poor for us breakfast was bad beds are uncomfortable and i think my husband and big daughter were bitten by bedbugs it was not that clean no air conditioner no fan with like grades hot hot,0
360,it was our first visit to amsterdam and we picked hotel library i spoke with the hotel before booking and they were very nice we let them know that it was our wedding anniversary and our first visit to amsterdam when we arrived at airport it was so easy to get the train and we arrived in central station and we walked to our hotel took us ten mins to walk there on arrival the hotel looked lovely outside and inside was very welcoming we were on the top floor which was very steep at the top i ended up crawling up the stairs as the steps where so tiny but it did put us off the room was lovely clean and the bathroom was amazing there were chocolates and wine out for us because they new it was our wedding anniversary which was a lovely touch we stayed for three nights and liked that there was free coffee and fresh fruit downstairs it was only few minutes away from all the sites and we walked everywhere there were plenty of trams as well we are looking forward to going again in a few months as we enjoyed it so much,1
362,the location was a selling point as it is right across from the central station it is walking distance to many of the top sites admittedly not much from the outside the room was larger than expected modern clean and just right for me my wife and our grandson he especially liked the lift as did i the breakfast room is pretty and the breakfast was a good variety the staff were all pleasant although mostly there were a real variety of people many singles and people looking for a secure environment a good european hotel,1
363,room was not to a star standard but okay for a weekend away the river is beautiful and you can sit out there during the day and it is in close proximity to a train station there is a woods nearby which is lovely to walk through overall nice stay and would probably go again,1
364,i am staying in amsterdam for nights so i booked the tulip inn amsterdam riverside the location was not great but at least it have a river view and the street view the room was clean good lighting great presentation and bed work this is a bit too good for a hotel the restaurant breakfast was superb lots of variety and good quality the and was clear no confusion there overall good rooms worth the money and you can easily visit there good job hotel keep it up,1
365,terrible customer service my family stayed there as part of our tour when checking in they misplaced a batch of our tour group room key and blamed someone in the tour group took the key however the keys were found behind the counter and they did even apologize rude customer service as well when asked please be aware that some rooms does not have,0
366,i travel the world staying in many hotels but this one takes the cake first arrived room smelt mouldy one tiny bar of soap size of a tea bag for myself and wife had to ask for more coffee set up had only one cup when there was meant to be two so we shared a cup called for room service they said they were short staff so come pick up yourself hotel must be next to a night club as constant dj music all day and nite it a saturday or cabin cleaner came this morning i told him do clean my room just give us extra towels seems simple so i gave him my room service tray from night before that was all he had too do was take it away and did have to clean my room so what does he do places by my door and just leaves there it now pm and it still there no sense of hospitality at all will never stay here again and i do recommend it to any one a shocker,0
367,booked to stay here without knowing that it was just opening this week friendly staff could not be more helpful the hotel is really well designed and to a very high spec close to the centre and train station but quiet compared to being right in the centre the room was lovely well designed large and very comfortable breakfast was great also i will be using it again much nicer than a big chain,1
368,nothing more exciting then staying in a brand new hotel everything was extra clean and new the location is great close to central station which was very helpful since this was my first time visiting from another country i was able to uber in a short distance the hotel was also walking distance to main points of the city the staff is very helpful and kind and helped me with plans and transportation and the breakfast was fresh the design is unique and tasteful i look forward to staying here again soon,1
369,the hotel is close to everything amsterdam as to offer most attractions are within walking distance and if prefer it is also close to trams as well the staff is friendly and the rooms are nice and quiet too,1
370,i was so amazed with this place after a last minute booking and at a great price i was sure what to expect i came here with my best friend and with two large suitcases and a lot of stairs facing us we panicked but the staff were amazing and as soon as they saw us attempt to go up they rushed over and helped us even took the suitcases down for our departure the rooms are small but cozy and you do really notice we requested a room with a canal view and we got it it was so worth asking for it so beautiful to wake up and go to sleep seeing the view the breakfast was above average plenty of options and lots of stroop waffles and if we ever brought food back they let us take cups and cutlery up to our room when we rented a bike from the hotel but i soon learnt i in fact could no longer ride a bike they let us be refunded i am currently in amsterdam at the moment and am heart broken that this place was booked out although i understand why if you looking for location staff value book here,1
371,stayed here for two nights from july as a surprise trip my partner booked for my birthday our room was absolutely beautiful and quiet with lovely views of the city and of a garden below we went out on the first night got engaged and when returned to the room the staff had left a meat and cheese board and a bottle of wine the staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much they also allowed us to store our luggage after we checked out so we could explore the city some more as our flight was at night would definitely return to this hotel thankyou for making our trip so special,1
372,we found this hotel on and booked a night stay check in is at but we arrived at pm very early we we very fortunate to be checked in by the lovely dana front desk manager who upgraded us to a room with a balcony and proceeded to get our room ready asap even though we were very early we then were able to leave our luggage and go explore and get lunch while this was happening we got to our room at and walked through the door to find some bubbly and balloons for my husband birthday it was a lovely touch as well as the call dana made to see if we had everything we needed and to wish us a lovely stay all the staff we encountered we friendly and helpful the only negative i would add is the room was slightly dated and a bit tired décor wise but clean and tidy would definitely stay there again,1
373,we booked this hotel last minute literally the day before and were very happy with our one nights stay as it was our anniversary i requested a double bed as opposed to a twin but because they were all taken we were upgraded which was lovely the lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and as we arrived a little early we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room so we could explore amsterdam before our room was ready the hotel is in a great location to explore and was very clean and tidy the room was a good size and the bed very comfy we had breakfast included and there was so much choice from hot to cold food a big choice of juices drinks good coffee and the breads available were beautiful and fresh we loved all the art work in the hotel too we would have no hesitation staying in your hotel and recommending it,1
374,staff were efficient friendly and helpful room was comfortable but a little tired breakfast was buffet style but the choices were amazing so a really good start to the day arrived at and checked in but staff were happy to store luggage until,1
376,i am not expecting anything in this hotel as i in party mode all i need was a clean room and comfortable bed when i checked in i asked the receptionist if possible to have a room with a nice view hoping that he will give me the view of hotel he respond yes the room is ready sir and its with a nice view he handed me the keycard of room so when i entered its a fabulous i got what i a room with a view which usually not available with a standard room and i know amsterdam very well and stayed in many hotels and in my opinion my room has the best view in amsterdam its very comfortable bed friendly staff beautiful breakfast area the corridor is quiet old but they have nice lift so i think they are renovating its super accessible to everywhere as tram stops just infront of the entrance of the hotel so if i will be in party mode again i will definitely stay again hoping in the same room,1
377,great hotel clean rooms and in a great location in the heart of amsterdam the breakfast was great with plenty of choice furniture in rooms was slightly dated but our room was very big and clean well worth the money,1
378,our new room was spacious and better than our original room due to some hick up upon check in we were allocated a better room thanks to the efficient solution to us the hotel looks tired and it seems like it has never been renovated or refurnished at all but i will say the location is really very you must book the half day tour to see the windmills cheese factory and the wooden never regret even we experienced heavy rain in the morning when we were in the tour,1
379,the hotel is renovating its rooms i think by the end of the year most rooms should be done we were very lucky to get one of the few already renovated rooms and it was very nice modern and clean no old carpets beatiful design see photos we really liked this room a lot but felt a bit bad for those who had old rooms these are absolutely not compareable stuff was very nice and helpfull and breakfast extremely good large choice of different stuff and its possible ask for an individually prepared omlette,1
381,me and my girlfriend went to amsterdam for a weekend getaway our first time there so were both excited we were met by a long wait to check into the the room before entering it to find it was tiny there was so little light in the bathroom that we had to have the door open to let light in when having a shower and there was no extractor fan so it just steamed everything up and to top everything off the later that evening we happened to notice some red marks on the carpet to our disgust when we looked closer it was blood yes blood and when we told the staff they tried to tell us it was red wine but it was obviously blood there was no doubting it they did then send someone up to clean it who just stunk the room out with chemicals which after the carpet had dried the stains were still there so they tried again and it still did help,0
382,they gave me old room was used for a years after complain they gave me bigger but still used for long time and very dirty one can smell the dust before u enter the room when i checked out i asked them to bring my big receptionist said sorry bring them by your self coz we dont have some one help u in this and i had to bring down big bags are very small,0
383,we are rarely disappointed by the nh chain it always lives up to expectations we were treated exceptionally well even though we arrived early on a busy weekend our luggage was safely stowed allowing us to enjoy amsterdam right away the room was clean well appointed and roomy thanks for another great stay,1
384,i booked this hotel as an early birthday present for my boyfriend and was really worried because of the reviews we arrived at the hotel early and was able to keep our luggage there until our room was ready the staff were very lovely and helpful we was amazed with the room we got it was very clean and was a lovely spacious room we was on the top floor and had two balconies could fault the hotel at all we had the best trip and the hotel and room we had made it even better,1
385,what would you expect from a hotel room for euro per night qm room with a view to the wall of next very close building bad smoky smell a filthy old carpet a tiny bathroom with not working air vent that was not what i expected but that was what we found but the breakfast was nice and the location very central,0
386,i am sorry i was unable to write a proper review on this hotel as i was ill when i was due to travel after advising reception staff i sent several e mails apologising for the disruption i had caused and suggested re booking later in the year however i never received any reply or response my booking organiser advised me that the hotel stated that my payment was non refundable and that was had not asked for a refund instead a rescheduling however the hotel has felt that it is perfectly acceptable to collect over euros and provide no service whatsoever feel hotels are supposed to be hospitable and friendly i feel this one has shown neither and i would strongly recommend that you check all terms and conditions if considering a visit,0
387,the nh chain in amsterdam has some excellent locations this hotel location is one of them it is near everything and mid range price for your stay the rooms are good but forget the view the breakfast is excellent with super service but a little bit hard to access free wifi in the lobby area and good airport shuttle service i rented a car with a driver from the hotel and it was excellent ride the driver was very resourceful and helpful one of the things i like is that the elevator generates electricity when moving between floors so an hotel with a sense of responsibility great,1
390,terrible place no wifi drug taking on doorstep curtains falling off building site for reception terrace door not locking totally overpriced and to be avoided tv not correctly tuned dirty communal areas,0
391,me and my boyfriend making our trip to amsterdam and been looking forward to stay at the arcade hotel cause their pictures on the website look so good turn out when we get here we could find the hotel cause there is no sign or the name anywhere so we guess from some random paper on the window said with no this place still under construction dusty everywhere in the air and smell very bad the stairs to the upper floor as small as hamsters house when we open the door to our room we kicked the bed cause the bed just stand right there you have to move very slowly and super careful cause the hallway in the room is very small check my picture bathroom was the worst cause the water couldnt go down the well so it flooding the front desk say its our design of the place i speechless cause if you can call this design i would never send anyone to study with much not worth your time and money to come to stay here and tell your friend family neighbors and some strangers you walk pass never come here,0
392,the room was well sized and so was the bathroom the fan and light however we complex to operate ask reception the highlight however was the games room and the many many consoles to play on such a brilliant idea bike hire is simple and bikes are well maintained breakfast is good thanks for the barista coffee staff are super chilled and lovely only criticism is that i could find my favourite games d,1
393,honestly the stairs are mountains my kneecaps gave in on day had to get on my friends back and have him hoist me up and dump me into my bed that i assume was low budget as i almost snapped my spine in half as my back collided with what was supposed to be comfort on the bright side vincenzo was a friendly guy,0
394,excellent room and facilities way better than any of us were expecting only fault of this place is the cleaners extremely clean but a few of our possessions were chucked out whilst we were out sightseeing such as water bottles we used on a night time that we kept next to our beds and sets of eyelashes which were left out neatly in the bathroom on tissue costing me just under hide anything you do want to part with the cleaners do think before chucking things out,1
395,worst stay ever they are renovating the whole place you could not even find the enterance it looked like no one was living there should not be up an running could not sleep through the night due to extreme noise from the builders try to compensate with breakfast but it does not make up for it we were super excited to go here and could not have been more disappointed the room did not look anything like they show you in photos and it was extremely dirty our bedsheets had holes in them and the bedside table was so gross i didnt want to touch it but what was true is that you get a big it just not possible to use it worst stay ever do go her staff is not very helpfull or welcoming not going back,0
396,my company booked me small double room and i got a hostel type accommodation no mirror in the room for i understand the place is under construction but that is acceptable do get cheated as well,0
397,what can i say i intend to lay out this review in the form of the meal i ordered but never received from the hotel in case you did notice that was the first negative point starters upon entering the more like a hostel because of the am raves and appalling hygiene i found myself the room as the staff were busy to show me to my room the first thing i noticed about my room was the carpet which had mould around the edges which when i informed a member of staff about i was greeted with the message that all our carpets are like that for the course of my review i received dirty towels in my bathroom and of course by bathroom i mean the bathroom which was communal for around family size rooms over my three night stay but of course it was my personal error as i should have known replacement towels are not complementary and would set me back to top it all off comes the dessert on the other half of the queen size bed i on was a yellowish stain which was later identified as urine by a member of staff who i caught the attention of whilst she walked down a corridor doing nothing instead of cleaning the people whos bookings keep them employed i can see i am not the first to leave such a disgruntled review of travel and i sure i will not be the last,0
398,i never usually one to write a review and very easily pleased however found this hotel awful we paid a fair amount of money for a hostel type accommodation a but box room with no window it was very dirty and we did want to sleep in the sheets we did pay for a shared bathroom but we did realise this would mean a tiny bathroom being used by other rooms would never stay here again,0
399,the hotel a very nice and central location in the the rooms are very small and are not in the best shape also it quite smelly in the hole place so this is not a standard and not worth the money,0
401,stayed here with a friend to begin interrailing room was very hot and no air con and the staff were generally unhelpful the location was also poor to get to the city centre of amsterdam you need to take a bus or tram which takes at least said our room was very clean and the bathroom was actually surprisingly luxurious for a hostel amsterdam is a notoriously expensive city you can do better for the money,0
402,the floor boards in the room were broken there was a bit of a funny smell there was free wifi it is located by public transport so getting in to the main part of town is easy the breakfast was not like you would get in canada or the usa ie it not like a continental breakfast i stayed here as part of a tour if i go back to amsterdam i will not stay here,0
403,the hotel was terrible there was a hole in the shower and an unknown stain in the tent the only positive things were the really kind staff and the position however i pretty sure that you could find a better place to stay at the same price avoid marnix,0
404,the floor is broke the toilet and shower room are together and there is only one for people this means if one is taking shower then nobody can use toilet what the worse the shower room is useless the water can not flow out so when you are taking shower you will sink in your dirty water how can people do that they call us to use the toilet in the reception,0
406,decent location poor room facilities ie no air conditioning and the windows would open properly still the cheapest accommodation we could find but regrettably i would use the hotel again or recommend staying there,0
407,i spent nights in marnix hotel since i traveled alone the accommodation was enough but i have been happier if they would have had a kitchen to use the staff is friendly and although they do have lockers they could store your valuables and they will be totally safe,1
408,room is ok but restroom is worst no words to describe total nasty and no shower head and water in every experiance and not worthy at all for what we at any cost to check single rooms somewhere,0
409,the room bath and bed sheets were so dirty they had blood on it charged plus to my credit card than they suppost to charge and they didnt gave me any billi want a refund for my,0
410,the hotel required a credit card as part of the room reservation process i provided my card details however was notified by the hotel that my card had been declined i then provided another card however this again was apparently declined when i explained that i had no other credit cards to offer them and requested they please reserve the room under a debit card i was told no a credit card was needed and their machine stated that none of mine worked they told me that it was tough and that they would not keep the room reservation as one would expect i booked a room at a different hotel this was done with no issues i then note per my bank statement that the hotel quentin arrive had charged me for a one night stay on speaking to who i booked through it appears that the credit card authorisation had worked a few days later quentin arrive did not notify me of this and as i am not psychic i had no idea that i had a reserved room quentin arrive has refused to speak to me about this directly and only through have i received the message that they will not refund the not book a room at this hotel awful place poor customer service cons travellersi have no idea whether my credit card worked all along and the hotel withheld this information i will never stay at the place or recommend nobody else do so,0
413,room was noisy can barely sleep and to make matters worse the receptionists have no sense of privacy the smoke alarm went off briefly and she just opened the door to our room while we were still inside naked when she realised what she did she closed the door then knocked wtf all the manager wanted to offer us to make up for it was a discounted rate on the next visit which is never happening,0
414,where do i start we booked a room and got a room which included an ensuite felt like a jail cell me and my fiancé were dreading going back to the hotel at night staff did try to help us just told us the manager is away and to email him we did and never heard back rooms were dirty stained sheets blood stains on the walls no aircon there fore have to leave window open and the road noise was unbearable we had to sleep with earplugs in stair case is so narrow and treads are tiny very unsafe would not be leagal in aus,0
415,we arrived in the room to dirty sheets and also bugs that looked like possible bed bugs would recommend this hotel to anyone was absolutely filthy as far as i concerned could not use the toilet as it sideways between walls pictures on booking do show true pictures,0
417,our room on top floor was small but very clean good bathroom and shower good choice of food at breakfast staff were lovely explained how to get to places brought drinks when sitting in garden very near to tram bus and metro stairs extremely steep but they are in most buildings in amsterdam,1
418,the hotel is situated in a stunning and quiet neighborhood it is not exactly near the centre but it is very easy to achieve it with means of transport staff kind and are clean and comfortable,1
420,this was an absolutely fantastic experience the staff were friendly and helpful and gave me the attention i wanted when trying to pick from the rooms they had available upon they were also responsive to emails and phones prior to my arrival i was able to choose a spectacular room with two windows and full renovations the huge bed was extremely comfortable while the large bathroom provided ample room to get ready there was space for a big screen tv and desk the spaciousness even allowed for the room to accommodate a entry foyer with a and mirror coming home to cool air conditioning was a welcome surprise for a european would recommend this location and hotel to anyone visiting the city and i look forward to returning while not necessarily the most economical hotel it was only marginally more expensive than the others in the area and paying the small difference to stay here will see you experiencing a very comfortable stay,1
421,i ca review the property because we ended up cancelling our stay but i can review the customer booked this hotel for a trip with my partner to visit my year old grandmother we booked it quite last minute and paid for our night stay and due to booking so late we booked as did expect there to be any reason to cancel less than one week after booking and a week before we were due to stay we were advised that my partner father has terminal cancer with only a few months left to live which was completely unexpected and therefore i contacted the hotel immediately to see if we could receive a refund as we could understandably no longer service i had received from our flights provider and car rental had been exceptional as they fully understood our predicament and offered great support as we had booked a room i received a blunt response saying in no circumstances would they need to provide a refund i asked the hotel is we could potentially keep to use at a quiet time for the hotel later in the year but they said i had to confirm the dates we be travelling immediately to do so i explained that we do not know exactly when we will be able to travel given that we do not know how many more months we will have with my partner father and need to be available are caregivers for him so i can not,0
422,the reception staff were very laid back throughout our stay talking to each other and on their phones did give much attention to us but did bother our stay they were helpful if we had room was lovely the beds were comfy and most importantly the room was clean the air con was good view was nothing toilet continually flushed it sounded like the tap was left on full we did know if this was an amsterdam thing so we did speak to anyone about it very annoying is great do get a taxi from the airport get the bus it we paid for the train to amsterdam then for a taxi on the way hard rock and the irish pub across the street were both great,1
423,we had two rooms at the alfred for nights rooms were clean staff friendly and helpful and the location was good located a few blocks from the museums it was an easy walk to transportation the alfred rented bikes which we tried warning be careful riding bikes the people of amsterdam are proficient bike riders and they have it down to an art mopeds bikes cars and pedestrians share the road and for novice bike riders it can be dangerous if we could have stayed longer and got the hang of the rules of the road it would have been better anyway would stay here again there was construction on the road to the side of the hotel but it really did effect us,1
425,i would like to firmly voice my disappointment and frustration with this sons were traveling alone to amsterdam for the first booked a reservation on july a week before their travel date directly from the website and received an email guaranteeing our my credit card company flagged it as fraud activity and put a hold on the contacted my credit card immediately and assumed that the charge would be of sending us an email to inform us of the denial the establishment cancelled our reservation once again without informing us of this event this left them stranded in amsterdam on the scrambling to find a hotel where there was availability for days as you know that is not an easy feat and the reason that we booked a week in advance they eventually had to take a lesser hotel with a higher a sad first experience for two novice travelers,0
426,was at the hotel for five days the front of house are all very polite and location is great i needed to be at the rai centre and for me it was perfect as was also near the centre the room was clean had everything i needed the room was a good size the cleaning team come each day and the hotel also offers breakfast the only bad point is there is currently a tram line being built outside and if you are looking for a lie its not possible with all the noise overall its a good value hotel in a great location with really great staff the next time i am here on business i would lool at booking again,1
431,me and friend stayed here for nights in june location is great and it was really easy to find coming from the train station only around a minute walk depending on how fast or slow you walk taking in the sights of amsterdam hotel was clean we had a room with single beds and it was lovely the hotel is next door to an amazing bakery that serves the best churros so make sure you grab a free sample off the counter because you will be guarantee to be lured in after tasting them for more churros i would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again,1
432,stayed for nights in the beginning of july quite charming place to stay and indeed very central it is walking distance to almost everything and the tram is also nearby this is very close to the dam square we had a window towards the busy street but it was surprisingly quiet still it was a bit damp atmosphere in the small room especially after showering but no big deal no aircon though but a fan is provided the receptionists were very kind and helpful smiling everytime we entered the hotel with steep was average but will definitely stay here once more if we ever visit again,1
433,great hotel for a cheap stay cosy beds and plenty of space no smoking in rooms in a great location we stayed on the top floor which was quiet stairs very steep would recommend with children or elderly,1
434,stayed here for nights at beginning of july check was quick and efficient and staff were lovely you get handed a discount voucher for tea and coffee at the bar as there is the facilities in the room the garden is lovely and very calm we found it nice to just sit down in the garden and relax after a day of exploring hotel is in a great location walked everywhere from the hotel and is definitely reasonable distance to everything however if you struggle to walk for periods of time then the tram is outside the hotel which is great for getting back to central and then the aiport rooms were a decent size all it needed for is sleep as we were out all day so was perfect for us would definitely recommend and stay again in the future,1
435,we have just spent four nights at this hotel and throughly enjoyed our stay the hotel is perfectly located with easy tram access to central station from where most sights tours etc room was spacious very comfy bed and a hot shower crisp sheets and soft towels this is a family run business they are friendly efficient and very helpful with directions suggestions for restaurants etc there is a very relaxed garden area which is a nice place to sit while enjoying a drink or two highly recommend this hotel especially for international travellers like ourselves,1
436,had two nights at this hotel with my teen daughter to give her a taste of amsterdam it a okay value for money and minutes walk from the van gogh museum and minutes from most places of interest but no parking for the car,1
437,we booked this hotel through the stena line hotel and ferry and so were not sure what to expect the hotel was situated in a good location not far from many shops and attractions and proved a good ranging point for our trip the interior of the hotel was pleasant and seemed very relaxed the staff were polite and always room itself was good but basic but then for us this was not a problem our room was situated at the front of the hotel so did suffer from the noise of the traffic which did last a fair portion of the night we also had some guests i assume staying upstairs which at some points seemed to be trying hard to smash through the floor and into our paid in advance for a breakfast which was a very basic continental breakfast it was decent quality but very basic and i think by the end we were becoming a little altogether this was a decent hotel for the brief city break and did for what we wanted however i think if we had stayed longer it might not have been quite so good,1
438,stayed here with my husband for nights hotel is lovely and has the best hard working and friendly staff our room was no and was really too small for my liking nowhere in shower room to hang towel etc and not enough shelf space however it was only for nights room was cleaned every day hotel has such a beautiful garden where we sat every night for a drink when returning back from discovering amsterdam it in a really good location about walk from dam square but you can take the no or tram beware of the bikes thousands of them would return to this hotel if ever back in amsterdam but will request a bigger room lol thanks to all lovely staff,1
439,we arrived around and were accommodated some hotels not allowed it hotel location is very convenient we were walking only and can reach any points of interest in minutes breakfast in hotel worth each penny high quality and many choices very friendly staff,1
440,great location beside tram stop and canal stop excellent breakfast with plenty of choice concierge was always helpful staff very friendly welcome drink on arrival access to hotel from two streets will be back,1
441,we spent night on july we arrived about but could gain access to our room until reception staff offered to store our luggage so we could go straight out to sightsee so perfect arrived back later in the afternoon and were given room on the ground floor which overlooked the amstel canal room the biggest room but nicely decorated and modern lovely bathroom with plenty of towels toiletries and a good hairdryer and always plenty of hot water only down sides was the door between bedroom and bathroom was frosted glass so bit unusual but suppose that modern and there was a slight smell of dampness in the bathroom slept ok lot of noise from the street and people coming hotel at all hours biggest letdown was the breakfast we went along at no pastries croissants scrambled eggs left i asked the waiter if these would be replenished he shook his head and moved on we settled for some toast and a boiled egg there was some bacon left but it really did look appealing check out was at but again they stored our luggage till we in all a nice hotel staff were friendly and helpful and i would return again would just make sure i went earlier for breakfast,1
442,a great location to know amsterdam very nice staff always willing to help proper cleaning the breakfast good although too expensive the only negative thing was the bed too soft even si we would repeat,1
443,the room had everything you need it was very clean and the bed was very comfortable the breakfast was included and was very tasteful and a there was a huge choice the toiletries provided in the room were very nice and vegan the hotel is very vegan friendly the location is perfect it is in the center of amsterdam and you can reach everything within a few minutes by foot i would definitly recommend it,1
444,as the headline says unpleasant personal a dirty feeling in the room a damp and moldy odor were constant in the privacy in the bathroom as the door is like the ones that used in showers and beware of a ridiculous breakfast price that you wont be informed ofthe location is ok though,0
445,i loved hampshire hotel eden amsterdam i stayed in one of the apartments on the side street it was spacious and comfortable the hotel took care of everything i needed the location was perfect i was able to easily walk to so many areas of amsterdam it made my first visit to amsterdam an amazing one i hope to be back soon,1
446,we stayed here one night in a single room and a double rooms are large clean and the are thick so i could hear anything from outside right outside the hotel you got the canals and tons of bars and nice restaurants and cafes very close to rembrandt reception staff is friendly responsive and very professional i feel safe in this would definitely stay here again,1
447,a group of us stayed here for three nights on a city break and i can not fault this hotel at all the reception staff were very helpful and friendly and the consierge was very accomodating on advising on excursions and booking tickets and arranging our airport taxi shuttle the hotel was very clean and in an excellent location to the main canals a minute walk to the bars and restaurants and a minute walk to anne frank house would highly recomend staying here to anyone visiting amsterdam,1
448,hotel staff were welcoming and enthusiastic room was as expected albeit roasting which would not have been a problem had we noticed the aircon unit slung on the wall but no we had better things to think about no problems anything here good location quiet but only a few minutes from the action on foot would be more than happy to stay here again,1
450,very nice hotel i ordered a meal by room service so i tried a fish and creme brulle and all was excellent room was very clean the staff was helpfull i recomend this hotel that was my second time and i know i will stay here again,1
451,we stayed at the hotel for six nights the hotel has excellent location both when travelling with a var or public transport the staff was friendly and helpful we loved the services provided by the consierge at no extra cost the late french breakfast at the coffee lounge was cheap and the service was great we bought breakfast one morning and found it ok but a bit expencive the only problems we had was with the key system our keys never worked the internet was not so great either but overall we liked it a lot slept well and enjoyed our stay,1
452,this was my second stay at the eden we enjoyed it so much last time we decided to return this time we just stayed in a standard room but to be honest there did seem to be much difference between that an the executive room the staff were all welcoming and helpful did not have breakfast this time as it was not included in the deal this was not a problem as due to the excellent location there was loads of cheap places near by to grab breakfast from only downside was that i did leave my top there and do hope they manage to find it planning on returning next month to the same hotel think i will be a lifetime customer from now on,1
453,overall my stay was very good due to the hotel being extremely busy we were upgraded to an executive room which had a bath and overlooked the canal wifi was great streamed video from bed the room was satisfactory in terms of décor bed was not a true double but two twin pushed together with a hole in the middle location was very good i would avoid the hotel food as there are many places to eat nearby for cheaper and better quality the manager was not very kind on one evening when we went to reception with a noise complaint but thankfully we resolved the issue,1
454,the hotel was stunning everyone was helpful and the concierge was the most nicest helpful man i have ever met in my life the beds were amazing too and i the sort of person that would take my bed away with me if i definitely recommend,1
456,amazing stay staff were so friendly and happy to help room was very clean and bathroom was was quite small and so was bathroom but as we were in room much did matter overall was great and would definitely stay here again,1
457,we stayed for six days it is in the middle of the city but quiet it is a short walk to everything the room was nice the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was delicate we are really satisfied,1
458,my boyfriend and i had a lovely stay at hotel eden staff were really friendly welcoming and helpful the room we stayed in was very clean and comfortable the facilities were great and we had everything we needed in the room would definitely stay here again,1
461,hi we stayed at this property for nights check inn june check out july merits location of the hotel is perfect it has two entrance just outside of its main there is a canal and the view is very beautiful and if we use the other entrance which open from its premium hotel we enter into street area the street has lots of bars and pubs also tram stop is nearby it offers lots of breakfast options everything could be found staff of the hotel is good it has a beautiful bar and music is good de merits rooms are small refrigerator is missing i think travellers can book this hotel its value for money,1
462,the location of the hotel is great it just a short walk to the metro and to tram stops we had a room overlooking the canal which was lovely the breakfast had a good selection which was a great start to the day the staff were all friendly and helpful we really enjoyed our stay,1
463,great staff joey is a great guy location is also very good everything was walkable we got a room with an view on the amstel my friend was celebrating his birthday and they put a birthday card and muffins in our room as a gift really sweet of them,1
464,we have been here before and as our son and daughter in law were visiting we decided to go back rooms were great overlooking the amstel canal and had recently been refurbished bathroom modernised and really lovely the bar was closed on our first night due to illness but was then open for the rest of our stay barman was really good and could make anything we asked for on waking on our first morning we thought we were in a building site drilling banging etc when we complained to the supervisor on duty he was pretty blasé saying he did know the works were to start but soon had a notice up telling other guests about possible noise following our complaint to be fair they did refund us for the inconvenience the remainder of our stay was without incident and we all enjoyed ourselves,1
465,fantastic location for this hotel such a central hotel for all attractions and everything within a walkable distance staff were very friendly and helpful we arrived very early morning and although we could not get access to our room until they were happy to take our luggage for us so we could go out and explore the city they are also happy to store your luggage on check out day until it time for you to leave the city rooms are spacious enough very clean and modern we did not have a canal view but at the end of the day how long are you actually in your room for were certainly not bothered by it would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip in this city,1
466,unless you like the hustle and bustle of the canal quarter and the impossibly small rooms near the red light district areas i stayed in my early twenties in amsterdam as a novice traveler then you stay close near central station and tolerate the of the potheads and party revelers all night long fast forward years on a seasoned and more discerning traveler in my thirties has preferred to be away from the smoke so to speak literally and it was such a delight to discover this quiet hotel just off the main drag trams and from central have stops on both sides of the hotel and literally up the road are bars and restaurants the hotel itself has small if adequate en suite rooms but you do see a canal when you peer out of your window i was placed in a canal room which i did book but eventually got thankful for so i had no reason to complain though the lifts were apparently not working various points of my stay luckily they were working every time i was in and did experience the inconvenience of climbing up those narrow steep stairs to the floor carrying luggages if i did staff were obliging enough to do it for you according to the other guests breakfast selection in this hotel is superb and the courtyard dining was just divine especially with the presence of least house cats which gave you that homely feel and sense of tranquility to balance,1
467,we had a long weekend holiday to amsterdam to we had booked inner amsterdam hotel after days of research and it was located in the museum quarter in amsterdam city i emailed them the night before our arrival to check the rooms i booked were together and to confirm our time of arrival to my horror they cancelled allegiance g the hotel was closed due to fire regulations they had relocated us to the blue tower hotel miles outside amsterdam apparently according to the cab driver who took us to our hotel this happens a lot hotels get late requests for parties willing to pay s premium and move people to other had not been happy about being relocated to a hotel i did book but blue tower turned out to be a great stay the staff were very helpful and the rooms had a panoramic view of the city it just been refurbished and the work is ongoing the european breakfast was also great and runs later in a sunday the location was a down side and tram needed into the city but on s positive the tram stops are a couple of minutes away on foot definitely consider buying tram tickets from the hotel for the days you staying rather than in s daily basis and you save money the only criticism of the hotel was the wifi in our room was terrible loads to do in amsterdam galleries canal trips to appreciate the beautiful architecture shipping and,1
468,just got home from nights in amsterdam with of my friends we all stayed in room which had three beds floor with lovely view and balcony very modern and stylish hotel with very comfy beds and modern the staff were friendly and were happy to help with any requests or queries the location was great too there a tram stop outside the hotel no noise from our room though and a minute walk in either direction takes you to restaurants and and more tram stops breakfast was nice there was quite a lot of choice compared to other hotel breakfasts i had and overall good food standard we did get a chance to book any trips through the hotel or eat at the restaurant as we had plans but were nice to have there in definitely be back in the future for our next trip amy,1
469,i sorry albus i had agreed with your manager that i would not leave a review but since you prompted me i am now telling my true experience this is my experience and there are no allegations in this i had booked about a month or so ago through my travel agent aaa who went through travel bound when i arrived the part time front desk receptionist did not have rooms then she found me a super small room where i had to go to the thrid floor and then climb some steps to go to it it had views of pipes and roof tops i think the rooms with views that amy j refers to are reserved for people considered special when i asked to change to a room with a window that was being cleaned i was told no that that room was reserved for someone else after enduring one night in a super small room where the shower leaked all night leaving water and mosquitos i asked to change in the morning and only upon the importunate request of the plumber was i given a slightly larger room in a dark and dingy basement under a pavement grate that gave me night mares all night was absolutely no slice of heaven for me the pictures in the hallways were not to my taste and the neighborhood was full of weed smoke i came back hopelessly sick on the one hot day there was no air conditioning and,0
470,really cool boutique hotel located in a centralized area for touring the city very nice front desk the bar down the street was noisy at night but who going to bed early in this town would easily stay there again,1
471,i loved my room apartment it was so helpful with working with my coworkers when we could just come to my place and have meetings there everything had a wonderful design to it and i had to love the fact that the hotel uses the same plates as my husband and i picked for our wedding registry years ago staff is super sweet and helpful too,1
472,central loation with access to train and bus tons of options around the hotel for restaurants and ten minute walk to popular front desk was excellent pleasant polite and helpful we were walked up to the room by front desk staff coffee tea champagne and light snack available in reception area when you walk in room was clean and cozy with everything you need,1
473,reception staff is just perfect nice polite and efficient we arrived early we offered coffee and could check in earlier than the room was clean big enough all good we also could check out late i ahd a very surprise for my birthday and was pleased by the attention will be back at albus for sure,1
475,the design of the hotel is very nice and modern i have really liked the floor in the room nice to walk barefoot and little touches like coffee machine bath robe and slippers what i did like was the shower really messy water splashing all over the place they have even provided special tool for self cleaning the floor from water and the person who handled my she was very fake in being nice it just has made me very uncomfortable good nice breakfast,1
476,stayed for one night and this is definitely the go if you want a fresh central hotel the staff was really friendly and helpful and it was really clean was a pleasure to stay and i will definitely book the same one when i visit amsterdam next time,1
477,all room staff breakfast was good and enjoyable rooms are very nice clean and location was great too there a tram stop outside the hotel and a minute walk in either direction takes you to restaurants and and more tram highly recommend this beautiful little hotel for business or pleasure,1
478,good centralized location between the center of amsterdam and the museums made for easy walking around the city very clean room with nice bathroom and plenty of space also the staff was very pleasant,1
479,service was excellent room comfortable and location was perfect the staff was welcoming and engaging with our children and upon check in we received a voucher for a heinekin mini keg to be delivered to the room,1
480,excellent hotel in the perfect spot of will stay there again in the next stop at one of our favourite cities in close to the stop city center shopping and must see points,1
481,the hotel is quite small but modern rooms was clean bathroom was spacious and well equiped wifi was reasonable as far as hotel wifi goes staff is friendly we did use the hotel bar or restaurant so can not comment on it view from the window was pretty bad some internal pleasant stay,1
483,i spent three nights at the albus hotel my overall experience was quite good what i did like was the fact that the wifi on my floor was terrible i could stay online for more than a minute it was better in the lobby and the restaurant but not as good as it should be rooms are quite nice although could be better for that price thin walls laminat flooring on the other hand the location is perfect staff nice and breakfast rich,1
484,very comfortable bed in a nicely decorated room with a great coffee machine nice big bathroom the room was cleaned very well and restocked location to see the sights in a very freindly city where everyone wants to have a chat with reception staff were really helpful and knowledgeable in how to get aboutand what to house restaurant looked good but we had a reservation already booked elsewhere so did was included in our package and was we return here yes without a doubt and have recommended it to friends looking to travel to amsterdam,1
485,nice little hotel in central amsterdam right next to the flower market and walking distance from all the central area is small and was regularly very busy no doubt because the hotel was fully booked while we were try the restaurant which was also very busy but it looked interesting,1
486,no surprises here exactly as comfortable hip rooms and a location right in th heart of the front desk staff that went out of their way to explain everything and welcome our daughters,1
492,on a recent visit to amsterdam my husband and i booked a room for nights here and we were so happy with our stay the staff were so friendly to us we had booked a very early flight from cork and arrived before our room was available i know it common practice for a hotel to store their guests bags prior to check in if needed but i felt the staff were super friendly about must have visited amsterdam on some of the hottest days of the year as i near amsterdam is not too unlike ireland and the day after we checked in portable fans were delivered to the rooms to combat the heat nice touch the surrounding area is gorgeous also so eateries and a park right next door ideal for children or if you want to get a bit of exercise in on your hotel is very near the and trams to take you to the city centre areas and i would recommend the hour depending on your length of stay for the trams and this will save you a small fortune in the long was really impressed with this hotel i believe it a star rating but it should be more,1
493,we booked the hotel through a secret escapes deal and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here the hotel does a look a little tired on the outside but it definitely very modern inside the rooms were clean and tidy with a great view over the city the rooms are a little compact but we did find that to be an issue when we stayed we also had breaktfast there for the duration of the stay which we really enjoyed everything is self serve and looked great the hotel overlooks the nearby park which makes for a great breakfast view the hotel is also conveniently located near a few tram stops which makes it super convenient for those using it as a base to explore the city i definitely stay there again if given the choice,1
494,we were at this hotel for nights the outside is clean and tidy but may put you off seeing the building like an office block or an old block of flats but inside this hotel was very modern lovely place to stay the beds were very comfy if you do want to be anywhere noisy this is a great location right outside the hotel is a tram stop and you can go all the way to central station passing a lot of good places if you want to go another direction there is another tram just the other side of the tropen museum next door to the hotel and that takes you to all of the other good places buying a travel pass is definatly a must to save money on travel,1
496,no complaints staff and hotel were wonderful construction prevented entering through the main door but not an issue the staff was both helpful and knowledgeable many attractions are minutes away,1
497,strategic place to stay the hotel is in amsterdam city near to station shopping center clubbing etc just walk a step you find everything you need the services is excellence but unfortunately there is no lobby are for parking a car,1
498,what an awesome place to stay if you are arriving by train it is a very short walk across the street to this hotel centrally located it just does get any better a quick tram ride to any part of amsterdam walking distance to shopping restaurants and canal tours the hotel concierge was very knowledgable and helpful clean i am a germaphobe it passed my inspection,1
499,dirty hotel our never the room got cleaned the hotel is under constrution and they just push everybody in an ugly next door block that is in a small alley is all improvised the rooms have nothing to do with the pictures they show in the web page or,0
500,my wife and i have stayed at this hotel on many occassions and every single time as been a very pleasant and happy staff are very friendly and will do anything they can to make you very welcome,1
501,even though under construction the hotel is lovely it is located literally in the cent from everything so you can just walk somewhere if you want to the staff were really friendly and the rooms were getting clean often and quickly the staff deal with your queries immediately i loved my stay there,1
502,i visited this hotel having made a quick booking at the last minute through the club carlson app and opted for a prepaid non refundable rate which included breakfast i chose the hotel because i had noticed it on previous visits to amsterdam when i had stayed at the krasnapolsky which is relatively nearby i wanted to be near the train station on this occasion and hence my decision untypically i began to read tripadvisor reviews after i had completed my booking and as quite a number were unfavourable i felt a degree of trepidation and foreboding that i had made a terrible am happy and relieved to be able to report that i had a thoroughly pleasant stay notwithstanding that the hotel is undergoing massive refurbishment the temporary entrance to the hotel was for example down a narrow alley which would be daunting for the fainthearted if they arrived in darkness there seems nothing to fear however because i walked freely and in safety around the area in the stayed in what is called the urban wing my room was modern clean well equipped and of a reasonable size the decor is perhaps a little dark but this is to some people taste and not to others i quite liked it the staff were coping remarkably well with the works that were ongoing and while the works are obviously very extensive with dozens of various tradesmen in hard hats coming and going and my experience was that the works,1
503,dear all hotel is located just opposite of amsterdam central railway station busy place in the city hotel is very good to stay and for tourist the best place to stay easy to access amsterdam city tour bus,1
504,a great hotel in a perfect location the hotel was a two minute walk to the main central station ideal for our travelling to schiphol airport and return hour trip to german travel was made easy with online booking via trainline our room was a reasonable size very clean with a view to the station and canals the room was very quite all with double glazed windows the staff was very friendly and spoke good english we did not eat at the hotel but rather experienced the many restaurants within walking distance shopping museums canal boat tours are all minutes walking distance from the hotel we would definitely stay at this hotel again,1
505,i was lucky enough to book a couple of months before leaving on trip meaning i got a nice deal on the price of the room the hotel was in renovation but everything was still accessible and working correctly the room was super clean and huge plus you have a nespresso which is a great addition finally it right across the street to go to amsterdam centraal so location is i would book again,1
506,the location is perfect to visit the city without using the city transport the hotel is great with the pool the room was nice but there was some noice because of the reparation in the hotel the staff concierge was really nice and helpful but i think the people at the reception could be nicer they are the first impression of the hotel and it disappointing,1
507,all very good but parking is horrible expensive euro for days even as it is valet parking and i also think the breakfast is too expensive the rest is a good package in a perfect location would recommend,1
508,very clean and staff polite our room was a good size and equipped little gym and lovely pool and surrounding of all great location which is very important for us whilst visiting amsterdam one down side useless iron and ironing board the rest of the hotel gets a thumbs up would recommend and would return,1
509,i staid at park plaza during an holiday trip in the netherlands with my wife and our kids the hotel is downtown in front of the centraal station and very close to the main city turistic spot nice room good service very good breakfast,1
510,we arrived here at after an hr flight did not expect to be able to have a room until later in the day the lady on the front desk was lovely warm friendly welcome and she gave us a room to use location is fantastic we caught a train from schipol airport to amsterdam central the hotel is immediately across the road it is situated by the damrak and it was a great place to base ourselves everything was within walking distance or an easy was surprised by our room i had been reading that the hotel rooms in europe were very small not the case here it was a good size very clean and well laid out beds were very had to attend to some urgent business whilst here and the front desk staff were so helpful with printing up documents and then scanning and emailing them on for it they were so happy to help it was much staff member we came across were smiling and friendly this absolutely makes the stay more i ever have the opportunity to return to amsterdam i would definitely stay here again,1
511,chose this hotel principally because of its location it is literally just across the road from the central station in amsterdam from the minute we checked in the staff could have been more helpful friendly and accommodating our room was on the floor and was very large with an enormous bed beautiful bathroom elemis toiletries safe minibar air conditioning and everything else you could possibly need you would never know you were in the thick of amsterdam at night because the windows blocked out everything and black out curtains added to the feeling of peace the breakfast in the hotel is superb with a very wide choice of food and drink we would hesitate to recommend this wonderful comfortable and friendly hotel left luggage service meant we did have to drag our cases around on our last day and midday check out meant we were rushing either ca really say anything bad about the place highly recommended in every way,1
512,الفندق ممتاز و ايضا الموقع رائع و الموظفين ودودين و الغرف ممتازة و نظيفة انا اتكلم عن executive room كبيرة ما في الفندق انا مقابل مخرج محطة القطار الرئيسية متر و انت في الفندق ولا تحتاج الى تكسي في المنطقة كل شي قريب جدا المطاعم و المقاهي و محلات تجارية و مراكز و القنوات المائية الخ fantastic hotel unbearable location nice rooms and services with pool opposite central station m or m to the hotel very nice staff clean rooms,1
513,a compact hotel in a quiet area with connection to all modes of transport the staff is very helpful and friendly the nearness to gardens and museums is a definite hotel offers breakfast only however a number of good restaurants are in the vicinity and offer good food,1
514,the muse amsterdam is well located it is on a quiet street but close to many museums and the rest of amsterdam is easily accessible via the nearby tram routes we had two rooms during our five night stay and the comfort double was quite adequate in terms of size if you plan to be out and about most of the day the hotel service was outstanding they helped with many questions regarding museum tickets and arranged a rental car for us we also enjoyed the availability of coffee tea and cold drinks at no charge hours per day we would stay there again,1
515,the service was excellent with pleasant staff nice clean updated rooms and a great breakfast beautiful courtyard out back to relax and take a break during a long day exploring this wonderful city near transit stops dining attractions and shopping would definitely go back,1
516,although the rooms are small it was a great location with a wonderful staff the hotel was in a great location it was close to the museums and the tram the breakfast that they offered i the morning was very nice you can order off of a menu or eat from the brunch area they had a wonderful assortment of beverages our room was on the third floor and was very quiet the halls and elevator were small but manageable,1
517,we had a nice stay at the hotel we had one of the bigger rooms but they are quite small but we had everything we need in the room including a comfy bed the walls are quite thin and it can get noisy at times there were no one to help us with the luggage when we arrived or departed it is not easy to manage through the small hallways and steep stairs with baggage the staff were friendly and the breakfast good the hotel is situated in a good location for a visit to amsterdam near all important sites and close to transport we could get to everything we wanted to do without a hassle,1
518,stayed here on my first trip to amsterdam hotel vondel was a great choice clean and comfortable room not the largest and only a shower no bath if that concerns you the receptionist was super friendly and chatty checking me in quickly and showing me to my ate in the hotel as was too tired to venture far and again the waiter was friendly chatty and attentive there is loads of menu choice but the pork i had was tasty and not too badly to the main road and tram stay again,1
519,loved my room and the fact that they read my comments on expedia so that i did have to deal with any stairs except the entrance that said the entrance is not friendly for those who struggle to walk especially with is a tram stop close by actually at either end of the block museums and great walks to enjoy,1
522,second stay here for me and i must say i surprised by some of the other less than positive reviews about hotel vondel my room was a comfortable size modern yet had a really homely feel about it bed was comfortable and good powerful shower enjoyable breakfast and friendly efficient staff hotel is very centrally located without being in the noisy crazy streets will definitely return,1
523,we enjoyed our one night stay at this hotel the room was clean small but was totally for the of us me wife and year old son receptionists were quite friendly and helpful worked fine location is convenient to pubic transportation there is a decent grocery market nearby we arrived from paris via train later in the afternoon and did want to venture too far from the hotel to eat because we were a bit tired and i had to work early int he morning so we ate at the hotel the server was very nice and our food was very tasty and fairly priced decent wine list too all in all i would recommend this hotel,1
524,after reading reviews on here i rather cheekily asked for a room with a balcony when i booked a large deluxe double room at this point i did realise there was only room in the hotel with a balcony room what can i say what a room what a view there are far cheaper hotels in amsterdam but this view was worth every penny of the price we did eat breakfast so i ca comment on that but the hotel was clean and we were more than happy with it central location my only tip would be not to forget the mosquitoes we slept with the balcony doors open every night and were covered in bites by the time we went home but this was definitely down to mosquitoes rather than anything else will definitely be staying here again,1
525,on arrival we were told where our room is up the lift and round the corner what was said is up the lift up half a set of stairs down half a set of stairs then up another set of stairs would like to be disabled in this hotel then when we did get to our room there was one set of stairs to the reception going that way would be much the room itself was standard double bed air con en suite however the bathroom stank as in like sewage it was as if the in the was not fitted the room had a window but outside that window about away was a window to another room the room also had a sharp rise randomly in the floor right where the bed was meaning it location of the hotel is right at the start of the red light district so good for stag groups etc but not glad i only stayed night but would rather next time spend extra money to go else where,0
526,after an initial problem finding the hotel we were warmly greeted at reception and after details completed provided with room keys to access room area you have to pass through a secure door which is activated by your room room was quite small however was very clean and supplied with plenty of towels and tea and coffee making facilities my daughters room was quite spacious for her and her daughter and problem with tv was quickly rectified all rooms have and our room which was a ground level had double glazing to reduce the sound from the street which was very hotel does not offer breakfast but you can obtain vouchers for a restaurant only yards away from the hotel is well placed and within a short distance from the train station and dam square as well as one of the main canals and boat hotel is kept clean and tidy and the staff are very quick to assist regarding any questions about travel or dining not the cheapest but a good standard and one to consider if visiting amsterdam,1
527,not long back from this hotel pleasantly surprised as it was very central right in the heart of the bars and restaurants the hotel room was really small but receptionist said we had booked a small room ive fortunately been in cabins bigger but to be fair it was clean and well maintained breakfast can be purchased on the streets close by i would go back,1
529,got to the hotel a few hours before check in time and was allowed to leave our luggage we were also told we could book in a few hours earlier than the agreed time as our room would be ready we were given room room is directly over the reception area has windows that do open and are directly over the foyer making it really dark there is also hardly any storage space and nowhere to store your empty case the air conditioning unit is really noisy as well so could be left on i went straight down to the reception to complain as there was no way i could stay in that room the very helpful receptionist found us another room straight away room which was so much better it is the ritz but it had a window that opened and more storage space and a comfy hotel is in a great location it is literally minutes walk from the central station is probably the same to dam square has loads of bars and restaurants near by and just seems to have everything close to hand it is on the very edge of the red light district but i think you need to go to amsterdam with an open complimentary toiletries are really nice which is always a bonus and there is a decent hairdryer and tea and coffee making would recommend this hotel as long as you get the right room i would stay here again as well,1
530,went july to aprox just is just off dam square so in good im yrs old the stairs were narrow steep without lift access to floor where my room had a lovely juliet the windows would not open because the bed was inches away from get out of bed i had to lift my leg to put it over the end of bed as bed nearly touched the wall i was sleeping by the back started aching on the sunday morning i couldnt get out of just thought bed must be very soft continued with my on the monday i could not move at noticed that my sheet was never tucked in under the mattress mattress was soooooooooooo thick i pulled the other side out from under bed only to find it reached the floor i then noticed the duvet that was on the bed was badly went on to take sheet off bed to see a filthy stained thin this off bed to find blood stains on the bottom bit of pillows were also badly went to complain but housekeeping were on my floor told proceeded to renew pillows duvet but he brought in a rolled up old mattress to replace my was also badly room was a not recommend,0
532,do not book this place if travelling with young children because sex shops are but the location is quite good close to madame tussaud and ripley museum and canal tours are very close by as well the eateries around the area are simple and great places to grab a bite rooms have ac free and fast wifi clean amenities shower was nice has shower head however the walls of the interior were not as soundproof as you could hear people talking in the hallway and their footsteps thumping down the hallmornings are quite noisy around this area because garbage trucks are around,1
533,my husband and myself visited amsterdam last week for the eighth time i had booked a room via when we arrived we were given the tiniest room imaginable it was atrocious i could walk past the safe without banging my legs and we could not get dressed at the same time no room at all i requested a room change and was told that nothing could be done until the next day fair enough we enjoyed our day stayed packed and the next day was moved to a lovely basement room overlooking the canal with loads of space the hotel is modern and quirky at the same time they are generous with teas and coffees in the room and the majority of the reception staff are great one in particular was awful and grumpy great location and not noisy at all highly recommend breakfast in the café directly opposite cant remember what its called,1
534,this hotel is perfectly located within the heart of amsterdam and close to all of the is very slow and the whole hotel is showing its age but is still good value for money in an expensive city a general facelift would benefit the breakfast was all you could ask staff very helpful and went out of their way to make you feel welcome,1
535,great location within walking distance of just about every place we were interested in visiting in amsterdam city center transportation was near by trams buses train grocery store fast food bars and restaurants were within an easy walk tour office was at end of the pedestrian only street the hotel was located on staff members were helpful with every request i had starting with me sending an email asking for rooms near each other in a quiet location unfortunately my room had a stench that did not go away at first i thought it was food from the previous guest but i was there for nights in retrospect i think it was the when i checked in there was a dirty on the floor thick dust on the tv and no shower cap in the box left in the bathroom the reasons for my rating for cleanliness my sister room was fine lighting was odd in my bathroom as the ceiling light shined downward behind you as you stood at the mirror which made it difficult to see what you were doing as you put your make up on particularly since i wear glasses breakfast was adequate choice of cereals yogurts meats breads beverages bonus pop machine served cans of heineken all in all a pleasant stay,1
536,the primary reason for my booking this hotel was its location it was right at dam square the other reason was that this was the only hotel offering a double bed for single occupancy as well the room was small like the kind of rooms you would find in manhattan but what else would one expect at the city center being a restaurant the only staff available was at the reception so do expect any room support if you need something you need to go and collect it from the reception yourself breakfast was nothing to boast of but it was decent the receptionist who also set up breakfast served hot coffee and hot milk on request which was a delight the receptionists were very helpful with any directions or queries we had they also arranged a cab for airport drop if you are looking for a clean room and only bed and breakfast this is one of the best to go to the shopping area the trams the rld the central station everything was just a few minutes walk from the hotel the only thing to be cognizant of is that it is on a pedestrian only street you will have to drag your luggage a bit to get to the hotel,1
537,a disappointment we have stayed in many best western hotels after flying to europe usually you know that there will be a certain standard of excellence not this time it is true that the hotel was spotless but our room was small and pokey but it was quiet there were lots of places to eat in the neighbourhood and the food was good this was in contrast to the breakfast offered at the hotel meagre choice i am sure you could find a better hotel for the night between flights,1
538,stayed four nights in late june with two other the net we were looking for an inexpensive hotel in the heart of the city off a main road and this is what we found it fitted our criteria perfectly sure there were some issues i understand it has the slowest lift in europe the beds are so spongy you can roll off them and my toilet bowl was difficult to access refer photograph while dated the our room was a good size however one of our group was quite small the staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast room was adequate it beautifully located in a quirky pedestrian laneway right next door to a wonderful beer hall is directly opposite a cute cafe which serves a great lunch and could be closer to highly recommended restaurants within walking distance of central station even with luggage well we managed it,1
539,arrived around for a night stay allocated room had a view of station platform receptionist suggested we request a room change the following morning room was ready at am we had slept in and had late brekkie which is offered from to noon clean room amazing breakfast selections very friendly staff fantastic location,1
540,stayed in this hotel just for a night as i was over visiting a friend i usually stay in ibis hotels have always had a pleasant stay very clean staff very friendly attentive great location for the city centre various excursions transportation up for a night stay at the end of october,1
541,very convenient for city and station and for river cruise terminal able to walk to latter with heavy bags downhill room basic with non working plug in bathroom basin and light beside bed not working ground floor room looked straight into bike park with glimpses of canal breakfast included and varied but always scrambled egg beans and sausages wifi free and reliable,1
542,great spot if you are coming and going by train from amsterdam central staff are super friendly and room very clean not a big room or bathroom bud adequate if you are not going to spend a lot of time in the room,1
544,the only good thing about this hotel while using the term hotel very loosely is it close to everything and exactly where you want to bestayed for days and they did not clean our room change our sheets or change our towels once even after asking them every day and again assuring us it would be done it never got done,0
547,hotel was in a great location very central to everything staff were great to deal with wifi was accessible from rooms which is a downside was rooms were very small by the time we put our luggage on the floor there was no where to stand except sit on the bed,1
548,very conveniently located roughly m from amsterdam central station close to points of interest such as tower city center and canal cruises the room we stayed in was rather small but comfortable with a great view facing the eye movie museum building across the waters from the amsterdam central station the staff were very friendly warm and welcoming it was a pleasant short stay,1
549,i have stayed here twice now and it really is a perfect spot for visitors the hotel is right next to centraal station and amsterdam city centre the staff were really helpful when i stayed last the rooms are clean and have all the basics if you are looking somewhere central this is perfect nothing luxurious but as a place to sleep and rest it great value,1
551,my husband and i stayed at ibis in august for nights the primary reason we had booked this hotel was for its location and we were not disappointed the hotel is less than a minute from the amsterdam central train station and is less than minutes walk into dam square the room size however is really small and the bathroom is even smaller at first when you open the bathroom you almost miss the shower area because the shower cubicle is that small also please note that there is no in the rooms i quote the receptionist we do not have air conditioning but we have air cooling and there is a fine line between them this was a new concept for us to grasp these air coolers would go off every hour or so at night and the reception told us that they control them centrally and turn them off if they feel it too cold our room became very stuffy without any cooling system the room has a small device to control this cooling but i think that a dummy device and the hotel controls it we did buy the breakfast because per person for breakfast was expensive for ibis overall if you just need a bed to crash in i guess this but it too expensive for just a bed at night,0
552,as many say this hotels location is it number one plus close to central station links around the city would use again basic room as expected not changed in the two nights i used it priced at it correct level considering how central it is for what it worth not a bad place to have as a base,1
553,we booked this hotel for ease of travel from the train and found it to be a good hotel in a great location friendly and attentive front desk staff good food drinks in the lounge area and a great breakfast buffet we would definitely book here again,1
554,have visited amsterdam a few times with work this is probably the best hotel for price and location the rooms are very clean and the staff only to happy to helpyou are less than min walk from the ferry and the central station dam square is about mins walk so you are right in the middle of it all if you explore the streets there are some great places to eat or you can take advantage of the hotels restaurant the food is really good i will defiantly use this hotel again for both future business and personal trip,1
555,ibis has a very friendly and helpful staff they went the extra mile giving our small group excellent services the location is right at the central train station and in the heart of the town center the train from the airport comes directly hear you can walk to the cruise terminal in about minutes across a promenade that is virtually traffic free luggage storage if you come in too early to or want to do the town before a late flight,1
556,we stayed here for nights and the location is perfect we got the train direct from the airport to central station for and the hotel is right by its side you are then close to everything within walking distance nice bar and food the rooms are very clean and nice hot shower i would stay here again without a doubt,1
557,the hotel is conveniently located next to the amsterdam central station which is a transportation hub there is a tourist office tram stops and ferry terminal in front of the station and a bus station a short distance across the canal it is walking distance to the dam square and other attractions like dewallen national monument royal palace nemo science museum madam tussauds and the historical city hotel features an excellent breakfast buffet with the restaurant overlooking the train tracks you can watch trains coming and going as you are having breakfast a separate restaurant serves dinner and drinks in the evening and offers a wide choice of hotel has two wings the city side rooms and rooms with a view overlooking the ij river the rooms with a view are over the train tracks and offer better views although you need to change elevators to reach size is reasonable and rooms feature free wifi staff is friendly and helpful the hotel is an excellent base to explore the worth a stay,1
558,the rooms were clean but small location is great for airport train in and short walk to hotel lots of attractions in close walking breakfast was good included with room many restaurants close by for eating out,1
559,the hotel is well located in amsterdam central from walking distance of amsterdam central station and tourist area small rooms but good for short stay reception staff is very friendly and helpful left luggage area will be great option to store your bags if you got to leave late very small bathroom and it seems designing issue from the beginning,1
560,this was the first time going to amsterdam i was taking my daughter age for her asked the advice of a friend since he had been to amsterdam quite a few time where he would suggest we told us of this hotel as it was very central and true to his word it was it was right next to the train from the airport and across the round from lots of the main hotel looks grubby from the outside but inside it very area is bright and clean staff are room itself is small just about enough room for a double bed and a chair we did find this a problem as we only slept found the bathroom more of a problem it was really small overall they were both very ate breakfast in the hotel even thought we thought it was over priced it saved us looking for something breakfast was good but not euros good per in all i enjoyed our stay and if i was ever going back again i would use this hotel,1
561,arrived from paris by thaly train service this hotel was perfect as it was just a minute walk out of the station staying two nights we were on the floor facing the front giving us great views took city sightseeing tours both bus and boat as for the bus we were seated on the top deck the configuration of the bus with its obstructed view made it next to impossible to take photos in addition the glass ceiling produced a greenhouse effect making the bus extremely uncomfortable even though the air conditioning was on the canal cruise you have your pick of different routes was a better experience check out the ruks museum and a good photo opp of the i love amsterdam sign behind the museum also the diamond cutting store is also on the tour we purchased a nice watch there and the staff filled out the vat form for us the hotel has an extremely tasty buffet breakfast service it also had a nice serving decent food at a good cost we found that getting meals outside was problematic due to the extreme numbers of people the train station itself does have some restaurants and stores a pleasant experience at ibis amsterdam central,1
562,the ibis was in a perfect location close to everything trains canal ferries eateries and red light district and busy with bike and tourists hotel we had a view of the canals on the amsterdam side and bikes bikes everywhere which was gorgeous gave the room a really amsterdam feel the room was a good size the bathroom was a little small but clean so that all that mattered to recommend this hotel easy to get anyway,1
564,great and friendly breakfast was delicious and plenty of room we had a room on the floor at the back near the tracks but had no issue with noise the location is great to avoid lugging suitcases through the city right next to the station so easy to catch a bus tram etc beds were comfortable and room very clean we felt the space was decent they have fast which was nice would stay again and recommend,1
565,we chose this hotel online and were delighted with the location close to everything and easy to walk to some attractions anne frank house the hoho tours are everywhere and great to finding things trams are right there if this is your choice walking distance to the cruise port be prepared that this is not an american hotel about like a holiday style stayed night and night the first room was rather small no facial tissue or wash cloths provided no clock in the room the buffet was expensive euros per and rather skimpy on the food check in quick and easy with wonderful desk staff healthy snacks available for purchase in the lobby free computer use for guests we are not smart phone people so this was great for sending a quick message home rooms very clean and our second room was more the size of a small american hotel room with a larger bathroom and shower still no wash cloths or tissue i would stay here again for price and location,1
566,the location of this hotel is perfect specially if you have an early morning flight and still want to live close to centre public transport is mins walk away and dam square is about minutes walk the rooms are small but that not unusual with ibis we were given interconnected rooms so we kept getting startled by voices of our neighbours the water in the vending machines is super expensive it was like euros for small bottle,1
567,after professor bubbleworks did let us stay in hotel alfa we booked last minute here very nice indeed only issue is if you over you can not sit on the toilet as very small hotel is clean and tidy beds are good,1
568,ibis amsterdam centre is just beside amsterdam centraal station and the perfect place to start exploring this amazing city city sight seeing bus and canal cruise is just in front of the hotel hotel is in a walking distance to explore red light area famous dam square the hotel is in a lively place with tourist coming from centraal station every moment hotel room is very tiny however it has all the modern amenities this hotel is pretty big breakfast is served in the floor of the hotel with lots of delicious items check in and check out was pretty quick and the behaviour of the staffs are excellent truly professional and helpful staff stayed here for nights in july,1
569,me and my partner stayed here in march for nights this hotel was a perfect location for exploring the city also being right next door to the train station it was very easy to find we payed a little extra for a river view room this was well worth it as the view from the room was beautiful the room was small and compact but the perfect for a base to sleep and explore the amazing city had an problem with the booking but the staff were very helpful and prompt to email back to resolve the issue location was the biggest plus for this hotel and therefore would definitely recommend would stay here if we return to amsterdam,1
570,staying in centre of amsterdam make me and family save time of journey and expenses from here we can travel by trains trams boats buses go around city and urban or airport also walking along canal or shopping are easy ways to do hotel have arrangements of services excellent staff with the best bilingual gave fell safe and relax in the meanwhile rooms are no noisy because of its double proofing wall we stayed here one week we will come back here for sure,1
571,we stepped of a plane after hours travelling from new zealand a warm welcome greeted us whilst a clean quiet room with plnty of hot water awaited us we slept like doormice before quickly wandering into the streets of amsterdam it is a good location for sightseeing a good selection of food was available in the breakfast room which set us up for another day travelling,1
572,there are two ibis in amsterdam google maps the very helpful well meaning locals were trying to direct us to the wrong one we can laugh about it now but when you been traveling for hrs from australia hauling two suitcases around amsterdam i did see the funny side at the annoying thing is with hindsight all we had to do was to come out of amsterdam central turn right it was only meters you live hotel is fine only negative is the rooms are a bit on the small side but great view of the center we requested a high room as it is a bit noisy below due to traffic stayed there twice have no regrets ate in the restaurant every night the staff in the restaurant were some of the nicest people i have ever met i work in hospitality the food was good recommend the lasagna stay there again,1
573,not a good place to stay if ur over tall bathroom is way to small ca even dry yourself after a shower without opening the bathroom door rooms very small as well no bar fridge or aircon very disappointing,0
574,hotel is just beside amsterdam central station walking distance to st nicholas cathedral lots of restaurants and souvenir shop hotel staff at the reception and restaurant were very friendly and helpful great selection for the buffet breakfast,1
575,lovely hotel great location right by the heineken experience as well has lidl only few doors up breakfast lovely had everything u could think off rooms but small but we were there much so was ok as was exploring amsterdam city staff very friendly there and coffee and tea was available all day in hotel which was great to,1
576,i can not fault this hotel in any way this was my first ever stay at a holiday inn and it was very pleasurable i spent nights here with my brother who was invited to the rai conference which is within close proximity also not too far from the city centre all the staff were pleasant the hotel had great facilities it was modern and clean breakfast was also great with plenty of choice although a bit on the pricier side around euros i would definitely stay here again if visiting amsterdam,1
577,i was dissapointed with the service we was stay four wasnt redy for wasnt enough towel and bath producs even service was verry am never dissapointed with any hotel ike this before,0
578,i can recommend staying at this hotel fair prices good service and nice breakfast not far from city center take tram and your there pls remember to book tickets in advance online to anne frank house,1
579,my wife and i traveled from the states to amsterdam she is a platinum ihg member for our part we were very pleased with the room and the service provided we were not able to fly out the day we had expected and they made room for us when they were booked solid very close to train tram and bus this made our stay fabulous the only thing it needs is upgraded not very strong at all,1
580,room good aircon and wifi both excellent very reasonable tariff not star but all the better for relaxed and so pleasant and accomodating breakfast is very good omelette chef nice to no tram which goes every mins you can buy a ticket on the near to rai train station,1
581,we stayed at this hotel could roam entire amsterdam thru tram fair price excellent service wholesome breakfast as tram station is at walkable distance being first stop its very convenient the dinner is really excellent,1
582,our initial thoughts were that this hotel was very far away from the central amsterdam city and tourist attractions but after a big day touring we were happy to come home to the peace and tranquility of this hotel situated at the rai metro rail station mins from centraal or rai tram station odd mins from centraal it was a peaceful minute walk to this hotel it is close to the world trade centre amsterdam stadium parnassus rai corporate exhibition onvention complex about mins walk away was a street full of different restaurants serving various cuisines and a supermarket albert heijn open till there is ice machines located on each level outside the lifts the mini bar has limited space to store drinks and all drinks supplied are electronically programmed to be charged to yr room if removed from the fridge,1
583,arriving to hotel with requested early check in which hotels pretty much always provide for platinum members just to be told check in at on my polite hint that i requested early check in it still no suggesting that maybe saying will try to get you room as early as we can instead of which would be hours later did not make any impression on front office clerk upon talking to the manager all rooms booked pointing out that during this silly argument at least people checked out out of sudden a few clicks in computer and oh i think i have a room for you really first impression counts and it was a very bad impression it will be one night only affair never again holiday inn amsterdam,0
584,clean tidy fabulous service excellent help yourself breakfast easy acces to amsterdam rai train station mins schipol airport mins even closer tram stop mins serving all of amsterdam centre or mins euro all day hour travel ideal for business or stayed on the executive floor neither of us liked the strong brown and white horizontal decor in the bedroom but it was quiet and the shower was very good,1
585,stayed for nights as part of a coach tour to the hotel to be large modern and very room was of a very good size with a powerful con was not too effective and a little found all of the staff to be cheerful and most helpful at all was a little hectic but a good choice was on offer but the hot food was only tepid at meals were good but again the hot food was not hot would revisit and recommend,1
587,this was a good hotel for my business needs i was here for business in june and needed to get to the rai center for a day conference the hotel was conveniently located within waling distance to rai the train station and stops from schiphol airport even access into the city center was easy just a quick bus ride into town minutes i did have dinner one night at the restaurant and it was a long wait the service staff did seem to have a sense of urgency granted the restaurant was probably busier than expected but the wait was incredibly long even to get our drink order taken there was a server in the morning that was fantastic though she really made up for the evening debacle she was friendly efficient and was able to multitask to ensure all guests were being taken care of overall the stay was fine no frills and convenient however when i return to amsterdam for leisure i might look elsewhere,1
589,it not at all in the city centre as mentioned on all the sites had to catch the tramp and its mins in the tramp was really irritated wen they mentioned the city centre part the staff was really friendly otherwise,0
590,the best thing about this hotel is their breakfast buffet lot of variety even vegetarians have food option which is great and the hotel staff was very active in taking cold stuff out and replacing it with hot food loved it,1
591,stayed in late june for one night the room was modern clean and not cramped at all the staff is friendly and very helpful the lobby has lemon and cucumber water available at all times free of charge and a small relaxing lounge and bar as far as the location if you are going to the van gogh museum it s just down the street there are stops close as well to get to other parts of town vondle park is right across the street treat yourself and stroll through the park plud walking up trough the park is a great start of finish to walking into the main part of town my wife and i can not wait for our next trip to amsterdam and stay at hotel piet hein,1
594,nice pleasant hotel staff very warm and welcoming prices v competitive clean tidy and in a nice part of the cityhighly recommend this is nice and good selection of hotel staff very helpful will definitely stay here again,1
595,my wife and i loved our five days at this lovely hotel all of the staff seemed happy to work there and happy to help their guests the breakfast was great this location is relatively quiet which suited us well we were in easy walking distance from the major art museums and the vogelpark and there were plenty of good restaurants nearby once we caught on to how to use the trams we could get anywhere in the city with ease,1
596,myself and friends stayed at the hotel for nights on arrival the hotel looked to be very lovely clean cool water and glasses in reception for use of guests a lovely looking little bar and comfy seating staff were polite and welcoming and check in was very speedy on going to our rooms we were very disappointed with the standard as they were nowhere near the standard shown on the website i would say avoid room as it is in the basement with a very small window facing onto the street it was next to the lift shaft toilets and offices not pleasant at all and my friends did sleep at all in there the first night as it was very stuffy and very noisy staff changed their room the next day to a much nicer room still not really like the ones in the pictures but pleasant enough staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome we had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning and it was good value euros there were hot drinks juice water cereals full english pastries and more very nice having cool water available in reception at all times was a very nice touch location was perfect we purchased a day travel card which was useful but we walked so much as lots to see we would definitely stay here again but would not accept room,1
597,we stayed at hotel piet hein for nights and probably nights too long my partner surprised me with the trip to amsterdam for my birthday and i was really looking forward to it on the day as i had not known up until the night before when we arrived to the hotel i was happy with the lobby area as it was quite modern and nice the man on the desk gave us poor directions to our room he was very clear on exactly which way we must go when we get to the stairs once we found our room we was a little shocked at actually how small it was we knew it would be a snug double but it was very snug there was barely any room for our luggage and we struggled to get down the sides of the bed also the room was quite dated not all of it but the carpet was horrid it looked like they updated the rest of the hotel and then got the carpet out of the loft once i opened the door to the bathroom a wall of sewage stench hit our noses and we rushed to open the window in the bedroom where i found bird poo on the inside of the window and someone used plaster on the floor next to my side of the bed also in the bathroom the towel rack was above the toilet so over the course of our stay the towels kept falling,0
598,stayed in this hotel for days with my boyfriend in mid june the hotel was gorgeous very clean and had comfortable beds location was good there was a bus stop less than mins from the hotel that went straight from the hotel to the airport the hotel was massively central but the walk into the city centre was lovely on top of the hotel being excellent the staff could do enough for myself and my boyfriend during our stay they gave great suggestions for activities restaurants and sights to see within would highly recommend to this hotel for a short stay in amsterdam,1
599,small and basic rooms but we were out all day so all we needed was sleep and a shower between of us it was pretty tight staff were lovely and the hotel is in a great location close to the park and walking distance to many attractions we had a good night stay to start off our europe holiday,1
600,stayed here for five nights on vacation with a friend the room was simple without frills but was clean and comfortable the staff was very helpful with assisting in directions and advice there was always delicious cold lemon and mint water in the lobby which we enjoyed on every trip into the hotel after days out touring the town the location is awesome across from the vondelpark makes it easy to find with a beautiful park to enjoy a five minute or less walk from the major art museums makes the location ideal close to the sights but far enough away to be out of the extreme touristy zones the hotel is also close to several tram and bus lines including a bus for direct to the airport there are several places to eat and drink very walkable as well we did have breakfast included with our room rate and did take advantage because we did want to spend on breakfast but when i inquired i saw they were making eggs to order and had a variety of offerings,1
601,we booked via booking dot com and so this hotel was an unknown both in terms of its location and the quality of the it is in a superb location if you are visiting the museums not only that its very handy for the hop on hop off bus and blue line of their river boats it is also very close to the airport bus service it is next to the vondelpark catch the tour bus and the bus at the entrance of vondel park on stadhouderskade stop almost opposite the hard rock cafel to get to this bus stop you walk out of the hotel turn left and walk down the street or through the park tip buy a really good street map of amsterdam before you come as most of the free tourist maps are not good hotel is smart and modern and a great bar wifi was excellent room was a budget room and so was small but adequate we did not know that when booking suggest you make sure you get a better room if you are here for more that a day or so in our room you could not walk around the double bed however air con worked well and was quiet bathroom small apart from a floppy shower head all other services worked fine the bed was very comfortable lots of english speaking tv channels delightful staff are delightful nothing was too much trouble it was worth staying here just for that,1
602,i stayed at the hotel piet hein for a week in june the hotel is right next to vondelpark where you can take a walk or go for a run grab a bite to eat and enjoy at your leisure you will be at a comfortable walking distance from the museumplein and from the shopping area on leidestraat and the hoofstraat the tram lines are nearby and the front desk will help you with getting rooms as mentioned in other reviews are very small but and comfortable most are but some are not which does matter in the summer months the staff is friendly and very helpful directing me to several excellent restaurants they also warned me against using the hotel laundry and gave me several options to get some jeans washed before i moved on there is an excellent breakfast with all the standards including eggs beer and mixed drinks are available at the bar there is also a quiet shady outdoor seating area for would definitely recommend the hotel piet hein as a home base while visiting amsterdam,1
603,i booked to stay at hotel piet hein for two nights for my boyfriends birthday whilst the hotel lobby area was beautiful every other aspect of our stay was a let ordered for a bottle of prosecco to arrive in our room at a surprise for my partner which they discussed when we checked in at surprise ruined the staff were also careless failed to deliver on information on tourist activities as they emailed me saying they would declined to help when our room stank of sewage for some unknown reason and were horrendously rude upon check not pedantic travellers we did care that our room was small dated that we did have any kind of view nor did we care that the hotel is sound proof at all or that the cleaner came into our room at whilst we were getting dressed we just felt we could have picked a much better hotel for the price we a positive the location is perfect although as other reviews state you there are lots of hotels in the area so they would be my first choice next time,0
604,stayed nights location was good easy access to the centre by tram hotel lobby very inviting despite the mouse running around did complain but staff not that bothered room though clean was tired and dated shabby curtains no tea and coffee facilities pillow was lumpy and small and hotel would provide extra ones bed uncomfortable and soft would stay again even for one night,0
605,my wife and i stayed at the hotel for the weekend the location is great and is very quiet being next to vondel park its easy to get on the right tram the hotel is quite modern and well maintained the continental breakfast was good the beds in our room were brilliant we slept really well there is a safe in the room which is easy to use we stayed in room which overlooks the park,1
606,i loved the location and the cleanliness but our room was tired and very small and dark and the double bed was sagging completely at the only side not against a wall the toilet was very dark on a plus most of the staff were very friendly and helpful bar maybe one who could only be described as quite rude,1
608,we are not picky traveller by any means but we were very disappointed by our stay at hotel piet hein this was our last hotel stay after three weeks of traveling through germany czech republic and the netherlands and it was not what was advertised on their website our positives are that the hotel offered free water in the lobby and that they successfully scheduled a taxi for our early morning trip to the air conditioner was broken during the entire duration of our stay even though multiple staff members told us it would be fixed when we inquired about it on different days we were told that the hotel had been struck by lightning and that someone was coming to fix the ac but this never happened during our five day stay after reading recent reviews on tripadvisor it is clear that this is just a standard lie that they tell hotel guests upon arrival the ventilation in the room was horrible especially on the two warm days we had during our stay even with the window wide open we slept with the window open each night and the security arm on the window was broken which allowed the window to swing completely open due to this we could hear late night conversations in the garden area while we were trying to sleep and cigarette and marijuana smoke would blow into our room when it rained it allowed water to come onto the windowsill on the side of our,0
609,we stayed here on our first night of our contiki trip i was very happy to see such a nice room and i was sleeping like a baby and i wanted to stay in the bed longer but we had to get up rather early we had breakfast and dinner the night before here and both meals were great i would definitely come back here again if i got the chance,1
610,we have enjoyed the rooms were a a little smaller but enogh for our one night was possible to park our car near hotel for free the route to city centre via tram took about minutes without a need to chnge lines of the tram,1
611,situated in the middle of nowhere it kind of like the place airlines put you when your flight is delayed if you are looking for a cute coffee shop or shop then best stay somewhere else if you happy to get straight on the tram and commute to amsterdam city first thing in the morning then fine no disrespect to the staff but i was a bit disappointed because the hotel had a lot of stars and i did understand why,0
612,stayed here twice in good size rooms equipped with all of the essentials good value for money friendly staff located in a nice neighbourhood closely located to public transport for easy access into amsterdam central,1
613,i was attending breakfast already had my food on my plate when a hotel memeber came up to me and told me i had to leave as i was not in the correct footwear i thought this was completely ridiculous as i was never informed there was a dress code and no signs where displayed to enforce this but rules are rules and made my way back to the room to change my shoes upon my arrival back at breakfast i noticed there was a lot of middle aged and up guests wearing flip flops also i then approached the same staff member to inform him that i had changed my foorwear but if he was going to make me change mine it should be enforced for all guests this staff member then started to abuse me at the top of his lunges in front of the whole restaurant saying its not only his job to check that everyone is wearing the correct footing and that i need to behave i responded to him simply stating that i felt personally attacked and victimised i then became so embarrassed and upset i had to leave breakfast in tears without eating my meal i pay for my stay like every other guest and i can not believe i was treated in such a way i really regret not getting this abusive mans name,0
614,we came for nights to visit amsterdam attractions and the concert breakfast was good and varied as well as staff friendly and helpful close to tram stop which makes it easy to move to the center also nearby are good affordable restaurants we be back at this hotel again,1
615,this is a nice hotel some may say small room but not for amsterdam the location is great for museums van gogh and rijks and is right beside vondel park the tram travels right in from of the hotel parking is available on the street for the city fee this is a very safe and upscale neighborhood,1
616,set on koninginneweg in amsterdam this hotel is on the tram line making it easy to travel around the city it very clean the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were very friendly polite and helpful my only complaint is not having a luggage rack in the room i was faced with either putting my suitcase on the floor on the desk or on the bed otherwise it exceeded my needs and was a very good hotel solution for the one night i was in amsterdam on this trip,1
617,first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,0
619,i can not fault this hotel the staff were friendly and helpful and my room was immaculate the only down side was it was a bit of a hike to get into the centre of amsterdam i should say it was a bit of a hike to get back to the hotel as we had late nights and the trams stop operating at around midnight,1
620,good location for a city trip to groningen close to and not in the centre further a good starting point for a bike and staff very helpful in providing information making arrangements and assisting in parking our are relativeley small but ok and with a perfect view on the city breakfast is very good and further is coffee and tea the whole day avaliable for free,1
621,the hotel does not look like much from the outside and also the lobby feels quite bland however the rooms were comfy even if not huge and the bed a dream i love them cozy the modern modular transparent bath room worked well for us though a bit small great breakfast buffet loved the fresh berries that is constantly refilled very curteous service throughout even though it is a hotel we initially were given a former smoking room that smelled terrible but were traded into a propoer room no problem good location off rembrandt square get a room to the rear which have no view but are very quiet,1
623,i was disappointed of the hotel exept of the breakfast which was junior suite we book looked and smelled like it has not been used and cleaned for months quite dirty overall waterstains on the toilet and surfaces dusty cabin and very bad sink smell from the bathroom which did not go away for three days the drain plug was on the bathtub shelf and looked like it smelled in the whole room no possibility to open windows only interior looks like nothing has been updated since which would be okay if clean but not for the price the old flat tv had a problem on the pictures everything really looks i wanted to give three points rating here but i stayed in many many stars hotels and this is definetly not the average of them the location is great yes but thats not what should be rated here there are tons of hotels in the center mentioned the breakfast was surprisingly very good fresh fruits different breads and rolls cereal and so on nowadays it would be suitable to add and soy alternatives but overall it was very service is friendly and nice but it all does not make up for the room where you do not feel comfortable in like not wanting to take your shoes off and not feeling good using the dirty bathroom where you actually want to get clean where you as a paying guest need to buy hygiene wipes to clean the toilet before,0
625,the room was a good size and the bed very comfy the location was fabulous i found the room we had on the street side extremely noisy from the party goers on the street below staff were friendly and the bar was a lovely place to have an evening drink the only downside for me was the noise i would go back to this hotel but would request a room on the quiet side,1
626,been all over the world and this is a beautiful hotel to make your base whilst in amsterdam great rooms very helpful staff amazing ambience near to all the canals min walk from the attractions and rembrandt square is walk away where all the bars and restaurants are enjoyed so much we are going back asap,1
627,we arrived at around and the taxi driver left us at the backdoor where no one was there to open for about we did not know how to reach the main entrance so inevitably waited until someone who had a card to enter opend for us as well the hotel is overstaffed but with very young chiildren wise students that do not know how to behave or to help you in hotelia way the room was not clean at all we have torn sheets and the table wnear the bed telephone was full of dust my wife said not to complain because we would be speaking with students so like speaking to deaf people so i did not location perfect near to everything even by foot rent a bike from the turkish under the hotel green bikes to ride around the beautiful a train for a trip to hague den haag what a great experiece this was in all the hotel is good only for the location,0
628,the rooms are really small but the hotel is on really good location you are in city center and you can walk form hotel to city center which is really nice the breakfast was ok but it is everything very small in this hotel so when you eat breakfast you sit less than away from other guest,1
629,the hotel met our needs it located close to the dam square the red light district and the central breakfast was very reception staff was took a room in the fifth floor it was basic room and very small but it did bother us because we spent all our time outside but if you plan to stay more time in the hotel room you should ask for bigger room,1
631,what i expected no nasty surprises and good price as compared to other stays in amsterdam was disappointed that we could not upgrade to the letter rooms especially when myself and my husband went up on the deck to look at them and they were not occupied would have been a nice experience also there should be more than one member of staff at reception when you arrive at a hotel after a long plane train and boat journey the last thing you want is to stand in a queue for minutes to check in all in all a pleasant stay if you plan to just have somewhere to lay your head down which for us was perfect,1
633,unique hotel as its a boat but thats were the excitement stops we given a twin room rather than a double room that was requested but did mind as the room were so hot that sleeping separately was an advantage you have to request a fan for a refundable that is not powerful enough but helps to make the room bearable in the heat luckily when we went it was degrees c and not any hotter the rooms are extremely basic no modern amenities at all the tv is small with poor reception the bathroom is what you expect from a boat the shower provides good hot water but is not a traditional shower head and you have to adapt its more of a tap up high reception stuff need customer service training as they are not friendly lack empathy and have a general poor maids were good smiled and cleaned to a good standard wifi was good and had fast speeds the catering staff were always smiling and quick to assist the breakfast was good except they need to replace the toasters took to get slightly brown bread getting to the hotel via the fery shuttle is a highlight and unique experience,0
634,a very nice hotel located right in the middle of the canal district we got a room on the floor overlooking rembrandtplein and the surrounding area nice and clean rooms with comfortable beds the hotel staff was very polite and helpful,1
636,stayed for business in june the pros the location the location is phenomenal it in a square with restaurants and coffee shops and a starbucks public transit is easily accessible and we could walk to dinner or drinks with more than enough selections it was about a eur cab ride from also list the as a pro because it was a nice place to relax and work while we were waiting to to our rooms final pro was the staff that was very friendly and accommodating the cons no climate control when i was there this was okay because it was cool enough outside that you could open the window they do leave a fan in the closet if you need additional cooling cleanliness not good when i got into my room after there was a giant wet spot on the floor next to the bed i do not know what that was but it was it wasnt bad but it wasnt good i got it included with my room in a promo deal however i would not pay additional for this breakfast there is a starbucks btw the coolest starbucks interior i ever seen literally yards when you walk to the right out of the hotel you would get a better value going to that starbucks than doing the hotel breakfast value you are paying for the location with other hotels in the same square i would research those hotels for a better in all the hotel was just,0
637,my boyfriend and i came to stay for nights on a sightseeing trip our first time in amsterdam nh schiller is a beautiful hotel located in the centre of rembrandt square a bustling area full of hotels restaurants bars and coffee shops rembrandt square is only a ten minute walk from dam square and the damrak and minutes from central station so ideally situated for the sightseeing we were doing it also close to the beautiful herengracht area and to rembrandt house museum the hotel reception area was stunning and the too though we did actually use it we were on the floor and front facing the room was clean and large enough for our requirements my only minor complaint would be that the room got very warm at night it was hot weather and as it is an old building there is no air conditioning with the room being front facing of course with the windows opened it was very noisy at night due to the nightlife there is a fan in the room however so we left the fan on all night and also during the evening when we were out for dinner so that the room had a chance to cool in advance the reception staff were very pleasant and helpful and printed out tickets for us for a tour for which we required a paper copy we were also able to leave our luggage at reception after checking out for the few hours prior to our,1
638,hotel was terrible the staff very rude and not attentive at all shoes were stolen out of our hotel room and the hotel did not do anything furthermore hotel staff entered our room and opened all our luggages and inspected them for some reasons when complaining about these not acceptable incidents they seemed not to care and we did not get a clear answer to what happened or anything besides all that they also gave us a hotel room where puke was in front of our bed and the smell in the room was horrible not recommendable property,0
640,this ibis is all about location location located very close to central station and the tram hub contemporary feel with a very helpful staff decent breakfast included room configuration varies from room to room our room was larger than the first room assigned but the staff were very accommodating in switching room our room had two steps up to the sleeping area and one step down into the bathroom which had an open shower and a very narrow potty space could be a problem for large and plus size people luggage could be stored in a secure area negative no tissues or washcloths complimentary cold water and coffee in the lobby elevator recommend and would stay again hope this helps,1
642,a very nice and cozy hotel situated one tram ride away from city center situated right in the middle of the west shopping center which means close access to budget shopping decent restaurants albertine xl and a nice open area with fountain for some kid s fun there is a lake a few minutes walk away the staff is very friendly reception is open hours and you feel very welcome they run a nice small café in the ground floor since the reception is open hours you get access to stuff in this café rooms are named after cities of the world with a full wall view of that city in the hotel is entirely in first floor with lift from reception at one end of the hotel from there it is basically a loooong corridor with rooms on both sides if your room is at the other end you would have walked half way back to amsterdam by the time you reach your room rooms are extremely small actually our room was as wide as the cot or ft when you enter the room you have toilet on one side with a ground glass partition there is no way to lock the toilet door there is a shower room also in there after the toilet you have a nice washbasin behind the shower room the bed is next and as i said it takes of the room space the bed is extra comfy my room had a full width,1
643,what an absolutley brilliant hotel i stayed in this nights from the to july was a simple trip from right outside the airport to the hotel by bus buses do not accept cash so buy a travel card i had to pay on card but when i got to the hotel there was a tobacco shop that sold day travel tickets for euros the hotel is in a lovley little town called osdorplein it a good minute tram ride from dam centre but i much preferred being away as the town was lovley your right in the middle of a shopping centre lake and transport links to one side and shops everywhere you look the hotel has water fountains outside which everyone seems to go in what a friendly bunch of people too there loads of places to eat near the hotel and a supermarket called hema which is extremely cheap and sells brilliant things the hotel it sell is modern and clean we arrived early and they got the room ready for us and let us check in which was nice of them we had a room for people which was big beds are super comfy the maids are always about cleaning rooms and restocking supplies breakfast was included in our room which was continental style and really yummy i plan to come back here every year it truly is one of the best breaks i ever had everyday i was there i went to amsterdam centre it a,1
644,citiez hotel amsterdam great choice with best price awesome staff and beautiful modern concept design my wife and i love traveling and exploring new destinations our next stop was amsterdam choosing the best accommodation type cleanliness price range location etc is very important for us while planning a vacation with the right searching for quite some time we definitely picked the best hotel in town by far citiez hotel hotel is located about minutes away from downtown in a shopping center we could find anything we need in the shopping center which was perfect for us in case of transportation we purchased public transportation days pass tickets includes all tram and buses from amsterdam central station for each person which was very helpful there is a lot to see around like beautiful beaches and beautiful little villages have stayed nights between june with my wife and we absolutely enjoyed our stay to the fullest the hotel itself and the rooms were extremely nice and clean smoke free with free wifi the breakfast buffet was amazing per person as far as the hotel rooms are concerned there are different types of rooms fits different budgets over all we loved the hotel the atmosphere the staff and the location special thanks to jean paul femke the creators and the owners of this beautiful hotel a lot of hard work and such a great job you have done so far with your amazing team your team makes the difference especially cennet front desk,1
645,i arrived in amz after driving for days from spain with my cat in the car originally booked into another hotel only to arrive and be told that they are not pet friendly booked into the ibis round the corner and they were fabulous from the offset they could do enough to help me and they could see how tired and stressed i was from driving with the cat in the car i was there for nights and they really were so helpful and friendly i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone i ca thank them enough,1
646,as always ibis is quite alright rooms are basic but suits everything you need after a long day of amsterdam clean rooms good airco free safe nice shower cabin and comfortable beds nice view from floor location is perfect bus stop in front of hotel line brings you in minutes to amsterdam central train station sloterdijk is a ten minute walk from there you can take train to amsterdam central station in minutes or you take a walk through the park in front of the hotel westerpark to the bus stop on the other side of the park luxury service of the hotel is the free use in weekends of the parking garage free parking space is quite unique in amsterdam,1
647,rooms are modern spotlessly clean and bed was very comfy breakfast selection is adequate with a cooked selection yoghurts bread and jams etc staff are really friendly there is a mini shop with crisps sweets juices nuts sandwiches smoothies plus vending machines with toiletries and some guests must be blind to have missed this as a recent review stated no ability to get snacks the hotel offers snacks at the bar also and this ibis bar had great ambience which is quite unusual in this style of hotel overall excellent,1
648,great hotel centrally located most tourists sites within minutes walk good access to transport for anything further afield brilliant staff ca do enough for you and a good breakfast not expensive for location,1
649,stayed here some years ago so it was the obvious choice for our recent visit found things were better than ever with a lovely quiet room to give us a good night sleep and a fantastic buffet breakfast to feed the inner person,1
651,just returned from a two night stay at the rho hotel the location is excellent just off dam square and easy to get to from the central station you can walk to all the attractions from here and it close to the many restaurants amsterdam has to offer the staff were very helpful and breakfast was good too room was clean and quiet would definitely go back,1
652,very good location in the center of amsterdam just a few minutes walk from the central train station good quality for a our room was quite spacious the personnel was very courteous and the buffet breakfast was very rich,1
653,we stayed in a triple room in late july the hotel is virtually on dam square and you can walk to most places we walked pulling luggage from central station in minutes entrance lobby is large and a bit dramatic we were at side of hotel and had very little street noise room was a good size fan provided not quite powerful enough for the room bathroom nice with range of toiletries reasonable breakfast with a few hot choices such as bacon and scrambled and boiled eggs plus the usual cold meats cheeses cereals etc so good choice although fairly expensive internet searches kept saying that amsterdam was virtually full for our travel dates at euros a night booked directly on hotel website safe and fridge in room too,1
654,look up when you get near dam square the hotel name is up on the walk from central station location is everything to was first you want a good place to sleep and a great breakfast look no further,1
655,i have stayed at this hotel times now over the space of years it location is amazing it the cheapest hotel on dam square the staff are helpful and polite although when you call to reception they do take a while to deal with requests the staff always keep a record of you so they appreciate repeat custom and it goes a long way to be greeted as a returning customer something you do expect them to do they store your luggage and let you check in earlier than advertised when they can it always clean basic but above satisfactory cleanliness,1
656,nice friendly welcome on arrival walked through nice air conditioned corridors to get to our room but on opening the door the room itself was boiling this meant we had to sleep with the fan provided on and the windows open which was idea small room and as it was in the roof sloped on one side which was a bit awkward not a lot of storage space good vending machine including cans of heineken lovely breakfast good location just off dam square so easy to get to from the station would have been improved by having air con in the actual rooms,1
658,hi everyone i would not recommend this hotel to anyone very sub standard to what i used to in ireland and all over room is clean but basic reception and food here is disaster the only thing good is the location do know how they got stars and how it has rating in would return and only because i had it paid for in advance i would leave and was cheap either,0
660,location and reaching there the hotel is situated opposite the artis zoo and near the amsterdam business school there are tram stops near the hotel but i used the connexxion airport shuttle takes around minutes and euros for return trip hotel it is essentially an old building it would have been interesting to have an insight into its for the hampshire manor is a converted hospital accessibility the hotel does have two elevators but none for reaching the reception desk from the street there are several steps and as a small individual i do tend to struggle with cases my room was on the same level as the reception but i had to negotiate another flight of steps room comfortable and exactly as in the photos i am not necessarily a fan of dark decor but it better than the manor red theme it overlooked a construction site which also meant that i had to leave the blinds closed when i was in the room the bed was twin not double but it was comfy you do tend to hear especially people talking on the corridor and noises from other bathrooms i could hear someone using an electric razor in the room tea and coffee facilities an electric fan heater under the window and a safe do note that the instructions in it may be different from those in the us there is free wifi but it is not particularly strong enough for example to make calls via whatsapp the,1
662,four of us two rooms were welcomed by a delightful receptionist who warmly greeted us then sorted out our tours she was wonderful but that is where it ended there is no air conditioning the rooms were incredibly hot it was not mentioned each room has a portable unit that has a long hose pumping out very hot air through the door but of course you have to leave your day open to use it the first night we went to the garden for a drink there was four staff who all looked at us but no one came over eventually we left went to a lovely pub for a drink for a third of the price it is a very expensive hotel for one in such disrepair i would not recommend this hotel to anyone this is my first ever negative review,0
663,we just spend days at the college hotel in amsterdam and were shocked by the poor quality of the were not notified at check in that all aircos on the first floor have been broken since june and as per the repair crew wont be fixed for at least another weeks end july in the middle of the hot summer no management is present in this education hotel and thus all staff is left on their own no suitable solution was available and we left in a mess many small details were broken we stayed in a junior suite like light buttons missing power plugs broken stays with kids in the summer this hotel is totally unsuitable due to the state of the rooms,0
665,this place is far enough from the airport that you are not annoyed by airplane noises all night long and in an area with walking and biking paths the food is much better than typical hotel restaurant faire and the price is right,1
666,with the days transit pass and hotel transfer to the airport we could travel to and from the attractions easily the hotel grounds was park like it had nice paths and even a duck pond there was also a large lake side park across the road,1
668,whilst the hotel facilities were acceptable standard in general on the day of checking out we discovered unauthorised charges on our card amounting to despite assurances from the reception staff that money would be refunded the same day days later we are still waiting for a refund even though we also spoke to accor who also assured us of a supposed free shuttle was refused from the airport as apparently fully booked and had to pay euros to get to the hotel which is in a middle of nowhere next to a petrol station you have to cross a busy main road to get to the hotel with no pedestrian crossing beware if travelling at night and via public transport,0
669,great venue near centre messed our reservation up by cancelling and only informed us the day before hotel sorted everything for us staff excellent and room clean and time we stayed here and always very good,1
670,this hotel is a great option for a short stay in amsterdam we were there nights and were impressed by price hotel staff and easy acres to central amsterdam either by short walk to tram or complimentary airport shuttle for schiopol train very clean and well priced,1
671,all very good nice breakfast in the morning a little pricey but good selection and quality food quiet great staff who want to serve and ensure my satisfaction love the ease getting to and from the airport and close to tram line for trips into amsterdam,1
672,the hotel has excellent facilities and links to the airport to make it the ideal place for those on a layover flight or short stay some of the features are a little via the website but this can be overlooked when considering the great staff and cleanliness of the rooms i would not recommend this hotel for families or couples who are looking to see amsterdam city pay the extra price for somewhere in the city centre,1
673,my sister and i just got back home from days in amsterdam and we could have been happier with our stay at he the hotel staff were really helpful and friendly the rooms have really comfortable beds good bathrooms and air con and the hotel is in a superb location near the center with three supermarkets in walking distance,1
674,we spent a couple of days at this lovely hotel in a beautiful area of amsterdam the area is just outside the busiest part the centre of amsterdam which is full of wonderful restaurants and bars it only a few minutes walk from the main areas and was very quiet during the night which was great for being so close to all the nightlife staff were very pleasant and friendly,1
675,this is a great hotel for both business and holiday makers though they claim that this is an airport hotel it is not really close to the airport and the shuttle service can take up to minutes each way to and from the airport the airport is well connected to the city center by train and the train ride into the city center is only mins so all in all it is possible to get to the center of the city from the hotel within rooms are very comfortable with all amenities that you will expect from a good hotel the gym is small but well equipped and while i was there there were hardly any gym users so it is was quiet and comfortable this hotel does not have a swimming pool and this was a downside for in the hotel are again a bit small but the food is reasonable priced and quite tasty so if you decide the stay in eating at the restaurant is a good highlight for me were the surroundings of this hotel which make for great walks each morning and evening be sure to swing left and you can reach the dyke in less than mins making for a great walk along the dyke with lots of birds in the water there is good restaurant bij quins which is housed in a old pumping station along the dyke the food is great but you will need to reserve seating for are no shops,1
676,we stayed for nights and really enjoyed the stay the location was great minutes walk from leightsplain and vondel service was very friendly and breakfast was very good and there is free coffee in the lobby at all times the rooms are a bit small but clean and come again,1
677,the hotel is excellent and the stuff is really good and patient they helped us with all our needs and gave us a great room we especially would like to mention teije from the breakfast room whom kindly helped us to plan a fun trip with his excellent recommendations thank you for a great time in amsterdam,1
678,me and my girlfriend have stayed for the weekend at caransa hotel have great location walking distance to every main square and a tram station right outside of the stuff was super nice everyone from reception to to room service guys especially teije and shirin who helped us in everything little thing that we warmly to stay here,1
679,clean modern and tidy hotel in a good location with bars next door if you wanted to eat and drink a good sized double room only a min walk from the must see red light district when i was there the main lift was out of order so had to use the service lift which did bother me friendly staff,1
680,we came to amsterdam to explore the city and enjoy an authentic experience and that we did the hotel was within walking distance to all the sites we wanted to see and the room was spacious with modern decor and a lovely large bathroom staff were always on hand to help with anything we needed and the cleaners were amazing ensuring it was spotless everyday,1
681,the nh caransa is a very centrally located hotel with excellent transport links to get pretty much anywhere in amsterdam the rooms were a good size and very clean being on rembrandtplein there are a large selection of bars and restaurants very close by a short walk when exploring the city would definitely stay again,1
682,teije was very helpful at breakfastthe staff and facilities were in general very good the location of the hotel is unbeatable and is in the middle of the busy rembrandt square the staff was more than helpful in every way,1
683,a glance at the map will tell you that this hotel is in an excellent location right by the main transport hub of amsterdam the railway theme is different and interesting without being some kind of railway theme park the service is excellent and friendly my room was clean and comfortable the only thing that spoilt it a little was the window being very high up but this is an old amsterdam building so it was a surprise the breakfast was very good check in and out was quick and shall certainly stay again,1
684,what a little gem right across from central station central for everything lots of bars and restaurants nearby hotel itself was lovely we had the dutch suite which is located on the ground floor and has its own little courtyard with a couple of chairs and a table there is no air conditioning but a very good fan which we made good use of there kettle tea coffee etc and a fridge staff were great and very helpful if needed breakfast was ok boiled eggs cereal bread cold meat and cheese also a toaster jams honey etc all in all a very enjoyable stay will definitely return,1
685,lovely rooms unusal as the shower is glass and in the middle of the room lovely bar with good selection of gins food very good too shuttle bus to station or minute walk from there you can get into the centre taxi is about each way to town for the shuttle to the airport,1
686,really did not enjoy my stay at this hotel the first hiccup was seeing leave my account days before our even though i was still inside my cancellation terms and could cancel up to before i had no communication from the hotel about the charge and so rang them up to confirm what this was placed on hold for minutes i had to ring up another times the hotel then confirmed with me that this was a authorisation charge and no money would leave my account no problem i put this experience down to me just missing something in the small print and the hotel being busy that day our experience was really really poor not told anything about the hotel about the shuttle service when check out was how to use the phone if we wanted breakfast did not acknowledge our anniversary i emailed ahead about nothing about the city and how to get there literally no information was given to us she handed us our key and said here you go i wonder if it was her first day on the job no personality at all the location of this hotel is not great it in the middle of nowhere and i had massively underestimated how expensive uber is out here it cost us about to get into the city with uber each way each time it soon became very expensive we did not use the shuttle as we expected it would take a long time that and,0
687,a pretty good hotel with kind prices are pretty reasonable and the room is beautiful and well breakfast is various and highly recommended weather the trip was for leisure or only disadvantage is that the hotel is about half an hour from the center,1
689,i booked a double room with a sofa bed to accomodate my family of three persons when i checked in i was told i have to make up the sofa bed myself because they were having a busy day as their reservation system was down they assured me an extra set of towels were placed in the closet when i went to my room i made up the bed as told but i found no quilt and no extra set of towels i called the reception and was shortly given a very hard tired looking blue blanket they said the blanket was a standard for the sofa bed i insisted to have a proper quilt and got it five minutes later and of course i needed to ask for towels this was the service i received from this four star room s carpet was tired the wall mounted light was flashing there was a bad smell when first entering the room these were the facilities provided by this four star hotel by the way wifi is only free for,0
690,the hotel though a bit far from teh city centre is very well connected by tram which starts from very near to the hotel its a min walk and the staff is very helpful to guide you for the you have less luggage then getting to and fro from teh airport is also cheap and just a direct train with rooms are small as per novotel standards and bit staff was very helpful and gave us one room to freshen up as we reached pretty early in teh morning this was of great help as we could go out sight seeing else we would have been waiting till pm after a hour pretty nice stay,1
691,convenient hotel for access to the rai a nice stroll to the expo centre or the train hotel has a business hotel vibe to it clean professional not too fussy the room was small by international standards what you would typically find in london clean and comfortable bedroom and bathroom with all the usual amenities including an iron and ironing board the lobby area was large which was useful as i arrived with a crowd of other people i never managed to eat at the restaurant but it looked nice with modern décor and a large selection on the menu,1
692,we recently stayed at the novotel amsterdam city the carpet in both our rooms were threadbare and badly stained we had to climb into the bathtub to use the shower and when you have year old parents with you this can be both very difficult and very dangerous there is no fresh milk in the rooms only whitener there are no coffee mugs in the room only paper cups you receive only one bottle of water for two people the most disappointing part was we were charged per night per room as a safety deposit when there is no mini bar or snacks in the room to purchase in the first place we have stayed in other novotel motels around the globe and we have never encountered these issues we will definitely not recommend this hotel,0
693,stayed here at the start of july when we arrived after we payed and asked for a receipt but we were told we would recieve the receipt as we checked out at the end of the week we were then told our room was ready and we could check in until when it states on the website that we should be able to check in from onwards when we checked out they tried to charge us again and we had to show that they had taken the money on our banking app otherwise the stay was pleasant and the hotel is in a good location,0
694,dried toothpaste in the sink previous occupant or cleaners hair by the sink a dirty bath not acceptable worn out carpet and peeling paint is fine but you have got to keep it clean v disappointing breakfast was good and staff at reception friendly but sadly that does make up for basics,0
695,when i got to the hotel i was amazed by the beautiful modern and clean smell of the lobby that image was destroyed when i got into the room the carpet was filthy full of stains and the humidity smell was awful the ac did work which made the humidity worst i was changed twice to different rooms but the problems were the same at midnight one of the front desk guys came and advised me they did have any ac i finally quit and tried to enjoy the stay peter from the front desk was very helpful and nice to even gave us good recommendations to enjoy the city which we loved despite the hotel rooms breakfast is varied and good restaurant food is delicious expensive though,0
696,novotel is very close to tram station which is minutes away from city center offered very good service and a big and good variety at breakfast and the staff are very friendly and helpful recommend this hotel for tourists who would like to visit this lovely city of amesterdam and enjoy its beautiful nature and weather and art,1
697,has all the amenities in the room including english language tv not much happening in the area but easy transport to the centre via tram metro or train the lifts were a bit flaky friendly helpful staff,1
698,lovely hotel but did get the low floor room i requested and when checking in they could do it for ages and then they forgot about us food and drink is expensive for drinks breakfast is really good but i go back to my treatment as this was really bad on checkout i was given the managers business card so i emailed him once back home no reply a week later,0
699,i stayed with a friend for two nights at i had to leave a deposit on my credit card and was promised this would be returned upon checkout this has happened and the security deposit is still showing on my account some seven days later i have tried calling the hotel without success and to be honest i should be having to call them at my expense in the first place the other issue was the cleanliness was poor the carpet was dirty as was the bathroom the last issue was the fact on our last day one of the clean towels left in the bathroom had a brown this hotel is not recommended unless there is nowhere else to stay,0
700,we stayed nights very helpfull staff amacing breakfast with so many options the hotel is right be the tram so it is easy to get to the city center we will defenetly come back also for the breakfast,1
701,efficient check in staff at reception extremely helpful and obliging beautiful rooms being clean spacious and with all working amenities breakfast extensive tram to city metres from hotel with easy minute ride to city centre would recommend this hotel,1
702,stayed here for nights and it was rail station in easy reach and always taxis on hand staff were generally pleasant and helpful my only real issue is that i was there for work and my room did not have a desk to work at i was told this was true of all the rooms so i had to balance my lap top on my lap to work not good,1
703,wonderful breakfast amazing staff very helpful with recomending restaurants and placec to visit the only downside is that the rooms was a little small when staying persons in one room the hotel was close to the tram and metero station taking you directly to central station in centrum,1
704,i stayed at this hotel before but last time it did stick out and i hardly remember my stay this time however it truly amazed me the rooms are very comfortable with soft carpets enough electricity outlets a large safe which will fit your laptop and a giant giant flat screen tv what surprised me however was their call for reusing the towels and promising to plant a tree for every towels reused also if you put a notice on your door that your room does need to be cleaned you receive a bar voucher of euro i would say for dinner there are plenty of nice places in a km range so if the weather is good and you fancy a walk go in the direction of scheldestraat breakfast blew my socks off i felt like i was in a all inclusive there an omelet service a incredible wide choice of meats and cheeses yoghurts and cereals the omelet was better than i ever had with exactly the right amount of cheese and salt the jam is served in eatable cups orange juice is freshly pressed and very important to me coffee cups are real mugs so that you can get a decent cup in one go the restaurant is devised in compartments and therefore does not feel as big as it is and a plus staff is friendly great job novotel i be back,1
705,stayed in renovated room as booked in this hotel for was cleaned every day but bottle water was not replaced they sold it at lobby for was in the middle between airport and town where either metro tram train will take you there,1
706,beware of this hotel they have at least one thief at the main desk and they re lying to cover it up do pay in cash or if you do be sure to get a written receipt at june we gave a cash hold deposit that they demanded the gal at on june refused to give us our cash refund said it would be credited to our visa card that did happen it now over weeks later now they deny we ever gave them a deposit in essence they claiming they let us stay without a temporary hold deposit of euros obviously one or both of the clerks pocketed our should have used our visa card instead of cash we should have demanded a receipt actually maybe we should have never stayed at nh amsterdam so do trust nh amsterdam we certainly never stay there again,0
707,the location is perfect breakfast buffet is very hotel could do with some was not working in the room very unresponsive my view this hotel is overpriced and should pay more attention to their guests,0
708,well located hotel close to the museums area and numerous restaurants bars and shops are just a short walk away friendly helpful staff and the rooms were comfortable and clean you probably need to take some form of transport to get there if arriving by train but the tram stops are nearby,1
711,good location close to several museums but far from the train station friendly staff big rooms but not used to the best a bit of moisture in the bathroom so the tiles were not spotless clean excellent breakfast good room service,1
712,it my first trip to amsterdam and i have my family with me too first of all the room was very small for family but thank god i had the chance to upgrade to a bigger location and hotel entrance are style is very thanks for everybody help me and specially stefan mod how where so helpful and so you need any help stefan will help you with his big abbas,1
713,great hotel perfect location had disappointing experience with bar staff wanting to leave early and rushing our meals and not making what we ordered after a long day of travelling and work this was definitely not needed simon introduced himself the following evening and a chance to redeem themselves with food and drinks and a surprise bottle of wine in my room simon was a great and will be back to this hotel only because of simon i travel to amsterdam times a year and will be checking in again on monday,1
714,nh really needs to change the names of their hotels in amsterdam we started at this one the nh amsterdam centre but after seeing how beat up the rooms were we moved to the nh amsterdam city centre do not make the same mistake we did there is no comparison of the hotels as the centre is a really old hotel that needs a good deal of renovation,0
715,this was our first visit to amsterdam and the nh was our best pick and we are very pleased that we made the pick we arrived late due to a very late flight staff went out their way to ensure that we got dinner as it was our first stay in this chain of hotels we received a room upgrade we enjoyed it from our perspective with the activities we had planned the hotel was in an ideal position close a pick points for both the bus and the canal boat the rijksmuseum van gogh museum and others were within easy walking distance as was the heineken experience we walked from the central railway square through dam square and back to vondel park and the hotel with ease paying close attention to hundreds of cyclists who have no regard for anyone the road construction in front of the hotel was a bit of a pain but we got round it there are numerous tourist restaurants close by one advantage we did not access was the airport bus which had a stop nearby we could have saved ourselves euro,1
716,the front desk personnel are excellent i would especially like to compliment sara who has gone out of her way on many occasions to help me with bookings reservations etc remembers my name every time so unusual in this day and age and so appreciated thank you sara,1
718,the king sized bed is really comfortable the room is big and clean after took long flight i found it super comfort to stay here and relax at the first night the location is really good not far from the airport and you find there as soon as you arrived kastelstraat station,1
719,we liked the spacious and modernly decorated room and the small terrace in front of the hotel i very much appreciated the fact that in the in the room we also found products the subway is a walk and in minutes you reach the central station,1
720,check in was very quick and even if we arrive in the morning the room was ready room was nice and clean staff was very helpful we had breakfast at the hotel which was lovely mixed selection of breads cereal croissants coffees juices and hot and cold food including bacon and is relative very easy to reach city center with public transportation,1
721,this hotel is located well outside the city center of amsterdam so that was a big draw back additionally the staff was incredibly unhelpful we accidentally booked this location and contacted the hotel immediately after booking to indicate our booking was a mistake they refused to issue us a refund or even allow us to transfer to one of the other nh hotels closer to the city center we offered to pay the difference in cost we just really did want to stay out there once we arrived and got in to our room there were peanut shells all over the floor and dark hairs on the chair and floor so the room had been poorly cleaned again the hotel staff at this point refused to help us by issuing a refund or allowing us to switch locations pretty awful experience the only good thing was the bike rental which we could have done at almost any hotel in amsterdam,0
722,really my room was not clean and the towels was dirty as well the tables and chairs as dirty as well i had to do my own cleaning before to put any food or my personal things i can say the staff was very friendly and did the best that they could do,0
723,i was in the hotel as a part of europamundo tour and this is one of the best hotels they use i had dinner at the restaurant and the food was incredible and very room is comfortable and clean the biggest disadvantage is tha it far from the city and there is no transport to downtown,1
724,well located hotel very friendly and helpful staff clean rooms but could do with slick of paint and a new food in the restaurant was did not hear any noise from was easy to find from central station just a tram ride definitely stay there again,1
725,the location was an easy min walk to anne franks house there was a hop on hop off canal stop right outside the hotel tons of coffee and food shops beautiful room overlooking the canal with excellent amenities i would definitely book here again,1
726,stayed here for nights at the end of june the hotel is right by the prinsengracht canal it is about a minute or so walk from the centraal station past shops bars and restaurants or you can easily catch the tram to and from centraal station numbers and as the tram stop is right outside the had a nice big room which overlooked the canal did use any of the other hotel facilities although the area did look quite hotel is in a good position for exploring amsterdam and there is a nice square called leidesplein with restaurants and bars just round the corner from the staff were always friendly and definitely stay here again,1
727,we stayed for three nights from check in to check out nothing to objet we were greeted by a person named gustavo the room is in excellent condition spacious and very equipped plus a very comfortable and large location is preferential to fifty meters is the tram stop the area is one of the highest level of close park central zone area of very complete and varied and the place is set to enjoy both at the time of breakfast and to read a book use the imac available remomendable,1
728,we stayed here in july in the room no the whole quarter is quiet and noble full of beautiful villas and gardens amsterdam itself is like a botanical garden in summer and also the backyard of the hotel we hade a view to the garden with a huge magnolia trea which was amazing the reception people were very nice and helpful you can rent a bike here for euro or so breakfast definitely worth ordering great choice of fresh sliced fruits lovely croissants crispy bread and many many more it is very nice that you can rest in the cozy reception after you return tired from the centre charge yourself with a cup of tea or coffee free of charge and than move off to explore more of the city the only think i would change there is no hair shampoo in the bathroom and i definitly do not wish to wash my hair with the liquid soap and also the hairdryer dries your hair out it noting dramatic but if you have any hair issues take your own stuff the location is great near the galleries and just besides the vondelpark we loved our stay and definitely will come back,1
729,where to start it was my first time in amsterdam and my partners so i had no idea what to expect but from the airport to the hotel was a pretty seamless an express train from the airport to amsterdam centraal which took about mins then a metro three stops to weesperplein which was another mins then a short walk to the hotel another mins and we greeted by the lady at the front desk and swiftly checked in our room was only a standard king size room but it was pretty spacious with lots of closet space bathroom with a rainforest shower and a also a normal shower head with different pressures lovely smelling citrus were so tired the first night that we decided to just order room service and as it was not too pricey it was the best decision we made on the holiday as we had the most delicious burger order it and you see what i mean and really really good chips also try the sticky rice dessert with mango and coconut cream as it delectable cocktails also very good and i had the pineapple worth mentioning also is that room service comes on the normal table but within the table there a hot box to keep your food hot if you want to eat it later brilliant so brilliant in fact that we ordered steak frites the next night too the guy on room service is the best did get his name unfortunately as,1
730,this hotel was opened in april it is a very nice hotel close to the tram and across from a supermarket it about a minute walk to town the staff are very friendly the rooms are spotless i would visit amsterdam again and i would definitely stay at this hotel the room had a canal view and it was very comfortable great customer service,1
732,we came here for new years and it was amazing my fiance wanted to propose to me and they made everything so beautiful and perfect we had the best room and service was also brilliant very close to the city centre it is a bus ride away very clean hotel and friendly service too,1
733,i stayed here in march when i visited amsterdam for the pt expo it is close to the exhibition venue and has a shuttle taxi every morning to the closest metro station the rooms are decent and the breakfast is chargeable and quite decent staying here is ideal if you prefer to be close to the venue though it is not walking distance from rai exhibition venue,1
734,mercure hotel is near overamstel metro station in amsterdam holland fairly close to metro station and if you have no or light luggage then it is comfortable to walk to about decent sized clean rooms upper floors have wonderful views have spa steam and sauna for guest use we had a triple sharing room and the room was of a fair size so did not feel too cramped,1
735,clean and modern hotel with very easy public transport access rooms are good sizes with a safe and mini fridge showers only no bath which was abit of a downside especially after long days of walking big comfy beds though staff all speak fluent english very helpful and is euro which is slightly over priced however no other places to eat fall into the trap of getting a taxi from the airport approx euro we got the train to amsterdam zuid straight from the airport then the metro to overamstel metro was for two days unlimited usage and train was for a single travel very easy and simple hotel was approx from downside is that it a isolated hotel with no nearby shops or restaurants hotel and hotel shop are very expensive,1
736,it is a bit further from the city but this is reflected in the price it was a good clean and the beds were perfect it is easy enough to get to from town the metro and a little walk as it such a tall building it easy to spot the room was spacious but to be honest we spent very little time at the hotel as we were too busy enjoying this amazing city,1
737,came back from a weekend stay in amsterdam in a standard double room the hotel is easy to get to from the airport via train and metro and easy to get into central amsterdam via metro system we purchased at the airport a day gvb card for euros each that allowed unlimited travel on the trains trams metro and buses the hotel is also only a few stops by metro from ajax stadium so would be perfect to stay in if in holland to watch a match the staff on check in were polite and a map was provided of the city which myself and hubby found very useful the bar area is lovely we did eat in the room was plenty big enough large comfy bed fridge tv hairdryer etc it was pretty quiet we were on level of the tower block we would definitely stay here again if we visit amsterdam,1
738,stayed in the mecure hotel amsterdam city as a couple july for nights i have no negative things to say about this hotel it modern clean and stylish our room had a beautiful view over looking the canal and we had the perfect nights sleep in a cosy king sized bed our room had a large flat screen tv with english channels an espresso machine and a kettle with a selection of teas a mini fridge with free soft drinks and bottles of water which was refilled everyday again for free the staff were excellent and very informative was quick and easy and the staff gave as very detailed information about trams and buses which was great the reception staff even ordered our takeaway for us and booked a taxi back to the airport for a good price over all great customer service the hotel is near amsterdam city centre but we were aware of that when we booked the hotel is only a minute walk to the metro and then a minute ride on the tram to the city centre quick and easy we bought a day tram pass at the hotel for it runs every minutes until half past at night and so the location of the hotel really was a problem over all i would recommend this hotel and really enjoyed our stay in amsterdam,1
739,rooms are small but clean breakfast selection is ok you can find all basic staff what i did like i super slow lifts you can wait for minutes for lift to arrive in the mornings hotel should consider replacing them with something more fast,1
740,hotel was very clean and stf was very helpful perfect location just away from the metro station breathtaking views might be a bit expensive for breakfast they offer parking as well at a reasonable price considering that parking in the city is expensive and impossible,1
742,beautiful hotel lovely room and staff the only downside was it is out of the way of everything a train ride into amsterdam and a minute walk to the hotel otherwise it is a beautiful hotel and recommend it,1
745,mercure hotel amsterdam city is not in the city center you have to walk to the train station to go to the center bed sheets were dirty covered with hair we had to request it to be changed they did put a stamp on the city tax sheet paper so i could get my refund they did mention about it i could open the windows so the room was so hot air condition was not working well the only good thing i can say was the breakfast,0
746,not far from nearest metro line overamstel arrived early evening very informal check in straight forward and given info of area maps and recommended restaurants and activities etc asked for a water view which is on the back of the hotel and this was sorted the room was on the end of the floor very nice comfortable bed no bath but that did bother us nicely laid out room was lovely and quiet at night with cold air blower which was welcome breakfast was good and varied i thought at the time it was a little on the expensive side but after travelling into the city was competitive with town centre price all staff very pleasant,1
747,we arrived early our rooms were ready there were quite a lot of people hanging around in the lobby waiting we stood for quite a while when it got to the time that our rooms should been ready i asked one of the ladies on reception who called housekeeping to check still not ready stood waiting again a male member of staff who i think was called jorgis asked if he could help we explained what was happening immediately he sorted rooms for us one triple one double he upgraded our double room to business floor too great rooms fabulous interior of the hotel bar lovely shop selling ready to eat foods meals that you can pop into a microwave coffee etc can also be purchased there lovely bar restaurant area outside patio everywhere smelt fresh clean metro into city is just a minute walk away very easy nice quiet location too lovely stay,1
748,i found the hotel just days before arrival after arriving we checked in by a young men named xadir who was friendly and smart he tried to speak german a lot since we come from lobby has modern intereor just as the rooms have we had a room the bed room and the bathroom are very clean since they got tidied and cleaned every day the view is great as well because a canal lays right behind the terrace of the hotel the next station is pretty near the hotel as well as the next highway and the airport the rooms and the whole hotel is very quiet though so you wo wake up in the middle of the night because of noise from the enjoyed my stay a lot and i really want to return to amsterdam and to that hotel in my next vacation,1
749,apollo hotel location on canals with a beautiful relationship therefore we did come back and interior renovated super restaurant with porter,1
752,a great hotel full of classic style and it adjoins a theatre the room was spacious and lots of roomy bathroom and tea making facilities the black and ornate deco gave a good impression of this boutique hotel the staff were excellent too,1
755,being an spg member i loved the flexibility this hotel offered me it was one of the ones available for the dates i was traveling but i must say i was impressed by the rooms had both the standard and deluxe rooms and they were pretty comfy and offered ample space for groups to get dressed and sleep one thing i must point out is that this hotel went above and beyond for my birthday waiting for me in my room was a handwritten card and some pastries to congratulate me on my birthday which was the same day i checked in so shout out to them for that gesture would stay here again nice view of the river but restaurant is a little expensive,1
757,stayed for a birthday celebration in january hotel very nice rooms of a high standard staff very helpful and friendly and even left a surprise birthday dessert in the room did not eat dinner at hotel but breakfast very good with lots of choice,1
758,my husband and i stayed here for two nights prior to our grand european tour on viking with arrangements being made by viking i communicated with the hotel prior to our visit informing them that we would be celebrating our wedding anniversary while at the hotel upon arrival they did not disappoint and as we checked in we were wished a happy anniversary and told we were upgraded to a king bed and a room with a beautiful canal view the lobby was under chaotic construction which made for a less than desirable condition but the room was lovely with a delightfully fluffy comfortable bed the bathtub is very dangerous and slippery with no mats provided even when we requested them they did not arrive causing us to not use the facility at all while we were there the complimentary breakfast buffet was one of the best i have ever seen in a lovely light and airy room overlooking the canal the food was simply delicious and a great way to start the day the hotel is far from the center of town but accessible with a tram or taxi robert the concierge was the nicest friendliest and most helpful person to us and perfect for his job he is a great asset to the apollo since from to he is the first person to greet you as you step into the lobby his towering figure and huge smile make you feel right at home we are now proud to,1
759,its on the water breakfast is among the best i had and you are having breakfast right on the side of a canal the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable the staff is superfriendly i would visit again,1
760,stayed here for days on business selected it because of how it looked online and some customer reviews they are currently doing a major renovation and things are quite disorganized and rather chaotic the restaurant apparently has been moved and it was hard to find they had my researvation all wrong i was with my wife but when i checked in they had it a single person they at first did not believe that i had made the reservation for two people and it was only after i showed them the reservation on my laptop that they grudgingly corrected it they also had that i had not paid for breakfast but we had and again it was only after i showed them the reservation on my laptop that they corrected it a number of other similar problems overall a fairly unpleasant experience particuarly given it is not cheap we would definitely not stay here again given how many nice hotels there are in amsterdam,0
761,especially by the staff it always amazesme to find hotels which would not be bad but the staff ruins the stay is management too busy to see what is going on so the room was clean and nicely decorated even though i am in the netherlands and i am sure they could have found pictures of their country instead of hanging two pics of new york city in our room just me noticing breakfast area as everyone else said best part in the hotel front desk personal not thefriendliest bunch to say the least and some waiters and waitresses busy talking amongst themselves instead of noticing paying customers is in walking distance within museums and restaurants and such and located in a very quiet neighborhood,1
764,the hotel belonged to several different chains over the last couple of years at the beginning of this year it has changed to starwood properties and is classified as design hotel i admit that i would have expected something different for a design hotel of course every hotel has a certain design but the denomination as well as the branding starwood uses for design makes guests consider this type of hotels is very modern and stylish the interior of the newly renovated rooms is nice and the rooms are comfortable especially the beds allow for a good night sleep however i would not have necessarily thought of design hotel when seeing the interior please don t be shocked when approaching the hotel the exterior looks not very accommodating but inside you have very nice areas you could read already from other reviews that the lobby area is currently undergoing some change so there is construction going on i have however not been disturbed by this in my room i had a very pleasant harbour view which i enjoyed very much the breakfast buffet is nice and the breakfast area is arranged nicely different from other hotels in a more winter garden from the other reviews staff has received differing ratings i was accommodated very nicely and very pleasantly by all staff members who passed my way i needed to buy flowers for a certain occasion one morning at a fairly early hour and i was helped tremendously by the staff,1
765,so to be fair i did intentionally book this place the company booking system flagged it up as ok and i saw double tree miles from city centre and thought it be impressions of the place was rough it on the wharf and really not an appealing part of town at all kind of in the middle of nowhere and a pretty awful looking hotel however was really well appointed and the staff were lovely the breakfast was good and the coffee ok the gym was not really as exciting as it sounded on the website it basically a runner cross trainer bike and a few dumbbells all n all nice rooms and hotel just not the location,0
766,it very hard to book a hotel when you do know the city we thought it a hilton so they usually are located in good areas this hotel was definitely not where a tourist wants to be if you stay in amsterdam rather book a hotel near the central railway station the hotel was ok the first time we stayed in a room with windows near the ceiling no view whatsoever anyhow you would not have wanted to look out the window as it was surrounded by ferry was an inconvenience to us especially on the day we departed we had a very early flight and the ferry was not operational that early so we had to take a taxi which cost we been near the station we could have taken the train to the airport for a lot less rather pay a little more and stay central hope this helps you in planning your stay in amsterdam,0
767,in may and july this year i stayed at this hotel with a friend the hotel was overall good and clean the breakfast was excellent and design useful usage of space noteworthy the view of the water view rooms was impressive even at the floors not at the top little things were missing no chocolate chip cookies received upon in july in may the hotel mistaked my gold status in a silver status the note that my friend alina became in may and the stay was part of the birthday gift was ignored nevertheless a very good hotel when visiting amsterdam,1
768,service was excellent at the hotel the stampers wonderful help yourself in a lot of different problems that we had also was a nice place to be was on the water i would recommend this hotel to anyone of those traveling single family business because it away from the hustle and bustle from amsterdam you have to take a free minute boat ride to get to amsterdam which is very relaxing,1
769,the hotel is located a ferry ride from centralstation which we took several times during our stay we loved breakfast buffet is well sorted and our room was in a modern industrial style which we loved bonus was the huge flee market on the weekend which is surrounding the hotel area,1
770,amsterdam is cripplingly expensive when it comes to hotels and if you still want to be close to the city centre but avoid the cost and bustle this hotel wins minutes walk from the free ferry to centraal and on the trendy north side this hotel is very handily stayed here on business but would hesitate to use its services as a tourist staff are super friendly bar and restaurant are good cosy during the winter downside is in the summer the rooms can be quite stuffy with no way of letting fresh air in,1
771,having visited amsterdam many times and visiting this area previously we opted to stay here and were not hotel was clean our queen superior room spacious and the bathroom modern and well appointed we encountered no disturbance from our neighbours or nearby venues we stayed monday to friday the view of the river was stunning and were were able to watch the river traffic going to and fro it was very were excellent with a wide variety of hot and cold choices eggs bacon etc meats cheeses and breads cereals and fresh fruits daily fresh pastries the coffee was also very the staff we encountered were courteous and hotel is relatively small and has a good we are spring chickens we took advantage of the nearby venues such as pllek noorderlicht and loetje and enjoyed them all we felt that we had a true amsterdam experience in that we were away from the main tourist areas the ndsm wharf is being regenerated and the hotel is right next to the old slipway the nearby ndsm boat works is now home to many local businesses there even a hotel in one of the old dockyard to the hotel is a problem the free ferries run every half hour every minutes at peak times and the journey takes ten minutes this gives you an opportunity to watch the yachts and boats sailing up and down the ij and see the landmarks as you pass by the hotel will give you a would,1
772,we were made very welcome in this hotel the staff were lovely and made our stay very hotel was very clean and tidy and we had no problems at all when we stayed location wise the hotel was about a walk to dams square and was in a nice area which was quiet and the area had a few pubs there was a big street market outside the hotel on the weekend this was really nice and sold a huge amount we would stay her again,1
773,i had a fabulous two night trip to the linden hotel amazing hotel fabulous staff and sweets on reception what more could you want seriously this is a great location nice and quiet but very close to the centre and stop with lovely room decoration and accessories,1
775,a boutique hotel which was pricey for the location minute walk from train station minutes from anne frank house room was clean and comfortable nothing exceptional had a family room with single beds which were comfortable and plenty big even for my frame bathroom was strange as shower drain not inside shower door so whole floor gets wet if someone showers free coffee and espresso was a nice touch nothing wrong and nice but again location was a bit far from center and pricey for a family room,1
776,i love the hotel it is in a great location the staff is very friendly and helpful and breakfast is included the rooms are small but i think that is expected in amsterdam the beds are comfortable the room was clean and the hotel has an elevator this is a bid help for people with lug gages i say a lot of families there so it is a great place for kids,1
777,everything was perfect from arrival to our leave only place for improvements is the breakfast menu a little bit of shuffling the offer would not hurt we stay for a week and had the same breakfast every morning,1
778,great location hotel room very small but clean with nice white towels supplied daily very quirky decor which made us smile hotel recommendations for eating were excellent including the seafood bar and the uptown meat club both on van baerlestraa which was about mins walk from the hotel,1
779,we had a great stay at the hotel we came to amsterdam for an extended weekend and find better place very good location quiet with walking distance to all interesting sights we loved stylish design of interior friendly staff small but very clean and comfortable room breakfast included i will recommend this hotel to my friends,1
780,the rooms were lovely and fun with a basketball hoop breakfast disappointing and unorganised and some staff were as helpful but for location it was perfect to get to everywhere you need a tram stop just round the corner,1
781,great hotel great area right outside the iconic iamsterdam sign short walk to the action lovely service from the staff too was a great place to spend my birthday only problem was the walls were a bit thin so got a noise complaint from next door,1
782,we love amsterdam have visited several times now on a previous visit we stayed in this hotel when it was the poet the feel of the hotel having changed with the max brown makeover my boys liked the basketball the rooms were of a good size for a family of four with two doubles and one fold out no bedding was supplied it was warm when we visited and air conditioning was missed the static fan was much help but never the less is only a small museum district gives great access to a number of parks and access to shops my eldest loved having a whole street of branded goods to look at breakfast was self serve continental you know this before you go it was ample and enough room to sit and have as much as you with the in room refreshments no coffee or milk and two tea bags for a two night stay although our room was visited by the hotel cleaners these were not refreshed or replenished the ladies on reception who met us to book in were very friendly lovely hotel not quite stars but a good,1
784,max brown hotel near the museum square is very well located transportation and activities the hotel is very clean and the staff is friendly and always ready to help the breakfast is nice and served on a buffet we enjoyed our two nights very quiet but the room and bathroom were little small for three,1
786,when we first got to max browns and saw the stairs i groaned inside thinking here we go again we had been travelling for the last weeks n i was over stairs but not to worry there is a lift for you n your luggage we arrived early expecting to just drop our luggage and come back later the staff where fabulous we where able to check in and go to our room the rooms are small but very comfortable clean and bright loved the basketball ring above the bed my only complained and it was not the hotels fault but one of the apartments opposite our room left their outside light on all night for nights most annoying would recommend max browns to travellers who want everything on your doorstep friendly extremely helpful staff clean comfy rooms and a decent breakfast thanks people for a great stay,1
787,if you looking for the large lobby elevators cookie cutter chain hotel this is not for you but if you like to stay in a quirky place with a lot of local charm this place is awesome we had a large room with sufficient space for our family of clean lovely decorated small but functional bathroom very friendly staff check in was a breeze we were given a small package with maps discounts and happenings in the area breakfast had a good selection of cold meats cheese and pastries location was great just one block from the reijks museum bus and tram and even a boat tour company to get a sense of the architecture of amsterdam would definitely come back next time we are in amsterdam just be aware that although there is a tiny elevator there are steep steps everywhere so it might not be suitable for persons with restricted mobility,1
788,this is a modern hotel we love the open reception concept service at the reception is great and very helpful and accommodating provided a free map and suggestions on how to go around the area they also sell tickets the location is to minutes walk into the old town restaurants and groceries nearby the area is in a quieter area the room is clean and quite big for a european hotel we were given a room with a view of the canal which was awesome bed is very comfortable and wifi is strong,1
789,a nice hotel quite well situated in walking distance of station and city although even easier using the trams tickets available at hotel excellent welcome on arrival kevin nice rooms quite spacious good bathroom breakfast was ok had better had worse both hot and cold available although hot was a bit limited overal a pleasant stay,1
790,just come back after a lovely break in a lovely hotel the hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly and helpful the room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels were provided the bed was really comfy for a hotel room there was free wifi and a free safe in the room along with english tv channels on the tv bbc and and toiletries in the bathroom free of charge one thing that would have been nice was if there were tea and coffee facilities in the room we ate in the hotel a few times at night as the food was lovely and was badly priced compared all the restaurants in the centre there is a tram stop a few min walk away from the hotel where you can get the number and in to dam this was only a minute tram ride you can buy your tram tickets from the hotel reception we bought a hour ticket which was around euros all in all would defiantly stay at this hotel again,1
791,had a few hiccups regarding reservations weeks before our stay here got to the hotel on and had absolutely no issues very nice clean and well presented hotel in walking distance to dam square amsterdam centraal train station and other shops and emenities my only issue was that it was extremely expensive costing us for nights for room only in the end it was worth it its a fabulous hotel will definitely be returning here thats if the prices of the rooms were to go down,1
792,i was really delightedly surprised at the warm welcome my first visit to this hotel yet their staff could not have tried harder to be as helpful as possible with the smallest things and the hotel was quiet and clean and arrival i was met by smiling happy staff who welcomed me as if i was a regular i had a good sized room on the floor with a canal view a window that opened enough to let in some air but wasn t really necessary as the air conditioning worked very well the maid had done a spotless clean with plenty of towels and i want to give a special mention for the young lady who came to put the water bottles in the room and asked if i needed anything else her smiling happy face lit up the slept soundly on a comfortable bed and also because the room doors did not crash each time a guest came in or out of their room which is the normal disturbing factor in most hotels the elevators were speedy and operated by a room key hence was good items included kinds of eggs cheeses hams breads jams cereals and croissants etc and a variety of fresh fruit and the coffee was better than expected a trifle expensive but if you like a hearty breakfast not was very handy for both trams at one end of the street and buses at the other which took one into the town and to,1
793,no complaints about ibis stopera we got a hotel shuttle minibus from the airport not prebooked but still easy to find and sort got to ibis too early but they stored baggage got checked in about when a room became available the room was clean basic and no frills but absolutely spot on for a weekend visit the staff were great plenty to choose from at breakfast and only a minute or two to shops maybe minutes to more central areas the bathroom was a bit tiny but other than that everything was great,1
794,we checked in with no problems at all and the staff were very helpful they gave us maps and lots of information about places to visit told us about the tram and bus services which were only a few minutes away the tram service was very easy to use the room we stayed in was basic but adequate and was overlooking a canal the facilities in the room included a large tv safe free wi fi and a very large shower the bed was large clean and comfortable breakfast is available in the hotel although we did not have one there is also a bar with a variety of drinks plenty of seating areas and all the staff were very friendly and helpful we would recommend this hotel,1
795,we got to the hotel in the middle of the night after we got lost in amsterdam the night shift worker welcomed us in a very delightful way explained about the city and answer a lot of our questionsthe hotel is very close to rembrant square and about minutes walk to dam square supermarked nearby and a marketplace and there is public tranportation minutes walkthe classic boutique hotel,1
796,stayed here for two nights july with my husband for our wedding anniversary and ca fault got the sprinter train from airport to dam centraal and then walked to the hotel around mins with bags nice walk no bother then on we did have to get any public transport as we walked everywhere the longest walk to by vondelpark is still just under mins with lots to see on the do enjoy walking on city breaks but it a really nice location and trams everywhere if you do fancy the walk only a minute walk from the icebar and also the skinny bridge which is lovely at night another minutes gets you right into the city could be simpler very friendly staff and no complaints about the room basic but clean with comfy bed nice and quiet at a great weekend and highly recommend this hotel,1
797,very modern and clean hotel breakfast very good and is available until rooms clean and compact bathroom a bit strange at first as it is like the bathroom on a cruise ship it was like it was moulded from on piece of material no complaints other than it was a good minute walk from the central train station staff very friendly and good value for money if you dont mind not being in a cental location,1
798,fantastic hotel clean online checkin and checkout friendly staff and above all great location very close to the central train station and metro and to the city center located in a very quiet area but in minutes you could be in the busiest touristic spots wifi really works and i ca wait to come back book a room with canal view foto is the view from the room go explore and enjoy,1
799,very few complaints did exactly what i expected reasonably sized comfortable rooms with great friendly staff and all at a good price it not exactly centrally located being around a minute walk from the nearest metro waterlooplein and minutes from rembrandtplein but still very accessible also a mention to the free wifi no problems at all with connection and good complimentary breakfast the only issues i had was no bin in the room only a small one in the the bathroom very little storage and only one pillow on the bed minor issues perhaps but all make a all of this in mind i would happily stay here again and recommend to others at the price thanks,1
800,stayed at this hotel for two nights very goo d hotel close to central railway station if you are arriving at schipol airport a short walk to the city centre and all the tourist attractions friendly people most speak english tourist boats for canal cruises nearby great bar and bar food and exceptional staff would stay here again,1
801,nice modern hotel close to dam square km approx and central station if you are taking metro then get down at waterlooplein station and walk for minutes if you are walking from central station it would take around minutes depending on the route you the metro cost me and my wife around euros hour pass on the way back we took taxi a merc and it cost us only euros so i suggest taking taxi unless you decide to were exceptional may be the best in all the accor hotels i have been to very helpful professional and had checked in online and we had the room ready they were kind enough to accommodate our request to change to a canal view had a great spread eggs sausages croissants hot chocolate cheese cold cuts etc and they serve breakfast from am to pm yes in the afternoon decent ibis sized rooms nice lounge next to reception minutes walk to red light is a bike rental shop and super market near the hotel,1
802,spent days is julythe hotel is located a bit of center but it was nice and quite for us we got a nice room with a view to the canal i like the ability to open a window and have some fresh air room was bigger than rooms in ibis hotels in paris and madrid we been at we also walked to and from the center by foot and there are also good public transportation nearby rembrandt house is nearby must see attraction for art staff are very welcoming at the front desk and at the bar pizza at the bar was nice we also had one breakfast which was various fresh and wait to come back,1
803,lovely hotel for a business trip it was clean and had all the facilities that i breakfast was also very nice if not quite simple was perfectly positioned for walking into the main tourist a shame though about the canal building site right outside i thought there would be a canal there with a nice view,1
804,i stayed with my wife nights in this has great survice and convinent location public transportation musiums and supermarket coop in minute walk from the hotel perfect breakfast and fast clean room service,1
805,just had a long weekend stay and would certainly return easy walk to local restaurants bars etc and to vondel park and museums room well appointed and staff could have been more helpful excellent minor criticism is that web site directions on how to find from tram be much clearer yes i got lost in heavy rain,1
806,my wife and i stayed here a month ago during a trip to amsterdam and rome the staff were excellent verena in particular was extremely helpful in recommending local food restaurants grocery stores and tips on going to the anne frank house anything we needed was always graciously provided in a very friendly manner it was out first stay at a nh hotel and it gave us a great first impression,1
808,everything about the hotel was perfect convenient location beautiful large room very helpful and friendly front desk staff i would recommend it to anyone visiting amsterdam we splurged on one of the glass walled rooms and it was really worth it,1
809,my wife and i and two friends enjoyed days here last week mara and jennifer made us feel very welcome at reception the room was clean spacious and comfortable breakfast was a lovely buffet with lots of choices other reception staff whose names i ca remember were helpful in making reservations at museums and in storing our luggage for a few hours after checking out the construction of a car park under the canal outside our room caused no noise or disturbance,1
810,the nh amsterdam was a great place to stay for our first time there within quick walking distance to the major attractions minutes or less on a quiet and beautiful corner of the city right next to the canal you ca go wrong the staff were friendly and helpful the rooms clean and comfortable all for a very reasonable price highly recommended,1
811,we stayed in amsterdam for nights and had the best time at this hotel very clean well looked after hotel service at the desk and the was fantastic rooms were perfect and close to the van gogh museum,1
812,had an amazing few nights at this hotel rooms were clean and tidy staff were very helpful and accomodating especially vincent in reception close to would recommend to anyone coming to amsterdam,1
813,this hotel sits between the museum quarter and de pijp area the former has van gogh and other treasures the latter has some fine restaurants the hotel amenities are limited the gym is serviceable there is no restaurant we did have breakfast but rooms are comfortable and clean and everything works the staff are fantastic and very helpful highly recommended,1
814,the hotel is in a brilliant spot to visit many of the museums which are mins away thou the anne frank house is about walk away the airport transfer was only by cab away book a and it only cost where it was from the taxi rank walking about the city is as easy as public transport the hotel is clean and the staff helpful let us check in early for free it is a bit dated and needs updating as wear and tare is starting to take hold,1
815,clean safe charming walkable city highly recommend all aspects be sure to preplan your visit at least two months in advance if you want access to cultural aspects such as anne frank home canal cruise was wonderful flowers colors vivid and abundant food fresh and delicious,1
816,the hotel was a little difficult to find as we arrived by train and had to take two trams to reach our it also we had to pull our cases up a street to find the hotel entrance not noticeable from the end of the street the canal opposite had been drained and an underground car park was being constructed before putting back the water over the car park a very interesting piece of engineering we were not troubled by any noise but the crane movement provided interesting sight before breakfast very comfortable room the buffet breakfast provided a vast choice to accommodate every diet and quite the best i ever experienced hotel staff very helpful and suggested time bookings for those museums with long queues for entry they were right we would recommend this chain of hotels as the one in utrecht was just a good,1
817,a very clean and comfortable hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel is in walking distance to the museums and one tram ride the away to dam square and you can stay on that same tram all the way up to central station we enjoyed being a little bit away from the madness of dam square so if you want some quiet that is easily accessible this is the place for you,1
818,just stayed here for nights found the staff extremely friendly the room we had booked did have a double bed so they upgraded us with no fuss to a superior room with queen size bed the breakfast was quite expensive and you can eat round the corner in the museum quarter i would stay again although was very business like and not usually the sort of hotel i would visit with a girlfriend,1
819,we stayed on the top floor but one and had beautiful panoramic views of the city roof tops persuaded to upgrade by the charismatic and friendly welcome i glad of having done so the breakfasts are excellent a good range of hot and cold food that constantly updated by the kitchen the bar is good and carries a wide selection of hotel location is out of the centre but only a minute walk from the central station and therefore within minutes of all the attractions of the city the trams stop just around the corner from the hotel and are cheap enough should you not wish to walk located by the iamsterdam sign and the rijksmuseum there are good restaurants and bars in the vicinity of the hotel and we found some lovely ones thanks to the amazingly helpful hotel staff and the map the hotel gave room we had was lovely clean modern and spacious and the bed was comfortable given the hotel location it meant that there was a lot of noise outside at night,1
820,stayed here for three nights the hotel staff are friendly and welcoming amazing central location with a tram stop right rooms are small but have everything you need in and probably the softest and most comfortable bed i have ever slept in other reviews mention traffic noise but our room was very quiet it was at the back which probably helped i felt the breakfast could have done with more choice although the scrambled egg was really good i definitely recommend this amsterdam hotel,1
821,we booked the and enjoyed a luxury stay in a beautifully designed room as the reviews on tripadvisor and various other rating platforms show the new rembrandt suite is one of the most popular rooms at the exchange and it is indeed when you seen the normal size of a reasonably priced in amsterdam moreover it was amazingly quiet and peaceful at nights we stayed at warmoestraat before which is only a walk away where the noise was horrible there were really friendly and always helpful people at the reception desk considering the prices i would liked a nice breakfast being included but one can not have it all,1
822,it is located in the heart of the tourist district and the door for the entry looks like you are walking into something not so great actually all the rooms are designed by fashion students and are very comfortable and kind of cute breakfast is ok a bit noisy and you have to walk outside of the hotel to the building next door to enter if you have any troubles walking avoid this hotel because the steps are very steep there are elevators of course but they leave you somewhere where you have to climb stairs which are steep and narrow aside from that nice views and welcoming person at the desk,1
824,tried this hotel when i amsterdam for a conference it happened to be my birthday when i checked in so they gave me a complimentary dinner which i though was a really nice gesture and nothing that i expected comfortable rooms the lounge is a bit small and breakfast in the lounge is basic not like in german hyatt where you can order hot food still quality was good despite not much choice evening hors were good restaurant was fusion location was is a quiet area not right in the centre but definitely walking distance would stay here again,1
825,we paid for a room with a view all we got was a view of a one big tree and a parking lot when you pay extra for a view you usually expect something that is worth the money room check that view please when i tried to change the room a woman from the reception told me that they do have another and said that i actually have a deacent view does that mean that the room without a view have not a window at all only because the hotel wants to get more money for the rooms does mean they have to lie about the rooms a tree and a parking lot in amsterdam is not a view at all the hotel is min from the center which is not so convenient if you park your car in the hotel parking they take your keys and every time you need to reach your car you have to wait the looong queue at the reception a staff member escorts you to the car because you are not allowed to reach your car alone and asks a silly questions what do you need to take from your car no privacy at all,0
826,hyatt is a new and great hotell free wifi good food great gym and good service the staff was fresh and need some time to be perfect the computer system in the reseption seemed to have some issues but a great hotell,1
827,very disappointed to have had such an experience when you pay around the rooms are new and a confortable bed and big the room service is very good level and people very kind the plates could be more elaborated for a they remain very the breakfast is the service must be ameliorated you must run to have your coffee and your bill to in this category of are supposed to serve you the orange juice too the room cleaning service is a real disaster due to which i would never suggest this hotel or come back pillows which smell floor not cleaned coffee which is absent paper absent people who enter to the room despite the privacy laber put outside too many mistakes for a hotel of such a category very disappointed,0
828,i really loved staying at this hyatt the vibe coming in was very up beat and inviting i do not typically go to hotel bars but the music and ambiance was enticing the rooms were fantastic with a living space dressing two tv and very comfortable bed the view was nice but a little obstructed by the trees it was somewhat removed from the center of town but easily accessible via metro or tram its even fine to walk to everything if you want to and have the time it was within walking distance to the zoo and to the windmill and brewery breakfast was full of many food choices from the buffet and nice selections from the menu,1
829,i ate at mama makan i was too hungry to complain they serve chicken that has still blood on bones i just ate the cooked part and never got an apology service was bad had to wait minutes for that chicken and had to remind them to serve my wine,1
830,great front desk staff good location near tram walking distance to excellent restaurant regency club really well managed excellent food and free house restaurant is well run and food above average especially breakfast,1
831,i am a fan of hyatt hotels as i travel often for work i was originally concerned that this hotel was quite in the city center but it is in the canal belt having said that i think the location of the hotel was ideal the city center turned out to be way too crowded and busy i enjoyed the side canal streets of this city more the hotel is within a minute walk to the metro and was very easy to get from and to the airport it was a nice and easy walk to the canal belt which i enjoyed there is also a nice delicious bakery cafe nearby next to the metro station called bakhuys hotel staff themselves were nice and most helpful they were all very knowledgeable if you looking for plan ideas the only two thing that made my hotel stay not as ideal was housekeeping who made my room did make my bed the first night i was there she cleaned the trash and the towels but the bed was left unattended it which was a bit strange the and nights of my stay all the lights came on in the room while i was sleeping for a total of in the middle of the night it was a bit creepy but i was too tired the first night that it happened where i just fell back asleep maybe it was a glitch when i brought it up to the front desk at checkout,1
832,we stayed here with two teens for nights this hotel is brand new cool stylish interior very comfortable and spacious rooms not a given in europe so this was a delight we updated to a suite which was even bigger modern and spacious bathrooms separate toilet shower and bathtub rooms were quiet and elegant hotels is a great location if you prefer a little quiet and want to walk to the sites having been to amsterdam before we really enjoyed having the close proximity to everything yet ebbing able to retreat the hustle and bustle of the city it can get a little much so we really liked this location a lot easy walk to quality restaurant but we loved our in house restaurant so much that we opted to eat there twice for dinner an indonesian fusion restaurant with authentic indonesian cooks my son loved the fried rice dish so much he asked the chef to give away her secret tips and showed how how to cook it that was at the end of her long shift we were impressed that she had the patience to teach him breakfast buffet was varied and typical european spread with fresh breads cheese meats fruit cereals and many other yummy treats we could have stayed all morning just for that we loved this hotel so much that we are considering going back there on our way through other european stops great find did i mention the staff super helpful friendly and fun,1
833,initially wanting a city centre hotel we ended up choosing one just outside the main city centre and it was seriously worth it no noise no crowds easy access in and out of the city and great help staff well worth a little walk,1
835,stayed here for a night due to close by business modern hotel will clean design suits my preferred style restaurant had good meal great quiet hotel if you need a place away from the city center mins by tram,1
836,we ended up here as our first hotel let us down but everything happens for a reason as soon as we entered the staff were friendly and welcoming speaking perfect english our room was spacious with a lovely bathroom and decent fridge to squirrel away snacks and nibbles downstairs in the foyer and restaurant were art installations and exhibitions which was interesting for us the hotel is about mins walk from the nearest tram which can be reached by crossing the road at the side of the hotel and taking the path through the houses and woodland opposite,1
838,i have spent a great time there with my family but i have one complaint about the room service i asked for a iced coffee twice in the day but i did get anything the rest of the hotel was pretty fantastic,1
839,stay here for days on the june and had the best time ever the hotel is in the centre but i liked that seeing the quite side of amsterdam got to the hotel by bus took less than half an hour and literally from the bus stop about minute walk to the we travelled into the city using the tram and bought a hour tram bus and metro card for we bought this from the hotel the rooms were cleaned every day of our visit the only thing that i thought needed improving was the ice machine on level every day of our visit did have cups or ice had to go down levels for the mini bar in the room was none existent just an old mini bar fridge that had been but apart from that loved our stay here and would defiantly visit again has a lidl about minute walk away with a takeaway and other shops near buy for snacks etc so we never bought from hotel,1
840,came here for days in july hotel is central but is a minute walk away from tram you can buy a gvb ticket for all transport was for hours does all buses trams metro and train which is great because taxis are not an option so expensive there is a night bus aswell if you stay out late an hour we got a deal with the hotel that was off all food and drink in the hotel it brand new and it felt like no one in the hotel knew about it so that was a hassle apart from that hotel was great cleaned daily has fridge safe kettle ironing broad tv hair dryer ect massive beds that were really comfortable would definitely go back amsterdam has so much to offer for everyone,1
841,stayed in the hotel for christmas and new year had a great time in amsterdam the hotel was very very nice it was a little bit further from the city centre than anticipated but the tram lines were right by the hotel and run every couple of minutes so it was good to see other parts of the area on the commute the hotel was excellent very fancy lovely room and facilities and i love amsterdam,1
842,stayed here in mid june with my daughter for four nights originally she had booked with a friend however plans changed and i decided to go in their place we had done a bit of research so we knew which bus we wanted to be on to get to the hotel number once we arrived at the airport once we got on the bus the incredibly helpful driver looked at her phone and worked out what stop we needed to get off at for us to get the tram to our hotel she shouted to us when we reached the stop this was our first experience of amsterdam friendliness and it did stop there after a short tram journey we got off and we felt at a bit of a loss as our hotel was nowhere to be seen we stopped a passer by and he was able to direct us the walk from the tram stop is around minutes and takes you through houses however once you know where you going it check in was efficient and you must pay a city tax on arrival which was around euros the hotel itself is stunning inside with lots of quirky artwork and the rooms are quite stylish done out in dark wood mini toiletries are provided in the bathroom and there is a kettle with and a free safe which you choose a digital code to use there is a tv however we never used it our break was during,1
844,the hotel is a little bit far but you go there very easily by the tram just min from the dam square it a modern and clean hotel big rooms and friendly staff the location is in a quite zone of the city it also very near from the airportthey offer a overprice breakfast for only thing i didnt like about the room was the bathroom which i found very little private,1
845,every thing was perfect and excellent staff rooms cleanness and services all fine location also was very good near public transportation there was lots of restaurants nearby the hotel as well as coffee shops and supermarkets with in min walking,1
846,a fabulous hotel a little out of the city but within easy reach of the tram services lovely comfortable room with a great bathroom and complimentary luxury toiletries staff were very friendly and helpful and even provided fresh milk for our morning tea garden terrace was very pleasant for a glass of wine,1
847,just staid for one night and did not use the restaurant for dinner only breakfast rooms are ok but with little attention to detail breakfast buffet is nice with good variety incl some healthy options location is very convenient and relatively close to the centre the lobby and restaurant look nice but the hallways and rooms clearly are one level below room was also a bit noisy towards the hall not the street,1
849,got this hotel through a secret escape deal we were hoping for the hilton lol very helpful staff who gave us some info on and restaurants etc yes it is a little out of the way of the center but it is also close to some good attractions so i suggest you read up on the map we like to walk so this worked out quite well for us room was ok but nothing special clean and comfy free toiletries expensive bar as expected free felt more like business hotel rather than a tourist hotel,1
850,as somebody mentioned there is a shocking deposit of euros per day per room other than that the rest is quite satisfying quite attentive staff can cater for everything from museum tickets to umbrellas the rooms are nice with lovely products and well replenished daily superior rooms get free minibar breakfast is good quality but small in size maybe a bit overpriced the hotel is in a quiet posh residential area min away walking from the museums and with plenty of restaurants nearby,1
851,in what world is this star first impression in the lobby very good but that where it ends the rooms are maybe star at best bathroom a star max serious my grandmas bathroom is more luxurious and that has been updated in my lifetime appliances in the room are terrible the hairdryer looks like something george lucas casted when making the empire strikes back no coffee machine and the kettles barely big enough to make one coffee at a time it get some sort of device that make a decent coffee and not that freeze dried cheap stuff for the prices you charge this is asking for much also where do you get of charging an for the desk phoning a taxi absolute scandalous if i knew this at the time i would have phoned it myself would have cost less even with the overseas charges on my own phone but i was told this and was unable to dispute it because you already taken it out of my holding deposit which you take on arrival in case of any damage done durning the stay there no need for this unless you see things in the room as some sort of antiques which could be the case as it does look like they have been updated since overall cheap dated and deceiving sums this hotel up,0
853,this hotel is lovely it very modern we arrived early due to our flight coming in at but they were helpful and let us fill out all our details to make check in easier when we returned at and also let us store our bags in a locker room which was controlled securely we stayed in a triple room which was quite small and basic but suited our needs as we were out all day in the centre of amsterdam it very easy to get the train from sloterdijk station into the central station it takes minutes and a return ticket for the day costs we also used it as our transportation back to the airport a taxi costs about and the train only cost each therefore this hotel is in a perfect location with many transport options around you we chose not to get the breakfast from the hotel but instead go to the spar store which is right next to the station and does fresh pastries fruit freshly squeezed orange juice and fruit smoothies and was all a lot cheaper than paying for breakfast at the hotel we also found the staff very helpful in regards to buying attraction tickets you can buy many different tickets for popular attractions at the desk which was better for us as we got ourselves organised on our first night overall although this hotel is basic it definitely provided for our needs was clean and modern and would be worth staying in,1
855,great value comfortable room great location with easy access to transportation city centre and airport park nearby good breakfast especially for the morning leaving to airport coming amsterdam,1
856,this hotel is fantastic a great location with a beautiful park in its surroundings and a rooftop bar with stunning views of amsterdam rooms were clean and in great condition with very comfy beds bar was quite expensive but where is in amsterdam tram stops outside hotel and is a minute trip into dam square is a fantastic place hotel is the perfect base,1
857,if you book this place because you trying to stay at a name brand and avoid the uncertainties that come with obscure boutique hotels you may be quite were sent to someone else room apparently housekeeping had not updated who had left and who had the room key was highly problematic throughout the room phone is tricky to use housekeeping is very very poor there is a mention about green choice and not changing your sheets or towels but there no way to opt out so if you prefer clean bedsheets you wo get them there was no change of linen for nights bathroom amenities are not replenished so if you staying days you need to make do with the amenities you received the first day repeated calls to front desk for toiletries went unanswered laundry was undelivered after days room incorrectly mentions complimentary tea service on the top floor when what they mean is there tea bags in your room that you can use housekeeping does not vacuum or clean the bathroom to test placed the shower gel cap in the middle of the bathroom floor found it right there upon return overall this place feels like a motel definitely not at par with other a beautiful rooftop restaurant though with great views of amsterdam and breakfast buffet has a wide spread with waffles breads cereals salads yoghurts hot foods and location is also a plus point because it away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but very,0
858,this hotel was a great stay we were welcomed on arrival at reception and asked if there was anything we needed to know and given all the local information we needed and directed to the soverigner shop for a tram pass the tram is directly outside the hotel which takes you into the centre in just minutes i do know where people are getting the minutes ect from on these reviews it really is not that far and i made an effort to check if this was correct this service really made the difference between being able to get to the centre one night we stayed out after and was surprise that a taxi cost just about euro so between that was bad at all the hotel was clean well maintained tastefully decorated and the rooms were likewise the staff were great they were friendly and helpful when needed and at the right times and would give you enough space and privacy to enjoy your particularly loved the rooftop bar spectacular views over amsterdam and so nice to relax and chill with a drink and would definitely return and recommend this hotel to you ramada we had a great time and i can honestly say i most of the time can find one small complaint but not in this case it was all fantastic we will hopefully see you in the future,1
859,i seen many mixed reviews on this hotel but i have to say i quite enjoyed my stay i leave tomorrow and i honestly do want booked this back in january as a surprise for my fiancé due to it being his birthday this weekend the staff wished him a happy birthday upon giving us our room keys and even left a note in our room along with some wine and balloons picture below which was a brilliant touch the staff are friendly and are happy to help whenever and if needed our room is spacious and the bathroom doors are frosted so if you stay in this hotel and share a room i hope you comfortable with that person we were pleasantly surprised to be able to watch english channels on the tv while getting ready to go out and the are sooo comfortable too we definitely stay at this hotel again we throughly enjoyed our stay for the past nights,1
860,of staff who i encountered were very friendly everything was explained fully regarding room keys breakfast times etc the room was extremely clean though not the largest i have ever stayed in i am dairy intolerant so there are often foods that i cant have on the morning i stayed for breakfast i encountered anushka a wonderful chef a very young lady who couldnt be more helpful she baked me an alternative to the usual sweet pastries which make up part of a european breakfast nothing was too much would highly recommend this hotel,1
861,this hotel was great the staff were all friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and the beds were really perfect after a tiring day exploring amsterdam they held on to our luggage when we arrived as we could not check in for a few hours thus allowing us to walk around without having to drag suitcases around with us the wifi was also brilliant and fast which was very mych appreciated we most definitley stay here again,1
862,great hotel central to all the major tourist destinations we were here for days and the room was clean with enough room for my husband and i the hotel staff were very friendly and were very helpful with all the questions we had the train station is steps away and there were great little restaurants all around we would stay here again,1
863,i start with the staff so friendly and so kind the hotel is well located in the center of the city minutes walk from the train are so small and the beds are not so comfortable but all is very is strange made out of glass and you can see all from the room breakfast is very for the back rooms and not the street facing as the street is noisy,1
864,the hotel is in a great central location with railway station and dam square all within easy walking distance and with friendly helpful staff our room was very comfortable and we overlooked the street below,1
866,perfect location near train station within easy walking distance to many of the main sites also plenty of bars nearby rooms were basically a bed bathroom bathroom had glass walls so privacy somewhat of an issue there not much room to store your bags or clothes either we were only here night so it was a big deal but might get weary after a week rooms were clean staff was very friendly helpful breakfast available for a surcharge there is a parking lot across the street if needed hotel offered discounted voucher as parking is,1
867,stayed nights staff were lovely and helpful breakfast was nice hotel was in a great location rooms were unusual but clean and comfortable bathroom sectioned off by a glass partition was not great and room light switches positioned behind your bed pillows was a pain with the lights accidentally being switched on in the night overall a lovely friendly hotel and would stay here again definitely thank you for a great stay,1
868,we stayed here for a week and we loved staff are all friendly and greeted us every time we went room was spacious which was a bonus and loved the bathroom no recommend this place to anyone visiting the best spot as it close to central station and walking distance to almost everything,1
869,i like this hotel first of all is everybody friendly the hotell are very clean the receptionist are very respectly people also the people are working in breakfast are verry good person i am really satisfied and when i come back i come in same hotell i love amsterdam also west cord hotell,1
870,we stayed here for nights and could have asked for a better time upon arrival staff were eager to help and even asked us what our goals for our trip were so they could point things out on the map for us breakfast was great with different hot choices every day literally everything is within walking distance from this hotel the furthest tourist attraction being a minute walk and the central station was only less than a minute walk away the rooms are quite small but nothing out of the ordinary for europe i would highly recommend staying here and would certainly stay myself again,1
871,with less than a block to walk to catch the tram you are in the city in minutes and can easily navigate the city rooms are clean good beds and the front desk is excessively helpful do get a room on the front if you are in the three lowest floors because street lights shine in and the noise from the restaurant across the street is loud the other room was on the floor not on the front and had no street lights and no traffic or pub noise,1
872,stayed at this hotel and we was so impressed the bedroom was lovely and the bathroom was nice and clean the history of the hotel was impressive and we loved the history of it station to central is a min walk there are local shops across the road and a fabulous cafe for breakfast the staff were really friendly we would stay here again,1
874,the lloyd is a perfect location not to close just a short tram to the centrum the staff is outstanding robin and the front desk team went out of their way to accommodate an early check in for my sick wife and flora in the cafe took special care of her with a great ginger tea and constant checking till the room was ready the facility is marvelous historic and quaint with a rustic charm when in again we will be sure to check in at the lloyd,1
875,so it seems that there is a lot of variability in the rooms we were perhaps lucky but our room was incredible we were told we were staying in a one star room and then got brought to the biggest hotel room i been in amazing art decor style and most comfy beds we stayed in room so if you looking for a cheap but incredible place to stay request this there is a shared bathroom which is just across the hall which was beautiful clean and i never saw anyone else using it location wise the hotel is right beside the tram line and it took about minutes to get to the train station trams were every taxi from centre of amsterdam was only had lunch here but top marks great fresh food cooked perfectly and average were very enthusiastic and everything went recommend this hotel enough,1
877,really liked this hotel check in and out was quick the room and washroom were very clean and the location was excellent yes the rooms are small and washroom is separated by a frosted glass door there is also carpet on the walls lol staff was very helpful our friends stayed at a fancier hotel down the street which at the time of booking months prior was a lot more expensive but when in amsterdam was the same price as we paid for this hotel,1
878,i could fault my stay at this hotel the best thing about it is the location you can walk to royal palace dam square red light district and lots of great cafes bars and places to eat and shop nearby there a tram stop right outside too which is easy to get to all the other sights the hotel itself is modern and very clean the room and en suite bathroom was great and bed was very comfy i a light sleeper but did get disturbed at all despite the location being so central could fault this hotel would highly recommend,1
880,we had such fine memories from this hotel with its location and lovely staffs with their excellent helps for sightseeing easy access for many sightseein like red light maddam tousu museum royal palace rabrant square with a short walk and bus stop is next to the hotel racheal is one of the staff in reception who accepts guest with her nice smile it is really more than a star hotel for its safety because we should use key card and just residents of the hotel can enter the hotel the hotel is very clean u can drink complimentary tasty water in lobby which refresh u after coming back to hotel a full breakfast in its restaurant makes ur day the view of our room was perfect the glassy chairs coordinate the room and u feel a bigger room the wash room was very clean and suitable about months ago we had reserved de roode amsterdam hotel for this trip but weeks before the trip i checked trip advisor about this hotel and i read the views of guests who were dissatisfied of de roode hotel because of its renovation without information to their guests and they had too many trouble with their stay in de roode hotel as we were walking in the street suddenly we saw this hotel which was in rebuild and just lamp were lights on and they had opened a small door for their probable guests i think the views of guests in each hotel can,1
881,the hotel and its history is amazing and i love the way you see and feel it in the rooms coupled with the modern area the atmosphere is perfect and it enhanced by the fabulous approach of all staff,1
882,most visitors probably leave lloyd with mixed feelings but the positive ones prevailed in our case take your time to walk around the building and discover its rich history i appreciated the fresh flowers and funky design elements on every corner we had a room with a right in the and bedroom with floors and windows which was quirky but really amazing the breakfast has a great selection of fresh breads crazy croissants covered with thick layer of chocolate champagne and bloody marry plus everything most people need we also got a bottle of campaign for free using the promotion code from the the hotel is located in a modern amsterdam neighborhood right on water the canals and most attractions are walkable on foot but you also easily get around with tram or in all the place may not be as suitable for families with small kids or elderly but youngsters and adventure lovers like us should absolutely love their stay,1
883,great building inspirational areas the restaurant lounge and library liked the staircase exhibition telling stories the plants area in the basement are a pleasant surprise overall great place staff is helpful and friendly great to have sparkling water at the free internet throughout the near tram lines line straight to central station and line to rozengracht and leidse plein could not be better for jogging enthusiast the quay along the waterfront provides great opportunity to get some fresh air and to jog over the newly developed ex shipping company islands giving great view to the city near supermarkets to stock up on drinks and snacks etc before exploring the city,1
884,we loved this hotel the location is perfect there are trams every few minutes we never waited more than and you in the centre within about minutes so easy to use tickets are very cheap and you can use them all around amsterdam we got much more than our moneys worth the hotel itself is stunning the rooms are basic we stayed star but clean and comfortable the bed was wonderful so big and comfy and the duvet was the best i ever had in a hotel we slept like babies it is like a little museum so quirky the restaurant was really nice very decorative but a little pricey for our kind of stay we mainly ate out the coffee was lovely i can not fault the place at all we will definitely stay here any time we are in amsterdam,1
885,the nice big star room it was hotel was at walking distance to our ship very easy to walk along the boardwalk even with the employees at the desk were very courteous and helped us a lot for roaming around the stay,1
886,it is good to see that after one year the quality remains the same it a clean and confortable hotel very easy to come and go wherever you want white linen and towels are essential always they can wait for me next year,1
888,the hotel is in a perfect spot from the airport with a train that cost around euros with metro to the city centre of amsterdam which is cheap as well hotel is one of the cheapest in the city in a star range it is clean and i know something about it because i work on housekeeping in a hotel my self i am defenenetly going to stay there if i come back to amsterdam highly recommend no more no less one of the receptionist looks like mammed khalidow by the way xd,1
889,beautiful ultra modern hotel very close access to all public transport tram bus and friendly reception staff are excellent and very quick to deal with requests and provide information on places to visit rooms are open plan with super comfortable beds,1
890,been staying here about or times now the staff are fantastic so polite and will help you with anything from your room to what you are planning on doing for the day in amsterdam the rooms are modern open plan with no door to the bathroom area the beds are the best i have ever slept in,1
891,i stayed in the qbic for four nights with my partner and other couples upon arrival the staff were really friendly and accommodating and this continued throughout our stay our room was spotless with interesting trendy decor a comfortable spacious bed and extras like a wardrobe and a safe which came in handy the staff also gave us suggestions for local restaurants and bars things to do and places to visit and arranged a trip to the van gogh museum for us every morning there was a variety of pastries available for all guests free of charge also with unlimited hot drinks which was perfect the staff also put out platters of local food including cheese and pickles some days the location was a five minute walk from amsterdam zuid train station tram and bus station and a local bike hire was less than a five minute walk away too it then took at least minutes to get into the central which was perfect overall this hotel is perfect for couples students and anyone with a low budget looking for good quality and a comfortable stay brilliant value for money,1
892,we arrived on a quiet wednesday to be greeted by a smiley and happy receptionist who was very helpful and informative there is free coffee and tea available all day and a lovely common room to sit in an enjoy your drinks the hotel is directly on top of a metro and tram station with easy access to central amsterdam,1
893,qbic hotel offers a good service and ambience it also offers a good location close to the zuid station and line of the staff in qbic hotel are very recepitve and it was a great time i highly reccomend,1
894,hotel is well situated ideal for using the going downtown personnel is kind and efficientbut rooms are totally unacceptable with bathroom including wc directly open on the bedroom with no door to close you better not be sick or comer for the first time with your new girlfriend a real romantic night killer another inconvenience the bed is close to the wall so impossible for one of the sleepers to get out other than by jumping over the other one hotel maybe ok if you are alone but forget it if you a disappointing run away,0
895,a very nice place to stay more than content very well decorated a very comfortable bed a lovely bathroom although it located a little out of the city it next to a train station so you may reach the center very easy it pretty close to the olympic stadium and me as a greek was really impressed that all the surrounding streets had ancient greek names a quite area though there were enough sites to enjoy cafe or dinner a simple but interesting breakfast lovely stuff nice and international mainly young guests i d certainly come back on my next visit to amsterdam,1
896,we stayed here on our last night in amsterdam because we had a very early train to catch and wanted to be close to the station the check in process was easy no time slot or curfew and the room was clean and modern the staff was friendly and the building was secure they also provided free and very fast wifi the only note in our room there was no bathroom door which we did mind but i know some people might prefer a bit more privacy,1
897,room was really spacious but it was well maintained modern and clean the view from the room over the city was amazing located in the west it a little out of the city centre but very close to the airport will stay here again if i have to,1
898,we stayed here for a wedding we can not recommend the hotel enough clean and modern with helpful we were worried the hotel was too far from the centre but we could not be more wrong the number goes from across the road and you are at dam square within minutes figuring out the tram routes was easy and actually we opted to walk a lot of the time as things are closer than they seem on the roof top bar is amazing with stunning you for a wonderful weekend,1
899,we have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the last few years this ranks with the best of them the positives clean property and room friendly and accommodating staff minute walk to tram to center city walking distance to restaurants about mile large rooms great water pressure in sink and shower good linens the best wifi you ever find in a hotel quick elevators great breakfast on floor with fantastic views of amsterdam on site restaurants on floor though we only ate at the bistro and not the pricey restaurant only negative room lighting is cave like which you wo discover until the sun goes down they really need to add some significant room light is no good at night bottom you have a great night sleep and avoid the masses in center center,1
900,my boyfriend and i stayed here on july the for nights we arrived at the hotel around after getting a taxi from the airport as the shuttle bus was available for another hour or so it was only a minute drive from schipol and only a minute tram ride into the centre so the location was were aware that check in time was so we were expecting a room straight away however when we arrived the receptionist offered us a change of room to one that was already ready but it was a twin instead of a double we thought this was the best option so we took her advice the room was very spacious and modern and the beds were very big and so comfortable they were also pushed together and it was a lovely room to come back to after a long day of walking around the centre of staff were very friendly and keen to meet the needs of their customers they also offer bikes to their customers to rent which was a fantastic idea and cheap for what it was therefore i would definitely recommend to anyone staying to spend the day in rembrandt park just outside of the hotel on these also offer a euro drink voucher to spend in the skybar in exchange for having your room tidied we were interested in having a drink on floor so we were definitely for this offer the bar was very relaxing and they had lots of,1
902,stayed here for three nights last weekend in order to see at the amsterdam arena thousands of fans in the city had pushed the price of hotels up but i d booked this trip back in january so had managed to get a decent hotel provide a shuttle service from the airport you just come out of the arrival hall and find shuttle bus stop the service runs every mins and takes about mins to the in was quick and staff efficient and friendly had brought the wrong plug adaptor with me but the souvenir shop sells them so was able to buy one is in the restaurant on the floor fantastic views and superb choice of food we were offered a discounted rate of euro per person at but didn t think we be eating there so didn t take it up as it was we ended up eating breakfast there on two mornings and enjoyed it full price was euro a couple of taxis on the first night to get into the centre and back they were around euros each time it makes much more sense to buy a travel card again from the souvenir shop and use the trams which run every mins past the end of the road the hotel is on for euro each we got days free travel on trams buses and metro around amsterdam the woman in the shop explained exactly how to use the tickets gave us maps and we had hassle,1
904,stayed here whilst having a weekend in amsterdam celebrating a in was smooth and efficient and the six of couples were given rooms next to each rooms were clean comfortable and well staff were pleasant and bar with fantastic views is worth a i feared we would be too far out of the centre but it proved to be the perfect minutes on the tram from the stop outside the hotel and you in the thick of things but when you done you can leave the madness behind,1
905,could fault this hotel do not listen to the bad reviews roof top bar and restaurant was amazing rooms were decorated lovely and staff were very pleasant tram goes straight into the centre and the stop is right would definitely return all in all it was a great trip,1
906,good hotel in the perfect location with tram stop taking you into amsterdam centre room was very basic and on the small side but was really a problem as we spent the majority of our time exploring amsterdam breakfast is good with a nice selection but the toasters are the worst i ever used staff are mostly good and friendly but some spend way too much time faffing floor bar is very relaxing with some beautiful views over amsterdam both day and night however the staff in this area of the hotel are too slow with their service drinks seem to take forever even in the quietest times but overall pleasant stay very convenient,1
907,very presentable hotel with nice would suggest that the word in the name is misleading as the hotel is a minute tram ride in all a nice clean hotel we booked a couple of breakfasts when we first arrived but after the first we decided we be better off just grabbing a coffee from the in the reception area to be fair it was the first week of the school holidays which made breakfasting a tad manic,1
908,for us this hotel was great lovely location overlooking the park city centre tram stop just walk away big quiet rooms great restaurant with views hotel staff made a birthday stay very special,1
909,the hotel is not close to the center but has a very good connection with dam square using tram the hotel is located in a green area near rembrandt park the services are ok breakfast is fresh and various at the floor with a very nice view over the city i ca say that is a stars hotel but could be a good choose for a crowded city like amsterdam another plus is that the hotel has its own bus to and from the airport taking only min one way road,1
910,this is an excellent hotel quiet in a good position with a great tram service outside of the front door an excellent shuttle service to and from the airport a good reception braeakfast was very good with plenty of choice,1
911,we stayed at this hotel for nights in june from the staff were friendly and helpful when i requested a change of floors just after we checked in it was no trouble at all and was done immediately we used the airport shuttle a free service from the airport to the hotel the hotel is very quiet and the room was comfortable the beds pushed together made enough space to accommodate a child as well we did not eat at he hotel however there is a place in the lobby to buy coffee and a few other things the little shop has tram tickets i spoke to different people there and they were very helpful and friendly the tram stops very close to the hotel a short walk away is mercatorplein a square where you will find restaurants a supermarket bakery and a fruit shop there is also a lovely park right by the hotel where you can walk or cycle altogether a pleasant stay only minutes from the middle of amsterdam,1
912,a very good the room had great standard was clean and had a wonderful view sadly not too friendly staff on the rooftop also its not very far from dam by taxi tram or one of their rental bikes other than that i would def recommend ramada,1
913,the room was clean steday wifi freat th floor and secent breakfast pretty far from the city center but all pales compare to the bed we ordered a double bed and got teo twin beds pushed togeter with a flat twin mattress on each which didnt even fit the bed i dont know how a hotel which respects itself can call this a decent bed i understood that all beds were like this very disappointing,0
915,visited this hotel on a motorcycle as par of a european tour with friends from the us booked for the parking facilities we normally stay closer to the centre and this hotel was perfect tram stop right outside night bus stop outside too if you plan to get back after midnight rooms were spacious and clean floor drinking and dining with far reaching views is spectacular comfy bed great shower nothing not to like about this hotel we did get breakfast here but the stall in the lobby was useful and very reasonably priced for coffee and light breakfast snacks,1
916,location in the heart of amstetdam not to far from dam square at the back of htl theres a tram station only station goes to city cebtre beautiful lobby variety brrakfast menu on floors big room new furnished recommended,1
917,the good hotel is modern with new are access to rembrandt man in the gift shop is very bad despite the name this hotel is not at all central it a min walk to the tram then a minute journey to amsterdam when you include waiting time the centre is minutes area near the hotel feels a bit unsafe i would want to be a lone female near the hotel late at price is too high for the location i could have paid the same and stayed in the breakfast is much too expensive and was much too busy there were always queues for the coffee machines and we had to wait minutes for somewhere to sit can be rude especially the night is no way to have a shower without flooding the bathroom building is ugly it has to be the tallest building in amsterdam and stands out as an eyesore,0
919,this review comes along side my partners and i can not fault this hotel in anyway we are reluctant to visit amsterdam if the ramada has no vacancies available during the time we want to visit it is honestly one of the best hotels me and my partner have visited and can not fault the staff we are hoping to revisit amsterdam in august and are looking to book here again and will only ever stay in this hotel when we visit everyone that visits amsterdam and asks where to stay the ramada is always the first place i suggest the facilities the hotel offers are fantastic and tram which takes you right to the centre in less than minutes is right outside the hotel offers free airport shuttle from airport to hotel and is only euro if you book to take you back at the end of your visit overall this is a hotel you will not regret,1
920,arrived early this morning and we was able to check in early and the staff are excellent very accommodating got are room early which was great but we booked a deluxe room but they are very small clean and high standard just very small sky bar is boss lovely little vibe up there going back up tonight so looking forward to it the room issue is probably me being a snob ha but i like what i hope this helps,1
921,my husband and i made one booking and my friends made a separate booking both for the same type of room at the same time arriving and leaving on the same days we had completely different experiences checking in all of us arrived together as a group my friends did a in at the desk took about my husband were unable to do a pre check in because they could not find our booking when they did eventually find it they did not pre check us in and we had to come back and wait again later complete waste of time also the other couples bags were taken by staff for holding where as my husband and i had to walk down to the basement and do it ourselves why the other couple had service and we did i do on arrival the other couple had water robes chocolate and slippers we had none of these our towels were also not replaced on the second day and when i phoned down for replacements they did answer their phone twice but did tell me it was a service they also had a better view and a bath we had a crack which was glued back into our room door and a separate toilet area within the room we also had a cupboard area tucked into a corner with no light above it our desk light did work and bathroom doors needed you to push your body weight against them as they,0
922,my mum and i visited amsterdam late june and this hotel was perfect for us the hotel is in an old amsterdam style canal house tall and narrow we were on the top floor and we were warned about the steep stairs so we did mind it but if you do have health problems i would recommend a room above the ground floor the view from our room was lovely we could see out over the canal the bed was comfy shower lovely and the décor was fabulously odd and quirky the location was great a short walk from everything it seemed i did overly like the breakfast but then i am not a fan of continental breakfasts personally my mum enjoyed it the staff were very nice as well,1
923,the location first of all was perfect a stone throw from all the local tourist attractions the rooms were very quirky but in a good way for example our room had a basketball hoop which meant for an easy pastime whilst the girlfriend was in the shower only one real problem which was the bed found to be a bit too big often found that the bed was swallowing me up on a couple of nights this flaw really is me being very picky though as overall my experience of max brown was excellent,1
924,we walked into the bar and were warmly greeted by the clerk it the first time i ever checked into the hotel at the bar we were taken to our room up two steep flights of stairs and were pleasantly surprised with the cute decor and deck area outside our room we loved this location close to the train station and within walking distance to many of the places we planned to visit the breakfast was great with many options but it was quite busy and a challenge to not bump into others we would definitely stay here again,1
926,we booked two nights at this place which is located within amsterdam city centre room was small but cute and clean staff was very friendly no air condition but a fan was provided parking in the area is eur per hour,1
929,i honestly can not fault this amazing b b the room that we stayed it was amazing we did upgrade to a bigger room and was worth it the staff are so helpful and polite and could ask for a better place to stay location is also great the breakfast is lovely really ca fault the max brown hotel,1
930,i was very excited when a i booked this hotel and understood it would be small rooms considering it was in an plus old house right on the canal the hotel had great reviews and great photos on arrived late at approx am and given our rooms unfortunately our twin year boys where given a double bed to share when we had requested two singles however we were so tied and hoped this would be rectified in the morning it also did not assist the check in process failed as there was a computer issue and the night staff came to our room at am to say the system is now working and could i pay for the room i would have thought this could have occurred in the morning the morning a spoke to the duty manager and stated i was disappointed about our twin year old boys sharing a small double bed when we requested singles i also stated the rooms were not big enough as the door to the room and bathroom could not even fully open and you had to step over your bags in the room to get in and out of bed basically it is the smallest room i stayed in and i stayed in plenty of small rooms in europe before the photos supplied by the hotel of a small room is misleading if a knew it was so small i would not have booked this hotel the staff member basically stated i,0
931,we found all the staff very helpful and approachable they made a big effort to engage with guests which gave a friendly feel to our stay the breakfast was plentiful and good quality our room was not big but adequate for a night stay very little storage in the room for clothes so only hung up what would crease hotel bar is full of character helped along by the bar man who has a dry sense of humour the central position of the hotel meant we could get to most places easily,1
933,my husband and i took a weekend trip and enjoyed our accommodations very much the room overlooked the hustle and bustle of the street we were able to enjoy the city noise and some fresh air walking distance to all of the attractions min walk to the train station,1
934,this hotel was very well situated it was about a min walk from the train station and close to the canals as well as market square the rooms were comfortable and beautifully decorated every staff member made us feel welcome the breakfast was substantial and delicious the pub restaurant was great for dinner,1
935,we stayed at die port van cleve for nights in one of their superior rooms with beams in the oldest part of the hotel our room was refurbished to a good quality large king size bed excellent linen very modern bathroom with good shower and bath all very clean and well maintained the room was noisy as it looks onto a road at the back of the hotel which is part of the busy canal area with lots of pubs cafes we understand that a central city hotel is likely to be more noisy but suggest that you think about secondary double glazing which would not affect the great character of the original hotel staff are very friendly well trained and nothing was too much trouble the food in the restaurant was delicious on both occasions we dined there and breakfast was a substantial buffet the blauwe bar is a great place for a drink in old amsterdam surroundings and we would definitely recommend the jenever enjoyed our stay here and we will look forward to returning might bring ear plugs to combat the noisy revellers outside at night ha ha would have been a definite star but for that thank you to all at die port van cleve,1
937,excellent location with tram stops right outside the staff were very friendly the rooms a good size clean the breakfasts plentiful and good quality and a great bar on site what more do you need,1
938,we stayed at this hotel with our teenagers in the suites on the top floor with balconies and canal views this was the perfect location situated right on the canal with easy access to the utrechtsestraat where there were many shops and restaurants the location was quiet compared to other parts of the center of the city the beds were very comfy the staff was always helpful the breakfast had a large variety and was fresh each morning the hotel was clean and very well equipped for all of needs we will stay there agin for sure,1
939,we had a big corner room with a nice view over the single canla bit small bath roomthe air condition worked but it was also nice to be able to open the was great with very nice staffsome may think that the design of the room was a bit sterile bit i do care about that,1
940,used this hotel for a week while attending a conference good location close to centre and main railway station but far enough away to avoid traffic and noise friendly and helpful staff nice bright rooms with free wifi and tea making facilities breakfast is as good as one would expect for a tourist hotel of this quality good without being may be access to guard against flooding the entrance is raised above street level and accessible only via a set of fairly steep steps not sure about access,1
942,as soon as we arrived we got a big friendly welcome from sri the other staff helped accommodate our early arrival and set us up in a clean modern room sri convinced us to try the breakfast buffet and we liked it so much we came back times she also helped with giving directions to places not in the tour guides and was a big help the central location was good for our site seeing and we would not hesitate to stay there again,1
943,i just returned from my trip the best thing my husband did was book this property it a two minute walk from dam square basically you in city center the staff is very friendly and efficient we got to the hotel by check in is requested the kind lady at the reception to try and please early check us in and she was soo cordial and nice we got a decent room though they a not too spacious they fit the need i was there for four days and not a single day did i need taxi it very comfortable to walk around to all museums markets shopping and enjoyed my walks up and about in and around my ref light district was a walk away is a lovely city and nh hotel is amazing from a tourists point of view i can say with confidence that this property is the best and a very sensible you nh,1
945,excelent localization very kind and efficent staff but there is no easy acess for disable people in stairs front door the superior room is very small and the chair is very big for that space in general it was great,1
946,when i came back to the room i found that my jean and got stolen they were all brand cloth i informed the front desk but they did do anything and told me to call the police even though they know i had to check out and leave very rude service never again back to this place,0
947,hotel near a spui tram station can reach from amsterdam central about min by tram line sure or mybe then walk about min from behind spui the hotel is comfortable with spacious room for bed and bath is quite large and the view room canal or city the breakfast is good the hotel surrounding by cafe and shop n just a steps from hotel there is kantjil indonesian resto or from back door hotel u can access to amsterdam canal,1
948,though it a four star but there was no sign of welcome rather no doorman to open the door or porter to help u with the luggage and the outside stairs are too broad to pick ur luggage n take it till the standard room category is considered to b the lowest n they treat u as if u they r obligating u to let u rooms r very small and bathroom small in nh collection milan and straight from there came to this nhcity centre hotel which was a terrible feeling after seeing the rooms n the do have any the room was neat n clean the bedsheets ver super white n so were the towels in the honestly i m waiting to go to my next destination a little claustrophobic,0
949,stayed was tiny but well equipped with complimentary nspresso side rooms like overlooks the water is great in heart of of restaurants and hangout places around the hotel,1
950,booked nights in a superior room we were told at check in that the room was not big but had wonderful canal views not big was a gross understatement no bedside tables as there was no room on either side i could not see the tv from my side of the bed as it was tucked away on the only available wall space the bathroom was no better though apparently the bathrobes and slippers that we never use were part of the superior deal on the first day we went out early and came back at to find our room had not been made up we were due out at a restaurant at so it left no time for us to shower and get carefully and do believe the photos shown on the website,0
951,stayed for nights with friends for a city break the hotel is in an excellent location very central with plenty of nice bars and restaurants around the staff were very friendly and efficient breakfast was extremely good buffet style with freshly cooked omelette of your choice even a glass of cava if wanted the downside was the size of our bedroom very small but clean and manageable for a short break no view at all the room our friends occupied next door was bigger with a view i would certainly recommend this hotel for a short thoroughly enjoyed amsterdam the city bus tour and canal trip were excellent although we did enjoy beautiful weather which made a lovely change all in all a really enjoyable stay,1
953,we had to book at nh hotel group after our accommodation cancelled on us at the last minute the hotel was a great choice it is well located with all local attractions an easy walk away it is close to dozens of yummy restaurants and cool bars our room was a little on the small side but bed was comfortable and room was quiet despite the busy street below we would stay here again but would request a bigger room,1
954,great location on canal i had canal side room about minutes from central station so close to station if want to take train or bus to attractive dutch towns like gouda but away from seedier area close to main train station lots of restaurants on spuistraat side of hotel also a fancy food place pretty walk along singel and cafes on singel canal on singel side can walk to a supermarket alfred heijn north to just south of dam square on nieuwezijds voorburgwal or walk south to koningsplein area amsterdam takes farther to walk than you might think because of the canals and while i could walk to some areas personally i found too far to walk to museums but can take a tram easily but i think no where in amsterdam can you walk to everything in walking distance of the leidseplein which is one of the party areas of amsterdam but not so close the noise bothers had been worried because heard so much about noise in amsterdam but not a problem i was on third floor fourth in north american terms on canal side aside from friday and saturday nights between pm and when some noise from canal boats going by quiet both inside and outside the hotel firm had a superior room and fine for one person but would be small for persons desk tv refrigerator but only one desk chair and one sitting footstool had twin beds so obviously for two people i used the,1
956,we decided to take a last minute weekend away to amsterdam and booked a suite here the staff was super friendly and the suite was great the room was clean with a view on the canal behind the hotel the bed was super comfortable and we had a great night s rest there would book again,1
957,lovely tragic i decided stay at this hotel because i saw it on tripadvisor this hotel nicely in front of the river and i booked with my travel agent planning for staying when i got there they said i couldnt get the river view room cos it fully booked and theres no view for the street view either so really disappointed okay let start from the entrance there a stair at the entrance quite have to pass the stairs if you want to go to the hotel you have to think twice if you alone and bring so many luggage you get the trouble and theres no staff to help you bring the luggage first got room number i really would not recommend you to stay at this same floor with the receptionist theres a stair in the middle of hallway are u kidding me no way if you bring big luggage you be in trouble especially if you old no view at all the room exactly the end of the corner kind of spooky theres a noise like a wind blows or the blower of air conditioner i dont know sure but kind of annoying something trouble with the parquette in the front of the bathroom becareful for the door stopper often bumped to it not really not worth it for the price if u stay in this room really disappointed the next day we move to room number more better but still no view only view for another,0
958,hotel is nice location is great breakfast buffet is nice and diverse sri yes as the iphone lady is super nice and helpful she works at the restaurant staff is generally nice and cooperative and friendly but the single room is really small narrow and rectangular the bathroom is really small and in a corner so if u open its door it blocks the tv this is how the room is narrow also has a shallow bath tub so the room does match the rest of the has good security measures the elevator does work unless u have your room card,1
959,great location rooms overlook singel canal modern great location just off the busy central town many restaurants and bakeries close by easy walk to flower market and museums try the pancakes they make an excellent lunch,1
960,three sisters shared a triple room in this hotel the hotel is in a fantastic location it is in the canal ring and on a street with many restaurants cafes and near everything all sites are within walking rooms in nh style are sparsely decorated but very clean and very breakfast is excellent and the staff at the front desk are very friendly and very helpful this is a really great choice for a hotel in the city,1
961,i would strongly recommend the hotel nh city center amsterdam the receptionists are very kind and welcoming and answer every question with a broad smile the rooms are spacious comfortable and extremely clean great breakfast there is a wide range of food and options and everything is fresh the price is good but the most important thing is amazing location very close to dam square walking distance to any site and we did not need any public transport,1
962,a nice hotel located within walking distance to shops bars local sights the room was clean a reasonable size and the bed comfortable staff were helpful with advice maps etc the only downside was a flight of stairs up to the lobby which is difficult with luggage and no porters to assist,1
963,my mum and i spent a few nights in the inntel when we were in amsterdam and we were very pleased with the location and the quality of the rooms i was disappointed that there were no biscuits or treats in the rooms except ones to be purchased at extortionate prices but i think this tradition may be more uk than european we chose to just have our room and got our breakfast each morning at a lovely little cafe on the corner it was a cheaper and healthier option,1
964,this hotel has a good locationif you come with your own car do not put the hoteladress in your gpsbut the the intersection road nieuwezijds from thehotel is a parking garageour room was with modern furniture small but clean bathroom quietvery good ac coffeemakerhelpful staffgood pricethe restaurant la colina in the same street and the italian restaurant belong togethergood wine by the glass spagetti alio olio perfect,1
965,i can under stand when hotels get busy that you need to wait but when people who are booked in advance at least groups by my count are told to wait some over an hour while off the street are checked in well that is clearly all their rooms became available at once so clearly there is no coordination between and front desk they could have avoided the problem by having housekeeping release the rooms for check in one by their systems are more important than the a pleasant stay,0
967,spent nights here in august most aspects were good the room and bathroom were clean and tidy the staff were welcoming the breakfast we ordered to our room was fantastic couple of things could have been better the room was not ready until despite check in being at and after a very early start this was frustrating the shower in the room could maintain its temperature and kept giving flashes of hot and cold this was at all times of the day as well on the plus side i asked the front desk for flowers for my fiancée birthday when i let them know they had not arrived they were good enough to bring them up straight away with complimentary champagne all in all good quality and a lovely stay,1
968,first time staying in this hotel and i could fault it room was excellent maid service was great room always kept tidy cups washed towels changed as i have stayed in a few hotels in amsterdam and sometimes this is not done staff were always friendly and helpful wished us good morning or evening whenever we passed reception room was a good size do know what some people were looking for when they say rooms were small excellent location for everything hopefully we will get the chance to stay here again,1
969,just spent nights easy walking distance of the train station this is like a tardis in that they have many more rooms than you expect even extending into the next building the room was clean and well maintained though this bathroom only had a water pipe to the waterfall shower it did have a normal shower head but you had to that pipe most hotels allow you to have both without resorting to messing with any pipes i do know whether this is a new policy to save some money or somehow that pipe got would recommend the hotel,1
971,service was great buffet was great room was spacious and the staff extremely helpful highly recommend staying here the location is fantastic with numerous restaurants at the front door and a tram stop mere meters from the front door also all for a reasonable price the only slight on the place is the lack of air conditioning but the air conditioning that spills in from the hallways is enough to keep the rooms at a comfortable temperature highly recommend you wo regret it,1
973,please save yourself the heartache we endured avoid this hotel and hotel our sons birthday large amount of money our account before visiting amd did not return to us until a week after our help no apology simply did not care,0
975,i brought by boyfriend to amsterdam to ask him to marry me this brilliant hotel after hearing what i was visiting amsterdam for upgraded our room free of charge all of the staff were polite and attentive the room was clean and smart the bed was gloriously comfortable and even though we were on the floor facing the street it was noisy at all this hotel helped make my special occasion extraordinary for the location the price is perfectly reasonable i will be staying here again,1
977,we found the location excellent staff very pleasant and always helpful facilities very good beds comfortable air conditioning good pleasant sounds from the clock tower on dam square breakfast varied and plentiful staff very helpful when there was a need to photocopy boarding pass for airport assistance overall a pleasant stay at inntel hotel amsterdam central,1
978,we visit inntel back in march when we visited amsterdam to celebrate our engagement having visited amsterdam a few times and always being less than impressed with our accommodation we thought we would give inntel a try we were blown away by the excellent level of customer service we received from all the staff checking in and out was painless and they could be more helpful when we had to leave our bags there for a short while the room is a very good size like i said i have visited a few different hotels and the rooms have been tiny but at inntel there is plenty of space around the bed and the desk and seating area is a nice touch i also love that they have baths after a day walking round amsterdam my legs are always in a sorry state so love having a relaxing bath we did not eat at the hotel but the food looked and smelt amazing we enjoyed our visit so much that we are returning next weekend for my birthday and have convinced my dad to take my mum away to amsterdam and stay with you in september i am looking forward to returning,1
979,this hotel was really comfortable located in the centre of amsterdam just minutes walk from the train station the room was comfortable and provided with kettle tea and coffee making facilities hairdryer fridge with mini bar and a small snacks basket it was a good area for restaurants and bars and was close to the red light district the staff were also very helpful there is a breakfast service available in the morning room but it is just as nice to eat elsewhere,1
980,the hotel is well located for transport attractions shops you can either walk or use the trams to get to most of amsterdam the rooms are clean and the staff are friendly and extremely helpful the hotel offers the opportunity to purchase tickets to local from the reception desk which can be added too your hotel bill,1
981,excellent location mins walk from amsterdam centraal station had a really comfy big bed and very clean well stocked expensive minibar do bother with breakfast though very expensive and you can eat anywhere nearby for a fraction of the very helpful when we needed to check in for our flight and print our boarding passes tourist information guy we found was that helpful as his english was great,1
982,the best of this hotel is two thing is clean comfortable and at the train station if visiting the place on summer time r vacation is great you can easily rent a bike is much cheaper and nicer than others like clink nord which is well located but much worse rooms,1
983,the location of this hostel is really convenient right next to a major train station there is also a large common area for lounging the rooms can be a bit difficult to handle with so many people assigned to one bathroom but it manageable,1
985,was expecting a holiday inn to be so nice really clean and great for the money we got a standard double for with free breakfast although the breakfast was a bit disappointing room was big and bathroom really posh great shower which was also really clean taxi back from the local red light district and coffee shops was euros though so get a bus or tram instead it only miles,1
988,excellant hotel close to metro and main line station mins away breakfast good only point is that their is no safe in the room but can use one down at reception which is free of charge breakfast is continental style lida,1
990,floor hotel with lifts our room was on the floor and huge very nice and comfortable the room was surrounded with windows on two sides with blackout curtains tv was inch samsung with satellite tv with english language channels including bbc sadly no itv or channel but plenty of music channels room had air conditioning which was very easy to had a large shower sink and toilet very nice towels but no complimentary toiletries here visited our room daily and made the bed cleaned up kettle and a few teabags coffee and creamer and sugar provided replenished the whole a hotel worthy of its stars although we had to dine in the restaurant of the sister hotel holiday inn for our evening meal reasonably priced dine for euros and we had steak ha ha were provided in the breakfast room on the floor alongside reception on initial entry to the building via the erratic revolving doors you will be in the main hotel with the reception for holiday inn only in front of you the reception for holiday inn express can be found by going through the doors to the immediate left of the foyer and taking one of the lifts to the floor where you wil find holiday inn express,1
991,this is a great place to stay clean clear comfy unfortunately meals can not be charge to room invoice as the most of the hotels of this category and the personnel could send the invoice by email probably more training be required or the system has the features always details matters,1
992,we stayed at this hotel while on business trip coupled with pleasure we found excellent facilities at this hotel staff was very cordial friendly rooms are quite spacious with good quality beds liked the breakfast which was quite wholesome,1
993,great hotel with a very nice restaurant the breakfast had an excellent range of cereals bread buns fruit and pastries the meals in the restaurant were well priced and the servings were quite generous the hotel is a minute walk to the station and the city centre is a minute ride away the staff members could have been more helpful and always eager to help with tourist information,1
994,we stayed for one night our last night in the netherlands we were very satisfied with everything the hotel and the room family room very friendly staff and nice breakfast the hotel is near a train station and very short from the airport and central by train,1
995,i stayed here for four nights over the period the hotel was very accessible from the airport via train on my arrival the staff were very friendly and just what i needed after my hour flight the room is small however i did spend much time in there anyway great shower pressure and temperature and the wifi was excellent there are not a lot of eateries in the immediate area however they are just a train tram or bus away would stay here again,1
996,the location of the hotel is one train away from amsterdam central which is essential i paid for a day transport pass to get to central amsterdam and surrounding areas i brought this from reception the hotel is clean friendly and has positive vibes i yet to see the place quiet which is surely a good thing right would definitely recommend,1
997,i really enjoy the time in meininger it very well organized rooms are very good clean comfortable i always try to find a meininger hostel when i travel i really recommend it it very good one,1
999,stayed here for a base to tour amsterdam just three stops in the train from airport and hotel right beside the sloterdjik station then it one stop to amsterdam is a guest kitchen and you can have the self catering option if travelling on a very busy hotel with a lot of groups of young are toys in the foyer and the staff very helpful one helped us order a taxi bus to travel to our next destination and was able to translate,1
1000,we have just returned from our day trip to amsterdam and have to say i recommend anyone visiting in a group to stay here it located in the business district of amsterdam in sloterdijk so not in the center however it a stop train ride from amsterdam centrum and stop from the airport so extremely convenient they have very flexible room options we were a group of so had x bed rooms which did feel cramp at all we stayed on a b b deal and although the breakfast was the best it was perfectly adequate for our requirements definitely a great option if you want slightly more affordable accommodation than in the city center,1
1003,such a good place with very good location very near to station and suprisingly this hotel have an open kitchen that we can cook by ourself and there is a refrigerator to put our food but beware i put my breakfast of chicken and box of friedrice and the next day my chicken is dissapear and hey have coin laundry too,1
1004,this is good hotel out of town but near the very impressive public transport the hotel has great staff always helpful tonight the meal was served by two exceptional members of staff mayra and giulia just brilliant the restaurant has good food and good service,1
1005,rooms are great even cooled before arrival on warm in the restaurant is fast correct and friendly special thanks to mayramenu is ok but for regular visitors a bit more variation would be welcome,1
1006,usual holiday inn clean quiet rooms and good customer service large car park and very close to the metro stops away from amsterdam central station which takes about minutes restaurant has ambience and the dutch beer was cold i can not fault this hotel in anyway,1
1007,absolutely recommend this place very comfortable beds and so very quiet staff are great and very helpful great location and really nothing to fault please try their burger my husband is a chef and makes a great burger himself but this was one great burger,1
1008,spent nights on vacation arrived early at and got a room with upgrade at were lucky front desk was excellent at getting within minutes room was very clean reasonable size safe was too small for our laptop breakfast was great but had to wait most days for the chef to either show up or get started making egg based dishes we were shocked to see so much litter and graffiti on the streets of ams early sunday it was everywhere within half mile radius of the and probably all ams small groups of loud voiced apparent african immigrants were on some street corners we did not see very many muslim women in their tent like costumes however the litter had been all cleaned up by noon found a great breakfast place next to the flower market about a min walk from the hotel sunday at overall the area was great,1
1009,we are three sisters who stayed at the raddison blu for a few days following a tour of spain and portugal we could not have chosen a more convenient location within walking distance of museums attractions marvellous restaurants and a fantastic deli location location and location we had a suite which allowed the three of us to stay in comfort with lots of space had wonderful meals in both the restaurant and bar and have to give a shout out to their staff who in all departments were so pleasant to deal with totally recommend this hotel to all,1
1011,a wonderful hotel with the best location close to dam square spacious rooms and a very kind staff breakfast consists of a generous buffet including variety of breads vegetables fruit cheese sausage cereal and more omelettes cooked to perfection,1
1012,very good hotel close to the center of amsterdam with larger than normal room size for europe bar and breakfast service were great we also had dinner at the bar and that was also great people were very friendly we also use the concierge who was a great help for directions and a taxi to the airport,1
1013,good location and very friendly staff they have a restaurant and a bar the lobby was inviting and nice to sit in the price was good and the room was very nice we were able to store our luggage since we arrived very early from a cruise the room was ready when promised,1
1014,nice comfortable hotel we had rooms facing the street but it was still quiet note that some rooms do not have exterior windows but are located within the building the bar is the best part of the hotel great drinks and service good breakfast selection easy walking distance to shops etc,1
1015,very well located hotel near the center when we arrived we were offered an upgrade we accepted and the hotel room was outstanding one of the best hotels i have stayed in very good breakfast buffet friendly and helpful staff both at the reception and at the breakfast buffet,1
1016,location great proximity to the station as advertised we used the shuttle multiple times to commute to the hotel and to the city it was easy but about a minute ride just as others said staff very nice upon check in we received an upgrade to business class bar staff exceeded our expectations room our room was spacious and the ac worked nicely especially compared to other european hotels we received one free water in our room upon check in iron blow drier and mini bar i have two complaints with the room though there were hairs that were not mine on both the coffee mugs which made me question the cleanliness of our room the bathroom seemed clean though also the pillows and bed were not to my liking i guess you have that from time to time so i did dock them for that hotel nice property with updated decor hotel is surrounded by some businesses but not too much else around gym the gym was amazing in my opinion one of the best gyms that i have seen when traveling they have just about anything you could want there spin bikes punching bag yoga classes etc they also have a sauna which was nice and appeared to be clean other items you can rent bikes on site if you want to go into the city after check in i recommend asking for another shuttle voucher take the shuttle back to the train station and then take the,1
1017,really nice clean close to the center but little old i expected more it was a very expensive hotel it could have given more things to the are supposed to pay euros to use the gym so sad,1
1018,very nice hotel great service but slightly uncomfortable mattress would have preferred a room with a view the lobby area was very nice and well designed rooms were spacious would have preferred a gym or swimming pool,1
1019,we stayed for a long weekend in in a junior suite which was well appointed our only complaint is that the air con would not go below our room overlooked the atrium so if we opened the windows it was very noisy for any voices echo in the space a man came to try to fix the air con but failed the weather was not hot when we were staying weeks ago but due to he air con problem we were too hot and uncomfortable at night i note this has been a complaint of others guests and management need to sort this have given a star recommendation as the location is great the room was otherwise good and above all all the staff were most particularly want to highlight that upon our departure i left a purse containing uk sterling in our room when i got home i realised my loss and rang the hotel the room attendant had found the purse and it was returned to me intact free of charge i have written to the room attendant to thank her for her honesty apart from the problems i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel,1
1020,very nice hotel great location to access many places in a minute walk very friendly staff who provided us a city map to help us find where we were going and stored our bags for free before check in they also left a special note in our room as we were celebrating our honeymoon the breakfast also had a delicious variety of food,1
1021,i can not say enough good things about the superior service we received at this fine hotel in amsterdam conveniently located to major attractions and in both the public areas and the rooms i highly recommend this hotel and the staff go out of their way to accommodate all your needs and wishes as i said in my title superior service with a smile,1
1022,the hotel is very well situated the room was nice and simple with a big smart tv and the staff was great however i was disappointed with my poor late night dinner ordered some pasta with tomato sauce but they tasted really bad,1
1023,this a really clean hotel ideally situated in the centre of the city it is in a quiet area but you can be in the buzz of the city in a few minutes all mayor attractions can be reached by walking or public transport is very efficient but be aware a deposit of per room per night is taken for incidentals this is returned to your account at are very clean and of a good size beds are comfortable and the air con works well without being too noisy the showers are powerful and the which charges typically exorbitant bar area is quirky and cosy there seems a lack of general seating areas so look out for the tables up the stairs above reception it a very pleasant area to watch the world go is very efficient with good download speeds as with all amsterdam buildings watch out for the step when entering different rooms overall we had a very pleasant stay at radisson blu it an ideal location for a short break and we would definitely visit again,1
1024,lovely clean room we upgraded as arrived early paid an extra euro which included breakfast which was mainly continental with bit of bacon and chicken sausage not worth paying for in my view but was nice and the restaurant was lovely and waitresses were too in my view almost for two nights was great value but my partner picked and all in all was nice stay anyone going amsterdam seriously watch out for bikes keep your wits about you,1
1026,we spent one night at the radisson before boarding our cruise ship nice hotel and very friendly staff i not wild about the location it a pretty dirty neighborhood the hotel is fairly quiet although we were there on a friday night and there was lots going on i would recommend it,1
1027,i initially just booked a day room here but ended up extending my stay over night just because i was so happy here there were some great deals for room service see the special staff were kind and very helpful tv in the room supports apple airplay and steaming from windows laptops which i found very useful will come again,1
1028,our room was an excellent size with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom wifi worked well the whole also had the breakfast package which was worth it they provide excellent selections from to selections you can have made to order eggs or waffles as well definitely have to fresh squeezed orange juice to top it off the gym was clean and provided enough equipment the location was an easy walk to some main neighborhoods and attractions for example the rembrandt house if you need to park be sure to reserve a spot ahead of time,1
1029,very nice hotel well located clean serious with a very good breakfast no negative point i saw that amsterdam is quite expensive in terms of hotels during summer radisson blu is a good compromise quality price you can go for it will not regret it,1
1030,the radisson blu hotel is a great place to stay centrally located and close to everything the room was very clean and a good size room to move the bed very comfortable and a good sized bathroom the hotel has fast internet it is in a quiet location and public transport is only a to minute walk the location is perfect min walk to the museums minute walk to the central train station with shops cafes and bars everywhere hotel bike hire or a minute walk to damstraat bike hire hotel staff were happy and very helpful recommended,1
1031,great hotel perfect location close to everything rooms are great and clean the beds are very comfy hotel staff are very helpful and always go out of their way to help you i highly recommend staying here,1
1032,you can now stop looking for a hotel in amsterdam this property was clean the staff was wonderful the internet was reliable the food was excellent the location is fantastic the air conditioning was perfect the entire experience was lovely,1
1033,a good minute walk from train station good location for sightseeing room was clean and reasonable size nice bathroom and well equipped would have benefited from full size mirror in the room was slightly annoyed that the mini bar was not fully stocked on arrival and there was a charge against the room for missing refreshments reception were happy to resolve once reported room service was friendly and food was good,1
1034,we stayed for three nights in a standard room on a basis on the receptionist said i can offer you an upgrade which would include free breakfasts and a canal view my first thought was that this offer was a free upgrade but it transpired that this was not the case at all and we would have to pay a not inconsiderable supplement for the privilege needless to say we declined her offer the room itself was excellent quite modern furnishings spotlessly clean with all necessary amenities there was no outside view but we did have a window overlooking the main atrium the hotel itself is very central and within easy walking distance of the central station shopping areas and museum quarter we only had one main meal in the hotel bar and this was also of excellent quality the staff were all unfailingly pleasant and eager to than the cost of breakfasts which we had to avoid as even a continental breakfast would have cost us almost euros we would thoroughly recommend this hotel as an ideal base in amsterdam,1
1035,first the location ca beat it just seconds from red light district and a short stroll to damstraat and all the restaurants and shops second the hotel itself is a nice quirky assembly of various buildings straddling across a street with connection underground given the structural limitations there an unusual amount of twists and turns before i could reach my room but it does lend some character to the property third my room and the bathroom were surprisingly large for amsterdam though it faced just a back with no view to speak of but it was nicely appointed so no complaints fourth the breakfast was alright decent spread though not cheap certainly enough to set me off for the day of meetings and travels all in all good value for money with quick efficient service will book this place again on my next trip business or personal,1
1036,we loved staying at this radisson blu and would do so our room was not ready when we arrived hours completely understandable our luggage was safely stored and we took the time to walk to the jordaan district where we paused at a pub for a coffee and a bite to eat apple pie was awesome wandered back through the nine streets admiring the local we returned to the hotel about hours our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a fabulous business class the next few days we found it quite convenient to walk from the hotel to all major attractions including major museums the train station canal tour boats the list goes on and staff was friendly helpful and professional the restaurant and bar were good the breakfast buffet is excellent our advice skip pancakes go for the local smoked did not use the fitness facilities because we did not want to pay the small extra fee,1
1037,great hotel in a great location friendly helpful staff delicious breakfast good sized room with modern amenities single sink terrible beds they need to replace them asap other than that it good value for the money,1
1038,the first thing i noticed was that the actual hotel building we were staying in is not the one shown on the website the hotel reception is in a separate building down the sidestreet and across the road once inside the hotel it has a crowded feeling mainly because it is used by so many tour groups and there always seem to be people milling around having said that we were quickly checked in there is a mezanine level above reception which is airy as it is like a central courtyard we had a free upgrade to a business class room that was comfortable and in the corner of the hotel we only had breakfast in the hotel but that offered a wide selection of food and was always hotel is located in a good position centrally between the old town red light district and the national palace,1
1040,radisson bue amsterdam is all about location location location the hotel itself might not be anything special however if you wan na stay in the center of the city this is the hotel you should choose you can easily walk to most places in the center in just rooms are large and well equipped with bathtub nespresso maschine and so on a nice feature is the minibar which actually has a dedicated shelf to your own cans and bottles i really like this since the minibar prices are quite expensive and there and there is a kiosk right opposite the hotel our stay included breakfast which was nice but nothing to write home about orange juice was served in small shots glasses which i reallly dont like why not just serve it in a normal glass would i stay here again i depends on the price to be honest we booked through amoma who had a good offer but otherwise the hotel seems quite expensive,1
1041,this is a traveler airport hotel shuttle bus to airport is availablenice breakfast but small roomshotel reception staff is only one by the evening time so if you need somthing you should pick it yourself,1
1042,stayed here during gay pride weekend and although other places in town were partying pretty hard the location was just perfect in a quiet side street location is a huge plus with the red light district tram access restaurants less than minutes walk canals are right there with even a star michelin restaurant bridges just behind the hotel maybe a five minute or so walk the pastorie bar has great ambiance and the de palmboom restaurant was not bad at all heck even the rusland coffeeshop which i think is the first coffeeshop to become legal in the netherlands is smack right across the street i had an upper floor room with a view of the street in the main building now i saw the reviews of the inner rooms with atrium views in the main building and i guess it a preference at the end of the day i mean in the winter time the sun does shine much so it is what it is the staff was very kind and helpful aiding us to the best vantage points to watch the canal parade thanks for that i spent a special day in the hotel and i thank the management for acknowledging that thanks marjo for making so pleasant will definitely be back,1
1043,great hotel for a trip to amsterdam it is located on the tram route with a stop right outside the door number the room was large clean and comfortable and the bed really comfy breakfast is the usual buffet style but had just about everything you could want including freshly made pancakes and waffles the best aspect of this hotel was the staff very friendly helpful and a real credit to the hotel i would heartily recommend the golden tulip to anyone and would definitely go again,1
1044,being greeted by a computer rather than a person was something new for me and i have to say that i did really like it particularly when i came to and i found that computer had charged me for four breakfasts instead of two something to do with single occupancy of a double room i gather or at least that was what i was told by a friendly human who had to sort out the muddle the computer had caused other thing was the this was not working when i arrived at the hotel which was pretty irritating as i had work to do i called down to reception no answer after calling twice and allowing to ring for in excess of minutes each time i went down to reception to find one poor member of staff trying to deal with about no etc feeling it was a bit unfair to burden her with more issues i asked to speak to the manager and was told that there was no manager available furthermore the hotel had no idea when the would be working again and apparently the service was nothing to do with the hotel anyway as it was provided by a and was a service that the hotel could choose whether to provide or not which i disputed as the hotel advertises free and i would have stayed there if it did have it above rather marred my visit which was a shame as otherwise the hotel and staff,0
1045,we had a lovely time at the hotel and in the city the hotel is finished to a very good modern standard and the staff were very accommodating and professional only downsides were the lack of a alcohol licence not a deal breaker and the fact it was either trams or a taxi to the centre,1
1046,having booked a one week for a tour we decided to start and finish our holiday with three extra days in amsterdam the six days enabled us to visit the many places of location was one tram stop from sloterdijk station which made our journey to a and from the airport easy the tram stop outside the hotel also made our visits into the city easy we were so pleased with our room that we asked for the same room for our second stay the breakfast was the best we have ever experienced in all our travels it had all choices imaginable and such friendly helpful staff we also found the staff on the reception desk could not have been more helpful and forthcoming with useful information,1
1047,the hotel is a couple of miles out of town but very easily accessible with the tram located just outside download the tram app for really clear directions based on where you are wanting to go modern hotel very friendly and helpful staff comfortable beds plenty of information and discounts in the lobby for use in and around amsterdam and a very quiet and peaceful tickets are sold in the vending machine in the lobby which was very selection was one of the best in house and free ones i was clean stylish and modern air conditioned rooms we were able to check in early at no extra cost i really liked the style check in very simple to use but staff on hand to help though we did make use of it i love the tiered approach to checking out at an hour up to although a little further out of the centre of amsterdam i would recommend this hotel and would happily return,1
1048,stayed here earlier this year with my wife and the room and facilities were wonderful the location was the best but the price made up for it and my wife loved the bathroom everything was clean and comfortable what more could you ask for,1
1049,staff on reception were so friendly room was beautiful and clean and modern we did spend much time in the room but no complaints atall bed was comfy amazing shower fab decor tram stopped right outside staff at reception advised which tram number to get to certain places and had a slip of paper with details on would definitely stay again,1
1050,i stayed here with my girlfriend for nights in july it is a beautiful hotel with very friendly staff willing to help you with anything the tram to the main city stops right outside the hotel also the restaurant service is slow however we were told they were very busy even though they had tables the hotel does sell alcohol which was a problem for us but might be to other people i would strongly recommend this hotel for couples and people looking for a quiet break,1
1051,contrary to some of the reviews the desk had someone ready to assist hours a day the hotel is partially automated but anyone can get help if stuck the room was big with lots of toiletries i found the desk extremely friendly the breakfast was big but at euro not sure the hotel had parking which was a huge bonus the tram stops at the door taking you close to the centrum the only drawback you ca walk to the centrum it a bit far,1
1052,the staff were extremely helpful and professional we arrived early in the morning after a long flight many hours before normal time with small children the front of house staff immediately found us a family room for which we were very appreciative,1
1054,stayed in this hotel a couple of times amazing value for money rooms are spacious and bright we had breakfast in the hotel daily and the amount of selection was unreal highly recommend to stay for breakfast best you will get in amsterdam we also had dinner on one occasion which was also fantastic staff are very attentive and helpful the hotel is tram stops away from city centre really easy to get to though from outside of the hotel you save a lot of money staying in this hotel than you would in the city centre even though you have to travel it is definitely worth it,1
1055,the hotel was very nice and convenient we had a room for three people and it was large and with two double beds in its nice bath coffee machine and its location was only one tram to the attractions of amsterdam,1
1056,very clean excellent and helpful staff assisted with tram info helped in securing cab at the right time and the right size to transport persons with large luggage requirements were able to change room requirements at the last minute,1
1057,the only negative i have is that the room smelt slightly on arrival but opened window and was ok after an hour the staff were friendly and helpful on arrival and checking in and out was easy and left luggage there when checked out as we had late flight was nice size and bathroom was clean and big location is good tram was immediately outside we got off at overtoon and walked to the centre we found from the centre it was easier to train to sloterdikt then tram was just stop from there to hotel on way back we bought a day pass which allowed travel on all buses trams and trams for euro each everything was easy to reach from hotel we had no problems with any of the transport would go back to this hotel when i first was trying to book i wanted something more central but now i been there i not sure i would want to stay any nearer the mayhem lol,1
1058,great hotel and their employees were awesome very reasonable and breakfast buffet was delicious quite a decent location tram was right in front it was clean and what a snap to check in very for check in,1
1059,speedy and helpful check iin underground parking facility ease of getting into the centre of amsterdam by tram i was woken up several times by other room doors sized room and bathroom,1
1060,we visit this hotel for nights in july we book room for people beds the room was big and very clean breakfast was rich and the transportation to the city center is very easy out side of the hotel there is tram station witch take you to city centerwe arrive very late at night minutes by taxi from the air port cost about in was fast and easy altheas it was very late at night amalthough its locate out side of city center its very good value for mony,1
1061,the cleanliness and service of this hotel is awesome we stayed at room the room beside the elevators you could hear some noice but not that much the curtains could have closed the window much more better perhaps an idea to use some rollerblinds in between the curtains and the window,1
1062,loved our stay last visit years ago was great so stayed there again the hotel has been massively upgraded from checkin rooms and concierge services plainly written stay there if you want a great hotel that is convenient to downtown and the airport the buffet was extra but for euros i skipped lunch for any return visit definite hotel book early since it was close to full,1
1063,we stayed here are a couple in november the location is not the best but the tramstop right outside the hotel makes it very easy to get in and out of the city we stayed in a double room but did not have a double bed instead it was singles pushed together the facilities in the room were very good bathroom was excellent overall very good hotel,1
1064,i ca complain about the location of the hotel and the size of the room but the cleaning service is very poor and our bed we were staying in a room smelled strongly like cigarettes it took days to have the issue resolved but the bathroom and the main room were never cleaned properly during our stay furthermore the price for breakfast is euros per person which is quite expensive especially if you traveling with your family,0
1065,even though this hotel is in the center of the city it is conveniently located across from a tram stop and has professional and friendly staff the rooms were very comfortable and the food including delivery to our room was great i definitely stay here again well worth it,1
1066,stayed here with a group of friends and the first time in west amsterdam near sloterdijk the rooms were nice and clean and beds were comfortable there is making facilities in the room itself which was ok the room has a safe which is free to staff were friendly and welcoming and there were no issues during my is a nice cafe which is situated just over the road from the hotel where you can buy a beer or have some hot food staff are very friendly and the prices are transport links from the hotel are good and go to most places as long as you know the route you need to take to get to wherever you going google maps is a good app to have as you can enter where you want to go and it will help you with which type of transport would be better for you to had the breakfast on the last day in the morning and you pay a set price the food is good and you will find something to your liking there is no limit to how much you can eat in the one sitting so an endless supply of coffee and tea was a plus for would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future,1
1067,excellent service and position in the city amazing room and people who are always on fire for us my girlfiend and me had appreciated this trip in your hotel and i recommend it for everyone who wants to do a citytrip in amsterdam,1
1068,very helpful and friendly reception staff vey convenient for travelling into centre tram stops outside the hotel underground car park is very convenient and well priced hotel was very clean and well organised,1
1069,non smoking hotel but allowed to smoke outside lobby greeted by very friendly staff clean lift bar unfortunately but that a good thing in a way about minutes cab ride away from dam square also excellent bedroom and even more so showers,1
1070,our stay was really confortable and pleasant tasteful the breakfast and rooms qiet clean appreciate too the nearness of the tram all perfect and with nespresso machine i enjoyed so much,1
1071,polite friendly and helpful staff good computer facilities mostly everything really could have done better regarding fixing room problems the safe in the room did work did get fixed despite us reporting it within an hour of there would have given stars otherwise,1
1072,the hotel is well kept and staff are very friendly and helpful it close enough to the airport like most things it just a tram ride away it tram rides away from central amsterdam and there is a tram stop outside the hotel the hotel has a strict no and no alcohol policy i was disapointed that i could not buy an alcoholic drink after hours of travel the mini bar in the bedroom is switched off so you can only drink the tea or coffee left in your room however there is room service and non alcoholic drinks can be bought from vending machines in reception or the bar the room was a nice standard and the bathroom is very nice you get a nice little selection of shampoo etc so do worry about bringing your own a good place to stay if you want to be away from the city centre,1
1073,when we arrived on both occasions staff were friendly and helpful we appreciated being able to check in slightly early due to our room being catch tram at front of welled attired spacious and definitely stay there again,1
1074,spent three nights at hotel which had very clean and generous sized rooms location is minute train ride from attractions but the train is right out front one great hotel amenity is on premise parking which is rare and even rarer is the nightly rate of euros on the downside hotel has a bar but no alcohol and only offered stay if had small children but if older that would look to stay closer to all the action,1
1075,and clean rooms with espresso machine away from the chaos of dam square but a convenient tram stop in front of hotel ride to the helpful and friendly staff thank you,1
1076,this hotel is fantastic if your going to amsterdam it a must it a bit far out of the centre it takes about minutes on the tram but the tram stop is outside the door really ca complain staff are also really nice,1
1077,stayed here one night for business purpose the hotel is quite big with a nice entrance the room was big situated on the ground floor very clean also the bathroom i did not have time to have breakfast but the staff was friendly enough to offer silverware in the middle of the night i ordered late night kebab it is a min walk from sloterdijk train station where you can be in min in amsterdam central station the hotel has a tram stop right in front of the entrance so very easy to reach by public transport even though it was a very brief visit i can recommended this hotel to anyone for a comfortable sleep,1
1078,we specifically requested a quiet room and were place on the story in the back with a lovely view of a green courtyard our concierge told us the building was originally a hospital there rooms are not huge but have plenty of room and are well organized with which made it easy to unpack we enjoyed not being in the center of the city and being near a lovely park the tram stops are only block away and so it was super easy to travel any place within the city the staff ar very friendly and helpful they seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your stay,1
1079,the receptionist was nice and friendly my room was on the ground floor and facing the street so we can hear footsteps and pedestrians talking outside it did bother me much because i a heavy sleeper the area around the hotel is pretty convenient to find places to eat drink and smoke there also some convenience shop and a laundry right across the got the room for pax and the size of the room was huge i love the decor the bed was comfortable there was no bathtub though only shower there a mini fridge which i like although was not stocked with beverages only one mineral i enjoyed my stay the location is slightly out of the central part of the city but i kinda like that as the atmosphere is more it not too far away though and you can easily get around from here because the tram stops just in front of the hotel,1
1080,in my opinion if a hotel is clean and has the amenities i need i am happy after that it comes down to the staff i cant say enough positive things about the staff they went out of their way to make sure all of my questions were answered whether it was about area attractions or how to get from place to were wonderful,1
1081,hop in the balcony for a good joint even if the rooms are smokers free the balcony allowed fresh air and a good view requested flowers for my fiancee on the bed and it was like i imagined i wanted the best for her and hampshire manor proved me right we had an amazing stay with help at service just excellent the front office was quite polite with meno the tall guy who is indeed very nice and the chinese guy who always smile that how a reception should be but i feel sad that the ladies at the reception were at the hotel level else everything was just right,1
1082,checked in july checked out july hotel is nice and staff are very friendly and helpful tram is right outside to take to city centre very easy and fast bathroom shower was a bit annoying as water leaked everywhere on the floor with the set up they have so that was inconvenient bed was comfortable now we checked out july at noon and did not have a flight until late so we left our luggage there and picked it up later in he evening to head out for our flight upon arriving at our next destination we realized that my boyfriend had left his perfume in the hotel room on the bed please note the price of this was euros and the bottle was quite flashy i called the hotel right away to ask if they have recovered this lost item and the lady informed us to call in the next morning as it takes housekeeping hours to register it in the system i was confident they would inform us the next day that yes they had but when i called they said they had nothing i was a little stunned but thought maybe they still had not registered it i then proceeded to call them for the next few days and when i told them yes we did indeed forget it there and maybe housekeeping must have taken it because there is no where else it could be we looked through all our luggage and everything they insisted that,0
1086,the manor amsterdam is a very good hotel in the eastern section of amsterdam the rooms were decent and the hotel provided a very good buffet breakfast there are also multiple tram lines virtually in front of the hotel to take you to any part of the city if you like to stay in a quiet neighborhood this hotel would be a good,1
1087,this hotel was very clean and comfortable there is a tram stop right outside the hotel with around small stops into the heart of it all plenty of shops and restaraunts outside the hotel would highly recommend,1
1088,decent sized room very clean comfortable large bed had a room on the side of the hotel which was quiet had to wait a while to check in with no acknowledgement that we were waiting classy bar with outside seating area ate in enoteca interesting menu plus pizzas unfortunately they had run out of pizza dough one night waiting staff are lovely drinks are pricey but no more than other large hotels nice to sit on the front terrace and watch the world go by right near the tram stop so great access to all the sites you can buy tram tickets at the hotel we stayed in hotels recently with frosted glass doors into the bathroom that have gap round them bad idea turn the bathroom light on at night and is very bright into the bedroom poor trend that hotels should stop otherwise good bathroom decent free internet,1
1089,i stayed at this hotel on my own for a long weekend born and raised in amsterdam i try to stay in or near my old neighbourhood in amsterdam east oost i recall when i lived there the manor was an old hospital and always admired the building when cycling into town when my usual hotels were fully booked i decided to give the manor a go and i was disappointed the staff upon arrival were lovely and the checkin extremely quick the hotel has a fantastic amsterdam theme and the three crosses are everywhere bit too much for some but i loved it the room was great very spacious huge bed lovely bathroom everything i needed and even a tv attached to the bed that could swivel round fab my room was at the back of the hotel and there was no noise what so ever had a great night sleep all weekend the hotel location is great the area has improved so much since i lived there and there so much to do fantastic restaurants and pubs a little shopping centre and you a five minutes walk from the tropenmuseum and a few tram stops from the zoo speaking of trams the tram practically stops outside the hotel and that will take you into the city centre within but if you a real amsterdammer like me you like to cycle this hotel cater for that you can rent bikes at the hotel for i think for hours perfect,1
1090,the hotel is located in the east of amsterdam only minutes by public transport from downtown it is a pleasant area next to a large park and with lots of attractive places nearby for eating and having a good service was friendly and diligent we always felt very well attended with our needs and questions the room was well equipped and offered a pleasant atmosphere we felt absolutely our next trips to amsterdam and we will sure come back to this great city we will choose this hotel again and we will recommend it to our friends,1
1091,excellent clean attentive friendly staff a little far from city center but with tram link from front door and only a minute journey to dam square local amenities are good traditional build but modern furnishings room we had was one floor over the bar facing the main road but was still quite with windows closed,1
1092,literally just returned from my stay here it was a lovely experience with polite staff good service stunning food and a decent room the wet rooms were lovely i genuinely enjoyed my stay a few minor issues which took away the star rating for me cleaning was certainly a bit of an issue there was a great deal of dust on the floors and behind the beds furthermore the room was cleaned at various times of day all very inconsistently which meant that the room was ready when necessarily wanted my last niggle comes from the prices the rooms are certainly a little over priced and the spirit prices were extortionate nevertheless it was a thoroughly enjoyed stay,1
1093,the hotel is a little out of the centre but walkable into town and there is a tram stop outside the door the rooms were not brilliant but clean and mostly functional tv had its moments the staff were personable helpful and all in all unremarkable we arrived early in the morning so having left our bags with reception headed off into town to see the sights we returned in the evening planning to have dinner in the hotel italian inspired restaurant wow both the food and the wine were superb the service was great and the cost reasonable,1
1094,stayed here for a few nights in july and had a pleasant stay the hotel was in a good location with a tram stop straight out the front that took you into central only taking minutes or so our room was clean and a decent size staff were very friendly and very helpful the restaurant was lovely too very pleased overall and would go back again,1
1095,my partner and i booked this hotel with another couple for night with a deal our room was on the second floor and was a food sized room the room was lovely and clean other then hair in the bath with a lovely view of a green area behind the hotel the bed was very comfortable but as we are a couple beds pushed together is really what i have in mind for a double bed the temperature of the water in the shower was consistent either and was going hot and cold throughout showers the shower also leaked the hotel has free wifi we did not have breakfast in the hotel is it was very basic it was very easy to get arrange once we had bought tram tickets for the hotel reception after going out for the evening we came home to our room keys not working we went down to reception to get new key cards we was back up to the room and it still was working we was then told the lock on the door was broken and could we wait at the bar until it was fixed we got given a complementary drink while we waited they were unable to fix it so the receptionist opened the door for us once we had left the room was then had to keep on going back to reception to be let back into our room until we checked out the staff was all very helpful and,1
1096,we stayed at the hampshire for nights last week of july the soundproof room was on the third floor spacious very clean and had a window with street view which i like the room was cleaned well daily and the bathroom had shampoo and hairdryer no the bed and pillows were very staff are very friendly and helpful the location is very convenient it is minute away from tram stop to and it is like away from the central station the hotel is locates near a coffeeshop and some nice restaurants a laundry a metro station a shopping street just min away from the hotel great value for the money it is highly recommended,1
1097,i wish i had booked something closer to amsterdam major attractions this hotel is in a nice neighborhood but out of the way it a hefty walk to the main tourist spots however you can rent bikes from the hotel and several tram lines stop nearby so getting around is i was not pleased with the sleep quality i felt our mattress was too soft and our pillows too service was good but we had a room snafu when we arrived i had booked two rooms for two adults and two children as we would be arriving late i called ahead to make sure we get two rooms together i was assured we would however we got there to find our rooms two floors apart they did switch us the next day no compensation was offered but the person on the desk quickly agreed when i suggested they give us all a free breakfast,1
1098,four nights at the manor in amsterdam during peak summer season this hotel is well appointed very clean and a good sized room with excellent bathroom staff were very welcoming and friendly booked through a well known consolidator and was a little disappointed that it was not made clear during online reservation that breakfast was extra so had to find another for two people on hotel is right next to two tram lines one of which goes to the centre and the other to the museum district and there are plentiful shops and cafes within metres however with hindsight we would have paid extra to stay nearer the centre and would happily use another of the many hotels within the hampshire group in tram journey is minutes each way and even with tickets the cost adds up in the summer heat it is not practical to walk back each time to the hotel and for those of us who are of age the bicycle hire was not a welcoming summary this is a great hotel but visitors need to balance the savings available by being away from the centre against the time and inconvenience of not being able to back for a regularly visit european cities and rank amsterdam as one of the safest and we never felt intimidated or unwelcome and loved being able to meander the compact centre however it is not a particularly cheap city and the budget does not stretch as far as it does in,1
1099,stayed nights as a couple and had a lovely stay we were originally given a room that had singles pushed together when we first arrived but a quick trip back to reception and this was quickly sorted had a great room with a massive bed good size bathroom with shower only as stated when we booked so no problem making facilities only earl grey tea though a great addition is the mini fridge in the room there are a couple of small think tesco local stores about minutes walk away so we got drinks snacks and stocked the fridge the climate control was a bit poor and i think in really hot weather it would not be very good we had it on full and had to open the window in the night as it was very stuffy staff very friendly helpful take the number tram from central station very easy to get to hotel and travel around turn right out of the hotel for some lovely restaurants,1
1100,this is the worst hotel i stayed at and i stay in many hotels throughout the year the sirens of ambulances all night long were one night a drunken man screamed below our window and the sound of loud traffic was not a pleasant sound to listen to while trying to sleep the room was claustrophobic and nothing like a room as seen on their breakfast offered at the hotel was pretty meager for a stayed in a hotel that was a lot better than this never understood why i was charged for the breakfast and for the rental bike i rented in all hotels i stay at they always render one bill at the end of the hotel staff was friendly,0
1101,very comfortable rooms with views overlooking the city if you arrive by train in centraal it an easy drag of your bags to the hotel metro trams boats tour buses all stop at centraal so it is easy to get wherever you going and most transportation heads to your hotel at night breakfast buffet is above average excellent rooftop bar starbucks on ground floor,1
1102,stayed in various types of rooms in the doubletree if you can book an executive room they are the best and you have access to the executive lounge which is free breakfast and free snacks later on in the evening free unlimited alcohol wines and champagne so obviously that a great perk you can take up to room or just relax in the lounge the breakfast is like the main breakfast served outside the lounge but it was good enough for me the hotel is lovely and the service is great you receive a cookie when checking in and if there are any delays with your room they will leave something in the room for you usually a bottle of prosecco courtyard access room is good in the summer better than a balcony rooms are clean and maintained well sky lounge is the best place to relax during the day amazing view of amsterdam very chilled environment and good customer service bike hire is super cheap and it great to get around and explore apple mac in each room and in lobby free wifi throughout the hotel i recommend this hotel it suited for everyone families and couples there a wonderful restaurant and starbucks within the hotel i been so many times because it so good i going back in two weeks,1
1103,we stayed here for nights after a river cruise this was a very good place to stay the breakfast buffet has a very large selection of foods and is fresh and very good the rooms are on the larger size for europe and had washcloths which is not common in europe staff in reception the restaurant and customer service are very helpful and friendly there is bottled water available to take each day when touring out in the city excellent location and close to centraal station the only drawback we found was that on saturday night it was very loud outside with a party or a bar close by and the noise echoed into our room until the early hours of the night saying this it was something the hotel has no control over we would stay here again on another visit,1
1104,this hotel is quite pricey but everything in amsterdam is so it was not that far out of range we stayed in a suite and had so much room very spacious living room with a couch that works as a bed and then a separate bedroom also beds are quite comfortable and the bathroom was quite roomy with both a shower and a tub it was all very clean and the view was amazing we just sat and watched out the window quite a bit we could see much of amsterdam from our window and took advantage of the white nights to stay up and watch the world go by we also took were able to use the executive level privileges breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks very helpful at saving money and also very good food and service the hotel is very centrally located easy to get to from central station which is right next door it is also close to hop off boat and bus routes so that is easy is you use that option while sightseeing good restaurants are nearby and everything is very convenient it is a cruise stop hotel so it can get quite busy at times but we did not mind as it did not really affect us much they also have bikes to rent so that a fun way to get around and they have waters in the lobby to grab on your way out for the day and those cookies and there,1
1105,second time staying here service location top place to stay in amsterdam easy walk to station buses boats cv chipcard is worth buying for use in netherlands for all transport would certainly stay at this hilton centraal should i visit amsterdam again,1
1106,i have stayed at a few double trees and this follows the similar high standards the location in the city is perfect for exploring the city and transport links the room was a decent size which offered a nice view we also loved the restaurant downstairs,1
1107,great location so close to centraal station transport room clean roomy staff very helpful would stay here again bit disappointed our room rate did include breakfast but certainly would recommend,1
1109,stayed for days in july checked in late in the afternoon and room was ready for check in check in was very quick and my husband is diamond so we stayed on the floor we overlooked the train tracks so the view was great but the location is excellent and i never heard any train noisesi never found a concierge but the front desk was some of the most helpful front desk that i have ever had they all gave directions and great information on what train to get and when they left they were great located next to central station which is a very easy walk when we arrived i felt odd carrying luggage across train tracks but do worry you will see lots of people doing it all week its close to trains and buses and the amsterdam information which i did find until the last day and i wish i would have found it on the first day they were also very helpfulbed was comfortable but the queen bed was really just twins next to each other but comfortable i always felt that the room was clean but we were without towels one day and toilet paper the next even when the guy knocked on the door to see if room was okay we said we needed towels he left and we never saw him again we got free breakfast daily and drinks at night but it was very crowded but a nice perki loved amsterdam and,1
1110,last minute book with the family due to a horrible bunch of flight mishaps as a hilton diamond top level i was not upgraded and no accommodations were made for the family so needed to pay for a second room will never stay here again as i was simply another number with signs to them as it felt i travel through amsterdam a bunch for business as it is a delta major flight route and i will never stay here again nor advise any clients to stay i love hilton properties but the decisions this property made was not a decision based on good customer service,0
1112,we had an executive balcony and it was amazing the views of the city from the floor were astonishing we had sunset views every night that were breathtaking all the boats in front going back and forth were a real treat the location was great and the executive lounge was a bonus we really enjoyed the hotel the sky lounge is a must a short walk from the train station,1
1113,good location and very good breakfast buffet spacious corner room breakfast buffet has many selections of the usual breakfast items including eggs made to order and champagne restaurant and starbucks on the ground floor several other restaurants very close by,1
1114,what i like about the hilton brands is that you always know that you will have a pleasant stay in a comfortable room this hotel is no exception the staff is friendly and the rooms are nice and spacious and a great bonus for hilton in europe is that you get washcloths and an iron in the room which is not common in europe,1
1115,we arrived late in the morning and even though the lobby was full we were checked in quickly our room was ready but our bags were whisked away into storage and we set off to explore amsterdam a short walk in the direction of centraal station and we had our two day tram pass coming back at our bags were delivered promptly to our suite which was on the executive floor our travel agent suggested a suite for us since we were traveling with our grand daughter and were considering booking two rooms booking a suite turned out to be less expensive then two rooms and having the island suite gave us a spectacular view of the city the hotel provided a roll cot which proved to be uncomfortable for my grand daughter but she simply moved to the couch which served her needs very well being in an executive room we had access to the executive lounge which provided free light snacks wine beer and soft drinks from to pm this was a lovely treat our breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was delightful the buffet was varied and well stocked when my grand daughter voiced a desire for a crepe the kitchen was pleased to provide her with it the number of gluten free options for my wife was outstanding and at the end of the meal you could take a few items from the buffet for a later snack or light lunch,1
1116,we are fans of the hilton double tree train so this was an obvious choice for us when staying in amsterdam check in said we arrived from our flight by and were given a room immediately the room was clean modern and of a decent size the location is brilliant right next to the station and a walking distance from all the main attractions and key areas i would definitely stay here again,1
1118,very comfortable hotel we had hilton honors as my family use the hotel brand frequently but even if you discount those perks free breakfast afternoon tea free water coffee machines etc the hotel is incredibly well positioned next to centraal station with a lovely view of the canal easy access to the city and a safe and short walk to trams or closer attractions,1
1119,arrived in amsterdam direct off the plane from australia at on a sunday morning staff at the hotel could not have been more accommodating and found us a room to check into as soon as we arrived we did expect this but we most easy location to find and a good base to see the best of amsterdam and beyond room was small but comfortable restaurant at the hotel was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,1
1120,we stayed here recently for days and totally enjoyed this hotel normally you would not expect a hotel located next to a major railway station to be so good but the double tree hilton is very good our room is not overly large but it has everything we need and to be honest you only end up sleeping in your room the best thing about this hotel is the top floor with the amazing outdoor bar and eating area it has fantastic views toward the main part of the city with nothing better than enjoying that view at sunset with a nice drink in hand its location is also excellent for exploring amsterdam easily and there is a good restaurant district very close to the hotel,1
1121,very nice clean and comfortable rooms we stayed for nights and has easy access to the but also a short minute walk to the old kerk and red light this is a very popular and large hotel check in and check out does take a little while so be prepared for some crowds,1
1122,i never write reviews but thought after the service i received tonight by a waiter called gijs in the skye lounge bar was beyond excellencethis guy is a credit to the a gentleman and is an expert at his will def return and ask for him again as he showed not only a talent for his job but an amazing persona which made our night special especially since we got engaged and he took it upon himself to make us feel so welcome and gave us some complimentary cocktails got a big hug from him and feel that he is now my a lovely lovely man alan and lesleyanne,1
1123,the hotel was in a perfect location he is walkable from central rail station took the train from airport and was in the hotel within great location for everything skybar on top floor had amazing views of great timothy at guest services made our trip he set us up for our two day visit he organized everything and made every dinner reservations for us he was patience kind and had a great sense of you will love the hotel and we took uber and it came right to the door of hotel great days,1
1124,just come back from my trip to amsterdam but first stay at the doubletree we used to stay at the crown plaza but after that shut were looking for somewhere similar in terms of standard and location our stay was excellent from start to finish all staff were friendly and helpful would stay anywhere else nice modern and clean rooms bathroom was huge but more than manageable brilliant location for the centraal station and the city itself no issues with noise whatsoever we were on the floor overlooking the train tracks could hear a thing from either the sky bar or the trains outside so no complaints from us we did have breakfast at the hotel but visited the starbucks underneath a couple of times which was just right for what we were looking for at breakfast time also paid a visit to the sky bar on the floor nice atmosphere and views of the city but the cocktails were very expensive but we wrote it off as part of the experience,1
1125,we stayed for nights the cookies at did not disappoint we had an executive room on the floor with views of the canals the room was clean and functional it had a small refrigerator and a desk area the bathroom was small but set up well it was a shower only the executive lounge had an outstanding breakfast with cooked to order omelettes and pancakes the evening reception had heineken on tap and red white wine the staff friendly and helpful throughout the location was perfect next to central station there were direct trains to and from the airport it was an easy walk to the main areas of the city,1
1126,we stayed one night during a quick visit to amsterdam the location was perfect for a brief itinerary we wasted no time between the train station and finding our hotel plus you can rent bikes in the lobby of the hotel so convenient the room was entirely adequate nothing fancy but comfortable i stay here again under similar circumstances,1
1127,i had a great stay at the doubletree the location was perfect as it was in the center of the very short work to lots of landmarks the staff was friendly and the breakfast was great with lots of choices,1
1128,what good about this hotel it pretty much centrally located walking distance to central train station shopping areas the notorious red light district and most attractions in amsterdam the hilton badge will assure you the quality of stay in the hotel i had a good nights stay at the this is a busy hotel so do expect to get an early check in but the warm cookies may cheer you up a little bit the rooms are very spacious choose the rooms facing the city the view is worth the extra cost the apple tv is interesting at first but the small screen is a little turn off there is also starbucks at the hotel it may be redundant as the hotel cafe also serves good coffee but i think it worth pointing it out overall i enjoyed the stay in this hotel if i travelling back to amsterdam doubletree by hilton amsterdam central will definitely be my choice of stay,1
1130,stayed here for nights in august and it was the most beautiful hot weather the location of this hotel is perfect for a first trip to dam as it centrally located so your within walking distance of most tourist spots could have picked a better hotel for my birthday i had requested a smoking room before hand and they delivered had a beautiful view of the canal also was greeted with warm cookies on arrival the sky lounge really must be appreciated all in all i would return,1
1131,i had been stayed here for two nights location is perfect which located walking distance from central station cleanliness in the room is also perfect regarding quality of service sky lounge f b housekeeping room service and reception staffs goes above and beyond only few staff at reception i am still feeling uncomfortable one female staff by chance i wanted to asking something due to my sickness plus long flight from asia i was difficult to speak loud she told me speak louder as for me if i wish i can speak louder with throats pain overall quality of service was excellent only few staff like this female staff please management watch out and take action accordingly what a waste entirely teams are doing great job besides high occupancy like this most busiest summer season,0
1133,this hotel offers wonderful service in a great location perfectly located close to city center as well as minutes to cruise ship location and minutes to train station would highly recommend this hotel while visiting amsterdam,1
1134,if you would like to see the whole of amsterdam from a treetop view this will be a nice place they have outdoor seats and you can enjoy a very nice view but be aware of the weather before you decide to go there they serve food as well and price is on the higher end take note it is not for budget travelers you can walk in and no reservation is required overall i enjoyed my time there,1
1135,good location to explore amsterdam rooms were clean and modern what you would expect from a double tree hilton there is a sky lounge however we did not use it as it was very busy bonus free warm chocolate cookie on arrival,1
1136,great location near the train station such a clean and friendly hotel received a nice upgrade and the service was great awesome bar at the top of the hotel to end the night would definitely stay here again if we ever come back,1
1137,loved the hotel great location easy to get to everything staff was very friendly breakfast was a bit pricey but we did opt to get that beds are very comfortable i was very happy with the hotel and would gladly stay there again,1
1138,it literally walk from amsterdam central station mins walk from the tour both that you can buy all your attraction tickets at and mins walk to the start of where the streets of amsterdam come alive my room had an awesome view of the river and the city truely stunning if that is enough there is a sky lounge located in the roof that serves amazing cocktails to enjoy with the stunning views of the city as the sun sets great place to relax after a hard day regards to it was but expected given it a hilton hotel the staff were friendly and helpful attentive to me every need the only gripe i had was that i wanted a king bed and i thought i got one but they had pushed singles together and out a king sheet on it i was there for business so slept in the center exactly where the gap was and woke up the next day with a sore back in summary if you can afford it a great place for a couple to use as a base to explore the city that is equipped with a relaxing bar to chill out in if you want to relax at the end of a tiring day if seeing attractions my room had door access to an adorning room so defiantely an option for families too,1
1139,i was hesitant of this hotels location but was happily pleased only a minute free ferrry ride to the center of amsterdam and beautiful view of the canal made this a perfect location rooms are clean and comfortable staff was excellent and helpful many places to eat within a few minutes of walking and restaurant in hotel was good also breakfast was fantastic would stay here again,1
1140,the hotel as a great location at the water at min from the city center the hotel is very busy manly visited tourists that is also the drawback no real focus service for business travelers the roof top bar offers a great view over amsterdam the rooms are special is the nice apple tv system although it would have been comfortable if the screen would have been bigger the pasta ordered from the room service was not very tasteful and nearly cold when served the restaurant with view over the water offers a mediocre quality of food the staff is not very friendly,0
1141,after an overnight fight we arrived before noon and were allowed to check in early this was greatly appreciated as we needed to get some sleep unfortunately the room we were given was across the hall from the linen supply room and there was a constant banging as the door closed not being very happy about this i went to the front desk and asked for another room the manager on duty was very kind and upgraded our room both in type and location which was greatly included breakfast was extraordinary lots of options great tasting foods and even fresh strawberries i had trouble with the in the hotel after the first day i went back to the front desk to request help oh your problem is that you are in airplane mode i explained that airplane mode did not affect and that it has worked elsewhere for years she turned off my airplane mode even though i said not to do so and said it was it worked but on cellular and when i got home i got a bill for the five minutes it was not in airplane mode that really annoyed location is close to the centraal station and not too far from where many of the river cruise ships dock which was convenient but to get to most of the other parts of downtown amsterdam it generally means going back past centraal station and then to the interesting parts of the city we stayed at another,1
1142,loved our room amazing floor to ceiling windows accommodated all four of us in our located and easy to get everywhere honors lounge is good but way to crowded lobby was also too crowded the small spaces to accommodate our stay causing a very very scrunched feeling was the only reason i took off one concierge service worth it to boom your stuff with them instead of trying to do everything on your own they were very helpful and got us in all the attractions we wanted to see,1
1145,so i picked this place because of the location and i have to say it was fantastic close to everything staff are great we had a mini suite which was also more than enough for adults and kids breakfast choice was good there is free water in the reception which is a nice bonus the executive lounge is tiny though and always busy it not somewhere i ever wanted to go due to it being overcrowded however i would stay here again in a heartbeat it clean it central it has a starbucks,1
1146,lovely staff delicious much appreciated warm cookie on check spotless and comfortable breakfast were here for a big and the front desk gave us complimentary drinks in the sky bar we were expecting it to be place it was rammed great vibe great music great people watching great cocktails what can i say it was great every tram comes back to centraal so easy to get home being so near the station it is constant crowds once you step out of the hotel,1
1147,we traveled to amsterdam to go on a viking river cruise rhine getaway and arrived a day early to try to recover from travel fatigue and to have a chance to explore a little of amsterdam before embarking on the cruise we chose the doubletree because of the proximity to the piers where the viking ships usually dock as well as being in a central location the location was ideal it was so close we were able to walk with our luggage to the ship if you arriving by train the hotel is ideally situated as centraal station is a short walk as well we arrived in the late morning and had requested an early we knew it was unlikely and we were right as the hotel seemed very busy as i believe it is most of the time we were given a warm cookie and found a place to sit and wait fearful of falling asleep sitting up we set out in the rain to explore to stay awake and find some lunch we highly recommend an argentine steakhouse called lagouch which is close to the hotel we had memorably wonderful burgers and fries there the hotel had many eating areas and places with a very large starbucks among them when we went on a walking tour on the first day of our cruise the guide told us the starbucks is owned by the doubletree there is bottled water and green apples in the lobby for the taking the,1
1148,we were in an executive suite for a family of we had a bedroom with a king bed and they brought in a roll away and made up the couch for the two teens very nice hotel very close to the center of amsterdam we flew into ams and took the train to the central station it was a short walk with luggage to the doubletree the staff were amazing all very friendly and welcoming the room was a perfect place to recover from jet leg and to walk around a busy tourist hotel but the executive lounge on the floor has a lovely breakfast and evening appetizers and drinks we stayed on the top floor where there was also a popular sky lounge with a roof top deck to look out over a the old town of amsterdam there was also a starbucks in the lobby of the hotel as well as a few restaurants that seemed popular the cruise port was also a short walk away and we were able to walk with our rolling luggage or a short cab ride if you have large luggage i thought all the hotel prices in amsterdam were very expensive but felt i received the value from the doubletree and would stay there again if i back in amsterdam on business or vacation,1
1149,very clean and well maintained helpful and welcoming staff great variety of food at breakfast bar well suited for children amazing views from tower executive suite great location in the vicinity of dam square and close to tram and metro stations,1
1150,this hotel is located directly across the street from the centraal station we walked to most sites in the city but took the direct train for euro to the airport the staff is super friendly and the sky lounge was a popular place in the had a harbor view and could watch cruise ships coming in and out of the harbor,1
1151,only stayed one night but is definitely the place to make your base when visiting amsterdam easy reach of central station and good cheap parking under the hotel the bar is perfect great in the sun and maybe even better after sun set,1
1152,god is in the details this hotel has a great location and very nice amentities best top floor bar for no charge viewing check in was in need of help with customer service get fixed quote for trip airport taxi about one way for trip on railroad is cheap but step lively and be prepare for long walks and lots of time to clear airport huge otherwise a good value,1
1153,very nice hotel balcony room was great for watching boat traffic and nice view of the city executive queen room with balcony was nice but small really enjoyed the executive lounge for breakfast and evening snacks and drinks,1
1154,superb hotel next to train station would recommend balcony room with executive lounge access free food and drink for two hours great breakfast and very good friendly staff will be back would highly recommend this to all if it is within your budget,1
1155,had nights here before embarking on a river cruise the hotel was great very central walking distance to town centre canal cruise stops railway station and river cruise boat port the staff were friendly spoke english helped organise tours and recommended great sight seeing spots free water cookies and apples at front desk which was an added bonus rooms were roomy clean and modern hotel restaurant great bar upstairs with city views beautiful i can not recommend this hotel highly enough was a great place to recoup after hours travel from australia,1
1156,the location was great very close to centraal station all the major route trams buses boats and tours start from near by the room was spacious i wish they could have added some area from room to bathroom because shower cubicle was too small the view from room was great facing canal though the room was facing main street but there was zero noise in the room executive rooms are highly recommended for good view and access to executive reception staff was very helpful during my time stay we got an early the concierge was again very helpful and knowledgeable in spite of being very busy they were doing a great job the breakfast was excellent when it used to be very crowded in the morning they used to open executive lounge the water bottles and apples were always kept near reception for guest convenience the best place of the hotel was their sky lounge on top floor which was a very lively and full of life almost everyday no doubt a hotel worth staying again,1
1157,location is perfect right next to train station the entire hotel and rooms are clean easy and friendly knowledgeable concierge willing to help sells tram and museum tickets great restaurant and rooftop bar even a starbucks if you are lucky enough to get into the executive lounge the breakfast is fantastic not cheap during peak but worth it,1
1158,great place to stay rooms were spotless fabulous hotel and great views food was good restaurant staff were lovely but i must say the reception staff were very poorly mannered and unhelpful very sharp and simple not nice quite disappointing as the rest of the stay was faultless,1
1159,we were on a girls day trip in amsterdam this hotel is very close to the main centraal station where you can get a train direct from the airport in minutes hugely convenient if you do have long in the city this is also one of the main tram stops so you can access the tram and metro network in mins walk from the hilton is a chain corporate so do expect boutique charm but do expect great buffet breakfast clean relatively spacious rooms modern bathroom good quality toiletries and efficient fast service in all areas plenty of staff on hand to help with concierge type queries buying tram day tickets at the hotel etc all in all a perfect place if you want to explore this city and have a comfortable efficient hotel to return to oh and yes one hidden gem it has one of the best roof top bars in the whole city on the floor excellent cocktails for a late night,1
1160,stay elsewhere the service was abysmal and staff was rude and unknowledgeable the rooms are incredibly small and there are so many other hotels in amsterdam that it not worth spending euros staying here,0
1161,i was so pleased with my interactions with guest services prior to my arrival they assisted me with reservation of a driver to meet at the airport and transport to the hotel the driver could not have been better to us assisting with finding a wheelchair for my husband comfort they quickly found us a for transfer to the nearby passenger cruise terminal the following morning the service level was so evident throughout our short one night stay at this hotel i will return,1
1162,very stylish and modern hotel perfectly located next to the central station comfortable if not slightly smallish rooms but very nicely furnished with an apple mac tv the lobby bar was good for a cold beer good selection or snack the skylounge was superb with great views over the city especially as the sun sets,1
1163,we stayed here in may for just one night at the end of a cruise and had not ourselves chosen the hotel this time we came for a couple of nights having had a positive experience last time we were given an upgrade to an executive room which was a nice touch we can find nothing to criticise in staff and the waiters are all friendly and efficient the executive lounge is small but during our stay it was never though we can see how it could become so the snacks served at pm were really good as before we very much liked the sky lounge with its great views over the city and a nice food menu this time we also tried the eastwood grill for dinner and were not disappointed all in all another very pleasant stay the location is also excellent for sightseeing and is of course only five minutes away from the train station too,1
1165,was in amsterdam to see last weekend stayed at the doubletree centraal station excellent location access to shopping old town museums and mins trains ride to the amsterdam arena super friendly staff early checkin after a hour flight was breakfast was dinner at the steakhouse was had a good time,1
1166,i would have to say excellent even though one thing needs addressing start with all the positives great location mins from train station and everything is in walking distance we nearly got a day transport ticket so glad we did hotel check in faultless we arrived to drop our bags off hours early to be told our room was ready floor overlooking amsterdam great start room perfect in both appearance and practicality had been some mixed reviews over the executive lounge we found this on the first night we got back at ish only to find no food or drinks until only tea and coffee never booked a ex lounge with these constraints then created a stampede at family also saw this as an opportunity to feed the kids for the evening did bring out meals rather than smaller the drinks were very limited wine and on the ground floor everywhere previous have been high up with views not a relaxing pre evening drink by any means however two things to add did complain and had a hand written letter in room with drink vouchers to main lovely bar area and also the breakfast on both occasions was nothing like evening great food selection and quiet atmosphere we went around ish roof top bar was worth a visit drinks not cheap but would you really expect two drinks for euros in that location that is what you are paying for our two drinks a cocktail and red wine euros so,1
1167,stayed here before and after a holland america cruise it was an easy walk into the city just a block from the train station and less than a mile from the pier rooms were available early in the day a great plus the space was adequate and included everything we needed the ground floor restaurant had a good burger and relaxed atmosphere the check in and out processes were efficient and fast all desk staff spoke excellent english and were very knowledgeable about the city and how to get around,1
1168,staff trip for circa people dt at ams centraal was the perfect choice booking process excellent for group staff in hotel professional and very helpful plenty of options at breakfast fantastic hotel,1
1169,pros level from all employees experienced that they did the little extra to make our stay as good and comfortable as possible cons costs to get quality,1
1171,modern hotel in great location with very good public transport links rooms are reasonable size staff and service were great cleanliness and buffet breakfast too the only slight disappointment was the size of the bed and the comfort,1
1172,the doubletree hilton amsterdam centraal station is located right next to the main amsterdam train station and is very convenient from the airport by direct train in less than min and for taking the regional and international trains to other cities in the netherlands or in europe there are also many trams and buses that depart from in front of the central station so getting around amsterdam is easy from the hotel the rooms are modern but on the small side but they are very efficiently and effectively set up with a small storage cabinet for some clothes and the in room safe a work desk with a mac computer that also serves as the tv and a small coffee table with low chair for an additional seat i have hhonors gold and so enjoyed an upgrade to a king deluxe room with a nice view of the city center and also had complimentary breakfast at the buffet restaurant the buffet had a very good selection of food including some asian options vegetarian sushi chinese congee with chinese fried doughnut one can also order eggs and omelettes from the wait staff but i would probably skip that and just go stick with the buffet as the omelette i ordered was not very good and a bit dried out the location does mean a bit of a longer walk to areas of interest such as the dam square but the trams are plentiful and frequent and not expensive to take and,1
1173,the dobuletree hilton has an incredibly service minded and friendly staff the room are pleasantly furnished clean and comfortable the breakfast is lavish and one of the best we have encountered in europe the central location is an additionally plus highly recommendable hotel,1
1174,this hotel is great from selecting your own room to the check out breakfast was amazing with great service rooms were clean and beds where comfortable very easy to get any where from this location especially the train station,1
1175,the hotel was modern and had a wonderful location that was within walking distance to downtown the rooms were not overly large typical of europe but they were very nice the staff was always very helpful they helped us book a riverboat tour that was wonderful made many recommendations to wonderful restaurants in the area the rooftop bar gets quite busy but is a fun place to go at night with amazing views of the city during the day you can get lunch at the bar we would definitely recommend staying here,1
1176,this hotel has two extremes excellent being the staff who were always attentive the drinks and service at the bar the food provided at the lounge the location terrible being the design of the rooms ours was a queen suite with so much wasted space and terrible sharp the executive lounge which was like a cheap pub on a friday night too many people no supervision shocking food handling practices we moved completely from the lounge for drinks into the bar where they provided good service great drink variety and just shook there heads at the poor behavior in the lounge administration need to fix this problem,1
1177,location is ideal minute trainride from airport and also parking available large busy hotel but brandnew rooms are small but confortable skylounge is perfect with great view meeting rooms are very good too,1
1178,this hotel was a great place to stay it is centrally located close to trams buses and trains and within walking distance of some attractions the rooms are well appointed and the staff did all in their power to make our stay comfortable they were helpful friendly and attentive,1
1179,this is a european modern styled hotel located on the island across from the centrum of amsterdam minute walk to train station city trams canal tours or across the bridge to centrum on our last visit to amsterdam we stayed right off dam square but prefer this you could take the train from the airport to the main train station and walk to this hotel quite easily hotel rooms are spartan but offer all amenities usually offered tv is an apple imac which i liked internet is fast hotel is far enough from the centrum that nighttime noise is rarely heard good nights sleep here there a refer in the room and bottled water is complimentary only real complaint is the carpet is relatively low nap direct glue down and as a result is dirty in halls and rooms if you can ignore that you will have a pleasant stay we had breakfast buffet at the restaurant and availed ourselves of the starbucks on the main floor sky lounge on the top floor has a great view and really expensive exotic drinks that are worth the price just to look at we also rented bikes from the front desk to ride around and see the real amsterdam would happily stay here again in the future,1
1181,great location great staff great rooms and a starbucks in the lobby the sky lounge is a must visit walking distance from city center definitely will come back and stay food options in the hotel too are well priced and was a great meal a special thanks to the brit that went out of her way to accommodate our request,1
1182,the right location very nice hotel with big rooms and great service the food is at best very friendly with children have plenty of spots to set and have drinks close to everything outstanding view from your rooms,1
1183,we stayed twice at this hotel recently and could not have been more satisfied with the rooms and the customer service we enjoyed the executive lounge the downstairs bar and the rooftop bar the nighttime views are amazing and should be visited if you come to town the rooms are well sized and each one has an imac that can be used as tv music or computer we had great views of the central city from both of our rooms will be back,1
1184,i do write reviews but i had to for this hotel because i was extremely are hhonors members checked in on around for nights we paid a lot of money for a king executive suite on high floor river view and mind you i had to pay in advance we ended up with a room on floor out of floors with view of train tracks and buildings one of which is an abandon building with graffiti on it see pics if this is what they called a room with a view i can only imagine what a room with no views looks spoke to the same agent at the hhonors desk who checked us in about the room that was assigned to us instead of being apologetic she automatically stated it was our fault she stated we picked our exact room online when we checked in via the app wrong when i checked in with the hilton app unlike other hilton properties this hotel does provide you with the option to pick your room maybe she needed to be better trained on her customer service skills and knowledge of how her hotel app few hours later the manager called and gave us an option to move to another room in the morning however it would be in a room with a smaller bed once again why would you offer me a room that is not what i had paid for in advance therefore we told her we do want it,0
1185,excellent hotel great family suites incredible breakfast with lots of food options toys and coloring books for kids super friendly staff will come back ca say enough great things was super impressed,1
1186,stayed for a weekend break in amsterdam the hotel is just next door to the central station really convenient for getting around and the are spacious we had a room on floor great views and no noise from the skylounge one storey above coffee with refill and cakes good value in skyloungebreakfast well stocked and we had no problems getting a table every day eastwoods restaurant did us proud for dinner and pulled the stops out decorating my sweet plate to celebrate my an excellent hotel and will stay there again,1
1187,we had a company conference few years back at this hilton double tree this time was passing by and decided to stay overnight at the hilton double tree amsterdam centre wow how the management has changed they are driven by text book service we ordered room service as we do signed for the food which arrived quiet late when we opened the tray the pizza was not what we ordered and naan bread missing with curry called the room served immediately the man was arrogant and abusive telling me we got the right food he will come and check and put it right about mins later called him again he was not going to do anything about it by now food had gone cold so we told him we have left all the food outside the room take it off the morning went to check out and the receptionist charged us for the room service which i challenged that we did not eat and have returned the food she said we had signed for it therefore we have to pay for it we should have complained last night and given the room service time to fix the issue hello listen to me i have just told you we waited mins for the room service to come back i spoke to another manager she seemed a bit sympathetic but that duty manager came out he was the same we will investigate the issue hello i am paying for something i did,0
1188,we had a suite or club room facing the city which was superb the staff were excellent and the choc chip cookie on arrival was a nice touch the hotel is in a fantastic spot within easy walking to everything my only criticism was that our toilet was unclean and obviously had not been touched when the room was cleaned from the previous resident all in all a great stay,1
1189,we come for a weekend break every year and each time find the service to be friendly the rooms clean and well equipped the cookies given at reception delicious and warm the checking process easy and a pleasure to stay the location is perfect for going out at night near the station but you never hear any trains and easy walking distance to everywhere always consistently good,1
1190,we had a double executive room with a slight view over amsterdam the balcony had a great view but not really direct access from room we checked in early and received a warm welcome biscuit each nice touch the executive lounge is too small for the volume of people and afternoon drinks were an impossibility unless you wanted to fight for a place the breakfast during the week was fine but crowds in the weekend not like the executive lounge we used in other hilton hotels room clean and comfortable curtains able to block out the late night daylight in july close to train station and this was good for airport connection also close to other areas of interest,1
1191,the hilton doubletree is a few minutes walk to central station and the hub of amsterdam the hotel seems somewhat tired and the foyer is not grand either our room of course was not ready but we were offered an upgrade to an executive suite which included breakfast and the executive lounge privileges for an extra which we opted to do and was well worth it entering our room on the floor with great city and canal view we were a bit shocked at the blandness of the room and only a queen bed all the usual amenities were provided free wifi were very friendly and a fantastic buffet breakfast with exceptional waitress we would stay here again,1
1192,my favorite hotel in amsterdam very convenient location next to the train station perfect starting point for touring the city great hotel amenities food etc but best of all the staff a little surprising for a big chain hotel but the staff are genuinely friendly very professional and will make your stay that much better if you appreciate convenience quality amenities and great service this is the place for you,1
1193,the rooftop lounge is sooo cool plush and relaxing with great degree views of amsterdam you could spend the whole evening here watching sunset listening to the live dj and enjoying nice negroni and other delights the best place in amsterdam for a drink with friends no question,1
1194,nice property with an easy location for entering the city by train and exploring the town by public transportation had this place for my parents visiting town and it always good to have hilton reliability for travelers,1
1195,the location is non descript but near to the station which was easy to get into amsterdam central über is great in amsterdam also the room was bit of charm with decorations but also strange shape it was a little stuffy and i did sleep well the front desk staff were friendly enough the gym is useless do bother unless you like to work out in a small basement i paid around without breakfast and would not consider it amazing value,1
1196,booked this hotel for a last minute trip in december and throughly enjoyed the stay the staff were lovely helpful and very accommodating when we arrived i was disappointed to find that two twin beds were pushed together for my partner and i i had specifically booked a double bed through expedia however i called down to reception and they were eager to help and we were moved to a different room i really liked the design of this hotel especially as we travelled around christmas it was very comforting to arrive to the fire after a cold walk the bathrooms are lovely too with a fantastic shower i would also like to add that i could hear anyone in the surrounding rooms during our stay which made us feel at ease and more like home,1
1197,my husband and i stayed here along with both sets of our parents we had a wonderful stay and found that the hotel was easy to find and walk to from the train station slorterdijk we could easily get to amsterdam centraal for the local sites and it was a quick ride from the airport was included in our my mother in law booked our reservation so confirm this when you book yourself it was delicious the mini pancakes were my favorite but cheese and cold cuts along with yogurt and granola were also available coffee tea and hot chocolate are available all the time from self serve here is not included but we highly recommend it our first server was extra friendly and happy to make jokes and drink recommendations we asked her what should we do while in amsterdam and she directed us to die hallen a area which was great fun and full of room was clean the shower was a nice rain water style one and the bed was comfortable the staff are friendly and my husband and i could easily step outside for a run overall our experience here was great give the urban lodge a go,1
1198,booked wondering if cheap rate meant cheap service thankfully we were wrong large clean spacious rooms extremely helpful and friendly staff minutes walk from train station then minutes to central station fabulous bar to relax in with great bar staff would highly recommend,1
1199,this was a nice place with good food and a friendly staff the room was rather small for of us but it worked out okay we loved how accessible it was to transportation that took us into town we enjoyed our stay,1
1200,it outside of the central after the bus or train ride still need to walk about min to reach the hotel imagine after a full day of touring still need to walk quite far it also not wheelchair nor stroller accessible makes it very difficult to travel with luggages,0
1202,great hotel staff very helpful and pleasant rooms great very comfy bed one side of hotel a little traffic noise if your window is open but no enough to disturb air con good breakfast good and the restaurant whilst limited choice was good as well drinks a little expensive in th bar but free coffee all day makes up for that,1
1203,really enjoyed our stay here it a very clean hotel with great facilities we brought our bicycles with us and used them to explore amsterdam it takes about minutes or so across a wonderful park to get to the main part of the city and there a few convenient bars in the park should the need arise to take a break during the city commute we found the staff to be helpful and friendly and the constant free coffee in the lounge area is very we were able to store our bikes in the underground garage for no extra charge car parking is free only if you book your reservation directly with the hotel,1
1204,the room was great and the staff was more than helpful they had recommendations for tours places to eat and so much more the hotel had an elevator the breakfast was good and had both hot and cold choices i would definitely use this hotel again,1
1205,my third time in amsterdam and this was the best one i stayed in within walking distance to the station and cafes and restaurants staff were very friendly and helpful room was a very high standard,1
1206,we visited the hotel in feb and again april it a great local small boutique style hotel it is well located and a cute looking see no reason not to visit the staff were very good and even emailed prior to visit to assist with our specific requirement for a family reunion thanks,1
1207,the location of this hotel a few minutes walk from the station but also in between the shopping area and the red light district can not be beaten canals everywhere this is a very central hotel accomodation prices are high in amsterdam so this is not cheap but it is hard to find better value for money nice bar good breakfast buffet fine wifi is our favorite place to stay in amsterdam,1
1208,hotel is not air conditioned the weather cooperated during our visit lucky room was large clean and everything worked as it should have great location for touring bed was comfortable,1
1209,the hotel itself is good what you would expect from a mercure but please beware if you are staying while the building work is going on beside the hotel not there fault i know but we are just back from a night stay the work seems to only be during the week but it starts from and the hotel actually shakes there is no way you can sleep through this so unless you want a very early start best to double check if the work is still going on before you book,0
1210,arrived after hours traveling first impression was ok room small bathroom clean regular hotel room slept for a few hours only to be woken up by bulldozers and moving cranes at finally i called reception and the lady was apologetic and said we could swap rooms in the afternoon we are here for nights so my son and i packed up our suitcases and spent the day in the city we came back only to change rooms as we did want to leave it too late the girl at the reception explained that unfortunately they was any rooms left and although she could see on the computer i had called in the morning she told us that she too thinks the construction site starts too early but there was nothing she could do this should have been explained when booking if i had known i would definitely not have booked it so unfair i paid a lot of money for a star hotel right now a hostel would be heaven i suggest if you thinking about this hotel ask before booking if you will be in the construction zone if so avoid it at all costs,0
1211,we stayed at this hotel in july the it very clean but if you need a hard bed for your back these wo do as they are very soft breakfast is amazing the hotel is about a minute tram ride from the heart of the city but very easy to get there it is in the heart of the museum district though so if you are coming to the museums this is a perfect place,1
1212,close to the major museums park museum square grocery store albert many restaurants and transit easy to walk to many attractions from her also comfy beds nice bathroom and breakfast available if you want but we are not big eaters so was too much very friendly staff,1
1213,my husband and i enjoyed our one night stay at this conveniently located hotel the rooms are spacious beds are comfortable and the organic breakfast is delicious highly recommendable for a short stay in beautiful amsterdam,1
1214,we had dinner at the dutchess with a party of this is one of the better restaurants in amsterdam managed by the same owners as momo yzakaya etc great food and fantastic ambiance get the chocolate explosion which is the icing on the cake,1
1215,i was a bit dubious coming here with a child as on the website it looked too cool for school but when i arrived at looking to leave in bags and deal somehow with tired children who had taken a flight yup a mistake and they allowed us to our room without paying more then i this place has core values of hospitality covered children rested we hired bikes they had children ones too and headed much thanks to making the holiday,1
1216,really loved my stay at the w amsterdam i stayed in the bank building and loved it style the rooms were designed for maximum efficiency in a smaller space and the modern look is a cool contrast to the old building the location is perfect for seeing everything you need to see in the city and the concierge wish i remembered his name was so helpful and managed to get us tickets to the anne frank house for that day saving us hours of waiting in line and the rooftop bar is a must see for the great view would definitely recommend and stay there again next time i in amsterdam,1
1217,out of what a beautiful hotel my husband and i had a room in the exchange building the staff were prompt and courteous the room was user friendly and had everything we needed the bed was very comfortable the pool in the vault of the bank building was spectacular lovely hot and cool plunging pools very nice sauna and a stunning pool everything down to the shampoo and conditioner was on point when i find myself back in amsterdam i will for sure be staying at this property again thank you w amsterdam for a perfect stay,1
1218,my wife and me stayed at the w hotel for the weekend we been to many hotels we have seen for a long time such a we designed hotel starting from the lobby reception the rooms the restaurants and even the spa and sweeming pool amazing the staff was very polite and helpful and the room was very comfortable the hotel is also located very close to the dam do miss the roof bar with the city spread all overin short this is the place for staying in amsterdam,1
1219,absolutely excellent book it you wo regret it i be back i hope well trained knowledgable staff keen to make your stay perfect location excellent in the heart of everything room was super cool a real experience,1
1220,the w in amsterdam is very well located near the royal palace and walking distance from a lot of the city it also close to the train station we stayed on the bank side the hotel is split in two by a road and it was wonderful the room had high ceilings lots of light and was very high tech with lots of outlets and usb ports the duchess is a fabulous restaurant just downstairs from the rooms which serves breakfast lunch and dinner in a very elegant setting the staff was gracious and helpful highly recommended,1
1221,absolutely amazing from start to finish thanks so much to daan koenhein our w insider who made our stag even more awesomely from the moment we were greeted at the airport by our hotel chauffeur service to the drink through to our room itself we loved it regular visitors to other w hotels this one definitely fits the brand style of trendy vibe and guest satisfaction above everything else i was able to add daan to whatsapp and immediately we had our on the ground ensuring that our stay ran smoothly our friends had never stayed at a w before but i think they be returning in fact we all will a big mention for mr porter too the biggest tastiest steaks i you once again to daan frank leon and igor for all working to ensure that our special weekend was extra forward to the then best wishessteve and rob,1
1222,the location ca be beat directly behind the palace at dam square made getting around amsterdam very easy for first time visitors the staff from front desk to concierge could have been more helpful and went out of their way to explain the city to stayed on the bank side not knowing the difference in their two buildings that make up the hotel next time we will try the exchange as per the suggestion of several staff members my wife and i like to experience new things but the decor and style of the rooms were a little too modern for us shower in middle of room was unique room was quite large considering we were in do much of anything in hotel as we were constantly on the go but would definitely recommend hotel for its location and service,1
1223,my third stay at the w amsterdam great location and wonderful staff one of the bartenders on the rooftop cristiano sp was extremely friendly and attentive during my first stay i was traveling solo and it was nice to feel welcome he even recalled my name and drink when i visited a second time food at porter is excellent nice to have a grocery store in the building i look forward to my forth visit,1
1224,the w in amsterdam has two buildings across the street from each other we stayed in the old hotel that used to be an old telephone exchange building the rooms kept this theme from the telephone booth shower with writing on the stall telephone wire overhead lights etc very cool the bell hop kensy sp went above and beyond he stayed with us the whole check in process and answered any questions we had during the walk to our room he asked our two girls what their favorite animals are a few hours later he arrived at our door with a pillow for one with her name and favorite animal and the other got a teddy bear wearing a tshirt with her name and favorite animal one of the our rooms was not cleaned properly when we arrived and the staff were so apologetic and even sent a bottle of champagne to our room i did expect this amazing service from such a hotel we would definitely stay here again,1
1225,we checked into this hotel at the last minute when we discovered that our other hotel did have and that temperatures were quite warm in july even in the evenings my reasons for stars and not five are the following i called the hotel and reserved the room for an immediate and i was told over the phone that an outside room was ready for our arrival at the bank building however when we arrived we had to wait minutes for our room we were so this seemed like a long time when we got to the room it was an inside room so we went back and they promised us an outside room but said we have to wait another minutes and gave us two drink tickets for the bar the bar was fabulous but after minutes nothing after minutes still nothing so i went to check on it and was told to wait awhile longer after hours we were able to check into a gorgeous king room with a beautiful view they had upgraded us because of the wait which was very nice but still it was a long wait the room itself had a huge comfortable king bed elegantly crisp and soft white sheets motorized blinds a large closet a unique light fixture a coffee machine a large shower stall with excellent soaps and shampoos and was quiet and extremely comfortable after that the service was excellent we loved the rooftop bar and pool as well i,1
1226,what a great location the front desk service was amazing and friendly the room service menu was lacking the concierge was busy doing her nails irritating the bartenders at the spa were a great source of information thank you we were upgraded to a larger room and it was impressive with the automatic blind light control giant shower closet and huge bar the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet my only complaint was when we went up to porter and sat at the bar i got the impression they really wanted us to leave so they could give the seats away the food was great though,1
1227,the doormen are always the best part of the w hotel experience at the amsterdam w the doormen offered a friendly welcome on the street and quickly got us checked in and comfortably to our room they also man the concierge desk at street level and were great in assisting with suggestions on ideas of where to go in the city the biggest issue we found at this hotel was the lack of housekeeping and maintenance attention the blinds did not work in our room and two of the ceiling lights were burned out we were told on that it would be resolved immediately when we returned to the hotel four hours later at pm they had not we were moved to a different room with similar maintenance problems in the bathroom the toilet brush was tangled with toilet paper from a previous guest stay and the holder was full of soiled water we asked repeatedly at the desk to have it cleaned and in our three day stay it never was dirty glasses with the last sips of left over drinks that we brought up from the bar were left by housekeeping sitting on the desk and not removed in the daily room cleaning you would expect more from a hotel of this caliber i would revisit this hotel for the restaurants and rooftop bar but would be reluctant to rebook a room here,1
1228,the w brand is very good at designing hype and trendy hotels this hotel is an is such a cool vibe and i really loved the indoor area unfortunately the rooftop pool was closed due to maintenance then to bad weather both times we we could give it a try the service is also very good we went for breakfast a bit late the buffet was closing but the lovely waitress brought us la carte pancakes fresh juice and hot chocolates and told us only happy when my costumers are full what a nice touch you really should ask a room with a city view and not atrium view as they are much much much nicer,1
1229,overall a great stay although we did encounter some issues in the beginning of it but i can only recommend to open your mouth and address your issues to staff and management they did listen to us and our problems and came with solutions and answers the only thing i can hope now is that they use our feedback for their continuous improvement processes special warm thank you to joost at the breakfast at mr porter his service is super top notch a good example to all associates there if all associates would tend that direction i sure the hotel staff attentiveness will land on the level the property merits btw rooms are very nice breakfast super i think it at least at same level of w barcelona if not even beyond anyway it great great selection of juices and also bubbles in the morning if you into heavier breakfast try the one at mr porter and have a minute steak in the morning ps try the spa as well a divine place in the middle of amsterdam if there would be any point of attention towards visitors than would it be the use of swimming gear in both spa as ont he wet deck we seen guests in and externals going with their underwear in the pools maybe a stricter policy would be welcome there in order to maintain overall hygiene for the other guests,1
1231,my partner and i stayed at w for nights and it was hands down one of the best hotel experiences we ever had we felt both at home and immediately connected to the city and it surrounding beauty thanks to w wonderful facilities services and obvious w places an enormous emphasis on the small details from their retro design influences stylish decor immaculate rooms and wide range of facilities to their personal friendly and very helpful staff so much thought has been put into making this hotel stand out from the rest all staff on the door reception providing room service and housekeeping attention to detail were clearly as a result of a well organized team that communicate efficiently and effectively there was even a fire alarm thankfully no fire on one evening and we were so impressed with how professional and stress free the evacuation procedure was dealt with by the mod security and all others involved the spa facilities are equally unique and professionally run super friendly and genuinely interested staff clean and relaxing environment and one of the best massages i ever had thanks michelle and team for the wonderful leads me to my final and equally special moment at w the rooftop terrace restaurant and bar spectacular sunset view delicious food veg and meat lovers alike and a really great atmosphere once again thanks to w top class family of staff w has something kind of wonderful with kind and wonderful staff we look forward to,1
1232,people really friendly whatever whenever works here fine w amsterdam pay you back your loyalty to the starwood is cosy nice environment breakfast is a bit small for a spoiled traveler in asia so europe is different therefore is good hotel is separated in two buildings what gives you an additional nice atmosphere drinks a great wonderful view and all in all a stay in w amsterdam is a remarkable stay,1
1233,i stayed at the w amsterdam perhaps times or so since it opened a couple of years ago in truth i had very mixed experiences there ranging from great to terrible most of the past negatives were the result of inadequate experience or training of hotel associates however during my last few stays i have expressed some of my service concerns to the staff at the w and i am pleased to report that i have noticed great improvements in service levels there are still kinks to be worked out but i happy to say that service levels are improving with time particularly around consistency of service level between different associates kudos to the team at the w and i will certainly be staying again i stayed thousands of nights in hotels and there are some very unique pro about this property try the rooftop pool long enough for short laps and incredible views an amazing spa in the bank building is actually quite nice but underutilized you be the only ones great centrum location if you runner you can run down and around vondelpark just to the south of the hotel a solid run if you into shopping or eating you be right in the middle of the spg platinum breakfast at the duchess is elegant and thanks to some memorable hotel associates charlie orlando yannick and andre look forward to seeing you all again soon,1
1234,i have previously stayed at the w amsterdam and had a less than a stellar stay i thoroughly thought about rebooking it when the time approached for our latest vacation but i happy that i did as there have been major improvements since our last visit check in there was a line at check in however it moved quite quickly and there was a friendly staff member socializing and asking if anyone wanted water or anything in line excellent customer service upon arriving at the check in desk we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded our new room was not ready however and the staff member let us know that they could text us when it was available i was a little wary about this since we were not contacted during our last stay but still provided our number she also let us know of the new additions to the w gym etc since our last visit when our room was ready the staff did promptly contact us and we were on our way room we had a wonderful room with a gorgeous view of the city as with usual w standards the room was very modern and beautiful it had the delicious smelling bliss amenities and interesting reading material as well location the w is very centrally located and it was easy to get to many places such as anne frank house or our canal cruise concierge we had exceptional service when asking for recommendations,1
1235,i generally love staying at w hotels and my first stay last year at the w amsterdam was truly special amazing room welcome amenity great sure the hotel has maintained its cool feel and general vibe however the personal touches seem to have fallen away it nice just not as compelling as it once that said the rooms are very nice modern and super clean the staff is personable albeit not particularly attentive the common areas are great the outside seating in the bar areas are among the very best in europe let alone be back for sure just sorry that my last stay was not as special as my past experiences,1
1236,hotel is very modern and in two different buildings across the street from each other our suite was in the old bank tower the building where the duchess restaurant gym and spa are located suite was large modern and provides a nespresso coffee machine and large mini bar not mini shower was kind of modern oval capsule with great water pressure bed comfortable wonderful light lots of windows there are black out curtains porter was my favorite restaurant had breakfast there everyday and dinner twice great food and service duchess had good food service not as good as at porters roof top soaking pool fun and nice of hotel is central convenient to all tourist attractions some longer walks away than others this hotel is not too far from the train station but we took a taxi into town from schiphol airport,1
1237,after reading the mixed reviews on trip advisor not sure what to expect the location has to be the best in amsterdam located just off dam square walkable to everything in the heart of the city restaurants attractions shopping trams train etc staff is young and energetic lots of staff always around to help both the duchess and mr porter restaurants are upscale and well laid out restaurant staffs are efficient and pleasant full european breakfast is vast fresh and well prepared rooms are nicely decorated and spacious only high praise for this w,1
1239,we have visited amsterdam many times but this is by far the best hotel we have visited we will be staying here every time from now on rooms services and bar and amazing perfect location stay here,1
1240,good hotel nice room located right in the center the restaurant and bar on the top floor have great food and a stunning view on a terrace is the smallest swimming pool i have ever seen with a view over the royal if you go to amsterdam and money is not to tight to mention for you this is the place to go,1
1241,we stayed at the w amsterdam exchange hotel there is another section of the hotel next door called the bank formerly a bank the gym is in the bank and had all the equipment you will need for a solid workout bench free weights bikes treadmill and weight machines you can eat breakfast at either the exchange or the bank the breakfast had a buffet but also about items that you can order as part of the breakfast omlets scrambled eggs etc our room was a standard size but hip and was well laid out and we had a view of the busy amsterdam streets the location was in walking distance to everything one of my favorite parts of the hotel was they offered a whatsapp number for their whatever whenever customer service if we had a question or needed something it was as easy as texting them via whatsapp and they were very prompt in replies as well as fulfilling our requests,1
1243,very nice hotel design and comfort of the room was excellent breakfast was very good staff were exceptional check in and check out was very slow due to computer use issues great location and great views from the top floor,1
1244,had probably the best massage ever at the away spa today was welcomed by jessica who was very friendly she showed me where the locker room which was extremely clean was and a towel bathrobe and slippers were provided by the now the best csaba the who gave an excellent deep tissue massage i truly think the best i ever had only improvement i could think of is that they probably should not mention the price of the massage on the confirmation emails they have sent to my email address since my girlfriend bought this for me as a gift and i should not have known that this is a really expensive massage,1
1245,this hotel is exceptional especially for the price it so stylish comfortable clean and fun everything in the hotel especially the rooms is designed to make a guest feel at ease the decor is both modern and funny with cork pinboards behind the bed so that information is presented in an engaging way the rooms are spotless everything works perfectly and the beds are extremely comfortable we slept like babies staff are helpful explaining the hotel area and tourist information expertly we would definitely stay here again next time we in amsterdam,1
1246,we loved this hotel we chose it partly because of the secure garage as we needed somewhere to park our van full of bikes which was great but it was perfect in every way very friendly and helpful staff with lots of suggestions for amsterdam newbies spacious and comfortable rooms a lovely breakfast and enough quirkiness and cool factor to satisfy our teenagers a great location too easy tram ride to the centre or rent bikes and ride through the lovely vondel park ca wait to go back,1
1247,very modern and chic rooms are detailed with a quirky bit and very roof terrace offers a great view of amsterdam and is very can enjoy a spa at the other part of the staff is very professional and nice,1
1248,i travel for business and pleasure internationally frequently i am a bit of a hotel snob the w blew me away everything was perfect because this trip was a family trip i had made a lot of special requests prior to arrival the hotel not only met but exceeded my expectations i have been to amsterdam many times first stay at the w in amsterdam it is now my go to hotel i stayed in the bank building it was fabulous,1
1249,not normally something i do as i believe that people have off days but i just had to comment on my recent stay at w hotels as i found the following to be causes of checked into the hotel from another hotel in the city as we changed our flights and wanted something a bit more in keeping with what we re used to and decided to book at the hotel at and went directly to the floor for check in we were advised that the room would be ready shortly and that they could take our bags and would be returned to us upon to the room and that they would contact us directly by text to advise the room s availability it came to and we had still not been contacts so we went through to reception where they d my payment card even though i had already provided full for recommendations of lunch and was given a suggestion of the focaccia dip and the spicy tomatoes the tomatoes were lovely but the focaccia was burnt and then asked about the spa facilities in the hotel and were advised that they were indeed closed for the day due to unforeseen being a guest at hotel de lerope in amsterdam i decided to visit w as it was a more modern hotel and thought that it would have a younger and more feel to it but this did not live up to the calling reception times over the period,0
1250,had a night stay in an exchange fabulous room given the style of the w it is not best suited for sharing with friends room was well appointed good amenities soundproofing interior exterior and use of property is spread out over two buildings across from each other exchange and bank the bank is more elegant with matching decor whilst the exchange is more loud and bright colours we had breakfast in day at the duchess bank and day at porter exchange the duchess has a limited buffet offering with most items available à la carte service somewhat poor porter has a wider buffet with a more mediterranean touch to it and excellent service and views with windows allowing sunshine in and an outside can rent a bike for w insider restaurant recommendation was quite,1
1252,the rooms were clean comfortable and small but lovely excellent air conditioning the breakfast was very good and varied i did not visit the restaurant or bar the staff was friendly and accommodating there is an elevator i was only there for one night but would stay again,1
1254,i loved my day stay at the bilderberg hotel jan luyken and highly recommend it the staff was extremely friendly courteous and helpful there is not a better location for visiting the amsterdam museums to hop a tram to sites a bit more distant my room was excellent great bed and many extra amenities,1
1255,wonderful staff they were always in a good mood and made our stay a delight good clean and spacious room and great location on saturday night the street in front of our room got a little loud but nothing to unbearable would highly recommend this hotel,1
1256,the hotel is very quaint and on a beautiful quiet street easily walkable to canals van gogh museum rijksmuseum wondelpark and anne frank house staff is very friendly and accommodating the rooms were small as expected but clean and comfortable worked well the breakfast was delicious eggs bacon cold smoked meats and cheeses fruit cereal breads etc the bartender was very friendly and wines by the glass reasonably priced,1
1258,we stayed one night before our cruise train from airport to centraal station then ten minute walk with our rolling luggage super location for walk around sight seeing canal boats nearby many nice restaurants and coffee houses very extensive breakfast buffet plus cooked to order selections easy fifteen minutes walk to cruise terminal the hotel staff is accustomed to cruisers and are available to help get your cruise bag tags securely fastened to your bags very comfortable bedding and quiet rooms though right near everything,1
1259,very good and clean hotel in the middle of the center the reception is trendy and fancy decorated the rooms are clean and quiet what is important in the center of amsterdam there is also a water boiler in the room,1
1260,nice hotel downtown of amsterdam close to many places and nice museums you really enjoy spend time in this nice hotelgreat service and beautiful rooms everything it walking distance thanks marriott,1
1262,very good location for our first trip to amsterdam super easy to find your way to many attractions walking from here and just a quick walk to the main train bus station water taxis also here for trips farther out note that the concierge has tickets on hand to seemingly all of the major tourist venues which can save time and money fair amount of decent dining options nearby as well rooms are above average for europe though you can hear some street noise very good lounge for rewards members,1
1263,hotel is nicely appointed and rooms are clean and modern except for the most important detail of them all room has no air conditioning we stopped in at the desk on three separate occasions to complain about how hot the room is and each time was told that it would be fixed only to find out right before bedtime that our room is one of the rooms that actually does not have air conditioning probably my miserable night in a very expensive hotel drenched in sweat and i travel a lot no excuse for letting out a room in summer with no air conditioning while it has a great location and pleasant staff this detail alone makes me put it on the never in summer months list,0
1264,we stayed here as part of our pre cruise tour very centrally located to the tram and walking distance to the square rooms were spacious and clean breakfast has a very good selection of items the concierge was very helpful with providing tickets to the tram museum as well as great suggestions on what to see and do,1
1265,although amsterdam is easy to navigate by foot this location was terrific it is close to the train station and tram lines the rooms are unique at least in the part where we stayed it appears that they have bought and renovated old houses and they have done a terrific job there are lots of restaurants very close the staff were also terrific and helped us with directions restaurant suggestions and tickets to museums,1
1266,this hotel is located in the old kinda part of downtown amsterdam great location near canal and train station walking distance to a lot of shopping restaurants are very close to hotel as had breakfast included but dinner was available at this hotel this month i guess or so rooms are clean but there is a lot of dust on the night stands the price is a bit high we had a room with queen bed for euro per is good,1
1267,the hotel is of a high standard rooms are small but very comfortable and equipped to a very good standard excellent breakfast with high level service the internet works well in all parts of the hotel the hotel location is excellent and the surroundings are full of restaurants shops and all the needs of the spoiled tourist,1
1268,great view of ronde lutherse kerk just across the street from our floor room the hotel was perfectly fine room with a comfortable bed the worked great expect plenty of tour groups and americans we were very pleased that we were able to check in early before after a long overnight flight from the us i suppose we were lucky that a room was available at that time but it probably did hurt to check in on the mobile app as an elite gold marriott member,1
1269,what a nice hotel the beds and linens are top notch the hotel itself carpet and halls are a but dated but the staff makes up for this every restaurant recommendation they gave us were perfect indian dutch italian we asked for directions to the museum and got roundtrip street car tickets right there as well as museum reservations as well this btw saved us countless hours in line at the van gogh museum another thing they recommended a great bike rental company which we used and the great doorman of our hotel as we rode by let us know our bike seats were too low and he came across the street to adjust them for us i regret that i forget his name but we gave him credit for us looking like locals all the other tourists riding around with their bike seats at the same level as their knees their personnel in the club level happy hour lounge are delightful it a bit warm in there though breakfast is also pleasant thank you,1
1270,fabulous location great staff wonderful restaurant and cafe best part was the location close to canals old amsterdam with good walking streets shops and restaurants only complaint very old mattress and uncomfortable bed stayed three nights and did sleep well,1
1271,location is very close to the train station but far enough away so do feel like you near a train station beds super comfortable and the gym is like a spa water fresh fruit towels great equipment and empty we asked for a quiet room which had a horrible view but it was literally what we asked for super quiet wifi is in the rooms free in the lobby ac works excellent we were sleeping in a fridge our only qualm was a super slow but we certainly were as upset as some of the people in line around us you on vacation people would definitely stay again,1
1272,great service good room size good breakfast within walking distance of everything you want to see in amsterdam was smooth and concierge was efficient and courteous good restaurants nearby i stay again,1
1273,stayed here in june for a business meeting i am weary of hotel rooms in amsterdam they are usually space constrained but this this was huge compared to the other hotels i have stayed in amsterdam just avoid staying in rooms that are located on the high street gets noisy at buffet is the usual but well made i had a couple of meals in room not particularly impressed never been in amsterdam anyway albeit maybe my experience has been limited a very good hotel much better than double tree which other colleagues stayed at and even has better rating on tripadvisor,1
1274,this hotel is close to everything a traveler needs but be careful if you follow the direction by foot provided by hotel web from central station the direction is designed for local people who is familiar with their surrounding but it s not easy to follow as a foreigner the service is very good the concierges are very helpful one block from the hotel is a tourist street full of small restaurant and souvenir shops and the price are less than in the major shopping area two blocks from the hotel full of stores for local such as flower shop super market my friend and i stay in this hotel for two nights and we do appreciate the convenience of the location,1
1275,stayed here one night and was impressed with their service the kind of service marriott was always known for we been disappointed with other properties the last few years this one stood out for its employees and the very pleasant room clearly they train their employees well the location is very central an easy walk to much of what the city has to offer had a problem with the bill when we checked out but it seems to have been handled quite seamlessly,1
1276,we spent two nights at the marriott renaissance amsterdam prior to a river cruise the hotel was easy to find from the central train station took a direct train from the airport we arrived early morning and our room was not ready but we hung out in the executive lounge which offered snacks coffee and free internet the hotel rooms are very nice spacious and clean the bed was super comfortable and the shower was great the front desk staff were very helpful pleasant we walked everywhere the hotel is in a very central location i highly recommend this hotel and i would stay there again,1
1277,nice rooms great location wonderful breakfast the staff is also quite friendly and helpful i would absolutely stay there again it is part of the marriott family it is an easy walk from centraal station where you arrive by train from the airport,1
1278,we stayed at this hotel one n night before boarding a river cruise we received a platinum upgrade the room was nice with a courtyard view this hotel also was great in communicating with me as i had luggage shipped there pre arrival through luggage forward i can not fault the only complaint is that it was hard to find a seat in the executive lounge and it was difficult to get food there must have been a lot of platinum members when we were there,1
1279,we stayed in this hotel as part of a tour group the rooms were large about the same size as a us hotel room clean and well organized hotel is in a good location only a brief walk from the main metro station that will take you most places within the city breakfast was amazing with a big variety and good quality concierge was also very helpful and willing to help i would stay here again no question only real downside was how busy the place was,1
1280,we stayed at the renaissance as part of our post trip extension to a viking cruise the staff was very courteous and extremely helpful the rooms were very nice and however our room was at the front of the hotel on the second floor and we could hear everything happening in the street below us all night long horns blowing people talking etc the location is very convenient for but ask for a room in the back of the hotel the scenery outside your window might not be the best but at least you will get some sleep at night,1
1281,nice clean hotel and good location room was clean and good amenities in the room minute walk from amsterdam square plenty of bars and eateries near by to the hotel only drawback on the room was the ceiling was quite low in our suite and if you over then you will bang your head on the wooden beams around the room,1
1282,hotel located at a very convenient place down town old but refurbished building clean facilities with modern decoration in lobbies and restaurant my personal opinion is that the hotel is overpriced comparing its level of services and image with similar hotels in big european cities,1
1283,as location is ideal hotel staff is very friendly check in was painless check out was automatic room was clean had electric kettle and note they should have also water and some creamer for the coffee by the way room was small but adequate only thing was that i could hear the people in the room next to me and needed ear plugs the walls seem to be quite thin if you luck out and get loud you could be in trouble did not take breakfast as it was very pricey shower was actually a bathtub with a shower water pressure was on the weak side no robe provided bed was comfortable price reasonable worked fine,1
1284,the renaissance in amsterdam is incredibly well located and convenient for anything you might want to do in the city i recently stayed there with my wife and daughters for two days we were able to easily walk to all of the things we want to do and see this included the anne frank house the floating flower market the portuguese synagogue and the red light district we also were a very easy minute walk from the pizza canal cruise that we took the hotel is up to date with top notch amenities the main restaurant looks great although we did eat there we did enjoy drinks and snacks in the bar and the outdoor cafe our rooms were well appointed and fairly large the beds were quite comfortable the hotel staff was friendly attentive and incredibly helpful with directions and restaurant reservations highly recommend this hotel,1
1285,we are marriott people so for our first visit to amsterdam it was going to be a marriott hotel we could decide between the marriott in the city center or the renaissance i read all the trip advisor reviews finally we chose the renaissance and i am so glad we did the location is just great we walked to the anne frank house and to the canal boat ride the management and staff were just top notch we were celebrating a wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a wonderful suite the royal suite i think it was room ask for it the club lounge was great the restaurant for breakfast was great ca say enough about how we enjoyed this marriott property,1
1288,we stayed at this hotel for a short break in december and it was brilliant the room was perfect the beds were so comfortable and the hotel staff were so helpful could ask for better service we asked the concierge for a recommendation for dinner not only did they recommend a beautiful restaurant i wish i could remember the name of but they also called and got us a table we knew we were in for a treat the minute we walked through the door it was an italian restaurant just across the road from the hotel on the main road in whole a wonderful stay convenient for everywhere in amsterdam,1
1289,overall a good experience location is great and the concierge was very helpful and recommended excellent restaurants the first drawback was they put us in room and it was very noisy it was as if the window was wide open even thought it were closed it was a very active party weekend in the city so there was no way to sleep with the noise we requested another room which they provided with no question i feel from their response that they know these are a noisy block of rooms and they anticipated the room change request also we had drinks in the bar a few evenings and the services was slow no refill requests from the waiter and we had to hunt him down to pay the bill but generally a good hotel and we wold stay there again,1
1290,i have stayed at this hotel on trips to amsterdam and i love it it is within an easy walk from centraal also is in a quiet location yet is easily accessible to a lot of the major tourist sights either by walking or tram the concierge room was excellent also the hotel was very accommodating to get me into my room as fast as possible after my flight i highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here on my next trip to amsterdam,1
1291,the hotel was really clean but never left enough towels the turndown service was a hit or miss the hotel staff was very friendly except the hotel bartender that would never visit our table to see if we wanted more drinks the breakfast buffet was very tasty but for some reason we kept getting invited to the preferred lounge it was a very small buffet compared to the main buffet the hotel is very centrally located excellent spot we would stay at this hotel on our next visit,1
1292,this is a fantastic high standard hotel located in one of the best prime locations in amsterdam which can be rare to find in city towns of amsterdam very clean rooms were great and good size local to many attractions at pretty much walking distance and located in an area you wo get bored of day or night staff are friendly and polite other stayers were also nice and polite no hassle or trouble local area is also pretty much safe and quiet in the night can be a little expensive but if you look out for deals you can catch yourself a great value trip no complaints would ideally like to be always staying in a hotel like this for european destinations,1
1293,i stayed here in july while in amsterdam the location of the hotel is great it is within walking distance to almost everything the staff was helpful and attentive the room was clean in my opinion the finishes in the room were a little below what i would expect from a star hotel or a renaissance hotel in the us but it was too big of a deal and the made up for executive lounge was well maintained and served a good variety of food throughout the in all a good stay,1
1294,needed a hotel for a weekend in amsterdam the services had to include at least a wifi network good enough to work from this was a good booking was made via the website which is a little flashy but extremely efficient if you want to make a booking it also helps if you are a member of the loyalty the hotel in walking distance of central station was easy and was efficient our wish for a particular type of room was also granted as we were very early to check wifi was good enough to do one last over as well and that got work out of the and bed were excellent marriott quality as did not try breakfast but had ours a the koepelcafe and at lpqnl both just around the corner the koepelcafe is part of the hotel so you can even charge it to the room on this rainy weekend the hotel lounge with firepace also came in handy the concierge desk was able to arrange a for us on sunday it rained but those boats are covered checkout was easy and we could leave the luggage in store until our departure in all a good hotel for a weekend in amsterdam,1
1295,the renaissance amsterdam does what it says it gon na do the hotel is super design is very nice modern efficient the rooms are clean but low water pressure in the shower and the sink extremely slow was above average nice of the staff very friendly especially the a bit generic but that exactly what we a warning it is heavily used by american tour groups so it can get quite chaotic in the lobby and at breakfast,1
1296,my wife and i were booked for five days at this hotel because it was the conference venue for an event at which i was speaking we were also sponsors of this event well our visit was a farce from start to finish largely due to this incredibly inept we booked months in advance and were relegated to a tiny room on the outside of the sixth floor as we were on the outside perimeter of the building the walls were slanted just under the roof as such it was very difficult for two people to move around in this small room and we had to do this for five nights even worse the bed was simply too small for two people i measured it to under cm my wife and i were constantly pushing each other over the side during the night we asked to be moved but the hotel apparently had no other rooms curiously a colleague booked a room at a remarkably better rate about a month before the conference and had a spacious room on the third floor with a big bed and two chairs she arrived a day later than we did i had to send some documents to the united states and needed a fedex envelope the reception said there was no business center but i should talk to the concierge the concierge referred me to the business center one flight down the business center said the fedex envelopes could be obtained from the,0
1297,this hotel typically caters to business travelers although i was on an extended family vacation i wanted to try this property given its wonderful central location near the railroad station we had friends near rotterdam whom we visited using the speedy and comfortable trains available in the netherlands generally the hotel fully met my expectations the service was excellent and the hotel had a special room for its elite travelers that served a full delicious breakfast as well as snacks later in the day the room was somewhat problematic in one area we could not obtain a comfortably cool temperature during the first two days of our four day stay the temperature in amsterdam was unseasonably warm and humid during our stay when i brought the problem to the attention of the hotel staff their initial response was to give us a portable fan which helped somewhat but did not give us the level of comfort that we were hoping for finally on the third day after insisting that the room was still too warm we received a visit from a building engineer who fixed the problem and we enjoyed the room which had a very comfortable bed and an excellent shower during the remainder of our stay i would recommend this hotel although i would also suggest strongly advocating for quick action if you find the temperature of your hotel room not to your liking,1
1298,a bit of a wild duck definitely a tourist hotel lots of retired americans and people with kids floors are big so the elevators bring loads of people through the halls just use ear plugs and put a towel under the gap of the door and you will be fine rooms are either smaller or a bit greater club is great restaurant is bad bar is awesome concierge and staff are wonderful location is amazing price is good i say go but keep the things above in mind i stayed there on business for more than weeks,1
1299,my wife and i stayed in july for nights the room was nice but not very clean the coffee cups had been cleaned since the last guests and the mini bar food was covered in dust we had a picnic in vondel park and requested a couple of forks and spoons from the staff but they would not help us and told us we had to go to the supermarket to get them we also asked the front desk to mail out a postcard for us already had postage just needed to be dropped in the mailbox and it was never biggest issue i had was with the way they handle do not disturb we were out late and wanted to sleep in so we switched on the do not disturb light this was days out of our there instead of housekeeping just skipping our room they had the front desk call us we were trying to sleep hence do not disturb but they insisted on double checking that we did want to be disturbed this is the opposite of what the phrase do not disturb means,0
1300,my wife and i stayed here last weekend just to get away for a couple wow tara on the main desk is a legend after the free upgrade to the honeymoon tower suite and complementary bubbly and chocolates all within the first moments of the staff refusing to take tips and all making you feel very location with views of the vodel park main entrance and leidsplien directly oppisite the main holland casino just off the main hussle leidsplien will be using this hotel again in the future,1
1301,my wife and i spent four nights at the park hotel and enjoyed the stay the hotel is very clean modern and quite it is a block from vondelpark and very convenient to many other attractions and the trams are handy and easy to use for more distant attractions bed was very comfortable bathroom was spotless and well stocked with towels and toiletries very diverse only in amsterdam range of items for sale in the room we did partake staff members were all very friendly and and out was a breeze we checked in early and left our bags until later it did rain a bit while we were there but hotel provided umbrellas for guests great place to relax and enjoy amsterdam,1
1302,the hotel is on a main bus and tram route the rooms are well appointed with a view over the city the staff were most helpful and booking to all the museums was made so easy walking amsterdam from this central hotel was a pleasure,1
1303,efficient pick up and check in front desk staff were helpful in directions and also made the effort to arrange a food box when i need to go on an early train trip before their breakfast starts the room is really clean well and newly designed and compact hotel breakfast was fantastic enables a few choices of different savoury and sweet staff at hotel breakfast always so friendly early in the morning near to museums as well as tram stops which were really convenient when i go for my conference or walk around the city would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time i visit amsterdam,1
1304,nice rooms and excellent location can be a bit noisy if room is facing the main street clean room friendly staffeasy access to majority of attractions and restaurants nearby location is key so i highly recommend this hotel,1
1305,i stayed here in the of july and was disappointed at the approach of the hotel my colleague and i used the hotel tonight app to book the hotel we paid usd to book the hotel on the same morning which i though was a good deal considering the lovely location of the hotel at the time of check in we had to pay an additional euros to get single beds instead of sharing a bed and were told that we were being upgraded room was small and not worth the additional money or upgrade check out time was noon and i had an evening flight the next day i therefore wanted to request for a late check out i asked if i could come back at pm from my meeting and change in the room and leave the hotel at pm the receptionist said she would check with her superiors and call me back response was that they wanted an additional euros for each extra hour they seemed extremely opportunistic at every stage and not the sort of experience that leaves a good taste bell boys were good,0
1306,the paul hotel is in a wonderful location a short walk to the museum district great restaurants and nightlife our room faced one of the canals which we loved canal cruises are offered right across the street and you can even buy tickets at the hotel at a discounted rate hotel staff super friendly and helpful will definitely stay here again,1
1307,the park hotel is located on a canal within a block of the rijksmuseum van gogh museum and the iconic i amsterdam a street stop is within a block and vondel park and leidseplein are both easy walking distance the hotel itself is extremely well kept we were in a room facing the street behind the hotel and accessed by an elevator past the lobby the room was a little unusual but surprisingly modern with a really comfortable bed it was very warm during the weeks we in amsterdam and the worked very well hotel staff was excellent,1
1309,this hotel is in the middle of the mix in amsterdam it is walking distance to most things but also a quick tram or bus ride to other areas the hotel itself is modern with a cool hip vibe the room was on the small side but it had everything one would need the staff here is great,1
1310,the hotel is fully up to date room was large enough and nicely decorated we looked out on the is right next to the hotel and the top musuems are a few blocks away close to leidesplein which has many bars restaurants coffee shops etc trams and bus transport are convenient good experience,1
1311,nice budget hotel very comfy bed good collection of tv stations limited complimentary water bottle in the room not that it matters unless you do like tap nice staff and great lobby to relax it is very central so easy to go to many places and also next door to the shopping area and there is a park next door which i will highly in all i will recommend it,1
1312,we stayed here for a few nights a year ago we loved the location right near to the museum and the canal boat trip loved the local people they were so friendly and helpful the hotel was quirky and the room was clean and big enough with a comfy bed the breakfast was vast and so enjoyable in a great spacious restaurant the town was beautiful with large squares and outdoor dinning with great restaurants and coffee shops i love holland,1
1313,be careful of not getting what you booked i was given a room with single beds when i booked a despite many rooms still being available on this night i was told it was my problem and i have to pay to upgrade if i wanted a bed according to the front desk they had changed my room at some time between my booking and my arrival,0
1315,this was a totally positive experience from early no problem store your bags to the sublime view across the city from floor to the facilities in the room especially bathroom get those dimmerlights for navigating in the dark but my admiration is especially warm for the breakfast team professional yet totally convincingly concerned for our every need everyone looked genuinely happy to help and contribution apparently i was first to request a strawberry jam styled pancake i loved it so why not try it and the chilled apples in a bowl on every landing thoughtfulthe park will always be in my top for local tips message the flying engishman budget air,1
1316,we chose the park hotel because of its proximity to the museum and antique district we were not disappointed a special thank you to the staff who were quite accommodating and friendly it was quite helpful that they have a parking garage at the property also the breakfast was delightful,1
1317,walking distance to major museums a great park and the canal cruise is right across the street we stayed one night after our cruise the room is spacious we had a nice view of the canal the coffee maker worked well wifi is free but make sure to bring your own adaptor for switch otherwise there is no place to plug a usa charger they did not have one at the reception we could purchase one for if we wishedthey stored our two suitcases for us for the night the breakfast was not included and was expensive,1
1319,we really disappointed with service here especially the night manager was so rude to we arrived hotel too early by accidentally at but we have reservation on that day we already noticed that check in time at and we are pleased to pay for early check in unfortunately hotel is fully booked i moved to sit at the lobby to seeking for other hotel for that night but the night manager not even allow us to have a sit in the night which is outside as we stayed this hotel before our luggage still in their storage room he said that he didnt know us i already informed my previous room no coz he not even allow us to use toilet as well moreover he keep threaten us if we still sitting in the hotel he will call police and cancel our booking after that a security guy came to us he was recommended us to go to the train station which is public area and everyone can have a sit there it so funny right see how your staff treated us,0
1321,park hotel is centrally located it close enough to walk to the red light district approximately minutes or you can take the tram euros the hotel is near the van gough museum and shopping the rooms are very clean the staff super friendly and helpful i strongly recommend this hotel for its exceptional service professional staff and reasonable price you can take the bus from the airport euros it leaves you blocks from the hotel approximately minute bus ride a taxi from the airport will cost euros,1
1322,just spent nights here with my teenage daughter great location and hotel staff in reception wonderful the living room concept really works and a very pleasant place to sit and relax the macaroons from the jewellery bar were delicious bike hire cheap and decent bikes thoroughly recommend this hotel,1
1323,we had a wonderful stay in this hotel i noticed that a lot of reviews mentioned the hotel room that has a small bathroom that is part of the room please read the room descriptions when booking your stay we read the descriptions and realized we did not want the smaller bathroom therefore we booked the slightly larger room at a slightly higher price the cost of this room was still excellent and our room was very comfortable we overheard a couple in the lobby expressing concern about the smaller room and the staff member was very nice and offered to change their room to the larger room for just the small cost difference my sister and her husband stayed in the smaller room and the size did bother them the location of this hotel is perfect we were so excited to see all the art museums we could have walked everywhere we wanted to go but i sprained my ankle the first day we were so close to the tram stop that i did not miss out on any of the touring even with my injury we did have to use any transportation one day to sum up the location is superb the staff was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable,1
1325,true dutch hospitality clean rooms good location helpful staff great breakfasts i highly recommend this place the stairs are steep i was on the floor and it was quite the workout but i still recommend this,1
1327,very nice hotel in the central parts of amsterdam it a hotel with personality and good atmosphere you are welcomed by an armor in the reception and there are some collections of other nice things to look at in the lounge we had one of the rooms on top floor so there was a few steps to climb i the steep and narrow stairs but that is okay when you know it and are in kondition to do it no lifts available the breakfast room is bathing in sunshine if it not cloudy of course and there is a just what you need breakfast to choose from as we say in sweden lagom we are very happy to have found this hotel and if we return to amsterdam we will stay at this hotel again,1
1328,we had a lovely stay at the wiechmann hotel we loved the world charm throughout this hotel our rooms were full of antique furniture which made you feel like you were really in historic amsterdam we booked canal view rooms and loved seeing the boats travelling the canals breakfast had an excellent selection to cater for all tastes this is a family run establishment and the staff are so very helpful with everything the hotel is an easy walk to the main tourist loved our stay here we would definitely stay here again,1
1330,we stayed in the weichmann hotel for several nights with canal view on the second floor the hotel and room were charming and comfortable everyone working at the front desk was friendly and they helped with any questions we asked the location is convenient for walking anywhere in central amsterdam there is a grocery store around the corner as well as many bars and restaurants nearby the room was huge and had a beautiful we stayed in the weichmann hotel for several nights with canal view on the second floor the hotel and room were charming and comfortable everyone working at the front desk was friendly and they helped with any questions we asked the location is convenient for walking anywhere in central amsterdam there is a grocery store around the corner as well as many bars and restaurants nearby the room was huge and had a beautiful view through several windows of the streets and canals breakfast was included with the room and it was convenient and of good quality the decor was traditional and comfortable with a feel i would definitely stay at the weichmann if returning to amsterdam especially if i would be able to have a room again the table in the room was a perfect place to sit with the windows open relax in the evenings after a busy day of touring and watch the people of amsterdam pass by by bike and through several windows of the streets and canals breakfast was included with,1
1331,the hotel is located at the opposite of sloterdijk station the location is very good as far as you have fast access to the center of the city by using tram or bus the station is less than min walking from the hotel during the night it is very quiet the rooms are large and clean staff is friendly,1
1333,hotel is very new and modern only mins walk from the sloterdijk station if you want to go to downtown only station from amsterdam central to sloterdijk almost every train to other city always pass this spot very good breakfast and it a must that you need to try staffs are friendly attentive and caring only one thing we miss is to visit the rooftop bar the gym is also good and hours room is big and very comfortable maid is also nice we stayed in the dutch maid is kind and attentive she cleans our room immediately when we asked her to do even it too late to clean as we woke up so late this is a compliment for her if i have a chance to come back to amsterdam again i will stay here again,1
1334,this hotel was simply perfect i could not find a fault if i tried location was great just a short walk to the station and one stop into amsterdam central the hotel has been beautifully done up and had a gorgeous seating area with fire in the reception where you can check in and print off your boarding passes with ease at no cost the rooms were quiet comfortable and had everything you needed including iron hairdryer toiletries the staff were friendly helpful and made you feel instantly welcome,1
1335,stayed here for a nights it a good cheaper alternative than staying in the middle of amsterdam the hotel is very modern and clean it a minute walk to the train station trains run every few minutes to the centraal station it in between the centraal station and the airport it suited our needs but would recommend if you plan on partying past in amsterdam when the trains stop running as you will need to catch a taxi back,1
1336,one of the best mercure hotels i have stayed in spacious rooms clean hotel close to the station close to the central station very easy to reach from the airport friendly and considerate staff nice breakfast spread will be back,1
1337,very nice and polite service always with a smile were able to arrange gluten free bread for breakfast which was a big bed great breakfast and quiet would definitley recommend thanks for a great stay,1
1339,i did not have one good nights sleep at this hotel and i was there for nights for a work course the mattresses are tiny i had two single mattresses put together to make a double bed they caved in the middle meaning i could not sleep in a flat position i made a complaint to reception and housekeeping told me that the mattresses had not been zipped up properly i tried the newly zipped mattresses the next night and they still caved in the middle i asked to change rooms and they told me they were full despite there being clear room availability online it was quite stressful because seemed to want to help and apparently is its a known issue that people accept so i just turned the mattresses degrees so at least they would cave in the middle but they were too short for the bed which brought its own issues given that a hotel should be geared up to ensuring its guests get good sleep i rate this as terrible a couple of my colleagues had exactly the same issues as me and the hotel did resolve it for them either no one checked in on me and when i mentioned it again on check out my time by this point the receptionist just said it was too late to doing anything unbelievable hence this review i would hate anyone to have the same experience as me and i would never book a mercure the rooms,0
1340,fantastic hotel great staff had great sound proofing black out curtains and welcome you receive and the atmosphere of this hotel makes the my view the best hotel due to having the best now really are excellent also and relaxing,1
1342,stayed in swissotel amsterdam for nights perfect location to go around are clean and nice desk is friendly and accommodating to get an early check in would return again to the hotel,1
1343,my recent stay at swissotel amsterdam was made extra special by the duty manager albert hammerseth who went above and beyond to assist in making my stay both enjoyable and easy albert went out of his way and very kindly provided a room upgrade on arrival and also greatly assisted to ensure my laundry was arranged in a short timeframe the hotel is also in a great location adjacent to adam square,1
1344,fantastic hotel with great location were wonderful and room great fi was arrived early and they gave us our room at am and also was given a room also receive chocolates and a thank you for booking direct with the hotel,1
1345,my wife and i recently paid another visit to amsterdam staying at the swissotel on the damrak right next to dam square the hotel has recently had some renovations especially the restaurant which to me is modern dutch and very nice we stayed in a select room which was also recently renovated and had a terrific bathroom with a rain shower which i loved and like the rest of the room was kept spotless the one downside was i found the room on the small side with hardly enough room for my wife and i to pass each other between the bed and the desk but we soon got into a routine speaking about the bed which was very huge and comfortable but boy was it high i recon about feet there was even a menu for your pillows also there was no need to close the curtains just press a button and it was done we were there for an anniversary break and the hotel gave us a curtesy bottle of bubbly which was very much appreciated i had to check in online for our return flights but for some reason i couldn t complete this but the concierge called albert managed to do this for us saving time at the airport another great service from the very helpful staff at this hotel is in the perfect location for exploring the city there are bars restaurants shops red light area all within walking distance and believe me it s,1
1346,we had a better room last visit same price for this room we had to keep the curtains closed all the time as the general public shopping at the h m store next door looked straight in to our window as they left the store approx away saying that the room was very well kept serviced every day no complaints there the staff as always were very friendly helpful and courteous no complaints there at all the breakfast room was very well stocked with all types of food small complaint with the hot food it was more often cold all in all i still think it is a class hotel but have marked it down for the reasons noted above i will still go back next year,1
1347,my wife and i selected the swissotel amsterdam primarily for it location in the heart of the city overlooking dam square the hotel is only minutes walk from amsterdam centraal station and due to flight times we arrived before the hotel pm check in this was no problem to the hotel and reception staff in particular we had a coffee and our room was ready within an hour and what a room our room window overlooked dam square with the benefits that brings whilst travelling for work i have stayed in some wonderful hotels in numerous countries but could only describe our room facilities as tremendous extra spacious room with flat screen tv excellent simple wifi connection comfortable modern furnishings with ample storage facilities wonderfully comfortable extra king size bed spacious luxurious bathroom with separate shower and bath ample luxurious towels and complimentary toiletries i must praise the reception staff rob in particular who could not have been more helpful on numerous occasions his assistance and knowledge were a great help we made a great choice and had an excellent weekend break,1
1348,we needed to stay in amsterdam for night on the way from belgium back home in hong kong we chose swissotel because of good experience with them in other countries and because of the location we would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1349,overall this is a fine hotel the rooms are comfortable clean and attractive the bathrooms while not large are nice indeed a great shower and easily accessible the bed was large and quite comfortable only thing that keeps this from being a is that while helpful staff attitudes always felt like they were doing you a favor by engaging you i asked for help on a transportation issue at one point and got the distinct feeling that i was asking for something completely outrageous which i was and i really did need to be reminded four times that smoking was not allowed in guest rooms i do smoke never have to be perfectly fair the concierge did give me a really great recommendation for a restaurant for dinner perhaps on balance that makes it other comment i make on this is that if you book this hotel please keep in mind that it is quite literally right on dam square and that means that once you walk out the door you in the middle of a massive flow of people particularly during peak summer tourist season upside you a five minute walk from pretty much anywhere in amsterdam including centraal station,1
1350,my work booked me here during a recent visit to amsterdam on the basis it was a quality hotel close to centrale railway and it certainly is rooms have recently been refurbished and are very comfortable although my room was not spacious just enough room to walk around the king size bed and open wardrobe door bathroom was small and lacked hooks to hang anything on but shower was fabulous a nespresso machine bathrobe slippers and ironing equipment all provided room was quiet with good black out blinds staff were pleasant and very helpful when i needed them to follow up a problem breakfast was great and the staff there were delightful,1
1351,as i visit amsterdam on a regular basis i always stay in the swissotel the hotel go above beyond to cater for you as a member of the swissotel club the bookings are always quick i just ring up give my name my information comes up all the time transfer from the airport can be arranged if needed i always picked up by a nice driver waiting at the arrivals gate with your name on a card so your can not get lost the driver always has refreshments available in the car when you arrive at the hotel staff always friendly always ready to help i stay in city view suite which has a great view of dam square rooms are nice big airy with plenty of light coming in the suite consists of a living room a separate sleeping area the glass bathroom is really really nice hotel always leaves little gifts that always nice to see ever since i found this hotel ago i never stayed anywhere else i visit amsterdam times a year overall i would recommend the swissotel to anyone perfect location perfect staff,1
1353,good hotel in great location nice clean room and bathroom we stayed on the second floor on the street side and it was noisy so book a room higher up or away from the street house keeping not as attentive with replenishing supplies we had to ask the concierge for shampoo and body wash,1
1354,customer service is amazing and location is perfect this is the place i always stay in usiness or pleasure stays i recommend it to any and all going to amsterdam the check in experience is made so great because when i walk into the hotel they know my name thank you ruby,1
1355,upon arrival we were upgraded to our surprise to a king suite room on the third floor staff helpful and friendly very clean and comfortable we did eat at the hotel restaurant as we chose to use some of the many nearby great location and walking distance to the river canals and other attractions overall we loved this hotel,1
1356,it should be minutes walk from amstel station which is a transport hub with trams buses metro lines and overground dutch trains all stopping there tram takes you to the main museums and musical concert place in about minutes you could go from the airport one stop to zuid and then metro stops up to amstel a bit quicker than going via central station the hotel is modern and clean,1
1357,i travelled with friends for a short trip to amsterdam and we were delighted with hotel casa the tastefully furnished lobby immediately conveying a relaxed inviting atmosphere with reliable wifi and helpful service who were very patient with two bedraggled exhausted international travellers who needed to have everything repeated twice to make sure they had it right our room albeit a shoebox met our needs perfectly and the beds provided restorative sleep after our excursions the restaurant was a godsend if slightly expensive and their breakfast buffet has something for everyone,1
1358,room were clean and the hotel is easily accessible from the international airport a ride would be around check in staff are helpful and polite rooms were comfortable and meet basic needs,1
1359,stayed nights on business attending a conference at the hotel the location is not really central which in this instance was not a problem the hotel has some nice design elements although can not be deemed a design hotel strictly speaking the rooms are rather standard clean with recent furnishing you will note that the website advertise the rooms as then mentions a surface of sq m so i guess it all depends on your own definition front desk was helpful both at and when ordering a taxi overall the hotel is good value and could be considered for leisure as well notwithstanding its location,1
1360,a nice clean and friendly hotel a little away from centraal but a min walk from the amstel station busstand and tram all metros pass by amstel from staff was great and friendly when we asked for help we got it including a little early checkinthe rooms was quiet and comfortable and would recommend it if you are visiting amsterdam for a holiday and plan to move around,1
1361,loved this hotel a simple room but comfy nice big windows free wifi the included breakfast was epic amazing coffee shop and restaurant too great price for nights thanks to the friendly staff,1
1362,i stayed with my boyfriend for nights and it was a nightmare the staff staff members are friendly as long as you do have complains location location is good its station away from central station and you can get into the city within min the hotel is located close to the station so its a very short walk there not much around the hotel area but you can just go to the the room was nice and clean however no one came to clean are room for nights out of the shower was broken and it flooded the entire bathroom we called every night to get it fixed and get someone to clean our room the response was thank you for letting us know i busy atm with checkout i let my college know we would get extra towels and that would be it no one came to fix the shower this happened for three nights in a row obviously they did do anything to fix it or were apologetic about the problem if you can avoid this hotel i recommend you do it is an ok price for amsterdam but sometimes it just not worth the trouble be aware that it might be charge for city tax,0
1363,this hotel had poor service and it has employees that do apologise and instead say thank you for bringing this to our attention the location is okay you can get to the city in bedroom was adequate but our shower would flood the bathroom completely and we had to use plenty of towels to stop this i asked them about the shower and they said they would get someone to fix it and have extra towels brought up we came back that evening and no one had serviced our room the shower still flooded and we had no fresh towels when i called they said that it was a busy day with check outs no apology they sent someone up minutes next day they also did service our room i asked them about this and all they said was we will send my colleague with new towels for you they came with new towels and for the first time i received an apology that no one had seen to our shower or serviced our room for our final day someone had fixed the shower and replaced towels but it was too little too recommendation book a hotel closer to the city and avoid this place if you planning on staying more than night,0
1365,i love hotel casa reasonable pricing for overnight stays room was spacious clean and had everything we needed lovely bathroom and shower beautiful architecture and lovely big windows in all the rooms but what really made this place were the people all of the staff were very welcoming and friendly and the hotel has a reputation for being good for partying which is perfect for me after a heavy night out the staff were happy to order is a pizza that we ate in the lobby at there is also a rooftop bar with stunning views across the dam overall i would recommend,1
1366,great hotel very comfortable ideally located for easy access into city centre and staff were very helpful it is obviously a newer built hotel and the of fittings is evident and much appreciated keep up the good,1
1367,this is a very nice hotel just a little outside the city centre but you can easily reach the centre by train tram or subway only three stops the rooms are comfortable with great beds and a beautiful bathroom and the staff is professional but very friendly and they make you feel really welcome this hotel is an excellent choice whether you are staying for business or for pleasure,1
1368,our family slept there nights july and july our teenagers got rooms close to us and they got single bed as requested the beds was sooo good nice rooms and a shower that really washed the mothers thick hair other hotelrooms you can nearly see and feel the water the breakfast was boring and should have been included as in norwegian hotels easy parkingspace,1
1369,very nice new hotel very nice reception and rooms are very clean i love the way your dont disturb sign is good location i really recommend this hotel for anyone whos visiting amsterdam you can rent a bike from the reception employees are very kind and helpful,1
1370,stayed in hotel casa for night for business very nice hotel high quality at very competitive price excellent location few minutes walk from the metro station great staff service at and easy and quick queue free you drop your key in a box at reception if you already paid at rooms are spacious and quite wifi works well in all common areas and rooms very good breakfast served in their nice restaurant which is also open until am for drinks and snacks after terrace at the floor to highly recommended,1
1371,located in a central area travel really easy trams etc really close fantastic staff modern rooms fantastic terrace bar with great views of the city worth a visit food good would stay here again,1
1373,from amstel station on foot really good service luggage storage they even let us borrow a vacuum to suction our luggage compresser bags amazingly soft bed i could stay in a nice lounge and restaurant there too,1
1374,just back from days in amsterdam where we stayed at the casa the staff were welcoming and helpful the room was clean and well appointed travel links are really good as you would imagine with regular connections to all the sights and the airport we had dinner in the restaurant on two of the evenings which was very good and again the service was great,1
1375,our stay at casa was magnificent everyone that we dealt with from front desk coffee bar and east restaurant were awesome room was clean and very comfortable beautiful location close to central amsterdam and public transportation look forward to a return stay,1
1376,the hotel was clean and modern and the price was reasonable location was great as there is amstel station less than minute walk which takes you stop into centraal station the tram stop is also outside station which takes you to the museum square the bar is ridiculously overpriced so i would bother there is a bar nearby with drinks and breakfast at a fraction of the price the bed was awful had some ridiculous mattress topper thing that slipped off the bed so then so did i the staff where professional but unhelpful and somewhat cold all in all it made for an average stay at a rather dull hotel,1
1377,this hotel is about a walk from the amstel metro station in amsterdam slightly southeast of the center it is a very modern hotel and its strongest point is its staff they are friendly helpful and seem to truly enjoy what they room was large and clean with a refrigerator we did not use only stayed night the bathroom was large and very had two problems with water the shower drain was apparently clogged which produced a small flood we called and this was promptly attended to and the bathroom also the toilet started leaking and would not stop running at one point but again a call to the front desk and this was also taken care of and the bathroom we were also offered free breakfast because of our restaurant east attached to the hotel is excellent and the food breakfast was also excellent and the staff helpful and would definitely stay here again,1
1378,price considered this was one of the most disappointing and poor value for money stays in a hotel i have experienced every staff member we spoke to during our stay lacked any sort of cheer and nobody seemingly wanted to be there for example it took us three attempts of asking to have additional pillows for the room the room itself was clean on arrival but by the end we were even getting new coffee and rooms themselves are very basic and seemed to be furnished with a will do attitude for example the curtains do reach the bottom of the window so light will always get in a quarter of our room was taken up by a desk which had no chair the shower had terrible drainage and almost no lip meaning every shower the room would flood there is no air conditioning unit in the room instead we got a rickety old fan which seemed the type from a bargain bin at a hardware store there is a thermostat thing it did do anything the hotel did offer extra services like breakfast and bike hire but all at a ridiculous surcharge breakfast was per person and bike hire was plus a deposit per bike we were surprised the wifi was free you could buy separate items for breakfast but they seemed to have gotten the price list from a budget a side note avoid the east restaurant at all cost there is a review on my profile the,0
1379,if you want a quiet hotel that is convenient for the city then casa is perfect the room was spacious and the shower was really strong the towels were changed everyday and the beds remade staff were very friendly and helpful we asked for an extra pillow one night to find out they did have any left and were told to ask again in the morning when we returned the following afternoon the maid had made up the beds with the extra pillow for hotel is right by amstel station that stops at various points in the city and goes all the way to central we never waited longer than or minutes for a train because they are so regular another plus is that you have to activate the lift with your keycard which stops any undesirables wandering about too the room came with a full size hairdryer not a useless wall mounted one like most hotels shampoo and shower gel were also provided as well as tea and coffee making facilities overall we had a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to amsterdam,1
1380,i really liked the environment and overall the atmosphere of the hotel the receptionist who welcomed us was very helpful and courteous one of the girls at the coffee shop was going her way to get my coffe right i really appreciated her efforts unfortunately i did not have the chance to try the restaurant but it looked busy all the time and again the atmosphere was cosy and welcoming the area is relatively easy to reach by transports and bike i loved the design of the hotel which reminded me a bit of a community place i will surely recommend casa hotel the room was a little small but clean and we had fresh towels every day i loved the terrace and its view with the style bar,1
1381,we stayed here in july we did know the hotel but given that we paid for a night we expected something very different this hotel is more of a hostal and charging that kind of rates is outrageous when asking the reception about this all we got was a cocky remark and a patronizing smile never again i can not recommend this place,0
1382,interior of the hotel is simple and modern very attractive and spaceous big rooms with comfy beds friendly staff location of hotel is easy accessable in quiet neighborhood yet very close to the city center we rented bikes at the hotel service and it is the best way to explore amsterdam definitely staying here anytime i come back,1
1383,my boyfriend and i stayed here for nights for a cheap getaway to amsterdam it the cleanest hotel i stayed at and is so easy to get from from central amsterdam took us minutes or less to walk from amstel station the roof top bar is so lovely drinks are abit pricey but the view makes up for it is also excellent they arranged a taxi to the airport for us when leaving very good facilities ca fault it,1
1384,i loved this hotel i went for one week to amsterdam for business and found the hotel amazing it has everything you need great service and the restaurant serves a very delicious food i really felt like home as i could have a cup of awesome coffee at their coffee place and a great there great rooftop bar with a nice city view,1
1385,had a great stay the hotel itself had great decor the staff were extremely helpful and all fluent in english if that a concern for you and the metro was less than a min walk with only a min ride to the big city center i also went running along the canal next to the hotel while there and there are lots of restaurant options nearby,1
1386,really cool hotel not far from center with nice bar on rooftop room was cozy staff was friendly breakfast also was good city center is couple of metro stations away also accessible by bike or even on foot if you do mind long walks,1
1387,located around kms from the centre this hotel is in a perfect location as it is not far from the metro station amsterdam centraal is just metro stations away around metres and at the same time it avoids the crowd and commotion of the centre i had a room in the floor which faced the small canal in front and i had a majestic view of the beautiful city through the wide glass covering the entire length of the wall of the room i had a very comfortable stay during my days at the hotel and the complementary breakfast was very good there is a restaurant and a bar on floor terrace and on the ground and floor service and food was really good the place is a little open so we get the breeze all the time there is albert heijn dutch supermarket chain at a distance of metres the neighbourhood itself is worth a walk there are a few quirky little hostels down the road some old houses decorated with flowers and big gardens along the same road the small canal in front of the hotel is surrounded by joggers path so one can walk and jog around like many of the locals in the area do,1
1388,excellent hotel and i can definitely recommend i visited amsterdam for four days nights with my daughter i found the staff friendly and was impressed with the is good minutes from amstel station i unfortunately had a leg injury so might have taken me longer the restaurants looked very nice but probably too pricey for us good location,1
1389,this is a good quality hotel offering good standards of service and accommodation at great just outside the city but only a few stops and a minute metro ride hotel casa is great for those wishing to avoid high city centre rates but still enjoy ease of access to all the attractions and sights it is remarkably easy to get quickly into the city centre the nearest metro station being only a very short walk good and efficient check in service was experienced from the reception staff and i was extremely happy to be welcomed particularly as we arrived early after our flight and it was nice to be greeted warmly with such pleasant service and be able to check into our room modern and bright the hotel has a nice vibrant feel our stay was only a short one and we did not have the opportunity to sample all of the facilities but the bar and coffee area looked great and the rooftop terrace was so nice and a relaxing place to spend time after a day in the room was a little on the small side but all very functional and ideal for the shorter stay the beds were particularly comfortable with really nice mattress toppers which made for a good nights sleep my only small criticism was the very small supply of tea and coffee making products that were available in the room i would have no hesitation in taking the chance to stay again at hotel,1
1390,hotel is a very good value of quality to money with very good location near to nice staff and good restaurant rooms are very clean and quiet with beautifull view i would recommend for visiting amsterdam,1
1391,found us a room here after another hotel cancelled our here all very friendly great beer selection roof top very cool and coffee shop very busy bed comfy room clean would use again,1
1392,walkable distance to everything but metro was min walk away hotel was clean and good facilities bar had a cool vibe to it and cocktails were good bedroom was very comfortable only negatives were towels were toooooooo small and there was no milk in the rooms for our morning brews,1
1394,was here for two nights good location not far from centre by walk service good rooms clean and comfy if i will come back amsterdam definitely will choose same hotel can definitely recommended great,1
1395,great hotel with friendly staff a nice coffee shop and good breakfast with a good selection located very close to amsterdam amstel station so easy to get to central amsterdam attractions and the airport,1
1396,the casa hotel is a really good hotel in the south of amsterdam city the rooms are modern and the beds are comfortable the staff in freindly and parking is affordable if you wan na go to town you can take the tram or the metro which are both very close to the hotel we would love to come back and spend a bit more than just one night at casa,1
1397,the rooms are very well designed and hotel casa has everything you need but keeps prices down by dispensing with everything you do need you have wifi and a large bed with nice you do have a bath with a bathrobe you do have a desk the length of the room to work or put your suitcase you do have plastic wrapped slippers you do have tv a kettle for tea and a and fridge you do have views of the city there is a good restaurant and everything you want from a hotel breakfast but you do have room service this is the perfect basecamp for people of all ages who are here to explore the city or work will definitely recommend it to my friends and colleagues francesca at the front desk is an angel,1
1398,my friend and i arrived and both of us were greeted by two people on reception they were extremely helpful and very positive the room was spacious and comfortable the shower was large and the bed was comfortable the location was our favourite thing about this hotel as it was minutes from amstel station and then a direct metro three stops to the centre it was very easy and convenient it was not right in the centre but close enough to it we were two girls traveling alone and felt very safe walking around we could not recommend this hotel more,1
1399,it was the second time i stayed there the location is fantastic a quiet neighbourhood away from the crowded damsquare but still very easy to be reached by metro or train amstelstation very clean room friendly staff and a lovely restaurant serving all meals until late,1
1400,stayed here for nights and loved it hotel is spotless location is nice and quiet and only a couple of minutes walk to the metro station where you can be in amsterdam station in less than mins beds are real comfortable and the rooftop bar is beautiful the food in the restaurant is very nice will be definitely be returning highly recommend casa hotel,1
1401,i stayed here with a friend for nights and as the title of my review suggests it was just right good location a couple of minutes walk from amstel station where you could get the metro to centraal or a tram into the museum district etc the room was adequately sized comfortable beds good shower clean and had a hair dryer we did have much interaction with staff but when we did they were polite and our room was cleaned daily the coffee was lovely slightly higher priced but nothing that would be expected of a hotel near the centre of amsterdam food was tasty and the coffee was fabulous we only ate here once as we mostly ate when we were out free wifi and a water foundation were both helpful there was really anything locally but we spent all our time in the city so this made no difference to us and to be fair we did really explore the area if you are looking for a comfortable reasonably priced base when in amsterdam with easy access to the main city then this is just right,1
1402,everything excellent about this hotel first and foremost they provided me an early checkin at in the nice reception area big and clean to tram train and metro station amstel station didnt see any supermarket closeby we did had meals included but their restaurants very mostly busy implying that the food and service was also good in suggestion is to provide multiple key cards,1
1403,we stayed for two nights while visiting amsterdam and felt the hotel was very good good size modern rooms and all very clean and efficient the rooftop bar weather permitting was lovely to relax in at the end of the day the metro meant we could be in central amsterdam in about mins from leaving the hotel while we did make use of the restaurant it looked and had a good menu if you want you use the fridge for fresh milk and breakfast will certainly use this hotel again,1
1404,we were in amsterdam for a few nights and ended up staying at the hotel casa location it is about a minute walk from the amstelstation which is a decent hub or the metro lines stop hear and it is only about stops to central station and stops for other city center locations the sprinter and intercity trains also stop at this station in addition there are casa signs almost the whole way from the station to the hotel so you know which way to the hotel is clean with a big lobby the lobby also has tables set up where you can sit with your laptop and work and many people were doing so this hotel has a young vibe about it with what seemed to be a younger type crowd staying there it also has a great coffee bar in the lobby as well as a breakfast buffet wine bar and floor rooftop terrace however these all close at around pm and there is nothing really close by so if you want a late night plan on being out in the city at check in the staff was very the view in our room was not great we were overlooking the other side of the hotel so we basically looked at a building for days also if you on the side you can see into the rooms across the way so keep that in mind had i known this i would have asked for a different view or,1
1405,my family and i have recently just returned from a long weekend in amsterdam we booked the whole trip through expedia which was easy and saved up money a good bonus upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by a young hotel attendant although the was he helped us every step of the way and made sure we understood the system he continued to give us a piece of paper with transport information he told us which line to use the stop for the hotel and the final destination of the trams which was very useful the rooms were a very good size extremely comfy beds and very clean i would recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly return,1
1406,a wonderful hotel with very high standards i recommend it for families business trips and usual sightseeing advantages close to service and very amazing food and comfortable,1
1407,this was our third stay in amsterdam during a euro cycling trip we decided to stay outside the city center to avoid traffic noise and all of the tourists corendon is in amsterdam west and is miles from the city center by bike it is about minutes but is nice to ride through vondelpark the hotel is clean large has a nice restaurant for dinner and breakfast we had mediterranean fare at cor don after a long day of cycling into the city it was perfect our room was cozy and has air conditioning cold for the summer months there is a smoking cabin outside and covered bike parking the hotel also has a lot of mac bikes for rental if you looking to stay close to the city to walk do not stay here if you ok to take the tram are looking for nightlife just outside your doorsteps and enjoy some quiet corendon is suitable for that,1
1408,only a short tram ride from amsterdam city centre this hotel provides everything you need it is a good value very clean has super helpful staff excellent breakfast and a great bar we stayed for five days and it was great the best hotel experience i have had for a long time it is worth visiting you wo regret thank you,1
1410,lovely hotel it was about minutes on the tram into amsterdam but it was nice to sit and see the whole city also it meant it was quiet at night rooms were lovely and the spa downstairs was a lovely way to relax after walking all day get you second wind and go back into city we had breakfast included and there was plenty of choice,1
1411,i was there in june for night it an amazing hotel very quite friendly stuff helpful employees the room size was good also all the hotel was very clean from inside problem in it location near from the airport but far from the city centre,1
1413,this hotel is amazing and when i return to amsterdam i will be staying here again first off let talk price this is a star hotel and was euros cheaper than any airbnb i found and more affordable than hotels or hostels within the city center incredible deal staff is wonderful and friendly and the rooms are great the beds are ridiculously comfy my only gripe is the wifi can be finicky but it always worked in the end last thing to note is the location it is about a minute tram ride into the city which truthfully never bothered me as i got to see some lovely parts of amsterdam i had never seen before i love this hotel and i quite sure you will too,1
1414,we stayed as a group in the hotel for days to attend a tournament at amsterdam zuid the metro was very close to the hall and to the city center very good ratio the rooms were very clean and the air conditioning can be turn off we had fresh air even we could open any windows the breakfast with is high but was delicious,1
1415,it is a bit far from the city but close to metro and tram stations it will take you about minutes by tram to get to the city if you plan on doing day trips recommend delft if you have time by the way it is two metro stations away from zuid station and another one whose name i forget those are nicer stations than centraal to plan your day trips anyway the hotel itself is clean and the staff is professional breakfast is good though the same every day which i say if it is broke do fix it one very minor pet peeve with the place queen sized bed actually comes with two twin sized blankets on top so even with a queen bed you have enough continuous blanket for as if you were sleeping on a twin,1
1416,this hotel was lovely has a lovely snack bar downstairs with croissants and sandwiches the cocktails at the bar are lovely and the rooms are peaceful airy and comfortable food was also nice minute walk to the nearest tram stop which takes roughly minutes to get to the main area great for a city break,1
1417,clean and good hotel we stayed for night during the pride it was a good experience great service we arrived very early oçlock and we left our luggage behind at around midnight we picked it up and went to our room good clean room great view big windows we slept perfect the bathroom is a reasonable size good shower the breakfast was more than sufficient different kinds of breads and pastry fresh fruit yoghurt fresh orange juice fresh eggs prepared how you like it we enjoyed our stay and would come back again,1
1418,the hotel is clean the toilet is very clean staff was very kind and helpful very professional the restaurant got good tasting food the sauna and pool facilities classy but come with extra euro per head for the duration of your stay away from central station using tram or tram them metro min walk to the hotel,1
1419,thanks for your hospitability there are so many employees who know turkish also there are photographs from turkey in the room and loby breakdast is also similar to turkish breakfast you can go to center easily by tramvay and metro,1
1420,generally the hotel is fine but there are no bars restaurants nothing outside the hotel to go to center you need to take a tram often overloaded for minutes or a taxi euro so unless you want to suffer and be a commuter be ready to add this amount on your room bill and finally it must turn out more convenient to stay nearer the center being an international hotek chain they could offer a navette to center but doing so obviously they wouldnt share your money with was clean but if you forget to switch on the green light no cleaning lady will you do turn it green the cleaning lady does do anything else than roughly your bedsheets no one cared of dirty glasses on the shelves or to arrange the room and make it look bath is sad is comfortable and room is idea of breakfast i thought it was included actually but it was not and to add another euros would have made it really out of price considering the taxis is ok but if you dont have your you need an extra euro and another to access the is good fine service and good meat no complains so generally not comfortable due to the location and the lack of a navette and euro for nights no breakfast do make it a place where i want to return,0
1421,the grand hotel krasnapolsky was located in an excellent location it was a short minute walk from central station after getting off the airport train about short blocks the front of the hotel faces the center of dam square the sandeman free walking tours meet out in front restaurants are all around and there is a dirk supermarket half a block up we had three adults for our premium triple room beds for very comfortable double sink so multiple people can use staff was friendly and helpful i only encounter two minor issues with my night stay the first was the concierge did know what the dutch museum pass was i had reserved for the anne frank museum but you would still need to have the dutch museum pass i needed to know where the nearest museum was so i can buy it i was redirected to use the iamamsterdam pass which would work or try using the tours desk located outside i had used my google map to locate the rembrandt museum which is about minutes walk for my second issue was the elevator was making a loud sound since it was having problems closing i saw what appears to be the repairman working at it early in the morning but it was never fixed it went on all day i brought it to the attention of the hotel and i was told no one had reported it,1
1422,i loved this hotel not only because i got an upgrade to a big suite the hotel is in the perfect location an renovated i loved the place where we have breakfast and the staff is amazing thank you so much nh i truly recommend this hotel,1
1423,this will be our first time going to this particular hotel when we have visited amsterdam before we stayed further out however as it our anniversary my husband suprised me with a hotel in the middle of dam i was generally looking forward to the trip however when contacting the front desk i had spoken to different members of the management staff to confirm my reservations they were very polite on the phone and via email however the actual customer service for a hotel was rather disappointing they were unable to confirm my reservation and made no further am due to visit in the next few days and hope the experience in person will exceed my expectations rather then the past communication i had,0
1424,we loved the grand hotel krasnapolsky the hotel stafff from the concierge to the breakfas stafft and room cleaners were very friendly and could not do enough for winter room where breakfast was served was stunning and the choice and quality of food was location was brilliant and only a short walk from central room was very stylish and good value for money a bit on the small size and not much of a view which is what you expect from city hotels unless you pay extra for a larger room with a would thoroughly recommend this hotel,1
1425,loved our stay in this hotel has a very star feel to it everything is clean and modern and there a doorman who welcomes you in and always hands you an umbrella if it raining as you leaving for the day we asked for a modern room as we knew the hotel was being renovated which we got the rooms are spacious with clean and large bathrooms the bed is probably the biggest and comfiest bed i ever slept it we traveled as a young couple but did feel out of place even though it was mostly business men who we bumped into during our stay breakfast was lovely and til so no worry to get out of bed early,1
1426,i was highly satisfied with all over the setting atmosphere and centrally location of the hotel too i would come again service was good and hospitality rooms clean and location of hotel is highly appreciated,1
1428,love this hotel this is the second time i have stayed here now and will definitely be back again room was gorgeous everything was spotless bed was so comfortable staff are really friendly cant wait to book again,1
1429,we came to the hotel at when check in is at was told that there are any issues with our room so we went for lunch and came back at room was ready on time was asked to come back at we are busy was the explanation we got nothing alse we thought that it should be reasonable to have been compensated for that but did ask for nothing i think that when paying this much for a star hotel they have to do more to make your customers happy when you messed up i sure that if i did check out on time i would be charged for it and so if my room was ready on time the same rules should apply,1
1430,stayed here last month with friends for a nice weekend in i had night shift the previous day i asked in advance if it would be possible to check in at am once i came to the hotel my room was available and i could have some sleep already lisa escorted me to my room and in the nice chat we had i dropped that i would like to be awake around apparently i also told here i always turn of my alarm when i finished night shifts indeed i at lisa called to my room and asked how i slept and if i did turned of my alarm wauw thank you lisa for waking me up as well she left a kind note with chocolates in my room in the evening the girl from turn down came by and asked us if we need anything no everything was fine and she gave us this cute amenities for some rest before going to sleep everyone in the hotel was very friendly helpful and nothing was impossible would definitely stay here again,1
1431,when we arrived at this impressive hotel we were thrilled when given an upgrade to a suite sadly the aircon did perform very well so our room was constantly very hot we notified staff and although they initially came to check obviously there was a fault breakfast which we had included was magic served in the winter garden room we loved our start to the day and enjoyed the luxury our suite was massive so enjoyed the space great location as the downside we were evacuated late one night with warnings to leave immediately and do not use the lifts already in bed threw some clothes over the top and only took long enough to grab passports many guests some quite panicky raced down the fire escape to the street where you would expect to see a staff member to direct us no no one was there we all gathered waiting for instructions eventually we decided to go to the front of the hotel to seek help the hotel seemed to be fine with other guests inside unaware obviously the wing we were staying in was the only area i queried staff as to when they were going to let us know we were safe to return to our rooms they informed us it was no big deal and all was not good hotels should have an obligation to their guests and their safety,1
1432,after using my trusted travel consultants to find an excellent hotel in amsterdam i was excited when entering the nh krasnapolsky hotel lobby however my expectations came crashing down when met by the hotel staff who demanded a euro deposit for the pleasure of using the mini bar and other facilities within the hotel it was more the manner in which this was demanded and the lack of flexibility until i challenged the request this was then adjusted to euro miraculously the room was average with no view not what i have come to expect when travelling around the world in some of the finest of hotels there were many negatives to this stay i have not got the energy to go through all of them on this review the communication with staff was poor i completed all the paperwork for my laundry the morning before my check out date i tipped the concierge to get this back for the morning after and was assured this would be no problem the morning after i was due to check out no laundry i was told on the phone it would be posted to my home address this was not an option as i had business meeting in malaga that day very disappointed overall with the stay,0
1433,besides my bar fridge not working for the entire stay the tailor bar has very friendly and efficient barmen the service was excellent position is very central will stay there again on my next stay,1
1434,beautiful hotel close to everything the hotel lobby is big and spacious a good place to have coffee and a piece of cake the only draw back was the elevator was rather rooms were cleaned everyday and spacious,1
1435,the hotel is immpecable with a well equipped and stylish room the staff are very pleasent and helpful the breakfast was excellent with a massive selection of hot and cold foods and a variety of fruit hotel is placed extremely well for access to central station buses trams and canals shopping restaurants bars and red light district all within a short walk is one of the best hotels i have been in and will definatley be the next time we come to amsterdam,1
1436,the hotel and our room were lovely but we had an annoying noise coming from the bathroom after the manager and maintenance personnel could figure it out kaylie from guest relations was gracious enough to move us to another room because of the inconvenience kaylie found us a larger room that faced the dam and made it extra special for me an my husband with rose petals and balloons in the room she even arranged for our luggage to be moved while we were out touring the city excellent customer service thanks kaylie,1
1437,this was by visit to amsterdam over the past years i stayed in the sister hotel barbizon which is close to the station and has a good location as well as other hotels the grand however is much better placed for those that want to be in the centre of the sites the service is impeccable a special thank you to melanie who was very professional and checked me in before the usual time and answered all my questions the dam square location s perfect for first time and well seasoned visitor to amsterdam perfect for couples or large parties i did not experience the restaurant over nights but the prices looked on par for a star hotel the bar staff were very friendly and attentive though my favourite hotel up until this point was swissotel which is more intimate but much smaller if you are looking for a superior hotel in the middle of amsterdam with walking distance to amsterdam centraal station within close proximity to all the attractions then this hotel is for you,1
1438,perfect location and perfect stay at the krasnapolsky we stayed for nights in july and had a marvellous time really easy to walk around the city and all the sight seeing as well as the shopping streets from welcome to overall stay breakfast and service it was all amazing upon arrival we were escorted to our room finding out that we got upgraded and not only that our room was decorated in a lovely romantic way for our anniversary thank you to all staff that were so attentive and friendly definitely recommended and would stay there again on our next trip to amsterdam,1
1440,was having hectic days and finally got my free day to chill with friends was dont know where to go and decided to go to the bar and lounge in krasnapolsky dam square amsterdam the bar was just open exact still dont know to decide what to have and the polite waiter johem was approached us and gave recomendation of cocktail based by gin forgot what the name of the cocktail but it was really surprised and kind of him gave us really good cocktail witch is unique cocktail served with infused something with vodka parfum and purple just made our day with his cocktais thanks for will go back to chilling again and high recomended for this place to having day out,1
1441,the location is very central to everything the premises is modern and tasteful with nice rooms and good taste in its decorations not much interaction with the staff but seemed fairly pleasant and professional good breakfast served before a day out,1
1442,the hotel is in a fantastic location with great amenities and friendly helpful staff the room was large clean and with a great bathroom we used the restaurant and the bar both were great we would definitely stay there again,1
1444,leaving a review the day we depart because my partner and myself are both gutted to be leaving this fabulous hotel as soon as we arrived on our first day we were greeted and told our reservation had been upgraded as we were their guest of the day the start of our stay was made even greater when we saw the room and the size of the bed my partner is pretty large but he was swallowed up in it haha i was sceptical of hotels in the centre of amsterdam as i has been told they could be rather noisy but we did hear a peep our view from the room was spectacular but i not complaining all you have to do is walk outside the hotel to see a beautiful view the location is also fabulous right next to restaurants bars and shops we found our favourite coffee shops right behind the hotel the bulldog coffee shops cater for all types of weed smoker depending on which mood my partner and myself were in there was a corresponding shop all in all the hotel is pretty amazing oh i forgot the breakfast beautiful i would recommend anyone who is looking to feel papered and relaxed while staying in such a beautiful city thank you to the staff for making our first holiday away absolutely amazing,1
1445,this hotel is centrally located although very expensive checking in was a bit long and laborious further frustration was endured when collecting the keys when the room was ready because we were registered incorrectly reception staff could be more welcoming that being said they did have a great deal of people to attend to and we did receive an apology from the very gracious manager for the inconvenience caused the room was modern with good facilities large bath walk in shower and separate loo beds were unbelievably luxurious with crisp white linen our room slept three and was spacious we had a drink in the bar area which was quiet on the inside and busier outside again bar staff could have been more welcoming and attentive the champagne breakfast was exceptional all the staff in the restaurant were brilliant friendly welcoming and attentive which is what one would expect from this high class hotel the food was phenomenal and the choice was over whelming in a good way there were several areas of food including smoothie bar cereals fruit bread cakes hot food and omelettes freshly cooked to order see pictures to perfection it was such a pleasure to have this experience whilst staying in amsterdam,1
1446,can highly recommend this hotel senem at front desk is such an asset to this pristine hotel professional helpful friendly this is customer care at its best rooms fantastic restaurant thumbs up,1
1447,perfect place center of the city rooms are very good clean internet is very good bathtoom is so good friendly personel everything is so good we will prefer again to stay in this hotel near everywhere,1
1448,i really would like to thank mr frans the lobby cafe man for his professional service and his kindness with us in general the service is great and we had a great experience with nh collection thank you,1
1449,i really likes this hotel the rooms were confortable the breakfast is is something i really did appreciate the lady at the check in counter wanted a deposit of problem is that my card is expired and she wanted it in cash i was on a duty trip for i paid the room and i mentionned that i will not use the mini bar or any other had only left for diner and taxis but she absolutely wanted the deposit of she clearly made me feel that i have to pay or get out so i had no choice i made the deposit and had left for was a very bad experience and i think that this hotel should review its policy because this deposit thing is a bit defenetly wo go back to the hotels of nh se to stay at hilton sheraton hyatt and they never require this deposit,1
1450,we arrived at am they had another room available for the us perfect flavored water in lobby and coffee too room was quiet and beds perfect lots of modern touches restaurant on site which has really good food with an innovative touch huge breakfast buffet in this grand room center of everything in the beautiful city of amsterdam,1
1451,a wonderful experience staying at the krasnapolsky on the dam in amsterdam close to shops attractions trams trains etc majority of staff are helpful although check in process could be more streamlined and quicker,1
1453,we stayed here on a family trip to amsterdam the hotel is situated right in the center of town minutes walk from central station the main sights tour boats many restaurants and shops are all close by within easy walking hotel looks a bit old fashioned from the outside but the lobby and our rooms were all very modern our rooms had large comfortable beds were well equipped clean with modern bathrooms with showers we did not try the breakfast but went to starbucks nearby instead was rather cumbersome and took a long time we needed to fill in our address again although they had it from our reservation and they needed copies of passports for each room the lady at reception was not particularly friendly maybe she was just stressed as she also had to help another less experienced the day of in the morning the cleaning crew just went into each of our rooms without knocking while we were still in the room in the shower etc we found this rather awkward surely they could communicate who has checked out and then clean the room lastly the concierge service was very friendly and summary we had a great stay right in the center of amsterdam,1
1454,this is definitely not a hotel the only good thing about this hotel is the central room definitely needs some restauration some things are just broken in the stayed in hotels that looked,0
1455,we stayed in july to celebrate our thirtieth wedding anniversary this is our fifth stay and each time we have enjoyed the friendliness and helpfulness of all staff the hotel is very centrally situated and everywhere we wanted to go was a silly walkable although we did make use of the hop on hop off bus and boat our rooms were in the amsterdam wing where we hav stayed times before and is one of my favourite parts of the hotel the breakfast room is amazing and the breakfasts themselves are wonderful with an amazing variety of food available at the end of a busy day it is great to sit and have a coffee while watching the world go by in dam square this is a really great hotel with great staff,1
1456,this is an excellent hotel in the very centre of the city the level of accommodation facilities and service provided by the staff is always first class and i would thoroughly recommend staying here the room i had was exceptionally comfortable with a great shower room and facilities everything was spotless and a very comfortable large is on dam square so everything is close by or within easy walking distance from the moment of checking in to checking out nothing was ever too much trouble for the staff who are always so polite and helpful,1
1457,the layout of this hotel is a bit unique with a separate building which is where i room that i was in was and had all the amenities you could was great for restaurants and exploring,1
1458,this was a smashing hotel where we spent an enjoyable night break in march ok we were upgraded but i am sure the luxury level would have been the same there is nothing to say that is negative though we chose to take breakfast away from the hotel there is plenty of choice nearby staff were extremely professional yet friendly and helpful thoroughly recommended,1
1460,we chose this hotel for its location which is perfect for sightseeing and in an historic location however above and beyond its location is the overall package excellent rooms excellent service and the friendliest hotel staff in amsterdam highly recommended,1
1462,this hotel is so central situated in dam square on arrival you are met by well dressed doorman then extremely well mannered reception staff check in was quick and easy small issue with being deducted from our credit card with no explanation when we questioned this reception apologised for not informing is it was for any incidentals rooms are located via numerous elevators our room was located on the floor via elevator lobby is dimly lit which possibly hides a multitude of issues one we noticed was carpet was quite worn and could cause someone an room itself has brown flooring and white cubed furniture massive bed which was really comfortable however the pillows were way too softbathroom was a glass cube style with everything you required during your stay toiletries were replenished every day we are both in our late but getting in and out of the shower was quite hazardous bath tub is really high no hand rails for getting in and out something the hotel should look at for elderly visitors we did eat in the hotel during our stay but had some drinks in the lobby bar it was well priced overall we had a brilliant stay here and would most definitely go back if visiting amsterdam again,1
1463,you cant be more central than this right on dam square very nice older hotel but all latest amenities you would expect our rooms were excellent spacious and quiet the staff here were amazing when was the last time someone showed you to your room when you did ask for help concierge was also one of the best i have ever used very helpful and went the extra mile breakfast was excellent in a very impressive room that is a listed building restaurant looked great but we did have the time to eat there overall an excellent value for money and a hotel with some real character,1
1464,very convenience locationeasy to get there from the airport and very convenience to travel to different sightseeing locations staff very helpful and knows the landmarks very welllots of good restaurants inside and around the hotel,1
1465,spent nights with my wife and friends last week to celebrate birthdays and had a great time the hotel is beautiful and all employees from check in to bar staff are exceptional also a huge thank you for the complimentary upgrade which was a lovely touch superb,1
1466,we stayed one week and what we liked best was the courtesy friendliness and unfailing helpfulness of all staff we encountered nice room with huge bed and an ample supply of all bathroom requirements décor was a little dull grey and brown it was especially pleasing to find that as well as very efficient air conditioning that could be turned off there was a window that opened ahappy week stay,1
1467,from the entrance the doorman the front desk warm welcome from danielle she gave us a beautiful room we love it clean and quiet and comfortable bed the amazing staff when we have our buffet breakfast rosanna marilen aida hazel jocelyn and maureen always made sure we are taken care of we stayed for three nights and always the same fabulous experience,1
1469,this hotel is a great starting point to discover all different options amsterdam offers be it culture exotic food boots trip or a tour through the famous red light reception area is typically busy and sounds like a main station personal can be nice if they want to rooms big enough breakfast is right place if you do not want to relax but experience amsterdam,1
1470,i spent nights in the nh krasnapolsky and i can definitely recommend this hotel first and foremost the service was amazing the staff were on top of things and very hotel location is right on the dam square so you are literally in the middle of amsterdam with a lot to do for those of you who will come by train from the airport it is a minute walk at most from the train decor was clean and well maintained the hotel breakfast was wonderful as well with many choices to choose from for those of you who are into hotel gyms this hotel does not have a gym they used to but after renovations they opted to remove the gym what they have done to compensate is to allow guest to use the gym at other nh hotels the closest one was a minute of the nicest aspects of the nh other than the location was the bar as it was run very professionally and had a very large drinks menu so definitely a must if you want a nice cocktail prior to an evening out on the room i stayed in was a bit small but being in the center of amsterdam that was expected the bed was very comfortable and it was very quiet at night so one could get a great night in all i would definitely recommend staying here especially if you want to be in the center of the city you will not regret,1
1471,stayed at this hotel for nights in july this year the hotel kindly upgraded us as it was a break to celebrate my birthday hotel is great excellent location in dam square so easy walk to everywhere cocktails and service in the hotel bar were excellent breakfast was full of choice in a beautiful room picture attached we took the train from the airport to the centre and it was a min walk from the train station to the hotel,1
1472,hotel is located directly on the dam square an easy minutes walking to amsterdam rooms are very clean breakfast garden was wonderful and choices are location staff very,1
1474,there is nothing negative to say the rooms are very modern clean and we were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to a larger room that had a sofa bed in it so kudos to the front staff free breakfast was exquisite lots of variety fresh and tasty and finally this hotel is located near all the action you can not beat the location overall recommended ideal for businesspeople but suitable to families and couples as well,1
1475,this is a very nice hotel in the price epicenter of amsterdam we relocated here from another hotel so we could be in the center of the city a relative value compared to other us style hotels at the same week we traveled only thing holding back rating was internet app for booking simply did not work once on phone in europe had we not physically walked into hotel we could not have booked once inside people were very friendly but check in desk was very disorganized no clear lines lead to people cutting ahead of one another at busy time not a huge issue but something we did not expexect at a luxury hotel still highly recommend it,1
1477,we absolutely loved our stay at the nh collection the hotel was beautiful super clean and in an incredible location it was so easy to get anywhere in amsterdam quickly each night the hotel did turn down and left a little chocolate on our pillow i know they can not guarantee this but my husband and i arrived super early from an overnight flight from the us and they were able to get us a room as soon as we arrived which was such a great perk they were so accommodating and professional highly highly recommend this hotel,1
1478,i have to admit that i tried like crazy to cancel our reservation here at the last minute we had a devastating health diagnosis and the hotel which was refused to give us a refund that said we decided to go on our trip after all i have never been more impressed with a hotel or it s staff like i was with this location was perfect and i will never forget the kindness the staff showed me when i became ill i had an infected spider staff arranged for a to come to the hotel they sent me a tray with fresh fruit tea and a get well soon card they even had housekeeping change my bed all within a minute span of calling the front desk i was so ill that the lady from house keeping was changing my pillows as i was crawling back into my bed i remember her lifting my head and fluffing them until they were perfect they sent us dinner via room service at no charge never have i felt so pampered and taken care of i am ever so thankful for the kindness they showed me this is a perfect place to stay in the heart of amsterdam stars all the way,1
1479,great place specially the staff and the room size our room was over looking the river the location was great as well handy to everything amsterdam got to offer the room service was great as well i highly recommend it,1
1481,great service from check in to check out hotel personnel were very friendly professional and helpful excellent breakfast set us up for the day and late breakfast til on sunday with free late checkout til think on a sunday were a real bonus on a short weekend break very convenient to centraal station and hassle free to get train from schipol to centaal station and a short walk to hotel very close to all the sights many sights within short walking distance and convenient to trams boat tours and boat great way to get around selection of nice restaurants and bars very had a great weekend in a great city and the brabizon palace was an excellent base to enjoy the city from intend to stay again if when we return to amsterdam,1
1482,in cities like amsterdam its about location and to have a nice hotel in the center of it all nh collection barbizon fits that bill close to amsterdam centraal and rental car areas we did a day trip to zaandam and zaans schans by just walking to the train station and taking a train instead of spending euro on a tour near all the historic sites and main squares and restaurants laundromat right near by plenty of restaurants for breakfast near by to not need hotel breakfast great service and conciergecons wifi did work with our macbook computers in our room on floor noise at night you are right in the center of party town with am crowd hanging out right in front of your room if you are facing the canal side and have your window open,1
1483,very good very good location near to center breakfast is expensive but very good the room is close to the train taxi service from the hotel is more expensuve its look like the take comissin,1
1484,this hotel is fab i stayed here a few times before the renovation and also after it was old and dated before but i still loved it location is perfect now that it been renovated it is fantastic great customer service good value for money a peaceful hotel with a wonderfully relaxing environment i would recommend anyone to go i stayed in a few hotels in amsterdam central and this one is my favourite,1
1485,very convenient location near the central train station with excellent connectivity with trams buses and boats hotel was quite good with clean rooms and helpful staff breakfast was very good prices can be described as entry luxury level,1
1486,nice staff and lovely rooms great breakfast the reception staff bart was very good spacious room little noise but only cuz of the parade and music which we loved i would def go there againit is a beautiful city,1
1487,very comfortable and well located the view to central station from our room was amazing we stayed nights the staff is friendly and efficient the breakfast was very good with special mention to marco,1
1488,lovely stay in amsterdam at this hotel but did not know about the tax due at the end of our stay about euros per room hotel is in great location with interesting districts in walking distance staff are obliging bit stingy on the complimentary,1
1489,the hotel was a good choice for the price great expansive breakfast buffet and central location if you have a car it is definitely a nightmare to navigate the alley to arrive and depart each day the room was large by eu standards there is small quaint bar in the lobby but your are in amsterdam where pubs and cafes are in abundance i recommend venturing out the location in proximity to the sights is top notch less than minutes to dam square redlight district and tons of shopping and dinning,1
1490,king bed is large and comfortable as is the rest of the standard room i especially like the rain shower head there are hotel bikes for rent if you are confident in the confusing lanes and alleys of amsterdam,1
1492,well appointed room and large bathroom with shower excellent location within walking distance of the major attractions breakfast buffet was included and outstanding staff were very accommodating and friendly room was very quiet at night,1
1493,polite friendly and efficient reception staff complimentary fruit infused water drinks and fresh fruits in reception area was much appreciated in the warm quiet and extremely clean room the bed and mattress was firm and very comfortable we did not eat in so cant comment on the wifi and air con work well,1
1494,great hotel central to everything very friendly staff and an huge breakfast buffet room was clean neat and very well appointed ca wait to return once they have finished remodeling of the restaurant excellent service in the bar,1
1495,the premium room was a great upgrade we faced the canal and was in the heart of it all the king bed was clean and comfortable the shower was either a rain or spray handle pressure was great towels were soft and luxuries the hotel was quiet and inviting,1
1497,we really loved this hotel for all the right reasons the location was excellent for walking to all the tourist attractions the front desk was knowledgeable and friendly the room was good size for two travelers with lots of luggage and the morning buffet breakfast was outstanding with way too much food to sample everything the fruit selection consisted of so many varieties that everyone should be able to find something they like it was all so very healthy except for all the processed meats which one did not have to take since there were so many other healthier choices the staff were all very helpful when vantage tour group concierge and guide was remarkable,1
1498,this hotel is very close to the main train station in amsterdam very conveniently located there is no parking but there are two very close i recommend the center oosterdok which is cheaper than the train station lovely hotel very well decorated very friendly and helpful staff the room was very spacious and bright the bedding was perfect and the bathroom very nice and clean the nespresso coffee machine available for free is a free wifi connection works very price is a bit high but in amsterdam for a quality hotel be aware that you have to pay the price,1
1499,fantastic stay as usual and the breakfast is just amazing perfect location confortable beds etc do not miss the restaurant the vermeer which is classified in the michelin and really deserve star at least,1
1501,recommend this hotel if you are using the rail system as it is right opposite the station the rooms and hotel are wonderful and the staff are very obliging drinks in the lounge area were reasonable and all in all a great stay,1
1502,we and my fiancé recently stayed at this hotel for one night during a trip to amsterdam very central opposite central station in a ideal location to explore hotel has been recently refurbished to a lovely standard we stayed in a superior room on the first floor lovely and cool as it was extremely warm whilst we were there very comfy bed lovely extras like slippers robes and toiletries would most definitely book this hotel when returning to amsterdam in the future,1
1503,the hotel check in was less than efficient check in time was hrs our group of four arrived at and our room was not ready it was as if we were not expected however the room we eventually were allocated was fine the hotel was centrally located and perfect for a visit to amsterdam i would definitely recommend this hotel but do not purchase the breakfast which is way overpriced we found a lovely cafe across the road at half the price,1
1504,amazing hotel i would definitely go there again the price is not too bad and everything is really near by the hotel the hotel has great facilities and the staff are all very friendly they also gave us complimentary drinks on the house thanks i would highly recommend this hotel,1
1505,i highly recommend this hotel the place is spotlessly clean rooms are in good conditions the bed was especially comfortable to sleep on and the bed sheets were nice and cozy service was friendly and effective breakfast was really good location is convinient just outside the main train station amsterdam central this makes it easy to get in from the airport by train and back the hotel is right on the edge of the district i usually prefer to stay more south in the city but there were many advantages to this location we were a group of three couples who stayed at this hotel in late july checked in on a thursday late morning and checked out on sunday check out time is by default which is really nice because we had an evening flight out the rooms were not ready when we checked in but were made available as we got closer to the suitcases were stored in the storage this whole process was handled very nicely even though we were not easy customers repeatadly remembering that we left things in the suitacses that we wanted to retrieve we received two rooms on the floor one facing the canal and the other facing the inner court the room facing the canal had stairs in the room which is a little strange we also received a room on the room were very quiet and sleep quality was very good there is quality tea and coffee in the room the,1
1506,we stayed there for three nights on a room only board the room we got was a good size and overlooked one of the many canals right outside the window were bars and restaurants but we really ca complain about the noise yes there are late night revellers but that will happen in any busy city the room itself was very clean and well presented and a good sized walk in shower mini bar in the room with not the cheapest prices but well stocked we did use any of the hotels facilities because we got up in the morning and got back at night the staff were very friendly and helpful as were all the local people we spoke to the hotel is a star and not the cheapest but this was a special birthday so we splashed out a little more the hotel is in a great location for bars restaurants cafe etc but probably even better is it only a few minute walking from central train station if you want to see amsterdam and treat yourself then this is the hotel for you would i go back yes,1
1507,perfect stay nice hotel clean room friendly staff and great buffet breakfast with healthy selections good location minutes walk to central station a lot of nearby restaurant choices in walking distance,1
1508,i was staying at this nice hotel nights i can explain how the location great it is in the heart of amsterdam you can get shops bars clubs restaurants etc the hotel staff wonderful people welcoming and skilled with good communication the room which i selected was superior it really big and comfortable the cleaning level is great the negative things the room dining services not available each time and do have enough options the lobby bar is dead and the breakfast not includes hot courses like omelet i recommend to stay again at this hotel though,1
1509,nh hôtel is wonderful location close to central station and the center of amsterdam friendly and professional people the room are confortable and very pretty i will come back with great pleasure for sure,1
1510,only great things to say about this place great location renovated hotel in the heart of the city rooms were excellent and very modern service was superb breakfast wow best one in europe on this adventure are room had a direct view of a busy canal,1
1511,hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated the breakfast buffet was the best i had of any hotel stay the location is close to everything in the city center so it was easy to walk around and enjoy the local shops and restaurants,1
1512,excellent staff who made our stay very memorable we received a very warm welcome everyone gave help and assistance and we thought our room was lovely actually all the common areas were gorgeous highly recommend this hotel for service and its location,1
1513,second time that we have stayed here excellent service individually decorated and extremely spacious rooms very central and within close walking distance of museum quarter and nine streets staff could be more helpful elderly parents had to take care with steep steps but certainly manageable thoroughly recommend,1
1514,what a great hotel in a fab location lots of road works going on all around but that really ca be helped we arrived to a free room upgrade to a junior suite no idea why but it was a big clean spacious room so who were we to argue the bed was huge as was the bathroom the hotel is situated in a great location a short walk to all the museums and not too far walk to anne franks house which was a pleasant walk along the canals hotel staff were really helpful and very informative would definitely stay here again,1
1515,it was our wedding anniversary so i asked for a room with a view and the hotel delivered i ordered flowers for the room and they were lovely too however their house champagne was very expensive room itself was again lovely and very clean could have been more tea bags in the refreshment pack we had to ask for more from reception hotel staff were very polite efficient andhelpful and i would definitely recommend this hotel to travelling,1
1516,the reception were helpful but the room service did answer at all the house keeping stole our things when we said that to the reception they did nothing the breakfast was horrible unclean the lift alawys broke down,0
1517,pros location is markable it near by everything restaurants bars and transportation front desk team are great super easy processes for checking in and out price valuecons main hotel doors are closed at late night you need to have short chat to come on bathroom was so small however it practical for me since,1
1518,this hotel has a great location fantastic food in the hotel breakfast was amazing and a super staff overlooking a canal you just cant go wrong when i return this will be my first choice it was a dream stay,1
1519,stayed for two nights for my fiancé birthday the hotel is absolutely beautiful staff were very helpful we had breakfast booked for one morning which was delicious with unlimited sparkling wine completely worth it when booked in advance only euro pp we will definitely stay here again recommend to anyone,1
1521,we chose this hotel because of location and price we were completely pleased gorgeous hotel beautiful fountain out front great staff and close to everything would definitely stay again,1
1523,this hotel was part of a package with plane fare i actually figured that if we did like it that we would use it as a base to travel from that all changed immediately excellent staff from the get go wonderful room overlooking canal and super close to museum loved having everything in walking distance the café and restaurant were most memorable parts were the people who make this hotel run i ca say enough good things about them hello to rose in the café thank you all so much for a perfect week,1
1524,we have travelled to many cities around the world and stayed in many hotels but this has the most comfortable beds and pillows ever the staff were were so helpful especially the blonde lady in the cocktail bar my wife and l thought her customer service was second to none a brillent stay ian tina,1
1525,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hampshire hotel the staff were friendly and all of our queries and requests for assistance were dealt with promptly and efficiently we were disappointed on our first night to find ourselves in a room which overlooked a ventilation shaft in addition someone banged on our door in the middle of the night when we told reception they moved us to a lovely room overlooking a canal and gave us a free complementary breakfast the rest of our stay was perfect the hotel is ideally situated for the city and transport to the airport everything is clean and well cared for we would recommend the hotel as pleasant and good value for money amsterdam is not cheap,1
1526,if you read my reviews you know that i like this hotel with it up and down stairwells good business center close to everything and within the city center vondelpark is very close and museums and other fun is right outside your door get a balcony and enjoy the sounds of leidseplein the hotel has a great restaurant attached and is surrounded by plenty of others anything you need is close to this hotel rent a bike i like mike bikes on kerkstraat and extend your range,1
1527,this is my third visit to this lovely and peaceful hotel where staff is looking to serve you in the most possible way they can they advice on the most interesting spots you can spend time and where you can go for dining ken and dave are figures from the staff that i will value their help,1
1528,everything was perfect even for a guest like me who is exactly one of the regulars you would find in these kind of hotels the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and professional i was impressed with the cleaning of my room when i came back i found a used towel still on the floor some bits of paper from the breakfast that morning and some other minor details that was unfortunately overlooked other than that everything was perfect and i certainly hope to come back again,1
1529,although this hotel is in the hub of the canabis smokers it is so central to stay in amsterdam fantastic breakfast nice room with a perfect bed my room on the floor was so quiet and curtains to block out light one could get a good nights sleep service was very good,1
1530,excellent hotel in a good location from there it very easy to reach all the most important sites to visit we had a nice room overlooking leidseplein with a very comfortable king size bed a plentiful continental breakfast is decidedly good but not included the personnel is kind and the whole a very good impression but definitely it not inexpensive,1
1531,we stayed at the hampshire which is in the heart of the leidseplein the reception staff were very friendly and speak fluent english like most dutch people our room was comfortable but not expansive however had everything we needed pillows can be requested to suit the restaurant was beautiful and food very good prices were similar to star hotels and would recommend,1
1533,thank you amsterdam american for another wonderful stay if you want history and art deco architecture this is the hotel for you i sure that amsterdam has many wonderful hotels but we are devoted fans of the amsterdam american the staff is courteous and always helpful the bartenders in bar american are exceptional shout out to all of them especially sara the location ca be beat walking distance to the major museums vondel park the trams are right outside the front door the bus to the airport is steps away too costs only minor complaint is that our room room is directly over the booth for the canal trip a few times it got a bit noisy in the morning however the room is worth this minor ca wait to go back to amsterdam we will be staying at the american again,1
1534,we spent nights at the american hotel in amsterdam in late july it is a very nice facility in an excellent location it looks a bit out of the way on a map but it takes only about minutes to walk to dam square assuming you do stop in the shops along the way about to the museum district canal boats are right there and restaurants are plentiful near the hotel a starbucks dunkin donuts for those who must have american stuff our room was pleasant and no street noise felt safe to walk all around would definitely stay again staff very helpful,1
1535,i recommend this hotel to anyone and the is well worth the trip the food is delicious as are the cocktails i would suggest trying the bulletproof cocktail room service was of high quality and the bed was so comfortable a very central location the hotel is situated within walking distance of just about all major attractions,1
1536,i have stayed at this hotel for business two times now and i keep coming back the staff is very attentive and if you have the good fortune to meet carlos for the breakfast buffet he will take very good care of you in fact that is one of the reasons i returned carlos made me feel right at home with his friendly and caring demeanor the location is central to everything and easy walking distance to everything but it can be quite loud because the bulldog is right across the street they upgraded my room for free and it faced the canal very nice but quite loud,1
1537,our first time in amsterdam so we had a bit of trouble finding this place after taking bus in from schipol we found another hampshire hotel who gave us directions they assumed we were in a car so the directions made us circle the block sidewalks and streets around this hotel were under construction so access pulling luggage was a bit challenging but we soon got used to situated close to canal cruises out front door restaurants shopping and transit we were disappointed our room only had a view of an inner courtyard until we realized this meant the room would be quiet it was and with the comfortable bed sleeps were good maid service was a bit slow on the first day due to a large number of checkouts but improved on the next two nights desk staff were friendly and accommodating throughout our stay we would stay here again,1
1538,the hotel américain as it was once known is a grand ol dam beautifully appointed our room had a balcony that overlooked a canal within easy walking distance of many restaurants and shops not to mention the beautiful canals loved the attention to detail the staff provided and the hotel bar is a wonderful surprise,1
1539,nice hotel good service comfortable beds very centrally located to many attractions in within walking distance of many we are seniors and it was a perfect spot for us we recommend it and would stay there again,1
1540,this hotel has been around for about years art deco design elements bedroom deco reminiscent of that era too but still comfortable clean friendly helpful staff right on a tram link to the main station near a bus link to the airport near the museum quarter and next to a canal with hop on hop off boats hotel recommended excellent local restaurants and we very helpful about public transport options it a big hotel so could feel a little large and impersonal for some,1
1541,i have stayed at the hampshire american hotel many times and the hotel is always wonderful this goes for the staff from the front desk to the bar the room was very nice and clean the location of the hotel is another plus,1
1542,returned here in july after visiting last october love the hotel and the location is great to visit all the great local restaurants and bars loved sitting outside watching the world go by will definitely be going back,1
1543,very nice hotel clean quiet great location the room was great the bed was incredibly comfortable the service is top notch the dining room and bar are beautiful breakfast buffet was very good on canal with beautiful fountain in the front,1
1544,hotel is well maintained trams stop in around the corner and can take you anywhere in the city museum quarter is walking distance plenty of restaurants around the desk people are friendly and will help with any questions you may have,1
1545,i really enjoyed food quality provided in room very delicious and well made but the menu is short and you have few choices specially for vegetarians staff were friendly one negative comment is that i have requested to remove mini bar in room multiple times but they do response also the room ground is made from wood and when you walk in room you hear some sound from wooden ground the breakfast restaurant close early about am and this let us miss breakfast left is small for child trolly concierge very friendly,1
1546,amsterdam is such a wonderful city and my stay at this hotel only added to the amazing experience i had while i was there the hotel is centrally located from to the museum square and yet in a quiet little street just by one of the canals comfortable room and they offer free bikes perfect for amsterdam,1
1547,great location very clean great service friendly staff very good value for the cost very close access to trams buses the hotel restaurant was expensive but the immediate area had so many restaurants it was never a concern we would certainly return to this hotel the next time we are in amsterdam,1
1548,the hampshire american is an outstanding place to stay on the way to the hotel from the airport the cab driver said your hotel is in the center of everything well he was not kidding the great shopping and amazing restaurants surrounding the hotel really validated his assessment we were within walking distance to many of the main tourist attractions the area around the hotel was vibrant with activity everyday the front desk staff was spectacular claire especially stood out with her professionalism and helpfulness the room was fantastic i will definitely be returning to the hampshire american on my next trip to amsterdam,1
1549,i just ca fault this hotel the location the room ca account for any others obviously the staff every single one of them the bar and the restaurant the legacy the restaurant makes feel like a superstar i left and the hotel with a grin on my face pleased that i was staying here helpful and friendly staff eager to assist and do their bit to make your visit the best it can be thank you to everyone i met at amsterdam american hotel especially to mathilda who gave me a balcony room and who was so kind and welcoming throughout my stay such a cool hotel in an amazing location with a simple walk to any part of this incredible city,1
1550,this hotel is good situated near museums and good public transport facilities to visit old amsterdam a good restaurant and delicious breakfast made our trip to amsterdam fantastic the room was spacious and clean,1
1551,liked everything about this place bed was so very comfortable rooms were well insulated from noise funky bathroom great selection for breakfast decent location would certainly stay here again only minus point was when we checked in late at night the member of staff was terribly helpful as we struggled with the self thanks for the cookies for my husband birthday too they made a great midnight snack,1
1552,the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was good no tea or coffee making facilities in was very easy to do using screens at reception and there was a member of staff available to help and to provide a map and explain the time that breakfast was served were given a voucher for a free drink at the restaurant attached though we did not take this up as the food was very hotel is conveniently situated for easily getting into the centre of amsterdam or exploring the area the overtoom has lots of places to eat and drink and an albert heijn to grab groceries if required vondelpark is very nearby and is a pleasant place to walk trams and stop very close to the hotel and take around minutes to take you to centraal station,1
1553,well located near vondelpark the hotel is designed to the max so will appeal to hip aesthetic appreciative it also delivers as a good clean but basic hotel the twin we had was small with no real view the beds comfortable and the bathroom spotless no drinks facilities in room which is was on screens but there were a couple of friendly staff to assist we had extra parking needs as our van would fit the car elevator so they arranged for us to park in the sister hotel next was excellent a quirky organic and apparently locally sourced continental spread cafe service was weaker with forgotten drinks the hotel could use more staff in the mornings for checkout and breakfast past would be was a nice place but did feel like great value for money especially with extra payment for parking and breakfast,1
1554,very impressed with this hotel arrived at central station from airport and caught the no tram minutes ride and minute walk to hotel from tram stop no reception desk checked in online easily with the help of the fantastic staff great room with probably one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept in amazing bathroom large walk in shower room very clean and modern with quirky touches throughout the hotel based on the tyre factory this hotel used to be located in lovely area lidl over the road and to the right which was handy for bottled my sister has an allergy to feather and these were changed immediately on request would definitely recommend and stay again,1
1555,i had a three night stay in july at the tire station i took a train from the airport to lelylann via a sprinter train and then from there a tram number to surinameplein tram stop it was short walk from there to the was quick and easy via the tablet system assisted by the hotel staff i was on the third floor and was happy with my quiet double room the bed was comfortable and in the bathroom i liked the walk in shower and the shower gel provided i would have liked thicker pillows on the bed but that is a tiny issue i did miss the lack of tea and coffee making facilities as i was out all day and it was warm so i was glad of the air conditioning when i was in the kept reading about the great coffee in amsterdam before my trip which unfortunately i can not drink however i was pleased to find a variety of herbal teas on offer either in tea bags or loose leaf tea at breakfast or in sticky fingers café or in the museum cafes i liked the area the hotel is in quiet and near to the vondelpark i had intended to walk everywhere but found i did need to use the tram to save my feet a little i had an i amsterdam card so i made use of the public transport card on that which was very helpful the hotel is near two,1
1556,stayed for nights at a sad time for us our sister funeral your staff were not just friendly but also very helpfull and nothing was too much trouble one of our party has asthma and needed change of and this was arranged very quickly we would highly recommend the hotel very comfortable all area clean good value for money breakfasts and a lovely overall great atmosphere a sad stay very you,1
1557,we loved our stay here because of the amazing service provided here from the second we walked in lot was absolutely incredible sitting down with us upon to give us many recommendations for to do and see many of which we did and loved we had dinner at the restaurant that night and have stopped talking about that meal since we might just have to come back before we leave europe the hotel was very funky and the room was basic but perfect for what we needed lot your service was unparalleled best we ever had thank you,1
1558,we stayed with friends for a few days in amsterdam and we could have chose a better hotel the rooms we fantastic with great the staff were very welcoming and attentive the bar was well stocked and had a special offer cocktails,1
1559,really lovely hotel right opposite tram stop which takes you straight into main centre buy a ticket for and hop on and off beautiful clean bedrooms with free wifi comfy beds powerful shower great bar with excellent cocktails could fault it,1
1560,our standard room was located on floor it was quiet and large much appreciated when we were staying a week mini bar water juice chips free and replenished daily happy hour on cocktails dining room provided tasty food an great service location great can walk most places markets and supermarket close by tram at,1
1561,central location and a lovely hotel used tram and train to arrive and cab to airport due to flight timing after anne franke buy anne franke huis tickets in advance and plan your time around this must see museum angelique was great resource and understands her city and tourists well given the unique personality of amsterdam,1
1562,this is a plush and hotel in the heart of the city well connected with a tram station just outside walkable from van ghog and ruks museum hop on hop off canal ride stop is also stone throw away rooms are vert clean with modern amenities the staff at the is very courteous all in all a very pleasant experience for me and my wife as we spent days on a holiday,1
1563,had a lovely stay in this hotel for nights in july the staff were kind the room was small but functional and the entire hotel had a boutique vibe great location near the heineken experience and situated right on the canals highly recommend,1
1564,i booked this hotel as a surprise for my partners was disappointed it lived up to all the previous good reviews and my partner was really over the moon with it we stayed in the deluxe canal view room exactly as described bed was massive and really comfy the shower was great with robes and slippers which is a nice touch coffee pods taste great and soft free mini bar spot asked the hotel if we could have a nice bottle of red wine for his birthday which they provided with a lovely birthday note the location is great with the tram stopping outside cruise and heineken tour just a half kilometre on the other side of canal from hotel we ca praise the hotel and staff on reception enough they were so lovely and helpful the iron in the room is a steam one so you may want to take a spray bottle for stubborn ate in a restaurant called bazar which is middle eastern food very tasty and reasonable it in the same street as the closes later than other restaurants which all seam to close at this closes at there is also a super market on this market you like indian food there is a good one on the other side of canal to the left side over the traffic lights it very reasonable but closes at pm bodywork museum was a rain mac it really does rain at the drop of a hat but the hotel,1
1565,stayed at hotel notting hill or our visit to amsterdam this hotel is beautifully furnished and an excellent location with the central station only a few stops away by tram which stops right outside the hotel the rooms bar dining room are comfortable and pleasant service throughout our stay highly recommended,1
1567,great hotel and so close to central station staff ca do enough for you and when i told them it was my bthdy treat they put a bottle of champs in our room lovely to have a free bar as personally think it should be a as the towels always seem to have holes in room with beautiful view of the canal exactly what we asked for,1
1568,our hotel was a walk from centraal station which is the main transportation hub in amsterdam location was perfect hotel had lovely amenities such as well stocked mini bar cozy bathrobes comfy beds with duvets delicious buffet breakfast every morning we we very pleased,1
1569,great hotel lovely staff and very helpfull peter at front had very large room with a lovely close to central station and city of some of local shops close to hotel as they charge twice the price of normal stores,1
1570,this hotel was beautiful elegant it is over years it is so close to central station and ship docks too it was just perfect location to walk around all over the staffs was so incredible they spoke every language breakfast was awesome the room was so perfect fit i would love to go back once again i want to be as loyal member of this hotel i love it,1
1571,we stayed here after a day river cruise it was within walking distance from the cruise port which was great it is centrally located near the train station because it is on a busy corner it can be a bit noisy we were able to upgrade to a superior room which was amazing stop number is right out in front of the hotel they will sell the off tickets at the hotel one of the other great amenities is that the mini bar is complimentary and there is coffee and tea in the room i did not eat that the restaurant the breakfast buffet is euro each a bit pricey overall it is a really unique and friendly hotel,1
1572,we had adult daughters stay here recently during a family vacation i booked this on another discount website and got a great deal for such a quality hotel the room was lovely and the decor was early it is not modern nor is it meant to have modern decor and they take pride in this gem well cleaned each day and the complimentary mini bar is a bonus top quality products in the bathroom and a good night rest each night for nights we did not use the restaurant nor the other amenities there is some construction going on in the canal but a hotel can not be held responsible for that and it was a bother even with the open windows facing the canal we would stay here again anytime and recommend it to others if you like to stay in a star time piece of a hotel,1
1573,i spend several months at a time in amsterdam and have been looking for a spa for mani pedi service this was one of the worst experiences i have encountered the price tag for both exceeded which is fine if the service is the filing and treatment was painful and uneven one foot had cuticle treatment and the other did not i was often asked to hold uncomfortable positions in order for the technician to attempt to file and shape second the polish did not have a base coat or top coat and as a result chipped within days finally the space was not set up for drytime and i felt rushed out the door with no help of gathering my belonging or shoes despite my nails still being wet overall there was nothing pleasant or relaxing about the treatment extremely disappointing given i get better service at a nail salon at half the price,0
1574,this hotel was originally built as the shipping house and the hotel conversion has kept many of the wrought iron nautical themed elements lovely leaded glass and burled wood details our room was large with high ceilings and a nice canal view really nice vintage wood furniture and an enormous bath tub but a small shower robes and slippers were laid out on the beds the complimentary was a concept i never seen before and they replenished it daily what a nice touch they offer a very good breakfast buffet with the best croissants i had outside france excellent location near central station and the red light district there a hop off bus stop on the side of the hotel,1
1575,excellent hotel close to everything excellent service og nice rooms with a big bathroom breakfast ok the pancakes a little on the dry side the buffet was not restocked regularly which meant that you could not get what you want the buildingin itself was quirky and that was interesting the indoor spa with heated pool wasfantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful,1
1576,the spa was fantastic not one but three saunas make sure that if it is very hot out the windows in your room open we stayed on the first floor and our windows did not open and it became hot during the day,1
1577,it a beautiful hotel in a great location close to centraal station which is the transportation hub and chinatown my daughter really enjoyed the swimming pool we had two concerns though the in the room was not very effective the room got very warm and the vents were and away from the bed we had to request two fans and place them on either side of the bed the first night we had only one fan and we had trouble sleeping because of how warm it felt we were disappointed with our experience in arranging for a taxi to the airport two of the concierge staff and a front desk staff member said that the taxi charged a flat rate of euros to the airport and that the taxi would arrive in minutes after they called when we were leaving early in the morning there were different staff members on duty they said that the taxi could cost euros and would arrive in minutes we were also told the taxi accepted credit cards the taxi driver charged us euros and said his credit card machine was broken when we told him we did not have cash he somehow found another machine and accepted the payment by credit card he also drove way too fast at a hotel we expected more professional service in arranging our transportation to the airport otherwise the staff was courteous and helpful,1
1579,great location beautiful old building friendly staff nice room pool very good value for the cost of the room easy access to train station and public transit walking distance to restaurants and shopping,1
1580,the hotel is very old like a bit of a haunted house the staff is very friendly helpful the rooms are very nice but big problem we saw a baby rat in our room the vibe of the hotel is amazing old type hotel i wouldnt stay there again,0
1581,everything about this hotel was beautiful the service was excellent and the front destroy staff were very helpful and friendly it was our anniversary and we were surprised by a wonderful champagne treat in our room the view from our room was gorgeous and the extra touches such as the complimentary minibar were very much will definitely recommend this hotel when our adult children visit next year,1
1582,i stayed at the amrath from to july the architecture is amazing built in the early century and the interior still has original details i was making trips from the central rail station each day it is a very short walk from the hotel you must be careful of cycles and trams if you are not used to them in the basement is a swimming pool and spa especially good as the weather was very hot and a cool swim was a good way to end the free mini bar was also welcome as it had plenty of cold soft can get very crowded in july and august and for sightseeing i would recommend spring or autumn fall the dutch rail system is efficient and by far the best option to get to all the interesting places in the country,1
1583,from the centraal station about a walk nice staff from the porter to the front desk great art deco building room had no so it can be a little unpleasant on warm days can ask for a fan but did not help that much,1
1584,great location made the city very accessible on foot and literally steps away from hop on hop off stops street and canal you can buy the hop on tickets at the hotel bus stop beside hotel friendly helpful staff stayed nights beginning of june one night two weeks later comfortable the first visit we were awakened at am by construction noise front desk was apologetic but all rooms were booked so could not relocate were comped breakfast second morning very nice room and bath were spacious appreciated the liquids in free mini bar and robes the second visit we were given a corner suite same price and upon our request mini bar contained only still water no beer or soft drinks and wine the memory of the fantastic stairway and light fixtures lives on,1
1585,i stayed at grand amrath again because in between my last terrible stay i stayed another time and it was not a bad experience this last time has however insured that i will never stay again first of all i arrived around three and my room which was supposed to be ready at was still not finished being cleaned i had a drink at the bar and the room still was ready i went out for a bit and came back and the room was still not finished i waited a few more minutes and it was finally completed you think the room would be outstanding based on the wait but it was the room they showed me had a dirty tub but it had a canal view i had them move me and the next room was fine the next morning i wake up to get ready for a meeting and as i showering the water gets so high that i have to jump out of the shower and get into the tub so that the shower did overflow ridiculous i expect something like this in se asia but not in amsterdam both bathroom sinks were also stopped up and there was a ball of blonde hair near the toilet just disgusting i called to get someone to fix it and go to my meeting requesting that my room be cleaned while i away i come back and the quality of the cleaning is abysmal the housekeeper had wiped,0
1586,we were first given a floor room overlooking a construction site from very early morning the noise of construction became so terrible that it was impossible to sleep the climate control also did not work so the room was super hot on reporting the noise problem to the front desk they transferred us to a subzero level room from which one could only see other windows of the hotel above no one pays per night to stay in such a room however the room was quiet and we also got a fan hence we could sleep well the remaining nights the front desk sent us a complementary champagne bottle and the minibar was free if you could manage to get a room overlooking the canal then the stay could be really nice,1
1587,friendly professional staff excellent room with free mini bar very clean breakfast was very good with plenty of choice good shower and bath in room good hotel facilities excellent location close to all amenities,1
1589,we chose this hotel because it had stars and what we thought to be a great location a minute walk from central station this was our first visit to amsterdam and in hindsight we would have been much better off selecting a hotel away from the crowds milling around the red light district it like new orleans during mardi gras on acid i agree with other reviews the front of the house staff is top notch friendly polite and professional we were escorted to our connecting rooms and which are in the basement with views of the parking area and the amenities were fully explained on the positive side the free breakfast was terrific and you ca complain about a free mini the downside i feel this hotel deserves stars at best our rooms were not up to the same standard of other star hotels we stayed in during our week trip the entire hotel had an old run down feel and the housekeeping was in my opinion substandard windows were dirty crevices in the shower were not clean had room and the nespresso machine did not work the tv had been reprogramed so i was unable to access english stations and the shower door was quite simply defective the shower door in room slid in three sections creating an opening of around inches the shower door on room had an oversized glass panel which only allowed the door to open inches i am small and squeezed in sideways when,0
1591,we had two nights here in a junior suite in july and were very impressed with the room the bathroom rituals toiletries the view over the canal and the complimentary mini bar we had sofas and a coffee table as well as a large desk it was extremely spacious robes and slippers were provided and a very comfortable bed it was quite a quirky hotel with i guess slightly dated decor in the room and an odd huge marble landing on our floor which was used for storage of tables however the room was delightful and we loved staying here and would hesitate to stay did eat at the hotel at all so ca comment on any of the restaurant facilities as vip guests i think via our expedia booking we had a voucher for off dinner however my daughter is vegetarian and the options for her were practically non existent so we ate the staff we encountered were charming and professional and very welcoming you can hire bikes from the hotel but we did realise this until too is good as others have said we had a wonderful view and the station is only minutes walk away we would hesitate to stay here again,1
1593,we arrived quite early friday morning and the staff were very good to take our luggage to a safe location whilst we explored check in was until so we had a while to wait but we were disappointed once we started walking were in a superb location tram station across the road restaurants and convenience stores at every turning we were in such a great area for shopping we walked for miles yet were always in a popular and busy location once back at our hotel we found the doorman to be so pleasant and pleasing the girls on the main desks seemed extremely busy and restless so we found it quite awkward to approach them at first but they were extremely helpful and could help enough as well as housekeeping and minibar staff they were always eager to please and a credit to the leave on aug which is my birthday and i can honestly saythat we would definitely return to the grand hotel maybe with more of our family in the near future as we still feel there much more to amsterdam that we did manage to cover and would definitely want room again it was gigantic,1
1594,one of the best things about the stay apart from the lovely room excellent breakfast convenient location gorgeous building and the swimming pool was the staff they really made the stay special and were focussed on the comfort and happiness of their guests at all times really helpful friendly and accommodating especially for my grandmother for whom they were able to source a wheelchair at very short notice which enabled her to join us on excursions around the city we would not have been able to make otherwise huge thank you to them for making the stay so special,1
1595,such a quirky hotel charming unusual and yet really efficient loved the free mini bar and the pool were rooms are wonderful the location was great easy to find from the train station and everything in walking distance did eat at the hotel other than room service which was reasonable,1
1596,this hotel is in a great location and within metres walking distance from the main railway station river boat tours shopping restaurants museums red light district and canal tours the grand hotel amrâth amsterdam is located in the former scheepvaarthuis and offers rooms in art deco style with high ceilings and large windows with plenty of natural light the hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms were very clean the hotel has a spa wellness centre free of charge for hotel guests there is also a good size swimming pool to enjoy the hotel restaurant serves great french à la carte dishes for dinner we really enjoy staying at this hotel and would definitely stay at amrâth again,1
1597,we arrived for nights we got a huge room with free minibar equipped with soft drinks and beer the stay was pleasant and the staff was kind and helpful anytime we asked for guidance or location is very walking distance from the central station and most of the old city attractions,1
1598,my wife and i stayed in the last week of june for my birthday and retirement complimentary champagne was a great touch thank is a lovely hotel it is a beautiful building and well worth having a good look room was large with a well stocked free bed was probably the most comfortable bed we have ever slept toiletries were good breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices also had a lovely view from our staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble especially rex and you all so much,1
1599,was so looking forward to staying here room was dingy and small no outlook as in the middle looking out to other windows coffee machine was faulty reception staff were unhelpful and very snotty in their attitude breakfast was included we were told and then charged for it also a city tax which we were unaware of and no explanation as to what that was i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
1600,the staff was very friendly and gracious they treated you as if you were royalty concierge was extremely helpful with great tips front desk personnel were very freindly location is awesome across from grand central station and most all attractions are within easy walking distance,1
1601,i stayed for a few nights over my birthday in july i got there crazy early they let me take a shower in the wellness centre and stored my luggage all day while i was out exploring when i finally got to my room late that night the guest services manager had left me a bottle of champagne for my birthday which i thought was a lovely gesture and i really appreciated i really liked my room it was large and quiet the windows opened yay curtains were nice and thick and kept the light out the bed was comfortable the free was well stocked nespresso capsules were plentiful could quite get the room cold enough though even with the thermostat turned all the way down the bathroom was large and the bathtub was perfect the hotel it self was gorgeous the details in the lobby and in the public areas were just incredible the staff was friendly and not in that fake friendly kind of way i felt like they did judge you where as when i stayed at other star hotels in amsterdam i felt uncomfortable and like i did belong this hotel was not like that they really were kind and not condescending in any way shape or form i will most definitely stay here again next time i am in location is also great minute walk from central station near some excellent old brown cafes and just out of the main centre oh and the wifi,1
1602,architecturally interesting well located with good service and breakfast unusual suite at top of hotel quiet with wrap around terrace but four levels so too many stairs employees fluent in english,1
1603,my boyfriend and i visited this hotel for nights after i won a radio competition as competition winners i did particularly think we end up somewhere nice let alone a star hotel that gave us such a lovely room the hotel is impressive from the start you can not miss it gothic exterior and the interior is truly stunning i felt like i been transported to the the staff were lovely and the room was spacious with such high ceilings amsterdam is a gorgeous city and easy to get round the hotel is placed within walking distance of restaurants bars the train station and coffee shops if you interested,1
1605,this is the worst hotel we been to in several decades of matchbox bathroom where it was dangerous to take a shower a toilet door that would close exorbitantly priced mediocre breakfast in a dining hall where they rarely clean the tables and do refill buffet trays when they are paper for the printer in a tiny business center slow bad unsmiling in a strange old building with poor furniture and lots of dark is great,0
1606,this beautiful hotel with a historic past was a great base for exploring amsterdam spotlessly clean with daily fresh towels and bedding changed every other day close to centraal station trams buses canal boat trips restaurant serves good food for lunch dinners nice clean pool in the basement with a gym and a spa did not use spa downside was the breakfast we booked the day before so paid each but it was lukewarm and not that great so we did have another one upside starbucks across the road and we had breakfast each morning for only in and helpful staff,1
1607,lovely hotel fantastic view over the wonderful park lovely atmosphere and very polite and friendly staff the room was modern and stylish free wifi the restaurant serves exquisite food the scallops are to recommend the tram stops just outside close to restaurants and food stores and street markets the train station is within walking distance the breakfast at the hotel is fantastic we lived our stay definitely coming back,1
1608,my husband and two friends spent wonderful nights at this hotel we had a room right at the top and were amazed at how beautiful and in keeping with the original features of the hotel it was our friend had a double storey room but we much preferred ours to theirs the building is stunningly gothic and set within walking distance of tram stops into the centre and right inside a park i would hesitate to stay here again and it was extremely reasonable in price too also the huge bath was amazing,1
1609,we stayed at this hotel this weekend when we arrived we were shocked about how lovely it was and the settings we went to check in and were told that was not available till it was only so we were provided lockers for our luggage and went to the hotel bar this is the reason that i never gave hotel arena stars and in all honesty i near gave only there were of us and we tried to find a able without a reserved sign on and finally managed to get a we asked for food and drinks menus after minutes we still have no menus so went and took some off the surrounding stand then we tried for another minutes to get someones attention to take our drink order put it this way we had been in the bar for over minutes before we had got one drink we even tried to go into the bar area but was told that someone would come and take our order when our drinks did arrive the wine was warm we asked for ice but once again too this point it was around so we decide to check into our rooms my key came first so up i went have too say the room was lovely although very small room it was a twin room and the beds were very close together but for a night stay it was sufficient thankfully we did have much baggage as there would have been much,1
1610,we had the room with terrace is really recommendable only negative point roomservice is only until pm friendly staff public transport are easily accessible parking garage is directly under the hotel is with eur unfortunately not quite cheap,1
1611,our initial encounter with this hotel was not what we had hoped for since they could find our booking we had booked through secret escapes it sorted itself out and we got a normal sized room for two we had however booked a larger room which we got the following day the staff was very helpful so there was nothing to complain about the hotel itself is absolutely fantastic very large and with nice clean spacious rooms the larger room we got was situated on the top floor maybe in what had once been the attic with exposed beams the bathroom was exceptionally large with a shower and a on to the breakfast buffet amazing a wide selection of food very fresh and nicely presented a lot of staff who made sure there was plenty of everything we never tried the restaurant for dinner but the bar offers some very nice i recommend this hotel definitely it wo be the cheapest option but in my opinion worth the extra money,1
1612,perfectly located and an excellent introduction to the relaxed amsterdam way the hotel appearance is captivating from the moment you arrive and then we were lucky enough to be greeted by the lovely smiley lisa on reception our room was beautiful we were even fortunate enough to get an upgrade as we were on our honeymoon i have seen people comment about bathrooms with little privacy it is right to say that in certain lights you might get an eyeful so sharing with a work colleague for example might be a tad awkward but did bother us not sure all rooms are like this tho the are even more stunning than the photos show staff were a joy generally helpful chatty and welcoming we even got to have a look at the chapel food was super and the cocktails were really rather good too if you fancy staying in a laid back neighbourhood a stones throw away from central amsterdam but with its own trendy cafes and vibe oosterpark is ideal only pernickety grumble it really no worse than this was a screechy bathroom door just ill fitting so caused a noise when my husband or i used the loo in the night do go,1
1613,if you are a regular visitor to amsterdam or are handy with a smart phone this is for you it is about half an hour walk from the train station or get a tram if you are a smoker of the herbal kind there are coffee shops near by but not as regular as you would closer in to the city this was the first time i have been in this hotel and at the time it was getting refurbished excellent could hardly tell there was workmen in the building or if you fancy a little walk the arena hotel is situated in the beautiful oosterpark,1
1614,we stayed at this hotel for a weekend the hotel is ideal for couples cosy setting and calm arena the city centre is not for away minutes walking room but the floor was cleaned under the bed but for the rest it was perfect good and lovely breakfast an extra asset is the parking lot under the hotel just eur a day which is reasonnable,1
1615,i made my booking via booking com we stayed for nights in this hotel from to july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you do mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a that contained some sort of a at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next i had to check out the next day before o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or it,0
1616,great place not too far from city centre nice hotel rooms are different i try to get one story room next time will visit again breakfast is nice too will go again the actual hotel is bigger than what i was expecting,1
1617,lovely hotel with great staff the rooms were cleaned daily and were immaculate will definitely be returning we had the most basic room and that was perfect so the upgrades must be even better beautiful grounds to the hotel as well with optional extras of renting bikes,1
1619,i stayed here night with my family i would say the overall setting of the hotel is lovely really grand looking and great decor the staff were friendly our room was ready on time so we got a free drink at the bar our room was nice it was a bit shabby in places though there were dead fly squashed to the wall and the side walls had scuff marks etc part of the wall was peeling it was very clean just a bit shabby though i would say the hotel should make use of the side entrances this would make for a much quicker journey to the tram stop the doors are there so let your customers use them it a min walk to the tram stop and a min tram too town which is nice enough you can get the number tram from sq and get off at alexandraplien the stop after the zoo,1
1620,i enjoyed my stay at this hotel the staff was very friendly and my room was a good size for my needs modern and clean i particularly loved the nespresso machine in the room the location was also very convenient to the museums and close to bridges to take you closer to the center i would highly recommend this hotel to others,1
1621,loved the décor felt like home we were only there a short while but had everything we could have wanted loved the hotel inside and outdoor spaces will recommend to friends heading that direction thank you,1
1622,the hotel is near the and near a where you can park your car the room with a jacuzzi was very clean and warm and the bed was soooo confortable you also have a good free wifi will definitely come back,1
1623,great location near the museums a quieter part of town my room was one of the most comfortable ever great big bed with huge picture window overlooking garden staff was charming and helpful will return,1
1624,we were blown away by the responsiveness of the staff here they truly do care about their guests the hotel is also very beautiful and has comfortable beds ita a beautifuly restored ristoric building that blends in modern touches through hotels gm dino and front office supervisor daniel made an impression on us they went above and beyond to respond to our requests that they had no obligation to would highly recommend staying here and my wife and i will be coming back on our next visit to amsterdam,1
1625,my boyfriend and i stayed for four nights from the to the of july walking up to the hotel i was amazed at how beautiful it was the mix of old and new is stunning walking through into the hotel lobby the place was full of were originally worried about what type of room we would get as we had accidentally booked a twin room instead of double but we emailed the hotel a week before our stay to ask if there was any chance of changing this and we were delighted that they were able to accommodate us with a double room at no extra charge the room was very interesting as it had the bathroom and seating area when you come in and a small stairs up to the double bed above you which i found very quirky although i did find the stairs quite steep and it made me nervous to walk down especially at night and also the bathroom walls were see through glass which was not really to my liking but i still loved everything the hotel was a five minute walk to a tram that would take you to the centre of amsterdam in no time or you could walk and it would take roughly to minutes to walk which was no issue to us as the surrounding area is beautiful and peaceful do be mindful of bikes though altogether it was a wonderful hotel and a fantastic trip will definitely be back,1
1626,upon arrival was given a different room than booked regular double instead of duplex the room was comfy and bright but the floor was dirty shower drain clogged and the roof leaked after it rained i liked the white decor but the white furniture was in dire need of a solid cleanup doors of other rooms closed rather noisily and the air conditioning also made noise as did the pipes i sure knew when my neighbors were taking their showers the whole second floor looked rather shabby in contrast to the public areas of the hotel which are very the upside the café was very nice with a pleasant park view and the hotel was located a short walk from a tram or metro stop,0
1627,loved the historical aspect the park location the amazing and all of the of this place i felt like a local while being treated like a special guest i am hoping that this hidden gem stays as such so i can afford it the next time i go to amsterdam the white sangria imagined by bar manager dior is to die for the breakfast buffet is worth starving yourself the night before for,1
1628,my husband and i stayed here for nights and we loved it it a little outside of the busy center which was perfect for us it was quiet and we were able to get good nights rest the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and is in a great park setting we had a large room with a king size bed and a soaker tub the staff is super friendly and made our stay very comfortable we will definitely be back,1
1629,very nice hotel clean rooms good breakfast very close to the metro and commercial if you come by car you can use the system from amsterdam arena to park it just min walk from the hotel for only,1
1630,stayed for one night after nights in amsterdam since we had a early flight we needed a closer hotel and this one was perfect very close to the train station and shuttle to the airport shuttle to the airport took minutes the shuttle was one time actually early so we loaded and left on timesince we got in later we asked for directions for places close by to eat and the front desk gave us a map into town and we ate at a local italian restaurant is was about a minute walki would stay here again and would recommend it to others hotel was very clean and did hear any noise from the airport,1
1631,we booked and paid for the stay however owing to circumstances beyond our control we had unexpectedly been called back to england at that time we were at the ibis in bruges when i used their wifi system to inform the hilton in amsterdam that we had to cancel our booking this was done on tuesday morning at around i firmly believed that i had given the hotel plenty of notice of my cancellation upon arriving back in england at around pm dieppe i discovered that the email was sent by the iphone when it connected at home i have subsequently sent two emails asking for a refund and received no reply just goes to show how bad wifi can be cost me because email not received before checking in beware anyone using wifi abroad make sure that if you are relying on email to cancel bookings that you also phone hotel to check a very expensive and unfortunate lesson not of my making would much rather been in amsterdam than hospital here visiting dad,1
1632,they do not have a kitchen so meals supplied are microwaved would not recommend for the price that we paid breakfast was ok much better than the evening meal staff were friendly enough and the room was ok i just felt that it was way overpriced for what we got,0
1633,all in all a very modern luxury hotel ideal for the allianz arena and only a minute metro ride into central amsterdam modern rooms and an excellent choice for breakfast also has its own modern gym facility,1
1634,if you are looking for a hotel that is reasonably priced and only a minute metro ride from amsterdam i would definitely recommend hampton by hilton bijlmer arena i did want to be trapped in the centre of amsterdam so finding an alternative location not to near nor to far was my primary motivation for choosing this hotel literally a stone throw from the bus and train station you can travel to and from amsterdam centre with ease and it a nice hotel however if you are adverse to football crowds then that could be problematic because the ajax stadium is in the same vicinity and on match day you ca avoid them otherwise you find the location suited for that small escape from amsterdam centre,1
1635,just by luck we booked this hotel and right from the start we knew we had a winner great location just at the train station that takes you to the city and also the the hotel is a shopping precinct and a great variety of different eating places and the imax the service was great the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast was sufficient and a great variety only problem was there was insufficient room for everyone and there was a waiting period during the peak times and they did restock everything nearing finish time of serving which if you had to wait for a seat and then not have everything available was a bit disappointing still having said that this hotel was a winner and very happy to recommend,1
1636,we had a family of us three night visit to amsterdam we arrived early and the staff were great checking us in with no problem even though were were hrs early throughout the stay the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble there is a pleasant bar area and the drinks prices are reasonable for hotel is just from the bijlmer arena station with trains from schilpol taking minutes and an excellent metro into rooms were standard clean and comfortable and the air conditioning worked well and was quite the breakfast was a buffet and i think that they provide just about everything you could ask had flights late in the afternoon and the hotel provided free secure storage for our you for a really great stay,1
1637,in my job i have to stay in quite a few airport hotels and while most of them are worn out because of the quantity of people staying there this staff manages to keep the hotel in great shape if you beed to stop in ams tjis is def an option,1
1638,ideal location for arena events next to station short train ride to airport and short metro ride to central amsterdam plenty of choices for complimentary breakfast luggage room was very useful,1
1639,so far our stay here has been very pleasant the staff have excellent english and are very helpful the hotel itself is clean and has a homely feel to it the rooms are well laid out and the decor is unique the accommodation staff we have met have been polite and have had our room perfect after each service the hotel itself is beside the metro and amsterdam centre is a short trip away we have a view of ajax stadium from our room luckily for us there is a football match on tonight so we will get to enjoy the atmosphere after the ajax game we are celebrating our anniversary the staff kindly left a lovely note and some treats for us when we return to amsterdam we will definitely return to the hampton,1
1640,surprise trip planned for me for my birthday by my husband hotel was amazing friendly staff clean modern very comfortable room breakfast each morning was fantastic could ask for any more easy journey into amsterdam centre to the airport very quiet highly recommended,1
1641,immaculately clean hotel with professional staff conveniently located next to a train station powerful breakfast staying here was a wonderful experience for me and my family we will stay there again,1
1642,the cost of room was eu but days before arrival hotel eu from my card this is more than times more than room cost i would understand it room price would be blocked but hotel overcharge more than times room cost i could understand then hotel ask for deposit upon but not somehow only hotel knows how much to be blocked without my on my arrival i was in a timely manner and as booked room was unavailable so i got upgrade but then i entered to the room somebody s clothes were there so i have to come back to the reception and guess what manager said to we are not sure we have other room believe or not this is not what guests expect to hear upon their especially after hotel charged me time more than a room cost i prefer not to listen about your internet problem at all so finally i got a key from room which wasn t occupied by somebody else and voucher for drink snack i also gave to mark i got a name from fo manager upon my and i hope it s correct from front office my parking cart to authorize and asked it it s o k with parking payment so i could leave tomorrow anytime i would like and the answer was on my checkout i reasked if my parking is paid and got answer no i explained that yesterday upon i got opposite info and that hotel overcharged,0
1643,i have been staying in hhonor chain for so long but never come across such a poor reception the entire hotel runs by breakfast very limited and has no varieties no in room food service toilets door does close wrong design no early check in as the cleaning service seems to be out sourced and only start at so even though the rooms were available when i arrived they had no one to clean if you are hhonor member do ever think that you will get a special treatment i asked the reception lady if they count my years old son as full person she respond back saying do you think he is an animal and asked for euro rooms and toilets was not clean when i arrived and shower sink was blocked after i called the the room service they guy who works at the reception came up to the room and fixed no fridge inside the gym has four machines onlyas an overall stay away from this hotel,0
1644,myself and three friends took a weekend break to amsterdam to see the sights and attend a festival we have had a wonderful stay the hampton hotel has been very accommodating and we were very impressed by their excellent customer service and their facilities no request went amiss we forgot to bring hair spray so a member of the reception staff brought us up some when one of my friends had a head ache they happily provided us with paracetamol the cleanliness of the hotel was also faultless i would highly recommend this hotel and plan to return here in the near future,1
1645,if staying near the arena this is perfect if also travelling to the centre the metro literally is next complaints internet could have been better in the room but that not a big issue unless you on business they offer a premium service but did use is good and powerful aircon is great and beds are comfortable,1
1646,the hotel is out of the centre of amsterdam but right next to great transport links the hotel is everything you need for a city tour comfy and clean room and impressive breakfast the staff were great,1
1647,stayed here for nights for my wife birthday the location could not be better for the airport for amsterdam centre staff were super friendly polite the room was very clean each day was amazing such a variety of hot cold food ranging from self made waffles to cereal to train station is literally on the doorstep yet you do hear any noise from it it to the airport to amsterdam can not fault this hotel at all we will be staying there again thank you,1
1648,this hotel is incredible it luxurious and clean with easy access to the centre however i found the local area better staying here again in july and can not wait staff and rooms amazing definitely recommend,1
1649,loved the hotel beautiful room updated everything and yes it in a good area however even with a map it is very very difficult to walk around without getting lost when the concierge tells you it right around the corner have him highlight it on the map here a view from the room,1
1650,excellent location walkable to lots of restaurants and museums and away from the raunchy red light district the room is adequately sized but definitely not your typical stateside marriott decor the absence of a dresser complicates storage during unpacking the shower is very good but the lack of a fan turns the bathroom into a steam room after a shower the breakfast in the executive lounge is much better than the stateside version the front desk service is very good,1
1651,hotel is located in a great area near central amsterdam stayed here for a business trip hotel was recently updated rooms were clean and comfortable took a while to get checked in but the remainder of the stay was fine very pricy each night had a different rate which was interesting breakfast was not included in my rate so i purchased it separately at a discount,1
1652,the quality of the staff the qiality of the rooms and the rest of the hotel is far of other star hotels we have been lived in the last years it was very old and outdated we paid euro for nigths and asked for high floor with view,0
1653,these premises are used by apt for travellers river cruises outside road works were being undertaken and this did help when approaching the property but inside the premises were modern and well maintained staff were friendly and helpful rooms were ample and housekeeping were on their game we did get to use a lot of the amenities within the hotel but they were in keeping with the rest of the property is close to including the bus and canal boats trams are close and run straight down to the old light district and if you up for it you can walk to most biggest let down was the breakfast provided in the cost of our room while being ample staff seemed to be stunned by the headlights with the large numbers and continual turnover of patrons while we coped with the frustrations it appeared that numerous patrons were able to there was a lack or maybe just interest it was for this reason we were prepared to try the said that if we were coming back we stay here,1
1655,stayed nights for wedding anniversary perfect location in city right on major tram lines so you walk out your day and can head anywhere in town you are right next to the museum district van gogh and riiks yet you are away from the some of the more crowded noisier seedier areas you are also literally adjacent to the lovely vondelpark beautiful for morning jog and midday stroll another street over has all the high end shopping hotel itself has excellent overlooking the main intersection club lounge had outstanding breakfast and dinner and staff was fantastic however gets a bit crowded hotel itself was fully modernized especially rooms which were super clean and contemporary beware beds are very very firm elevators a bit tricky with card readers not working so well but everyone managed very modern type hotel and i mean that as a sincere compliment will definitely stay here again when we return to amsterdam,1
1656,reserved this hotel for parents visiting me from the us and it was a great property they are accustomed to travelers landing early from international flights so early check in is usually possible for guests with status rooms had outlets for american appliances which was interesting and shows they understand their clientele will continue to send out of town visitors to this property,1
1657,had a night stay at this recently renovated hotel rooms look more modern and new beds ensured a great slumber we had access to the business lounge where a good spread of foods were made available at breakfast and evening times and with refreshments aplenty throughout the park is next to the hotel for a good morning run or evening strolls there a couple of ferry services that offer canal rides in front of the hotel across the street enjoyed the hr ferry ride that took us around the major canal were courteous and helpful especially with suggestions on what to do around the city with updates on most recent tourist clean hotel there a tram stop right infront of the a minute walk to the main shopping thoroughfare in had walked alot in this charming city and each corner has little surprises in store from the boat lined canals charming cafes quirky shops cheese stores weekend markets that offered some of the best local foods major retail outlets and an international array of food outlets and restaurants plus the endless offerings of museum stops there always something to do something to try something to eat drink and some scenes to capture in this picturesque of the hotel was ideal to explore the interesting spread of this city,1
1659,i really like the marriott brand and this hotel was up to its high standards service was attentive rooms well appointed self service laundry available which was helpful concierge staff was helpful in finding sights and restaurants best part is the hotel is centrally located major sites all within minutes walking distance right next to vondelpark the museums were about minute walk although no airport shuttle the bus from the airport stops right in front of hotel very convenient only euros would stay here again if i returned to amsterdam,1
1660,great hotel with warmful staff the room for was ok in spite we did have free wifi payed breakfast was ok but very crowded good location close to museums shops and trams a goof place to stay,1
1661,just finished a day stay here earlier this month the amsterdam marriott is situated in leidesplein a stones throw from the rijks and the van gogh it is right next to vondel park perfect urban rooms are well maintained but small according to american standards however they are comparable to most european hotel rooms in size after looking at a regular room i decided to stay in a suite on the floor the highest floor which was very roomy with a balcony this turned out to be a perfect choice as the room overlooked leidesplein and afforded a view of the canals as staff are extremely polite and pretty much handled everything with professionalism and courtesy the hotel has two restaurants midtown grill steakhouse and sorels we had dinner at the grill one of the days and found the food to be is an executive lounge for use by marriott members and we had breakfast there most days it was well stocked and the staff made sure that everything was replaced promptly they also have made to order eggs for breakfast we did not use the lounge for evening snacks but did notice that it got a little crowded in the peak hours of the evening snacks seemed to be quite sumptuous as service was excellent the concierge booked all the tickets we needed and made the requisite dinner bookings and also had some great touristy suggestions as well i highly recommend this hotel for a amsterdam city stay,1
1662,this is beautiful hotel near the tram and within walking distance of the museum park the first thing we noticed was how friendly and welcoming the staff was we were given information and touring advice from who ever we asked including the gift store clerk who gave us some great ideas about what canal houses to room was comfortable and the executive lounge was great for breakfast and dinner,1
1663,walkable distance to heineken experience rijksmuseum van gogh etc well connected by trams to city center i have to say it was a bit expensive good breakfast as well nothing average about this but value for this high price tag not really quite lot of food joints in leidzeplein nearbyamsterdam is an expensive city especially if you want to stay in a good area,1
1664,so the lobby is gorgeous and the staff very nice and efficient but the rooms a disappointment it reminded me of a dorm room there is no closet as such a rod with some hangers there a built in tiny sitting area with a table that is small and uncomfortable my deluxe room overlooked the roof and air conditioning ugh if that was my view i guess the standard rooms overlook the dumpsters the executive lounge is nice but not big enough it seems every one can get it and there were kids running around everywhere awful the person working in the evening does have enough help so it takes forever for things to be refilled and she runs it like a military operation when dinner is over and desserts come out heaven help the person who goes up to get a piece of dessert you be told to sit down and wait also this is the first executive lounge that does offer bottled water i am a platinum rewards member so i stay in marriott a lot and know i just do was working properly in our room one evening causing it to drip all night on the stone floor it was a danger zone in the morning to not fall with towels at a premium in this property it was tough we reported it to the front desk at and returned around in the evening we were instructed in the morning to check at the front desk before,0
1665,the hotel is based in a good location near some great local coffee shops cafe and food restaurants a little bit of a travel from the main areas in amsterdam but cabs are too expensive the staff were a little poor to accommodate certain needs such as rooms together with extra bed etc as it was a group of people however great hotel and rooms were nice clean,1
1666,this was my first trip to amsterdam and i was super exited the check in went smoothly and the rooms were quite spacious there was some construction going on at the hotels higher floors which were a bit of a disturbance apart from that the overall stay was great the rooms were clean the bathrooms were well taken care of very easy access to all the attractions of the city,1
1667,we had a pleasant stay here there are canal tours that depart blocks from the hotel and there is a lively atmosphere near there with shops restaurants and a casino however it is much less hectic around the hotel than the central station area which is great after a long day we received breakfast and lounge access with nice afternoon snacks and desserts being marriot gold the rooms were modern and recently redone they are small but we did not spend a whole lot of time in the rooms anyway it was great to find a hotel with double beds difficult in europe which makes it an ideal place to stay with our small kids would gladly stay here again,1
1668,we arrived at from an overnight flight from dulles we did not expect a room to be ready on arrival however our receptionist made sure that we were shown to the executive lounge which we were qualified for due to our loyalty points and while there eating breakfast our room became available room was spacious and well appointed hallway was a little noisy with door closures location is great for walking to old town and the red light district as well as canal tours heinenken eating locations and the museums price is at the high end but worth the expenditure,1
1669,just recently stayed at the marriott hotel in amsterdam and had a great time very nice location easy access to all the key attractions in the highly recommend staying there while in amsterdam,1
1670,we have stayed a lot in this hotel i wrote some very positive reviews in the past we always had great stays here we liked the location being recognized as mrw platinum members and as regular guests but none of it this time frans the parking is the same steady factor in this hotel and almost the only reason we like to come back to this hotel looks like that with the renovations completed the service in this hotel is gone rooms are very sober now i like the dutch touches but there is not a proper closet anymore more colors all grey and white no warm feeling anymore time our stay was not a good one asked for extra towels in the evening they never came there was still water in the kettle from the guest before when i wanted to make a morning tea there was no shampoo airco did not funtion properly i was either to cold or you had to switch it off which was not a good idea during hot days when i wanted to write down my complaints i found out there was no notebook we were not recognized as platinum members no upgrades whatsoever it felt more like a downgrade a room next to the elevator with all the noises that it brings being on that location normally we like to have a drink in their executive lounge this time t was hard to find a seat or a table way to busy,0
1671,after a river cruise we had days to explore amsterdam the concierge at the marriott took charge providing a wealth of information and booking a private walking tour for us were extremely helpful also helpful were his local restaurant recommendations purimas and trattoria toto were minutes away and lived up to expectations the executive lounge off the lobby was another plus for our well stocked with efficient friendly service,1
1672,floor room beds adults kids view was of other side of hotel but did not matter to us since we just used it for a place to sleep and have breakfast for the price of this hotel i was a little disappointed to find out that we had to pay upwards of per day for wifi access i sure this was listed on the website somewhere but my husband booked the room so i did not catch this before the booking either way for a night wifi should be included at no additional charge as for our overall stay we were very pleased with the staff breakfast and special attention paid to my younger son birthday a plate of chocolates were left in the room for him on his birthday,1
1673,we stayed three nights at this marriott property we arrived from an overnight flight from west coast our rooms were ready and we were checked in without delay checkout was equally easy and error property is very clean the rooms bathrooms both room and public public areas and restaurants were all clean and had no odor the staff was uniformly polite and pleasant we did find bar service to be often rather location is quite good it is an easy walk to the van goh museum and reijksmuseum it is a minute walk to old town which is too bad either one of the big shopping streets is also nearby as well in general the hotel is in a quite excellent ate breakfast here and some snacks the food was quite solid and no is a hotel i can easily recommend if you are looking for a a well located functional hotel it has no particular culture related atmosphere or charm just good solid functionality and did not price shop but my sense is that the room rates are reasonable and competitive for what you are getting,1
1674,i have stayed at several places in ams but this is my favorite i am a marriott platinum member so i may get some perks others do but i think the location is what makes this place very good the various attractions are all within minutes walking from the red light district to the historic hotel itself has a good bar and the club lounge is typical of a marriott the rooms are modern and consistent my only complaint would be some of the experiences i had with a few of the front desk staff nothing too serious but i didnt get the sense they were the most it was a big deal my overall experience was great and the overall quality of service excellent,1
1675,this is an upscale marriott and a delight in most ways the bellmen and lobby concierge were personable and very helpful sorry i ca remember their names but they were great to interact with we checked in at am coming off a river cruise of course a room was ready which was no problem but when i asked to make sure we were on a high floor with a canal view it did look like it was going to happen nicole came to our rescue and worked the system to find us a room while we were exploring amsterdam we got an outstanding executive level room on the odd number side which gives the best outside views we had a very large clean room with a large bathroom and a shower thank you nicole when you check in work with the front desk people our friends traveling with us got an even number room which looked at a wall and worst of all the bathroom was small with a pedestal sink and absolutely no counter space to place toiletries and we paid the same price for the room our advantage was being a lifetime platinum and i worked with nicole thanks again for taking great care of a frequent stayer thanks to the concierge who booked tours for us cheaper then i could get online in the states also when they called a cab they were there at the appointed minute the hotel is in a perfect location to visit,1
1676,we stayed in this hotel from thursday to sunday prior to setting off on a cruise it is very convenient to the museums and is within easy walking distance of the rijksmuseum and the van gogh the tram stop and which takes you towards the centre and central station is about minutes walk away we had breakfast included which was tasty fruit cereal cold meats eggs and bacon as well as bread pancakes and other things available on request the hotel is small and the bar and lobby area also small but comfortable dinner on the first evening was made by thomas both he iris and andre were all very friendly and helpful we ate at restaurants on the other nights beds very comfortable a good choice,1
1677,small quaint hotel very clean with soft comfy bed and pillows staff was super sweet and helpful centrally located near the museum district easy access to bus which is a direct bus ride to the airport high end shopping stores right around the corner plenty of cafes nearby we definitely recommend and return to this hotel,1
1678,i did realize how good we had it at jl until we left this hotel to go to another and it sucked all we talked about at our hotel stay was how good jl was and how we needed to return was easy our room wasn t ready yet so they took our bags and assisted us with directions around the neighborhood walked around came back room was ready it was clean facing the street beds were comfortable the honesty bar came in handy we had planned to eat breakfast elsewhere but always ended up at the downstairs restaurant when the weather is nice the courtyard in the back is open for you to sit and enjoy your meal i wish i could remember the person s name at the front desk he was hilarious hotel is close to everything touristy was able to get up early and get a nice pic of the iamsterdam sign min walk if that multiple lines to amsterdam centraal and to everywhere really found a nice restaurant named pompa nearby and there are lots of food options around we didn t eat dinner at the hotel ever so i can not comment you may be able to hear your neighbor s television through the wall but other than that it was very quiet every night did i mention that the beds were comfortable lol just want to make sure i say that if you are walking back to the hotel late mind the numbers,1
1679,everything was fine once we got there we did however appreciate the email or days before our arrival telling us that we were booked into a basement room in your hotel fortunately our travel agent fixed that problem for us,1
1680,great location and very friendly staff in all areas in reception and restaurant as well happy with the big room very comfortable bed love the surroundings too with great shopping and van gogh museum round the corner,1
1681,we really enjoyed our stay the staff were very professional and friendly the room was extremely comfortable and we would definitely stay there again the location is great for visiting the museums a great hotel,1
1682,we loved this hotel so much the first time around we booked again for our trip this past april we had a different room on the top floor which was cute but a little smaller so we requested a new room and were given the same room we had last year on the main floor this hotel is fantastic it boutique with a very cool eclectic style and is located near the museums vondel park casino and a some cool restaurants and coffee shops you can walk into the action but far enough away to be quiet and comfortable the service was great the staff friendly and we just loved our room we will definitely stay here again when we return to our favourite city btw if you can visit for king day at end of april it an absolute blast thanks again for a wonderful stay,1
1683,the hotel itself is wonderful large spacious rooms with many extras great location great ac helpful staff not much to complain about except that rooms were not available until very late in the day we had rooms became ready by pm and one was not ready until pm please try to turn the rooms around faster to avoid delays not a good luggage storage situation either storage while rooms were being made up still an overall positive experience and i would use this hotel again,1
1684,we stayed in a private room with separate bathroom the room was clean and cozy the rooms came equipped with a refrigerator and coffee maker the cabinets where crockery and cutlery are supposed to go were empty though the staff at the hotel were very helpful and gave us ideas on sights to visit nearby the hotel itself is less than a minute walk from sloterdijk station which in turn is another minute by train from amsterdam central trains runs every couple of minutes if you do plan on buying the daily travel pass to get around the city and prefer to sight see on foot or on bikes the travel to and from amsterdam central is euros per person,1
1685,we booked pillows for the location it is near museums rijksmuseum van gogh a tram stop restaurants churches and the vondelpark it has been remodeled so nearly everything is new clean and efficient no front desk check is vía a hand held device a hour kitchen can cook up a meal in no time breakfast can be ordered or enjoy their continental breakfast a small but cozy lounge wifi internet concierge service why not a higher rating our room for two had a king size bed that took up most of the room not enough space for luggage to out or generally move around very tight quarters for one person let alone two people staff tries hard to please their visitors and they do an excellent job we will stay here again but in a larger room,1
1686,i had an awesome experience at teleport hotel the staff is great funny serious rooms location everything good i will be back soon i promise is was a magnific experience thanks for all,1
1687,the hotel is very close to sloterdijk station you can go everywhere where you want from there hotel rooms are clean beds are comfortable and also hotel stuffs are very friendly rooms has own kitchen it includes microwave owen water heater so you can cook in your room enjoy and another thing is breakfast it is also perfect it has a large menu,1
1688,we stayed here just last week and the hotel is clean and comfortable we had an external private bathroom your key card unlocks both your room and your bathroom and they were just across the hallway so this did really bother us the bed was comfy and it has a kitchenette with microwave fridge and kettle hairdryer in the wardrobe is handy towels shampoo shower gel and soap supplied in the bathroom room comes with a bottle of water each and to help the environment they offer to opt out of your room being cleaned any day you like and as a reward they give you a free beer of soft drink there no way our room needed cleaning everyday we had it cleaned once in a night stay and that was fine the area is quiet but it is a minute or less walk to the sloderjik train station and only stop on the train to amsterdam centraal so very well located to get around we did not eat at the hotel at all we went to a local spa shop right outside the station and bought breakfast bits and kept in our rooms fridge to eat on a budget a great shop which is in the amsterdam centraal train station is hema they are cheaper than spa and we shopped there alot you have to try the stroopwafels and the waffles and the pancakes around amsterdam delicious,1
1689,do be fooled by the look the rooms are very nice and clean with great amenities despite having the bathroom in a separate room is a bit strange it is also very clean and i do consider it as a drawback we have not tried the breakfast the location is great you have direct connections to the central station and city center in minutes walking distance as the prices for accommodation in amsterdam are quite high this hotel provides a great ratio,1
1690,i had some doubts about this place as i read most of the reviews but i booked it because of the location at the end i have to say that my experience was better than expected the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly and helpful you can reach the train station easily as it located on min from the hotel we purchased a day rider ticket for which you can use on trains trams buses and metro be aware that amsterdam is a big city so having these tickets made our journey easy and well time consuming the breakfast was great too i paid it in advance if you book the room online through their website you get a box of biscuits which was great as a small souvenir the bathroom is located next to the room and it for all your use no sharing with other people the parking is free i paid for a parking when i booked the room but they gave me the money back so ask for this one you get discounts for the attractions from the reception will consider this place in future ignore the bad reviews you get a bit more for what you pay and this is the best balance in customer service well done teleport hotel keep the good work up,1
1691,nice and clean rooms near to a train station so very comfortable to travel even to the airport the shower is spacious as so the toilet and the place has good security the staff really nice specially claudia she helped us a lot i stay again in this hotel,1
1692,is the second time i stay at this hotel and i love it excellent ratio for amsterdam it s not central but in minute you can reach the the sloterdijk station from there in max miutes the train leaves you in amsterdam central wich is one station room and the bathroom are big and very breakfast is basic,1
1693,i chose this hotel for its location and convenient rates plus ihg member discounts and benefits location excellent minutes both schiphol airport and amsterdam centraal slotedjik station is located steps from the hotel note to get to the hotel by train amsterdam travel card can be bought at ako kiosks and ns tickets at schiphol main hall unlike the gvb pass this one includes trains plus all other public transport front are on the first floor elevators right in front of the main entrance stairs to the left check out with nice professional staff they had a room ready before noon very convenient after a long red eye room i booked a standard room and got a floor one station view not noisy at all were good it had no safe closet nor fridge but still comfortable for my short bathroom very clean good water gel dispenser wall mounted hairdryer plenty of facilities electric kettle continental breakfast complimentary with good fresh selection served at a spacious and bright dining room again nice and helpful would recommend this hotel and stay here again,1
1695,booked for me and my partner in one room and my friend and partner in room which they put right next to each stay was enjoyable the room was clean reception was amazing so friendly and welcoming offered to look after our bags as we were to early to check in it a right bargain as it is right next to the station which is two stops until central station comfy stay quiet out of the city but close enough to get to friendly staff that did mind me putting balloons and confetti in our room to surprise my partner on his you for helping our holiday be enjoyable we are returning soon but unfortunately could not afford this hotel to stay in as quiet expensive for students however very pleasant and enjoyable and would defiantly recommend if visiting again will book in advance thank you,1
1696,although you ca expect plush and red carpets here as it express brand nevertheless this hotel delivers very friendly and customer service orientated staff rooms although small functional with all basics needed for a decent night stay located literally next to station from where you can get to amsterdam central in minutes and airport in less than perfect fix for out of the center cheaper hotel with great connections to anywhere in the city,1
1697,good location good breakfast which is included good wifi and tv pity they dont offer a buffet meal too especially on sunday night when there is nothing worthwhile to eat in this area without getting back on public transport only negative is no fridge,1
1698,i spent almost one week at this hotel last april when i was looking for hotel to stay during my holiday i thought that this hotel will be far from downtown but i found many positive reviews regarding the transportation and the hotel services and utilities in general i happy i did book there my experience was great and and i would like to come back again there are two stations near the hotel metro and tram small walking distance also the supermarket is next on the corner where we found everything we needed to eat during our stay the neighborhood is safe and there few nice shops too close to the hotel flower shop bookstore cafes staff in the reception were very friendly and helped us a lot the team who was working in the restaurant during the breakfast time was very nice and used to offer their services in general the location is good for one who want to visit many places as it located on acceptance distance to dam station the airport van gogh diamond and other i did gave is that because there is no small fridge which i think is important in summer also the restaurant only opens for breakfast,1
1699,great value hotel with big rooms for it price good continental breakfast the best thing about the hotel is the accessibility it is beside sloterdjik station and it is mins away from amsterdam central and mins away from schipol airport there is a supermarket in the hotel at the entrance great rooms are decent for a budget hotel spacious because we can still open two international long haul luggages on floor and we can still move around no minibar or refrigerator definitely stay here again when i come back,1
1700,motel is conveniently off autoban with transportation by bus or train bart the boatman offered tour through was decadently nourishing with appetizing variety only issue is reflected with bart claim of the city tolerance describing openness to moral and amoral immoral as well as islam tv reflects over of channels devoted to instruction of sharia the sponsored by islamic countries no melting pot here an increasing absence of christianity morals and influence also apparent,1
1701,just had a night stay this timeusual great service at check inrecognised as ihg member with free drink and snackslove the new carpets that are being layed on all floors so happy you chose to replace old ones only thing i noticed this time was lack of attention at check out by the trainee on dutybasic thats it its always nice to maybe get asked if everything is ok with stay but maybe i am just expecting too muchwill be back soon offcourse,1
1702,nice hotel fair price near amsterdam sloterdijk station kind staff good cleanig of the room the wifi didnt work so well in the room but there is a hotspot in the reception area ok breakfast but the tables are small and the space is narrow,1
1703,this is my first time staying outside of centraal so i was a little weary about it but it was so so much easier than i imagined we originally got a taxi to the airport once we landed which was quite cheap between the of us but on the way back once we had figured out the trains and it was so easy this hotel is literally stop from centraal and takes about minutes you can also get a pass for however long you there to hotel itself was so nice although we were gutted we did get a fancy graffiti room it was really modern and clean there was a modern kitchen fridge sitting area tv and two double beds i was confused when i knew our toilet was in our room but it was literally outside the door and so easy to hotel is great value for money and i definitely stay there again,1
1704,we had a very good experience the hotel is well located and all staff we met were extremely pleasant and helpful with lots of ideas about things to do in amsterdam the room was a very good size really clean and comfortable we certainly recommend to friends and family,1
1705,trendy boutique hotel the staff is delightful rooms are clean and well appointed loved the nepresso coffeemaker bed is very comfy they accommodated a slightly early arrival time it is in a quiet neighborhood just a street over from the museums very convenient to the parks museums a grocery shop high end shopping and tram stops all virtually less than a minute walk shower had awesome hot water also english tv stations,1
1706,a lovely easy going clean hotel very comfortable we upgraded to an executive room and it was fabulous quiet and no noise at all did not get chance to use the lounge but it looked lovely easy to get to all parts of amsterdam,1
1707,we stayed at for the last few days of a european holiday with the kids the hotel was perfectly situated for easy access to all the big sites right behind the museums and blocks from the canal boat cruises and yet it was quiet very comfortable and the staff made us feel totally at home we would definitely return,1
1708,had an absolute amazing stay at the student hotel it did disappoint and stayed true to its word this was my second time this year that i stayed here and it was just as amazing time as the first time was,1
1709,i enjoyed the stay and rooms were outstanding and artistic the staff were helpful and explained everything really clearly i would recommend anyone to stay here and it would be an ideal location for families,1
1710,all worked fine and the staff and room were perfect the hotel is very clean close to the subway station and the place is absolutely familiar in our next trip to amsterdam we would definitely stay at tsh,1
1711,the hotel is about minutes out of amsterdam but it is located at a major transport hub so it is very easy to get both from the airport and to the city from if you arrive by air get a multi day transport ticket there appeared to a be limited number of restaurants nearby,1
1712,knew what to expect from pictures and reviews but can say we definitely enjoyed our stay clean and comfortable floor room provided great city views and right outside a main metro line stop decent price for a pricey city and would stay here again if visiting say the bed was extremely comfortable and the curtains were very out great night sleep was had,1
1713,we stayed at the hotel for nights and were really pleased with the was easy to find a short metro journey from centraal hotel was decorated really colourfully and is very cool both in the lobby and our room there is a retro black and white photo booth in the lobby too and it just to room was clean and spacious the tv included some english television we had a kitchenette in our room too and a small coffee machine there was no cutlery though we had to get plastic spoons from the restaurant downstairs the hairdryer was good a properly sized one and not a travel one that you would normally find in a hotel the toilet paper was that cheaper more tracing paper like stuff room was a bit hot at times and we could seem to adjust the thermostat also we booked a city view room and had a view of another high rise block there is a supermarket across the road a good place to pick up some snacks overall a really good stay and we would return,1
1714,dreadful hotel they tried to take before we arrived first i knew about it was when the fraud dept from my bank contacted me then we had to leave early due to my father being rushed into hospital on life support in unlike klm who refunded all our flights including airport taxes refused any refund disgusting at such an awful time for all the family especially after they tried to take a considerable amount of money before we even arrived the floor was not clean in the room also you can not open the windows as you are practically sitting on the train track and tram line and there is no aircon in the rooms do not stay at this hotel,0
1715,hotel is new spacious and at a good location super fast wifi connection train bus tram and convenience store all nearby was slow even though i did front desk staff attitudes and housekeeping needs improvement,1
1716,staff were friendly and room was very nice had everything we needed and have a gym and saunas which are both open for long hours which is great and also ideal the location was brilliant there was a bus station and also some trams which stops within steps on the hotel also the train station amsterdam sloterdijk was the other side of the bus station which was no more then a min walk there is a spar a few minutes away from the hotel also there is a quite a few small food places in between the hotel and train station and in the train station,1
1717,we had a pleasant and quiet stay at in staff was helpful and the room was spacious clean and center of amsterdam is at minutes by bus or tram that can be catched near the hotel,1
1718,we stayed nights at the sir albert we found the service to be fantastic and the hotel quaint when we checked in the staff was excellent booking tickets for museums and reservations the hotel is small and the hallways dark our room was very small and dark but fit our needs just fine the location is a bit off the main areas but has a more residential feel which we enjoyed it was excellent walking to the museums if you are walking beware of all the bikers is a place for bikers for sure also be sure to have euros ready for many places do not take credit card,1
1719,the team have a serious communication the service at the restaurant it terrible night a random person enter our room at it was another guest that mistook the door the explanation of the hotel was that an error in the system allowed for a few minutes any card access to any door other day when i closed the room door a piece of roof ventilation whole felt down thanks good i closed door from inside otherwise it would break my head when you have any issue that you want to report to the manager it really dificultades to reach him not serious for a star hotel,0
1720,sir albert was definitely by far one if not the finest hotels i have ever stayed in the hotel decor itself in the reception corridors bedroom are very modern and chic with a touch of class we were offered complementary prosecco on arrival the staff were more than helpful when we were checking in another day we asked for directions to the van gogh museum and the man at reception went out of his way to help and assist us with directions and offered umbrellas to each of us as it was a rather dreary day the room itself was very edgy and modernly decorated and felt very personal and welcoming with complimentary messages on the mirror and my name on the tv to welcome me it took maybe walk to get to dam square but there are lots of lovely bars restaurants shops and markets on the way which was nice to experience there was also a tram about a walk away that can take you to dam square i would recommend this hotel to every type of passenger and hope to return to it once again in the near future,1
1721,this uniqe hotel is located at de pijp district which is less touristic and very trendy definitely my favorite real boutique hotel with a lot of great restaurant great service and very clean,1
1723,great boutique hotel just a minute cab journey from rai and minute stroll form the rijksmuseum lovely staff very attentive decent breakfast room ok and bed very comfortable izakaya asian restaurant is fabulous,1
1724,we had a very nice stay great staff very cosy and comfy room good beds the location is very central and one can rent a bike from the hotel to get around great restaurants and shopping around the hotel,1
1725,we have just spent nights at the sir albert and have to say it was much better than i expected we were upgraded to a superior double as there was a problem with the plug but the room more than made up for the inconvenience we did eat breakfast as it quite expensive unless you like to eat lots in the morning then it worth it location is superb a little on the outskirts of the centre but a very cool trendy area we ate in the restaurant the first night amazing food pricey super trendy bar with some beautiful people and staff i would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again,1
1726,this is such a fantastic hotel we stayed here for nights in february and it was super cool to stay in such a hip place the decor was awesome the room was clean and comfortable and i really wish i had just purchased some of the amenities when i checked out because i still kinda miss the scents even though it was in the middle of the winter the albert cuyp market was in right outside the hotel i have such a great photo of fruit at one of the booths we walked everywhere for those few it was very easy to do the locals would be riding their bikes through the snowfall but i definitely saw a tourist take a pretty mean fall while trying to slow down going over a canal bridge winter biking is not for the faint of heart the hotel was pretty easy to get to from the airport getting off at museumplein and walking a couple blocks we did choose to trudge through the deep snow with our giant wheeled suitcases we were traveling for a month and it was dumb but a cab might be the more reasonable option or perhaps not winter travel no regrets,1
1727,becky simone from beach bum vacations recommended and made the arrangements for me to stay at the sir albert hotel the hotel is centrally located and is charming inside with a fireplace in the lobby the bed was superb in comfort the room was also very quiet with no outside noise the staff are very helpful there is also a place to eat across the street that has a must try salad,1
1728,stayed for nights for a city break within walking distance of the museumplein and close to the number tram which takes you to centraal bed was extremely comfortable it was difficult to get out of in the morning friendly and helpful staff free glass of prosecco on arrival good neighbourhood plenty of nearby we did opt for breakfast as we felt it was on the pricey side and there a bakery very close only thing that i marked it down for was that the sound travels from the hallway into the room very easily,1
1730,first i like to thank becky simone from beach bum vacations for arranging this hotel for us the location was great it was an short walk to the museum district the tram the street market the heineken experience and many restaurants although the rooms are smaller than i am used to it was clean and comfortable and quiet we arrived before our room was ready so they stored our luggage and gave us directions and maps so we could get around we returned at the time they suggested and the room was just about ready so they offered us some wine while we waited the last few minutes there is a restaurant in the lobby area that was always busy but we chose to eat in the area of the city which we were visiting for the day the little on the corner across the street was excellent too i gladly stay here when return to amsterdam,1
1731,we stayed here for nights at the beginning of our week trip the hotel was picked by becky with beach bun vacations and our entire group stayed here too what a great choice super location only a minute walk from the museums and a minute walk to the heineken brewery and the tram stop a ton of restaurants within waking distance as was the open air market staff was super helpful and friendly and the room was on the smaller side but very nice bed was comfortable which was all that matters really neat decor throughout the hotel we would definitely stay here when we come back which we need to do since there is so much to do in amsterdam did eat at the restaurant which is another reason to return super job by becky picking the hotel,1
1732,days before we reached the hotel we were emailed by them to let them know about things that we might specially need in our room we stayed nights the rooms are updated but tiny we walked into the hotel and were pleasantly happy to see a hotel look and feel they have a bustling restaurant izikaya on the ground floor we were taken to the study where we were checked in by maureen an extremely professional and friendly person we were started off on some prosecco the room felt fresh and well serviced during those four days i also had my birthday the hotel left a beautiful card and balloons on the bed for me i was rather hot in the duvet on requesting them for an alternative they did have any thinner duvets but they did leave some sheets for us responsive hotel happy staff and charming environ the red light area shares the same block i had a walk towards that side too walkable to all city center attractions i think i was all in all happy we were driving but did park the car with them it was mostly on the street the hotel breakfast buffet is popular but we could really try it may be another time i hope the next time around they have winter and summer bed linen it is quite difficult sleeping in a inch thick duvet in summers thank you guys,1
1733,stayed two nights using the hotel as home base very accommodating at by eu standards descent size rooms very good amenities with rain shower heads and illy coffee flat panel service wifi rooms facing west on floor get hot so avoid in summer needed to change our room otherwise friendly service with professional attitudes nice am buffet at eu,1
1734,we visit amsterdam at least once a year we had visited the restaurant in the hotel on a previous trip so selected the hotel as we felt we knew what to arrival our room was ready nor was it ready over an hour later when we been told it would had paid for a deluxe room this is not the basic level at the hotel on check in i was told that the room did have a city view even though it was on the first floor on entering the room it became very clear that not only did the room not have a city view but it did have a very unattractive view of the bins and yards of the opposite apartments i will attach a photo the room lights did not respond to the remote controls and the room was very i raised this with reception i was told that if i wanted a city view i should have asked for one even though it is part of the room description described on the hotel website we were moved on our second night to a room of the standard we had booked however that hardly a good start to a vacation the room we moved to was great had lots of light and a view we expected but no apology or recognition of the issue with our initial in all we felt that we were not valued customers and that quality of service and ensuring that we had,0
1735,good size room black dominates the decor excellent experience light switches seem to have a mind of their own no handwashing available in the actual toilet facility no towel racks the inhouse restaurant is japanese south american fusion food is good but our service was indifferent there is a great dutch restaurant across the street easy walk to the museums and the street markets,1
1738,we arrived at the sir albert greeted by a glass of prosecco and warm and friendly welcome i had booked this as a special birthday treat for my partner and had emailed ahead asking for a bottle of bubbly and a small birthday cake to be put in the room the hotel topped this off with balloons and a birthday note the room was lovely and spacious for amsterdam and very high tec lots of buttons for lights etc but not too complicated for this technophobe the hotel is just outside of the centre but with a very interesting market a stone throw away i have to mention the staff who went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable any request was met with a positive and the breakfast here both the service and food are definitely above standard every choice under the sun including hot cold and even eggs benedict should you fancy it the sir albert also has it own restaurant which although we did try it was packed every night and looked lovely all in all a wonderful stay thank you and we will be back,1
1739,impressively compact and efficient with lots of design flair and an airport location just a little too small and intimate for more than one person toilet cubicle and the same for the shower,1
1740,the hotel charged me for credit card costs i did not approved or made i did not paid with a credit card in addition the reimbursement of the breakfast expenses i did not consume did not happen to me this does not constitutes affordable luxury,0
1741,the key thing about this hotel is knowing you will have a toilet and shower in your room if you know this and are ok with it the hotel is awesome great staff great location tram out the door and easy walk from the train excellent breakfast and bar spent nights here and other than having no room to unpack our over packed suitcases we loved every minute this hotel was the starting point for women in our on a much needed vacation from family no romance on the docket so the in room provided extra giggles and as advertised the shower is strong the bed is comfy and the towels are soft would stay again,1
1742,this hotel chain is actually pretty good i was unsure whether i like it due to its plan nature which i go on to in a second great points huge comfy bed wall to wallgreat powerful shower fluffy towels great selection of free moviesnot so great there were people running up and down the corridor outside our room at in the morning which disturbed us a bit not the hotels fault the toilet is to my taste at all but that just personal preference having only frosted glass between you and your partner watching the tv while you on the loo no thanks the atmosphere in the hotel is lovely staff all really friendly and the bar offers a good variety of drinks great hotel just make sure that whoever you sharing your room with you super comfortable with,1
1743,i stayed in the citizen m hotel at the airport in amsterdam too thats why i choose this one in the centre for a proper visit to amsterdam location wise it is about by tram to the centre tram stops almost in front of the hotel which is perfect amsterdam south is quite posh which is nice the rooms are very modern everything lights tv heating aircon controlled by the ipad so maybe if you are a bit older and do know how to work an ipad that might be a problem to share a room you must be comfortable with eachother as the door to the toilet is a little see through the bed is one big one and massive by all acounts which i loved rooms are small but perfect with clever storage under the deffinately visits again love this concept of hotel,1
1744,i loved the hotel rooms are so funky bed big and smart room ipad bar is hours and check in and out was simple only downside for us was that it was a little to far out from the city centre although really easy to get to from the airport,1
1745,citizen m at the airport is a great hotel in a superb location citizen m nearer the city is a nice hotel in a rubbish friendly helpful staff hotel is also nice but for me the location is just so far out from the main attractions getting a taxi in out costs from euros breakfasts are good but on the basic side not much changes day to day if this hotel was placed in the city centre it would be great but of course it not next time i will stay closer to the centre,1
1746,i askes for a small surprise for our wedding anniversary but instead we got surprised with a lot perfect would i say and the people are friendly warm welcome nice to be there see you next time,1
1747,check in was a breeze and extremely helpful the rooms were small but quirky everything worked perfectly in the room would certainly stay again when visiting amsterdam great drinks choice in the bar also,1
1748,since we start chatting on whatsapp with citizenm about our booking that we realised that we were in good hands all the crew works there with love they really like to make part of that team they are always ready to help with everything the rooms are small but very comfortable the ipad control everything from lights to tv to films to ac to blinds etc you chose the mood you want on your room and just enjoy the space the bar service is also very good and open hours they are always there for you so simple and to go in the center you can go by bicycle and in minutes you will be there we will be back thank you,1
1749,thank you to all the lovely and attenttive staff at citizen m amsterdam who made our experience relaxing and enjoyable the bar the bikes the mood lighting the crazy fitness and yoga channel the nuts at the bar not the singing and dancing staff the interesting library the sweet day shower gel and the sultry night shower gel the amusing citizen mantra and the humourous noise the lift made,1
1750,i stayed here for a work trip great location mins on train from the airport and mins walk from the station i stayed here solo not sure i would bring my other half here though it very compact perfect for just frosted glass between the bed and the toilet and clear glass on the shower everything in the room is controlled by and ipad very cool and there is a great selection of free movies on the tv breakfast was ok continental would return but only if alone,1
1751,the hotel concept is pretty cool but i was left pretty grossed out by a blood stain on the mattress that was simply covered by a white fitted sheet housekeeping put a second fitted sheet over the mattress when i said something but there was still an ick factor that bothered me otherwise the hotel is ideally located if you need to get to or from the schiphol airport minute walk to amsterdam zuid train station then minutes on the train to the airport pretty far from the city center but the tram seems convenient,1
1752,it my second time at citizenm always enjoyable place really relaxing place good position going out on the left you find tram number that bring you in center on the right you find railway station and in minutes you reach the one thing that i noticed immediately in this visit is that shower not so clean as before not shower walls but down where the doors are sliding really dirty so nice place that i really have some difficulty talking bad but cleaning is need to improved,1
1753,booked this fab hotel for a stay was absolutely delighted with all aspectspure luxury at an affordable price very accessible by all transport links very friendly helpful staffall in all a really great hotelca wait to go back fabuloso,1
1754,just like the title says this hotel is incredible i had one of the best and most painless holidays i ever had stepped off the plane and got straight on the train to the station closest to the hotel amsterdam zuid whole journey was about minutes to get to the station and minutes to walk to the hotel as soon as we arrived we checked in on their touch screen system in minutes and made our way up to the room whole process was so easy and so simple we found the room with little trouble and my god what a room it really felt like a modern hotel when the lights in the ceiling are controlled by an ipad and can even change colour my girlfriend and i definitely had fun with the ipad you can watch tons of free movies brand new releases too as well as watch tv from the news to comedy central the ipad lets you play music from different radio stations or airplay from your would fall asleep to a movie and the ipad had a feature that powered down the tv after a certain amount of time so we were disturbing our sleep the alarm was a gentle wake up the blinds opening slowly and the lights coming up really tied it all together ready to start the day we navigated to the closest tram stop minutes away and got the number tram straight to the centre cost us for a single tram,1
1755,how different what a novelty we had read all the reviews before making our reservation on but the hotel is years ahead of all other places we have stayed in around the world super cool small but good price for what we received and very high here and get the feel for yourself,1
1756,we are just back from a three night stay here having previously stayed at citizenm in glasgow i booked here for our stay in amsterdam as we already loved the hotel and the location was in was quick and easy we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who talked us through how to use the self service check room was very similar to glasgow with the only noticeable differences being the shower and toilet were in separate huge bed is incredibly comfortable there is a great choice of channels and movies on the tv and i always love the mood lighting great shower within the room from the curtains to temperature is controlled by an rooms were quiet except for the last night when the construction work at the front of the hotel was noisy and woke us a few staff are what makes a great experience an excellent one all very friendly and helpful we were able to buy our tram tickets at the hotel and staff told us about how to check in and out of the trams and talked through the map with hotel provides bikes free of charge which is another nice little added extra the hotel is next to a tram stop and is a minute journey to dam square and closer to the museum quarter it is a short walk to the train station and a short train journey from the location meant that we could enjoy breakfast in a quieter location,1
1757,it wonderful strange hotel staffs are realy realy nice and kind they would answer your questions how many you ask all kindley and theie welcoming is realy good too the rooms are realy modern and they are smart room you can control everything with tablet there are movies musics and radio for you in rooms you can reach to city center easily by tram and it takes about recommend this hotel to families and couples,1
1758,quite a good place to stay nice architecture rooms creative notes in every corner friendly and warm ambassadors who are energetic well located near the tram line and also the canteenm sells the day ticket trams,1
1759,citizen has clearly worked hard on defining its offer which feels modern and differentiated great beds leave little space in the bedroom but the living rooms concept really delivered allowing for collaborative work or individual time in shared spaces smartpad controls in room felt a bit of a gimmick but functioned well so no gripes there catering offer whilst not extensive flexes well for people on different circadian rhythms or time zones helpful staff known as ambassadors which they were location is out of town but very well connected easty walk through beatrix park to ria conference centre mins on foot to museum quarter strolling distance from zuid station which connects with airport or number tram on doorstep,1
1760,i have to start by saying this was a genuinely great hotel every inch of the hotel has been thoroughly thought through planned in great detail and made as comfortable as the little branding details which give a feel about the place to the helpful staff and a which has clearly been designed to give the sense of being in a big that visitors can feel at home rooms themselves are excellent and very space efficient but by far the biggest bed i ever seen in a hotel for a single traveller it fantastic although you want to be very close with your partner to share a room as the toilet and shower are part of the bedroom so there no hiding any intimate details one unexpectedly cool aspect is the smart room feature where everything from the music lighting and blinds is controlled from one single ipad very a thoroughly enjoyable stay and conveniently connected with train from the airport minutes and a tram going into the forward to staying again,1
1761,i like the citizen m amsterdam because of the happy atmosphere very friendly staff and excellent modern rooms the rooms are modern simple and luxurious with mood lights a superb shower and a fantastic bed in the room you are welcomed with your name on the tv and screens a nice person touch the breakfast is also very nice the location is convenient near the tram and the wtc train station,1
1762,the staff was excellent robby was extremely kind polite and helpful i would stay at this citizenm again just because of him the location is also excellent it is away from the city center and all the tourists but next to a tram stop which can get you anywhere in the city,1
1763,i liked the style of the hotel modern and quirky i loved the possibility to personalise the room light intensity and colour of the light curtains and blinds from the ipad in the room which also had a good choice of tv channels radio station and recently released movies the really big bed was also a plus and the fact that there is food available really made the difference as i arrived at and very hungry i also liked the presence in the hall of a nice and quite area with apple computers wonderful addition for people like me who need a quiet corner to work not fully recommended if you looking for a hotel near the centre of the city or if you like spacious rooms,1
1764,if you go to a citizen m you need to know that you need to expect relatively small rooms the bed goes from one side of the room to the other this gives it a very cool feel the interior decorating and modern tablet control of the room makes it a very fun and comfortable place to stay personally i find it perfect for a city hotel although my brother finds the rooms too small the idea in the citizen m hotels is that your leasure area is in the area and the rooms are literally only to sleep and watch a movie in the staff were great and very love the ambience the moderness and the overall idea and setup of citizem to get into town it takes about by tram and the tram station is just around the corner this makes it a bit far out for some people but it is definitely doable although coming back in the early morning hours was a bit challenging and we ended up having to take an uber the train station is about a min walk and this is probably your cheapest option to get to the hotel from the airport only a few euros,1
1765,my partner and i stayed here for days in august and we loved it the hotel is very modern and the tablets in the rooms to control temperature mood lighting tv etc was a really cool touch the staff were very welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived until we left the tram into the centre of amsterdam is a few seconds walk from the hotel and runs really frequently the breakfast at the hotel however did look very appetising also the prices in the canteen were a bit extortionate for small nibbles and refreshments apart from this it was a really good hotel to stay in and would recommend,1
1766,i stayed here not too long ago for my birthday trip to europe i loved this place i ca wait to go back at first i was concerned about the distance from the center but the train to the center is right in front of the hotel so we got day train passes which made it easy for us at the time i booked there was a race in town so this was my best option and i glad i chose this hotel the shower is like nothing i ever saw before although it was really neat to watch the light colors change we also pretty much controlled the tv blinds and lights via an ipad i was very pleased with my stay,1
1767,great hotel staff very helpful and friendly the bed is big clean and comfortable room very modern you monitor every thing in the room with an ipad food is excellent and affordable minutes walk to airport station and if you want to go downtown the tram no is next to the hotel i highly recommend it,1
1768,clean and comfy with everything we needed for a two night stay good location for the arena and are quirky with good facilities but the pod toilet might put some off beds large and small irritation was super slow bar man on saturday which meant our free drinks had to be necked otherwise all staff helpful and friendly,1
1769,great hotel every time i stay here i have nothing negative to say the staff are friendly efficient and helpful the beds are so comfortable and room temperature easy to manage it also very clean and well furnished,1
1770,the hotel is really nice it suits the guests who would like to enjoy a relatively big rooms compared to amsterdam other small room is located minutes away by train or bus from amsterdam downtown but exactly infront of a train station,1
1771,nice clean hotel great rooms were very nice and locality was the best but just one tram away from dam square which takes roughly minutes to get two close by restaurant one chinese and the other lebanese we not enough options to go out to eat around the good experience hotel food was the best but was ok as we had breakfast while staying there,1
1772,great hotel cosy nice rooms good amenities just opp tram stop away from the city hustle good facilities provided in the hotel breakfast was expansive and coffee was excellent however things they provided nespresso machine we were so looking forward to a great cup of coffee however the machine did not work on most days it used to swallow the capsules and did work for couple of days despite all our refrigerator in the room and that ok but the can dispensing machine also did not work so had to order cans stuff from room most disappointing issue for us was that the housekeeping cleaning service was quite bad food stains hairs soap scum in bathrooms remained as it is and was never cleaned i had raised a complaint with the front desk and was shocked to see the same stains hairs even on our return it remained that way for all the nites we stayed there such was the quality of housekeeping other than that this hotel is great value for money lovely restaurant called cedars just walking distance from hotel food was excellent there overall a nice place to stay,1
1773,very modern clean comfortable family hotel not very central but easy access to the tram which will get u to the museums quickly the stop is in front of the hotel ask the staff and get a pass right in the hotel lobby breakfast downstairs is with plenty of choices only wish it had a fridge in the room nearby market albert heijn has anything you need one of my concerns was the noise from nearby highway but with closed windows you sleep soundly enjoy,1
1774,the hotel staff was rude when asked for information pertaining to the coffee machine in the bedroom they also ripped us off by billing us on the mini bar items which were not consumed as we never opened the mini bar as we were in a hurry to catch our train to brussels we did not confront them and paid the over all experience was bad for us,0
1775,the room was way beyond our expectation for the price we paid the double room was comfortable and spacious and very clean same goes with the bathroom we really appreciated the staff who are so friendly especially one guy who helped us with the safe in our room who was still happy even after going up and down times for us to help us out and also speak perfect english the facilities are great and functional there a tram stop right outside free wifi complimentary coffee and tea in the rooms great cleaning service a couple of computers and a printer if you need it a small gym and a games room you will definitely be taken care of if you stay here thumbs up to the staff who made our stay very comfortable,1
1776,the hotel is absolutely amazing reasonable trek from city centre but travel cards made it a lot easier the room was well decorated cosy and well equipped the bed was comfortable and the view was nice the customer service from the majority of the staff was amazing we only have one complaint after my partners purse was stolen we went to the front desk when we got back to the hotel but the woman at the front desk did even acknowledge us until we cleared our throats after asking her what we could do about it because we never had that situation and was sure she said to us do know i guess you could tell your insurance or notify the police and showed a complete lack of interest towards the situation we left it until the morning and spoke to another member of staff and they could have been more helpful unfortunately there was much they could do but they still made the effort and showed compassion towards our situation,1
1777,a very nice hotel the rooms are cleaned every day there are coffee and tea facilities in the room fresh fruit available at reception there is a restaurant which you can pay to eat in the tram stops just outside the hotel and the ride into town is about minutes,1
1778,stayed for nights for our first visit to amsterdam great location mins on the tram from the centre tram stops right outside hotel and there are supermarkets if u turn right from the car park comfortable rooms with a coffee machine down graded this star as depending on which staff you ask you can not get any tea or coffee to make in the machine when other staff are on its no problem breakfast buffett was good with lots of fresh fruit good price for a modern hotel,1
1779,we had got a corner room and the view was a amazing it close proximity to the tram station helps in better connectivity to the tourist was pretty surprised that we were denied the free bottle of water on day we were informed that it was the hotelspolicy to only give the free bottle of water on the day of,1
1780,this hotel has a very good tram line connection from the centre it takes mins to reach from the central station to delflandlan which is right in front of the hotel though you may find it quite far but not a problem at all as the trams run very frequently till midnight rooms are neat and clean and beds are very comfortable washroom is spacious prices are reasonable and this hotel is recommended if travelling is not a problem for you,1
1781,no where during the booking process were we told or is there any information to let you know that this hotel has a no alcohol policy there is a minibar in the room but it is empty and does work i would mind this if i had known before i booked so that i could have chosen to stay somewhere else very disappointing,0
1782,hotels in amsterdam can be pricey but we consider best western couture to be among the best value for money in the city the location was quite far from center but the tram in front of the hotel made it easy to visit the city quick easy system the staff was available to help if you encountered any problem bedroom is clean spacious with comfortable bed it was nice to return to this room after long day of walking and traveling we loved the bathroom with its floor heater the shower had good water pressure too the only downside was that the minibar fridge was working in our room but front desk staffs were nice enough to keep some food we had refrigated throughout the stay we were late risers so decided not to take breakfast in the hotel but the buffet seemed to be good value for a price of one plate of poffertjes in some pancake houses we stayed for nights and next time we coming back to amsterdam we wo hesitate to stay at this hotel again,1
1783,my wife myself and daughters visited this hotel in july for nights rooms only basis hotel was immaculate very large rooms with modern decor coffee machines terrific very large bathrooms with walk in showers location is terrific the tram stops right outside the door to take you to all areas of amsterdam only downside is hotel doesnt have a bar to have a nightcap if getting train from airport get off at lelylaan station its just a short stroll from there,1
1785,we had a lovely stay here the staff were very helpful and all spoke english the rooms were clean and up to date with very comfy restaurant generally quiet in the evenings with a nice variety of definitely stay again,1
1786,this is a very good stay which is near to tram station the hotel staff is friendly the rooms are very large and also affordable but its very far from the city which is not an ideal location when you are for a short visit,1
1788,a lovely boutique hotel in a great location great service and a nice lower ground bar with a terrace onto the canal unfortunately one can not take drinks onto the room was small and up a steep traditional winding staircase but with very high end and modern fixtures and fittings,1
1789,probably the nicest room i ever stayed in the canal view was really quite impressive but the high point is the breakfast i never had better incredible variety of choices and every single one outstanding the la carte options were prepared to highest seems inconceivable that a place like this misses the mark on mundane things like wifi terrible laggy slow and strangely setup ssids choose the best one a better connection was available at the heineken experience the air conditioner was broken and so we kept our windows open which forced us to enjoy the second hand smoke from the people on the terrace below for the canal view and the stellar breakfast these quibbles can be overlooked but with a little extra investment the place could truly be outstanding,1
1790,the location of this hotel is perfect if you want to be in a neighborhood environment and away from the craziness of the city it only minutes away from the cruise ship port and about minutes into the heart of the city many cafe within walking distance and super cute shops,1
1791,john lennon was amsterdam hilton is a great place to rest from the crowds of tourists and rest with a picteresque view on a canal photo attached bed quiet environment friendly definitely come back if there is an opportunity,1
1792,we loved this hotel location in a more residential area where we could walk to the tram or to the museums and other busier areas of amsterdam the lovely park right in front the canal out back the adjacent neighboring shops restaurants etc are ideal the hotel itself is wonderful and the staff were very professional and nice this was a bit fancier than we were used to but they made us feel welcome and comfortable and we were grateful for that the restaurant out back on the canal is great we really enjoyed the executive breakfast dining on the rooftop it is a lovely layout with all one could want and a cappuccino machine to boot it was unfortunate that our bathtub did not drain properly we reported it and hope the next people to stay in will have a better experience,1
1793,visiting this hotel was a great experience from the receptionists to the rooms being clean and the bar team from the manager downwards were awesome and very friendly time i stay here and definitely wo be the last,1
1794,this hotel was really beautiful and the staff was helpful for us to get around its a little far from the center of the city but a short cab ride to all the attractions museum and bars and restaurants,1
1795,lovely location on one of the canals especially for some drinks and lunch walking distance to public transport loads of parking spaces awesome service and wonderful staff the hotel also has a great gym and fitness facility,1
1796,we stayed here a couple of nights before a cruise and could not have been happier the location is excellent with easy access to the tram system and if you wish to walk it not that far to the museum area maybe minutes hotel staff were superior three i like to mention are annet and kin at friendly efficient wonderful personnellinde in the executive friendly helpful nice plan on returning to amsterdam soon and will definitely stay in this hotel highly recommended,1
1797,amazing service from bellman to check in to concierge to amazing breakfast crew and every other hilton employee at this property everyone is passionately engaged in providing above and beyond service my wife and i both agreed we would never consider staying anywhere else in amsterdam a real well run gem,1
1798,though not very near to the hotspots of amsterdam situated in quite surroundings on a bank of a canal actually whole of amsterdam is hilton on apollolaan is a charming hotel with a very friendly and courteous staff made famous by john lennon and yoko ono bed in seventies this hotel is true to its name,1
1799,visited the hilton amsterdam to have some cocktails we were lucky to visit when it was a beautiful sunny day and we were about to sit out on the chairs over looking the canal beautiful surrounding area good service views and drinks the hotel is very luxurious and beautiful,1
1800,top quality hotel within walking distance or uber of main sights but in a pleasant quiet upscale neighborhood fantastic restaurants nearby frequented by locals hotel has gorgeous city views and is perched on a canal beautiful peaceful patio restaurant and bar right on the canal you can take a vacation from your vacation perfect place to relax after being around the tourist hustle and bustle exec package provides full breakfast and city view lounge with open bar and canapés in evening perfect,1
1801,we stayed here for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary amsterdam is one of the nicest places to visit for a weekend the vibe of the city is so relaxed and so vibrant restaurant and bars are full of happy people and it a joy to visit the hotel was nice and we had a nice acknowledgment from the staff as we mentioned in the booking we are celebrating we did stay too much in the hotel as we were our most of the time hotel is clean and the usual good standard thank you for the beautiful weekend,1
1802,stayed here during viking excursion very clean very helpful staff the included breakfast was really good with a lot of choices the restaurant provided excellent food but was a little pricey a bit of a walk for an older couple who had already covered miles on an day viking cruise to the museum area and the city center but the tram system is inexpensive and easy to use,1
1803,this is a very comfortable very well appointed hotel it is conviently located in the ou zuid district close to vondelpark and walking distance to the busy museum district and the old part of town but far enough away that it is quiet and easy to live in,1
1805,rooms are not grand had an executive canal view room which was small bathroom tiny so had to shower in the bath other than that the lounge and location and staff made it a very pleasant stay will for sure be back,1
1806,stayed for one night on a business trip managed to squeeze in a lunch on the canal which was lovely rooms are spacious and well equipped conference facilities are nice and service is very friendly and attentive recommend,1
1807,hotel location is minutes away from city centre but it so much nicer being tucked rooms are spacious nice bathroom has kettle and international tv channels but carpet and wardrobe a bit italian restaurant does good food,1
1808,this hotel and all its services are excellent lovely residential area in a very safe walkable location to museums transportation restaurants and tours easy access to anything you want to see in amsterdam this hotel went above and beyond in welcoming us thanks for making our stay so memorable,1
1809,me my wife really liked this hotel from europe standard huge rooms great interior and lovely very helpful snd well stayed in a jounir suite which was we could have stayed longer,1
1810,i am not sure if this is the amsterdam hilton where john and yoko made love in their bed for a week but they did really help me and i am most was staying for just one night while attending a conference i found the staff most helpful the rooms clean and comfortable and the common facilities is a strange brand once it was very grand and then it confused everyone by getting into the lower end of the market well the hilton amsterdam restores the brand in my opinion here what checked out and caught the train to the airport i was on my way to italy for a friends weekend birthday party only when i reached the airport did i realise i left my tablets in the hotel bathroom i called the hotel and a wonderful lady from housekeeping arranged to send a taxi with my tablets to meet me at the train station i got the tablets and made my way to italy thank you thank you thank you exceptional and caring service,1
1811,we stayed here night before and night after our holland america cruise both nights were very nice the gentleman who accepted our luggage and the young lady at remembered us on our night return after we had been on the cruise the breakfast on sunday morning was amazing wish we had been able to take advantage of it on our return the rooms were very nice and the staff very attentive,1
1812,i was in amsterdam for just one night for business the central peaceful location overlooking a canal was excellent and i was glad to be welcomed warmly and recognized as hilton gold member and the rooftop executive club was truly star and the rooms were certainly good enough nothing particularly stood out though i recommend this property for a business stay,1
1814,this hotel looks almost out of place in an upscale newer neighborhood of amsterdam it makes a good visual impression with a nice lobby the location is okay if you enjoy walking a fair distance to get to any of the usual tourist attractions nor is it very near to public transport the room i had was a good size and definitely clean but the electric lighting was poor and one outlet in the bathroom the only one with a us style socket did not work water temperature was hard to control the hotel provided instant coffee and tea in the room which you need to use because a coffee at the lobby cafe was euros the breakfast buffet was very good and they would also get other items upon request,1
1815,we had a great stay at this hotel the room was clean we selected a room overlooking the canal breakfast was exceptional at robertos the complimentary internet was ok and there was trouble with tv service one night other than that great experience,1
1816,hotels in amsterdam were crazy expensive in late july and we found this hilton which at was steep but reasonable compared to other properties the hotel feels like a cruise ship but there is more than meets the eye the backyard has views of a lovely canal the rooms were fresh and turndown service was offered the breakfast buffet was ample and tasty as was the selection and view of the executive lounge for visitors the hotel is a quick bike ride or walk to the museum quarter and other tourist attractions and the trendy foodhallen is nearby also the hotel also has a nice modern gym and you can run in the nearby streets nearby there a joe and the juice which is nice as well as wilhems and carter which are nice neighborhood places popular with locals,1
1817,wonderful hotel in the hugh end south of central amsterdam location club with great views and excellent food and service area to walk hotel amenities and staff stars,1
1818,the rooms are beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful we really felt the accommodations were excellent though not in the heart of amsterdam this location is within walking distance of most of the oldest and historic parts of town just north of the river including many of the boat tour kiosks and near the central train station the location is satisfactory however many of the museums are far uber is alive and well in amsterdam though so this is a very good hotel you are not in the middle of amsterdam but you are at the center of everything toward the north end of the city if you are willing to travel a little then this is a great hotel,1
1820,my family stayed in adjoining rooms in july for a day stay in amsterdam we were excited by the central peaceful location overlooking a canal and glad to be welcomed warmly and recognized as hilton diamond members and the rooftop executive club was truly star and but we stay in hilton for their rooms and while the amsterdam hilton rooms were clean and beds comfortable the decor was a bit dark and dated the bathrooms average at best and a glitch with the the televisions had them turning on in the middle of the night disturbing sleep the opportunity of this property is amazing and a bit of investment would yield dividends i sure anyway i would recommend it as a good convenient clean safe stay just not what i expect of a great hilton property until they make some investments,1
1821,poor internet restaurants lounge were all too expensive minibar auto charge tried to bill me for putting food drinks in minibar not labeled as auto charge front desk attitude bad located in a pleasant residential neighborhood min walk to van gogh museum,0
1822,and free whirlpools on the bar and restaurant on the and and well designed station is directly in front of the door stations until the central station,1
1823,was not sure what to expect when we booked this directly from the quirky website but we were not disappointed the reason to pick this hotel was part price part location and part the unexpected hotels in amsterdam unless you want to share facilities and sleeping areas are extremely expensive in comparison to other hotels of a similar standard this place was great value if you dont mind a short walk to the trams or using the metro which is just outside then this place is great services are regular and cheap to use and get you to all the main hotspots across amsterdam the hotel itself is a glorious mix of the unusual the strange the unique and that is just the staff the place clearly has an idea about the vibe they are trying to achieve and do it very successfully,1
1824,my two teenagedaughters and i are totally crazy about this funky and vibrant hotel located in a building who once housed a dutch newspaper the rooms are practical clean and love the at ground floor and the restaurant at floor bring swimmingclose for the ourdoor wooden hot tub at the rooftop the neighborghood isnt the most lively but the metro is nextdoor and take you downtown in seven minutes,1
1825,my partner and i stayed here for nights we had a great time and the hotel was excellent this is my first review but thought it was important to support independent hotels such as this and give credit and recognise the great service they is a city that will accommodate every need if you want history fine dining easy relaxed weekend art music or a wild time amsterdam manages to deliver is exactly the same it manages to address the needs of an eclectic mix of guests when we arrived we were welcomed and efficiently checked in the lady at the desk was informative and friendly the mix of people in the hotel lobby and bar summed up volkshotel there were students groups of young families couples and older friends all enjoying the same space this is the beauty of volkshotel it manages to meet the needs of had the johnny jukebox suite and it was brilliant the sound system set up was great and the room was just perfect yet quirky food and service at the hotel is very good on the saturday evening we arrived after the chef had finished taking orders however the chef still offered to cook us a main course and it was excellent we had our meal and the restaurant then transformed into a club with some great and house terms of location it is right by a metro and short walk to tram which takes you to the museum has captured what it,1
1826,stayed there with my girlfriend in july for nights rooms are modern tv with channels in various floor where the reception is the great place to spend time have a drink few good restaurant around recommend dovers dog love their by metro to city centre from airport need take either taxi eur or train metro around and takes around,1
1827,we stayed here for night after hearing good things about the hotel on arrival the reception staff were really friendly and accommodating the downstairs area was really large comprising of a cafe as well as lots of seating where you can charge your electronics or simply relax we later found out there was a ping pong room the hotel is also right next to the metro with quick links to the city centre less than minutes there is also a massive supermarket mins walk away there are also a variety of activities in the hotel to attend such as yoga parties on the roof and fitness classes the hotel itself is huge with floors our room was very quirky concrete ceiling hanging tv pod like beds only thing the room could have benefitted from was a mini fridge the room was on the smaller side but still ok for people the shutter blinds also made the room dark which helped early on in the morning when we were trying to sleep on the roof is a lovely restaurant and rooftop bar area with impressive views of the city the breakfast the next day was fantastic a great range everything from fried breakfast to fresh and ham only downsides would be when i pulled the sheet up from my bed there were other guests hairs that had probably been there a long time which was pleasant to see the hot tub on the roof seemed to be dominated by groups of,1
1828,i arrived early due to taking a flight and was overjoyed that reception managed to accommodate my earlier than the scheduled check in time the hotel is about minutes walk from central station and is close to a metro if you are not a walker there is a good range of local amenities and the area is trendy and central rooms are clean with plenty of light a good selection of tv channels and there is a good overall vibe to the hotel itself the only thing i think needs improvement is the nightclub the two nights i attended were a bit of a let down ie sparsely attended and i wasn t a fan of the electronic style music but hey you cant have everything,1
1829,i love this hotel it has everything that a person needs the design is interesting and the rooftopbar offers nice foods drinks great music and a lovely view i would defeinitely recommend it to my friends the hotel has a great location and it offers you an innovative room design the only bad thing is that the walls a little bit thinner than usually but i personally dont have a problem with a great hotel,1
1830,stayed here for night during a recent vacation to amsterdam the hotel is located right next to the metro station and about stations from the grand central station it super convenient the hotel is located in a very cool neighborhood with some some shops and restaurants away from the chained stores that you see in the city center staff is exceptional friendly and i really like the communal working place on the grand floor as well as the coffee area it really has a great atmosphere and i had a great time staying here than a standard international hotel chain i would highly recommend to stay here to enjoy and experience another side of amsterdam while it still close to the grand central station,1
1831,my husband and i had a great time the hotel is right off the metro station and is clean with friendly staff we rented bikes for the day to explore the city and hung out in their downstairs bar for food and drinks after a long day of adventures we would definitely come back next time we visiting amsterdam,1
1832,did want to pay the ridiculously high rates for accommodation in amsterdam central so looked volkshotel which was reasonably priced and a train ride away there are trains headed to central so literally a train arrives every few minutes it was so close to main points of interest that you could easy ride there as first glance there did seem to be too much else in the area but you be able to find several places to eat as well as the occasional coffee shop all a short walk or an even shorter bike ride away when i was there they just opened a supermarket almost next rooms are massive but comfortable enough for people modern styled and very clean in a way though it a hotel of sorts so do expect the bells and whistles like a fridge branded amenities or even an in room telephone there is a tv with plenty of channels as well as a safe the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful they made the stay there that much overall vibe of the hotel is very young hip and happening with guests mainly on the younger would recommend this place to a friend and i would definitely stay there again if i was in amsterdam if you are a couple looking to explore amsterdam and are looking for a cost effective base to see the sights volkshotel is ideal,1
1833,we quite enjoyed this place good vibe great aesthetics from the funky art on the walls and hallways to the city map they give you that worth framing we enjoyed the first floor bar or zero floor bar in europe and the breakfast buffet which i thought was decent value at night the floor had a great open air patio that looked out over the city but we were chased back indoors by all the smokers rooms clean staff nice it a few minute walk to the center of town but the metro is close and efficient,1
1834,stayed in the edmund hillary room had a good bath shower bed and projector fun decor albeit a little dark and certainly no view it was disappointing that there were no tea or coffee making downstairs bar cafe was well priced very relaxed and is a restaurant on the top floor that we did position for public transport nearest underground approx available for euros for one of the days our room was not serviced by house keeping until by which time i was in the bath if you like friendly different relaxed then this maybe the place for you if you want to be pampered in luxurious surroundings i would probably give it a miss,1
1835,amsterdam is a relatively expensive city for hotel accommodation especially during peak season when we visited recently volkshotel is certainly an unprepossessing building from the outside its monolithic concrete and glass exterior resembling something from the communist era but the contrast with the interior could be more stark this is a very cool colourful and characterful hotel offering very good quality accommodation for a reasonable price we chose the petite room but were pleasantly surprised by its size it was considerably more spacious than many hotel rooms in which we have stayed in similar cities in fact the hotel as a whole feels spacious and benefits from high ceilings and generous proportions the room was spotlessly clean the shower was perfect the bed comfortable and the view from the room was better than expected thanks to the very large window and pleasant aspect facing attractive period housing across the street but also with views to the adjacent busy main street we did try breakfast but the floor nightclub offers great views as does the top floor roof terrace next time i remember to bring my swimwear the only drawback is the fact that the hotel is not really centrally located but it a minute walk to many key sights and just four stops on the metro to the central station or about minutes walk the immediate area seems safe and perfectly fine and there are local eateries as an alternative to the city centre volkshotel is highly recommended for tourists,1
1836,i stayed at volkshotel for nights a couple of weeks ago this hotel has its own unique style of retro feelings i booked a standard room but was upgraded to the sir standard room at the corner with two large windows of city view which was excellent the room was cosy functional and fun it makes staying at a hotel is not only about sleeping but has some positive feels to it i especially love the large long desk by the window that i can eat read and put everything on it i did not use the hot tub on the rooftop but it seems fun there are many spaces on the ground floor to meet and hang out overall staying at volkshotel gave me some new experience it not the most luxurious nor the most inexpensive hotel but it definitely a fun comfortable one oh did i mention the wibautstraat metro station is just outside the door of minutes of walking making the traffic super easy,1
1837,a very good hotel with a quirky and quite hipster feel to it friendly staff and within a couple of hundred yards to the nearest metro which takes you to the city centre within a few minutes never tried the food in the hotel but had a drink at the bar which was ok hot tubs on the roof looked good but did go in as weather was a bit cold best part of the hotel for me was the chilled feel to it and our room although small was cosy and well worth the price would recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam and would visit again,1
1838,stayed here for one night with my dad the hotel is really quirky and fun since we stayed there was any noise from partying or anything the club i the seventh floor was actually quite nice for a drink and enjoying the view the location is not bad four stops on the metro to the central station or a nice walk along the river the beds are on a raised platform so you sort of have to climb in there was only one stool and it was a twin room so there should have been two my only real grievance is that the breakfast is far too expensive if you walk one block towards city centre you find the breakfast club which serves a great breakfast for a better price after paying good money for your room it feels strange to pay more for the hotel breakfast than you would at a restaurant,1
1839,volkshotel was such a quirky hotel i must say i have never stayed in a hotel like volkshotel before and i was extremely pleased with it i booked the petite room but it was more then enough for the two of and super comfy bed shower had great pressure and even came with automatic window shutters breakfast was divine assorted breads salami cereal crossaints cheese salads bacon eggs fruits one day they even did freshly squeezed orange bikes with them with no problems location was right next to the metro which was handy super friendly staff would definitely stay here againthanks volkshotel for such an amazing stay,1
1840,great premises well decorated rooms in reasonable price away from the touristic crowded city staff ready to help you and make you feel underground station and the bikes you can rent at the hotel make your transportation very lounge and the panoramic exceptional on the top floor serve delicious meals and is always an event miss it,1
1841,we stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon and thoroughly recommend volkshotel for any first time visitors to get on the train from the airport it costs euros each and brings you right into amsterdam centraal from centraal station you need to get on the metro that the underground one not the trams above ground for four stops you can buy a ticket from the machine outside or inside the station i would advise getting a ticket that covers the amount of time you are in dam for very good value conveniently the hotel is located before the lines all split off so it does matter which you get on you get off at wilbautstraat this means the metro is running every couple of minutes to the hotel rather than having to wait for a specific train handy when coming into centraal station from the hotel you need to cross the road and ensure you get on a train heading to centraal station again because there are five lines all running that way you never wait very long when we checked into the hotel we had a party bag waiting for us as a gift to the newlyweds which was a nice touch a party hat a couple of party horns and a pack of bubbles made us smile the check in was swift and simple and the staff were friendly we chucked our bags in the room and had a look round the hotel there is,1
1842,stayed her for my stag but luckily not your usual stag place used to be old newspaper nq and has media and art creative themes abound awesome roof terrace and bar hot tubs and saunas in the roof also all with great views great nightclubs and great cocktails bars perfect for groups in super chilled and bohemian vibe,1
1843,this is the coolest hotel i have ever visited nice design all over the hotel relaxed atmosphere nice staff in the reception and the restaurant the roof top baadplats with bathtubs with panoramic view is a great experiance unique,1
1844,my husband and i stayed for nights we got upgraded so we had quite a spacious room with two twin beds and a loft with a double bed it my second stay with volkshotel and i will probably return next time i in amsterdam we rented bikes one day as this is the perfect way to get around the city it takes about minutes to cycle to the city centre the hotel has a very cool bar with burgers and really nice volks pils beer they also have rooftop tubs and sauna everything is down to the details in this hotel and it all done with humor,1
1845,we arrived to early for check in but were able to leave the luggage at the hotel the room was small but clean and well equiped the bed was had our breakast at the panoramic canvas on the floor and it was great and more than you soon volkshotel,1
1846,visited here based on reviews and very happy we not crash bang in the centre of the tourist hotspots but certainly very conveniently located to get anywhere really by metro a mere few stops and you at amsterdam centraal and the metro stop is literally a min walk from the front door thumbs up comfort room perfectly comfortable decorated in a minimalist brutalist kind of style unusual shower which you could look into from the bedroom fine for us as we are a couple but maybe take heed if you not atmosphere hip and friendly always greeted by friendly receptionists who would go to great lengths to help you out orienteering you around city printing tickets etc also appreciated being fast tracked through to front of queue for lift was a busy night in night club on roof and there was a queue for that food only tried the brekky at around if i recall correctly it was good value expansive selection of quality hot and cold items interestingly had one of the most tasty salads of recent memory from the breakfast bar value it was cheap as such but i think it was because we visited when there was a big music festival on so it must have been a busy time nonetheless think good value for money i would definitely return,1
1847,the volkshotel is one of the most unique hotels i ever stayed in it in a quieter area outside of central amsterdam just a quick metro ride away or stops we had people in our group so we reserved the room it is a lofted style room with one big bed on the ground and two suspended bunk beds up top my husband and i slept in the suspended beds climb ladders up which were actually very comfortable and gave us a little hiding area where we could eat snacks while watching the tv down hotel is equipped with everything you need there a fancy restaurant called canvas on the floor with great views and a bar with drinks snacks in the main lobby our last night in the hotel we enjoyed the rooftop hot tubs and sauna enjoyed a small plate and cocktails at canvas then headed down to the bar for snacks drinks and a round of scrabble the music played through out the hotel is great and the vibe is young and would gladly stay at the volkshotel again if i am back in the region and would recommend staying here,1
1848,the hotel is right outside a metro station and about a block from a tram that takes you into the museum precinct they also offer small boat canal tours ppl from memory which are reasonably priced so you do have to do it on one of those larger touristy boats we went up the eastern channels around the zoo and ended up outside amsterdam centrale staion hotel is on the main road but as bikes are the main form of transport little road noise could be heard and nor were sounds from neighboring rooms present,1
1849,we stayed at volkshotel for two nights in a family room and totally loved the place great feeling friendly staff good rooms lovely view etc the pools and the sauna on the rooftop are awesome no need to bring towels great food both in the restaurant and in the lobby loved the breakfast do go to any of the nearby breakfast places the hotel is much better value for money worked great and the room was very quiet despite being on the floor below the the downsides are really strong perfume smell in the room way too much probably from cleaning products rather hard beds especially in the elevated area in the family rooms also note that if you staying in a family room and have smaller kids you probably wo like for them to sleep upstairs steep staircase not enough protection from falling down thanks for a great stay,1
1850,we were a family of four spending one night in amsterdam before moving elsewhere the hotel was perfect for our needs when we arrived at around the hotel let us check in early which was most welcome as we had an early flight the room was a total hit with us and the kids comfortable spacious impeccably clean and different from your average hotel we used the top floor hot tub twice and were surprised that there was no one else availing of the facility the top floor has a fabulous vista over the city the hotel is so convenient for the underground which is just outside the hotel door there are reasonable places to eat close by the only slight downside we had was the hotel food which was overpriced for the quality of food received the continental breakfast was for two adults and two kids for a fairly basic buffet after coming back from a day the food offering is limited and expensive that said i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for its location and brilliant for a short stopover in the but eat elsewhere,1
1851,where else on earth could you book a hotel room in which a functioning vinyl record player is installed and connected to a surround sound system perhaps nowhere else but volkshotel if you could tell i stayed in the johnny jukebox room i highly suggest everyone to check out the special rooms if you have done so already they considerably more expensive than the standard rooms but could change your whole time in werkplaats dining badplaats hot tubs and almost the entire johnny jukebox room were excellent the canvas breakfast buffet was good although it was by the buffet at my zandvoort hotel service was excellent too the only major issue i had was a little trivial but the bed in the johnny jukebox room is surrounded by a sloped wooden frame structure meaning you pretty much need to step on the sloped portion and then step onto the flat floor in order to get out of bed someone with a bad sense of balance might not handle that well,1
1852,everything was perfect from the beginning the place is awesome the staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are really nice if i have to say something negative it would be that it is a bit far from the centre but there is public transport just opposite the hotel,1
1853,room was cute cool i stayed in the summer clean and well serviced i loved that i could open the window for fresh air well located easy bike ride to the main tourist area hiring the bike was an added convenience breakfast upstairs was pretty good but an added extra charge and excellent views of amsterdam service was good staff seemed a little cool at first but i suspect that just the dutch way they were actually warm and friendly once you asked or initiated contact and i found them really helpful friendly at the front desk i loved the werkplatz full of people activity and great music i especially loved the pianist who played in the afternoons and even jammed with the soundtrack after his own i was nervous about club music but i was there when events were on and was disturbed in the least the only disappointing thing was no tea or coffee facilities in the room pretty standard ask and makes a big difference if you there for some days overall a very relaxed relaxing fun funky and place to stay,1
1854,i had a wonderful stay at the hotel the staff was very friendly and professional a big thank you to esmee for her friendly assistance with my and booking she made me feel welcomed my room was spacious clean and spotless this standard was maintained each day i have stayed days the breakfast was delicious the breakfast team could consider to provide different varieties each day the wifi worked excellent the hotel is not in the inner city but can be easily reached with tram it sometimes nice to get out of the busy crowd i will definitely recommend this hotel for your future stay in amsterdam,1
1855,the best front desk staff ever trained to find a solution for everything beds very comfortable room extra clean excellent breakfast great location directly at the tram station only min to central city center in very safe area,1
1856,great hotel but needed unlimited tram pass because was out of the city center and there was nothing to do where it was located great free breakfast though great staff and rooms and hotel was very clean,1
1857,my friend and i stayed at the hampton amsterdam east for the first time and rowie front desk agent was fantastic friendly and helpful during our stay she greeted us with a smile daily and helped us plan our excursions the location at the hotel is easy and the breakfast is really good i will be back for sure,1
1858,newly done hotel clean n contemporary looking i loved the location more or the hotel i m yet to decide its amsterdam out of amsterdam nice evening snacks for your drinks v courteous staff he packed me some fruits and cookies for my lil one v near to metro calm peaceful and lovely stay it was,1
1859,the hampton by hilton is by all means fair value for money especially for amsterdam the room was very clean the breakfast was good and staff were professional compared to many city breaks and many other hotels i have stayed in europe this is a good hotel however the price is still a little on the pricey side and if you are an avid traveler like me you actually do not spend so much time in the hotel however we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would seriously recommending this hotel to others dependent on their requirements thank you for looking after us,1
1860,hotel is located stops from the centraal station on the tram using the tram to get to museums etc was also very easy buy a pass for the trams and buses trams stop at midnight so get to know the bus schedule and drop offs if you plan to hit the clubs and bars room was nice typical size for amsterdam and the breakfast was very good,1
1861,this hotel and its staff rooms and breakfasts were wonderful i would return tomorrow if i could the hotel is very near the tram with easy access to the central station the staff are friendly and the hotel is managed nicely the hotel is a new hotel and it is very nice the free breakfast exceeded my expectations a lot the staff were helpful and the room was nice my husband did think the bed was very comfortable but i found no problems there are only three channels in the room for the television for english i watched more national geographic than i ever watched before i would have liked more channels as at night my husband and i iike to watch tv prior to going to bed the hotel should have adapters for different countries to convert electricity without having to traipse around the city looking and buying conversion adapters that said i would return to this hotel anytime i loved our stay,1
1862,its a very nice hotel very near central stops away from central by tram which one can just outside good staff and good breakfast hotel is in a quiet place and good neighbouhood,1
1863,highly recommended close enough to the downtown craziness without being in it we hired bikes from the hotel and went on a tour of the local area which was great staff were friendly and answered all of our queries,1
1864,location location location modern extremely clean well built with an excellent staff safe nice neighborhood less than a tram ride into city center tram stop is across the street with several great restaurants coffee shops a small shopping center on the water great property for a family at a reasonable rate we were there with our ten years old wanted to be close enough to city center but not in the midst of it if all hampton inn properties in the us is thoughtfully built as this one there would be many more happy travelers,1
1865,new hotel according to hampton standards created in a former institute building limited parking in the building plus overflow parking garage on the other side of the street which has to be manually opened by hotel staff cost of euros for parking is a bit quite comfortable and low noise breakfast included and rather good with coffee from real beans the young staff is friendly and can just about cope in the busy mornings,1
1866,are very staff about take tram to central station then go anywhere by bus tram cab or walking tram loops the city,1
1867,i had been stayed one night for leisure purpose take tram from central station and only two stop takes this property my confusion was from station it was a bit difficult for me but a local gentleman who assisted me he was really kind esmee who checked me in by friendly and cautious assurance she was extremely pleasant and emotional engagement was there during checking in acknowledgement as hilton hornors member was also there i had been stayed total four hilton worldwide property in amsterdam during this visit i can say she was the best and role model as checking in process most impressing part was courtesy i entered my room within mins i received a call from her thanks for excellent first impression from esmee needless to say my entirely stay became excellent cleanliness in the room was also perfect on top of that housekeeping staff gentleman was also friendly breakfast was minimum item of food selected regarding cutting bread by self service was the best in any other hilton worldwide property in amsterdam once again thank you very much for memorable and unforgettable stay,1
1868,we were a family of adults kids and stayed here from this was a rare amsterdam hotel that had a room for people and was within our price range we had a two bedroom suite with a bathroom my sister and i were in the bigger front room and the kids stayed in the adjoining back bedroom front desk staff was perfect very helpful our rooms were clean and housekeeping maintained a high level of cleanliness throughout our stay the bus to the city center was a minute walk from the hotel the neighborhood was very quiet and near the bus stop were restaurants supermarket pharmacies and little shops would gladly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam,1
1869,we booked a night stay for our wedding anniversary and picked this hotel as it is just outside the old town but within walking distance the check in was efficient and we were upgraded to a room with a small balcony the room was clean and the balcony had very comfortable wooden benches with cushions the bed was very comfortable and large unfortunately i was unwell the day after our arrival so did not get to experience amsterdam itself but what i did experience was the hotel staff at their best i needed a dr on our night and the night receptionist was able to advise my husband regarding this and also advised of the option to go to the walk in centre rather than the cost of calling a dr i was unable to leave my bed so the dr was called he was english speaking and very efficient the receptionist then telephoned for a taxi to take my husband to an atm and then the hospital pharmacy all in all not the short break i had expected but the hotel was excellent and telephone twice the following day to see if they could do anything i would be happy to book this hotel again and hopefully next time be able to enjoy it,1
1870,this hotel is very comfortable and stylish it about mins walk from the city centre but the public transport is brilliant taxis are a bit expensive though the breakfast in the hotel is lovely but it much cheaper to just get it when you there rather than buying it as part of your room offer you can build your own breakfast from a menu so you only pay for what you get staff are lovely and helpful and the hotel is very clean,1
1871,this is a lovely hotel and room was ideal for adults the only down side is location the number bus stops about minutes away from hotel but it probably about minutes on the bus into the centre staff were very helpful and friendly,1
1872,stunning hotel very friendly staff and really accommodating had a standard room which was cleaned daily with fresh bedding and refill of coffee great location away from the busy centre but not to far to just jump a bus into central station amsterdam i have fell in love with i will return and back to this beautiful hotel,1
1873,we booked a stay for nights in the star area beautfiul clean hotel and friendly staff modern rooms with comfy beds and a nespresso machine in the room wifi worked more or less allover large breakfast buffet with everything you need cold and warm to start the day in a perfect way nice swimming area did use close to the city you can either walk or take the bus nearby approx minutes walk to the bus station and then a minnutes drive to centraal station the bus is running regulary and can recommend this hotel and would go back anytime,1
1874,we visited the hotel days ago when we arrived we were asked to authorise euros this was fine as this was a pretty standard request and allowed us to settle our bill as we left the hotel when we left the hotel charged my card again instead of using the authorised amount my bank explained it will take a long time for the funds to show in my account as available due to being in europe my bank recommended emailing the hotel and asking them to cancel the authorised payment which i did and received no response i am still waiting for this money to be available in my account secondly when we arrived i requested my friends room was near us the manager immediately interrupted and said in a tone you book with a multi million pound company and expect a personalised service take a huge amount of my profit if you wanted a personalised service you should have booked with the hotel direct we had just finished travelling and were feeling a little bit flustered as it was and this was not the welcome we were expecting for the remainder of the trip i felt uncomfortable being in the common areas if the manager was there the hotel is advertised as a art hotel but most of the art covering the hotel is pretty ghastly and gives the building a very confused feel the swimming pools advertised to not belong to the hotel these are public swimming bathes,0
1875,lovely hotel on the very outskirts of amsterdam to walk to town centre very comfy rooms with large soft beds and modern clean bathrooms though ours had a large shower very good restaurant and bar area and a serious amount of art work on all the walls of the hotel quick process and the counter has a lovely water dispenser flavoured with fresh fruit hotel has an outside pool for adults and a shallow area for children i did use it so ca tell how warm the water is on the whole a very nice hotel,1
1876,we spent five nights with kids here everything was great we got very good service the room was clean and quiet good connection to public transport and the bus comes very often central station just,1
1878,the room was clean and comfortable beedroom the staff is super friendly and very helpful the hotel is close to amsterdam centraal bus about minutes we also appreciated the daily coffee capsules in the room for the nespresso machine lemon and ice water at the reception for free and a computer and a printer in the had a really nice stay,1
1880,my family and i visited the netherlands early july starting with a night stay in amsterdam we chose the westcord art hotel as it was easy to reach from the main ferry terminal in amsterdam and had onsite car parking we were not disappointed the hotel was super stylish and the staff were very helpful we ate in the hotel on one evening the food was lovely however there were only two staff on duty and the restaurant was very busy we would of ordered a few more drinks with dinner if we had the opportunity still the staff on duty did their best the family room we stayed in was fantastic main double room with an adjoining twin room for our children amsterdam city centre was only a minute walk from the hotel although we could of took a bus we enjoyed exploring the streets by foot i would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity,1
1881,lovely modern hotel lobby area is beautifully decorated the rooms are great spacious clean and modern no complaints also the restaurant on the lobby is great we ate breakfast and lunch there not included in price min walk to the a bus station so transportation is easy although this hotel is away from the city center ride to central station by bus all and all would stay at the hotel again but may choose a different location closer to the city,1
1882,we stayed two nights in this hotel in a family room adults kids two double beds in the room but there was still plenty of space and the room was very clean it only minutes from amsterdam central on the bus and the bus stop is a minute walk away staff were all very friendly and helpful,1
1883,we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel it is all very modern and nicely decorated the bathroom was nice and clean and had a huge shower we even got a welcome card and complimentary water when we arrived the staff was helpful and nice throghout we would definitely recomend this hotel to everyone who likes to be close to the city centre but enjoys to have a quiet good night sleep,1
1884,nice hotel cool art in the hallways and modern rooms with all the expected features staff are very friendly helpful and overall dutch good of a trek to the centre but there are bikes to hire and a local bus very near the home avoid the hotel bar and restaurant for although pleasant a bit too expensive for what you get there are plenty of cafes and bars in amsterdam in all a lovely place to stay for a long weekend away the gorgeous receptionist also lent me an adapter which may make this review slightly biased,1
1886,returned home from amsterdam early hours of this morning stayed at westcord art hotel adults and children my first impressions of the hotel were that it needs a little tlc on the outside the inside reception area was lovely and bright the staff were friendly polite and accommodating throughout our whole stay i felt our family room was a little dated and the pull down bed that the children slept on was damaged obviously not the hotels fault but the beds were comfortable and clean our other family members had more renovated rooms the pool at the back of the hotel not owned by the hotel but you can get free passes from reception was a huge bonus and my youngest son went there every day of our holiday there is a bus stop a small walk away and a bus that will take you to centraal station round the corner from the bus stop is a row of there are children parks and swings down nearly every street which is a huge bonus when travelling with a energetic year old we did eat in the restaurant but we often had coffee and drinks it looked clean and it was well staffed would we stay here again yes without a doubt we would love to go back,1
1887,this hotel is warming there is a bus stop outside takes you to the city rooms are very stylish and comfy beds very are so attentive and is round defo star,1
1888,as the name suggests art is the theme with many works by dutch artist and musician herman brood it certainly hits you when you enter do be fooled by the star and star rating it is one hotel with the main entrance in the big red building not the grey one next door reception staff were helpful upon checking in though they had assigned us with a double room we wanted a twin room but our booking was for either this was quickly rectified and we were given another the original double room had a view of the street not much to look at the twin room my friend and i settled in had a view of the pool and surrounding green area which was better there was a nespresso machine in each room a fancy coffee machine but very noisy room was clean though like most hotels though i wish the usb plug sockets were near the bed rather than near the tv which worked well and had channels from all over europe the bathroom had a large and powerful shower there is also an electronic to get into central amsterdam by the bus heading east also useful when getting the train from sloterdijk station to wherever bus heading west as it is less crowded than amserdam centraal station and many trains pass through sloterdijk,1
1889,i spent the weekend here with friends and we share a room for we thought it would be a tiny room but were surprised with a very nice room with queen size beds made of individual beds each and a very clean bathroom which is always key for hotel itself is very nice as an art hotel it has a lot of paintings and artsy designs in display that you can take a look at it is very well located not too far away from the city about min by bus and the bus stop is around m from the is included and it has great variety and taste great and the backyard has a wonderful value for the price for sure,1
1890,lovely bright spacious hotel staff friendly and helpful bus stop close by to the centre but it is also a nice half hour walk rooms were clean and well equipped bed very comfortable lovely supply of coffee,1
1891,the hotel was about out of the city centre but only a min walk from a bus stop where buses ran every minutes friendly staff they could do enough including sending up maintenance straight away when the room safe failed and setting aside an area for us to put up pictures and play a few games for the hen food and reasonable bar prices fabulous,1
1892,we had a wonderful stay there was of us and this hotel was roomy for european standards there was a water park wit large pools that belong to the adjacent hotel but we had use of within walking distance to center city i t was a great stay and the staff was hospitable,1
1893,stayed here for nights beautifully clean hotel with everything you would need for a few nights out of town but bus route just up the road we walked into town both days and took about mins fantastic art throughout the hotel fantastic staff we did eat there so could really comment on any of the meals nice outside seating area and very large swimming pool which although we did use was popular with other residents very clean good children pool also very pleasant stay would recommend to friends excellent value considering the amenities of the room and the hotel,1
1894,rooms very comfortable and staff very helpful with getting around and services in the hotel food was great had steak on my last day amenities are generally great am gutted i was there in the winter cause i loved the outdoor as well,1
1895,my husband and i stated here for two nights in this beautiful stayed in a junior suite the room was very a very quiet relaxed atmosphere where a var menu was available with fantastic there was some construction works being carried out at the entrance but it did bother us,1
1896,i̇t was quite and peaceful area location is not bad tram bus are go to city centre in minutes rooms are good roof is excellent i can stay again in your hotel but ı wish roof was open till midnight,1
1897,excellent front line staff special mention must be made of patrick as nothing was too much trouble for him we were also most greatful of his suggestions of places to visit as well as his advices regarding transportation also appreciated how he quickly got hold of the doctor when one was required,1
1898,this was our second time to amsterdam and we decided to stay just outside central amsterdam because it would be cheaper this trip was our honeymoon we loved being here last time so came back when we arrived the staff were very nice and our room was wonderful the bed is really comfy and the little kitchen is great if you want to just stay in one night or have breakfast the hotel is in a great location minutes on the train to amsterdam central i would highly recommend this place if you do mind a small train ride in out of amsterdam and want a small little type of room,1
1899,one of the best things about is it location it is stops from schipol airport on the train and stop before amsterdam central it is a minute walk from sloterdijk train station so it perfect for both getting from the airport and into town it also has a tram stop at the station number that goes past anne frank house and up to the hotel itself is fairly new and it looks sleek and stylish the rooms are light and comfortable with a couple of chairs and a decent sized wardrobe the fittings are nice and there is a senseo coffee machine in each room that beats the standard sachets of instant coffee housekeeping was regular changing towels if required and squaring the room up the room could have been a little cleaner it just seemed a little hotel has a sauna and a gym that we did use and a nice roof terrace that we did we sat out till closing time which is but the staff were ok with us staying out a little longer to finish our drinks before they locked up staff were very accommodating of requests and very helpful in general for the price this hotel was very good value,1
1900,excellent location with sloterdijk train station and tram terminal on the doorstep long stays can be booked at reduced rates and the facilities washing machine roof terrace gym and sauna help make business trips manageable friendly staff and studio facilities with clean equipment fridge hob and microwave just minutes tram ride from central museum plein or mins on the train to central station,1
1901,we had an issue with payment checking in and even though we had the money and sorted it in the meantime staff were incredibly rude and laughing at us in dutch not knowing i a fluent speaker no food facilities and area is barren other than a small spar supermarket and sloterdijk hotel could have been cleaner but overall would recommend if it was for the terrible customer service,0
1902,very clean and the bathroom drain was not very good the hotel is extremely convenient to visit the van gogh museum and the museum area in general tram centraal station is only two train stops or direct by bus,1
1903,hotel stay was well priced and is very convenient to transportation hotels are very expensive in amsterdam and this hotel was the best value i found it very but had what we needed it was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful,1
1904,i had a great stay in clean rooms great bed perfect facilitations in the room full service kitchen and in the hotel gym sauna very friendly hosts used the fine parking spaces in the basement as well altogether i very much recommend this hotel to stay,1
1905,one train station away from amsterdam nice modern looks good front desk always with a smile would come back here and recommend it to all my ca beat the for this,1
1906,pleased about our stay ideal location new and modern looks exactly as it does on the website daily housekeeping needs to be improved microwave was never cleaned prior to our check in our room was never swept or mopped,1
1907,really friendly welcome room was spacious and well decorated with self catering facilities and a generous shower room massive bed and plenty of wardrobe space the hotel had a small gym but we never used it we stayed for nights which was a perfect length of is to visit the city sloterdijk station is on the door step with access to the city by bus tram or train lovely helpful staff throughout the stay even borrowed an umberella on a rainy day could recommend this place enough,1
1908,very helpful staff location is outside the city but very well connected to central through bus and tram the rooftop is really cool staff is polite and knowledgeable there is a kitchen available to make your own breakfast,1
1909,a fantastic hotel you appreciate the ratio when you are in amsterdam the location was great near a big transport hub the rooms were light and spacious with wonderful beds and very soft bedding the kitchenette has everything we needed and more shame we did not get to use the sauna or the gym the reception staff were remarkably helpful and friendly at all times will definitely be back,1
1911,this hotel is perfectly located just few steps from bus tram and train station grocery spaar is very close so we did need to pay for breakfast during our stay after our arrival we were a bit afraid that there will be the noise from the street but all we heard in the hotel was silence our apartment was beautiful clean and we fell in love with our king size bed we were unable to get up from there as it was really comfortable huge advantage is also big terrace on the roof of the hotel unfortunately we were there just once during the last day of our stay i recommend this hotel to everyone who does have full pockets of money but wants to have beautiful accommodation with great access to city center we ca wait to be back,1
1913,arrived at hotel at on fri july staff were nice and friendly and check in was quick we were situated on floor and the room was spacious clean and had a brand new memory foam mattress so the sleep was comfy and great bathroom was all modern with a fab shower can not fault the room at all its in the perfect location as was quiet and only mins away from central amsterdam by train you can also get the trams from outside to the museums there is a coffee machine and vending machine in reception if your but then the supermarket is literately mins away and you can get a all day travel card from there for also there are hairdryers kettle and a coffee machine provided in room all in all a great stay and would stay here again when i return to amsterdam,1
1914,it suited us to be out of the city a little bit the transport system in amsterdam is brilliant is on this hotels door step both bus train very near a lovely park to walk in the evenings facilities in the room where fabulous it was bright clean and very comfortable with everything you would need,1
1915,service great and helpful apartment clean comfortable beds well equipped kitchen good to the center by tram bus and metro all mins from the hotel hotel service nice helpful,1
1917,the staff here are fantastic rooms have necessary amenities close to trams and railway station cleaning staff are the nicest i ever come across my only criticism is loud music from nearby clubs,1
1918,no faults at all staff we amazing with great knowledge very helpful rooms as immaculate and modern looks unreal such a great stay also in a quiet location and so easy to travel around the dam with train and tram station outside the front serious but could be become possibly a may or something on the shower as they get very slippery,1
1919,we stayed at the holiday inn express amsterdam south for nights as soon as we arrived we were bowled over by the amazing customer service nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to be hotel was lovely and clean it was also very quiet due to location and that most people staying here were stay for business reasons breakfast was a continental buffet which was fine for us do not expect to be able to get a english as you will be disappointed the hotel were particularly attentive to dietary restrictions such as allergies or the need to eat kosher unfortunately there is no restaurant on site but there are some local restaurants and a supermarket a few minutes walk the hotel you can use the metro which is again a few minutes walk this line can take you into the centrum and amsterdam zuid station is approximately stops along where you can change to get a direct train to schipol airport stop along i would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend the hotel to others,1
1920,the staff at holiday inn express are exceptionally welcoming warm and friendly and always helpful megan and alejandra especially the rooms are cleaned daily the rooms and the hotel are designed simply they are warm comfy and welcoming the lobby also has a wonderful area with couches the beds in the rooms are comfortable the location for people who eat kosher is terrific being a few minutes walk away from local stores and restaurants all kosher as well as supermarkets with kosher departments in them the location of the hotel is great as well in the sense that there is a tram and metro that pass very close by and they can get you everywhere most importantly the city center and the central bus station if you keep kosher the hotel gives a kosher breakfast notice that the kosher area is opposite the non kosher area so if you see a hog picture you are not looking at the right foods for you the kosher breakfast is sufficient but not much more it includes slices of bread cut up cucumbers and tomatoes a boiled egg slices of yellow cheese fruit and some spreads honey jams butter drinks include juices and i think that more or less all if you do not keep kosher there is a much wider variety of foods for you i saw muffins of different sorts and all kinds of pastries looks good as this hotel is marked as an express hotel it is aimed for business,1
1921,as business trip transportation is for fully booked appointments outside the hotel overall experience is good however the hotel location is a bit far from the center without conveneient stores surrounding for personal trip,1
1922,close enough to the city centre wlaking time approx mins or hop on the tram which is directly outside the hotel close enough to central amsterdam but also far enough out to get some peace and quite and enjoy views of the river amsel clean room with friendly and helpful staff,1
1923,we stayed at the movenpick hotel for an overnight stay prior to taking a two week river cruise from amsterdam to budapest the cost for the stay was quite had no trouble in checking in mid afternoon and left our luggage in our room before going out to explore the city we returned to the hotel just after and went to our room which was located near the lift shafts on level it was then that we noticed the continuous noise coming from the lift shaft as the lifts went up and down we contacted reception and requested a room change to a quieter part of the building but were informed that this was not possible due to the usual response that one gets at hotels we are fully booked and there is nothing available were quite disappointed at the response unfortunately we did not get a good nights sleep due to the rather incessant do believe that we got value for money paid and find it hard to recommend this establishment based on our chalked it down to experience and will carefully vet further stays in hotels,1
1924,it was may when we arrived into schipol airport amsterdam and it was lovely weather as we checked into movenpick by the side of international passenger terminal used by cruise ships the hotel room overlooked the sea on one side and the red light district on the other and the centraal train station was also walking distance the staff of movenpick and our entire experience was just amazing,1
1925,the room was ready for our early at found the room to be quiet clean and superbly were friendly and the receptionist brought the towels and shower gels midnight upon the request as the room cleaning was not done on the day due to the reason that we were sleeping during the day when the cleaner tried to come to the and tastefull breakfast with lot of options and hot food never tried the dinner and the ice was very near to the centraal station and the views are superb from the only difficult thing experienced was that our room cards were expired after the first day but the receptionist was asking for the before she gave us the new keys luckily i had a passport copy in my and showed it to is the the extra security measure from the hotel side but it would have been a trouble if there was no in my,1
1926,excellent location got early tried to sell me on a suite for additional euro for nights got the cheapest room although paid for vip room took minutes to change to the right room i do understand why i did got my room to begin with,1
1927,my family spent the night in a room for three and it worked out perfectly for us it was close enough to the railway station tram stop and also afforded us a lovely view of the harbor with the visiting ships arriving and departing,1
1928,very clean quiet and wonderful view from upper half of hotel get a city view right on the ij river so you can watch all the boat action as well as beautiful night and day views if the amsterdam staff was very helpful and friendly even had a current converter they let us borrow to charge our phones room was also good size and bed very comfy small fridge included very handy to tram station to take you to central station where you can get to anywehre in the city,1
1929,we stayed for nights in preparation for a river rhine were situated on the floor facing the river and were able to watch all the river traffic pass view was nothing short of room size was good by european standards with all mod cons including minibar cable tv with movies facilities was a good size with illuminated makeup mirror and hair liked the fact there was an ironing board and iron in the room it makes all the difference if you have been on the road a reception and concierge staff were extremely polite and and bar staff were cheerful and is a gym and massage facilities tram stop to the city is away and there is a hotel shuttle that you can use as is a bike friendly city so it is no surprise to find the hotels have bikes for hotel is close to the waterfront central station science and maritime museums and the city centre which is tram stops would highly recommend this hotel,1
1930,great hotel rooms are very comfortable and clean great location walk or courtesy shuttle to main train staff is fantastic very helpful if you feel like takeoff a bike there a rental shop right next door,1
1931,beautiful spacious room with lovely views convenient to city center great buffet breakfast staff friendly and helpful i would stay there again it is right next to the dock for the popular river cruise ships and to central station it a minute walk but the tram stops right outside if you want to connect to mass transit very convenient,1
1933,movenpick was a top hotel in a very convenient lkcation to end the long day of being a tourist in amsterdam helpful staff and it was very close to where we finshed our cruise would highly recommend it,1
1934,we stayed at this hotel on previous occasions and it is always very nice and convenient staff is helpful with suggestions on places to visit breakfast buffet was very nice we stayed in the concierge rooms and the snacks wine was very good,1
1935,the movenpick hotel is wonderful the room was clean the staff helpful and was of a good standard the hotel is a tower so any room offers a great view it is a five minute walk from the central station and city centre so you can go into the city centre have a great time and then come back to a quiet night sleep the beds are comfortable and the breakfast is great i will however advise that they invest in an omelette chef what they were making was horrible however i will always be booking the movenpick i enjoyed it and recommend it,1
1936,we stayed here in june before we boarded our rhine river cruise down the romantic rhine river with avalon cruise lines it was an excellent experience for staying in europe the first time everything was just perfect especially the check in breakfast and concierge advice and service it is very convenient to the city and tram service we would absolutely recommend staying here the night before your cruise we want to go back soon,1
1937,need to offer earlier check in ensure charge is actually cleared from guest credit card also was not advised of where breakfast was second floor at check in so when i checked out i gave my room key back and then had to wait in the elevator lobby until another guest went upstairs as the elevators are only activated by a room card swipe,1
1938,this was our second visit in so many years we find the movenpick not only a great hotel with a fabulous breakfast but it location close to the central rail station makes it a good base of operations for visiting amsterdam as well as other cities close by it close proximity to the cruise terminal is also a huge plus for cruise passengers,1
1939,my travel agent recommended this hotel and i was sure what to expect because it was right in central amsterdam but i loved it clean modern hotel with friendly helpful staff room was very comfortable and had a fantastic view of the only a short min walk to central city and close to central station the breakfast buffet was out of this world would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1940,we stayed at the movenpick for nights we received a friendly welcome the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too hard the rooms were clean and the view we had was amazing seeing for miles the distance to the city centre was a short walk but the best way to get around was by tram the no dropped you at the door of the hotel the food in the restaurant at breakfast and in the ground floor bar was very nice and well presented would highly recommend this hotel,1
1941,this hotel is within easy walking distance of downtown and central station you can get anywhere from here easily they also have a frequent shuttle to central station which is free there are also quite a number of nice restaurants and bars really hotel itself is very nice clean and quiet the people are great and will help with whatever you need i recommend this hotel very highly if i return to amsterdam this is where i will stay,1
1942,we arrived in family to amsterdam after a long trip it was important a quicky and easy and also an excelent breakfast the next location to walk to downtown nemo and navy museum,1
1943,we stayed for night on holidays in amsterdam adults and kids age and it was perfect clean nice staff and an minute walk to central station interconnecting rooms super loved it,1
1944,nice city hotel with a very good location in the middle of the rooms are spacious and the gym is well lady who checked us in laura was very welcoming and friendly and gave us a lot of would return,1
1945,for cruisers this hotel is in the perfect location and views from bedrooms are great bedrooms are of good size and well appointed bathroom is good with very good shower breakfast is excellent with wide choice,1
1946,this was a day stopover for us prior to our river cruise departing amsterdam we enjoyed a lovely stay made more enjoyable with a room upgrade that provided scenic views of the harbour the room facilities were excellent clean the area was wonderfully quiet with easy access to the city station we would not hesitate to return here again,1
1947,the staff in this hotel were amazing every single one went out of their way to help you with anything you needed especially the concierges everyone at the concierge desk were so so helpful gave us advice on attractions to go to how to get there what transport to use etc they saw us constantly getting bike taxis and came up to us to notify us about other cheaper transport we could get which we did not know about to get to places the staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect and that you are satisfied could not fault them at all me and my partner stayed in the junior suite and it was a perfect room extremely clean so spacious and the bed was so comfortable and the view was incredible only problem with the room was there were no plug sockets near the full length mirror which was quite annoying when getting ready and maybe another mirror could have been added in the room as well however these are the only faults i could pick from the whole stay at the hotel location wise the hotel is not bang in the centre however is just a five minute walk towards it which is nice as there is no loud noise coming from the centre when in the hotel overall the staff really made mine and my partners stay at the movenpick hotel in the executive lounge they made sure we were waited on,1
1948,we stayed at the movenpick for nights before a viking river cruise we arrived from our overseas flight at and to our surprise our rooms were ready staff was friendly and accommodating during our visit our room was spacious and lovely very efficient modern design the restaurant in the hotel was excellent dinner our first night was wonderful excellent wait staff beautiful view and delicious food breakfast buffet offerings were extensive and also delicious the hotel is located within easy walking distance of the transportation center as well as the center of town and the river cruise docks also across the street from the trolley alert watch out for scary bike traffic i would highly recommend this hotel,1
1949,spectacular view to the river und cruise ship from executive room on floor very friendly staff very clean room with comfortable beds excellent breakfast buffet only a few minutes walk to the central station and city center,1
1950,i loved the hotel i felt comfortable i wish the price was so high it just one night i mean i not staying forever i liked the people at reception they were efficient and nice they really cared about what i needed i paid cash and had to leave a euro deposit which i did enjoy i think it too much unnecessary since i prepaying the room,1
1951,we was here last year and it was amazing but this year we are shocked from the room services its really bad sheets not changed cups not changed or cleaned and we complained the first day but nothing happened the second days we found everything the same so we decided to move to another than this the hotel was good,0

1954,only issue of euro deposit required at after being told when we checked out that the deposit was not charged to our credit we were very happy with your facility in regards to the quality of the room food and service we especially appreciated the proximity to the city and public transportation,1
1955,friendly courteous professional staff more than willing to aid a weary traveler excellent rooms with great views of the river and port recommend this for anyone who want a great stay and easy access to amsterdam central trams and board cruise ships,1
1956,good quality hotel which we chose mainly because of its location next to the cruise port room had a superb view of the harbour and the cruise ships in port only a short walk into the city centre for good sized room friendly staff especially the concierge who guided us on the best way to check in for our cruise we did not have breakfast at the hotel as it was very expensive at per person may be okay for business travellers on expenses but not for a family,1
1957,after disembarking from a scenic river cruise we were most pleased to find the hotel was an easy walk to the left of the pier with all of our luggage as it was right on the water although we were unable to access our room the hotel was most willing to store all of our luggage and give us a map and directions into the city we purchased a hour tram pass from the concierge and the tram stop was out front and across the tracks we learned to watch out for the bicycles and motorbikes we did not eat at the hotel but there is a bar fridge to store your small items a very nice gift shop is also in the spacious lobby as they were four of us traveling and two rooms with accompanying luggage we booked a van to the airport again with the concierge,1
1958,this hotel has an awesome view of the city it is clean and safe the location is only a minute walk to the city centre you should buy a i amsterdam city card for transportation and discounts take the tram to movenpick,1

1960,very cordial reception very good shuttle service to the central railway station however the restaurant could use more servers dinner took way too long but person adjusted bill located within walking distance of cruise ships and across from tracks,1
1961,the service started out bumpy but they sure made up for it the hotel is right on the water close to the trolley and near the port for the river room is very clean and the beds were comfortable the bathroom had a weird door but it was clean and stocked with toiletries the breakfast was incredible and i was able to try all sorts of foods i would stay here again,1
1962,we stayed here at the end of our viking river cruise viking picked the hotel and we were happy with the location tram accessibility and other amenities breakfast was buffet style with many great choices large lobby great harbor view knowledgeable help at the desk and and the concierge i would stay here again,1
1964,we booked this hotel at the last minute as our airbnb was cancelled we had two kids and needed a hotel that can accommodate two adults and two children the movenpick hotel was within easy walking distance from amsterdam centraal train station our room turned out to be two connecting rooms the kids loved their room the view from our room was wonderful we will definitely stay here again when we return to amsterdam,1
1965,we landed at the amsterdam airport and took the train to central station which was just a walk to the movenpick hotel we selected this hotel because of its location with the cruise terminal next door we were set for boarding our ship the next morning the team at reception were efficient and very helpful we knew our room would not be ready but the hotel has luggage storage and assured us the room should be ready by we knew we would be back by three as we had many things to see once we returned from exploring we retrieved our bags and got to our room was lovely clean spacious great views we were exhausted by this time and just wanted a light snack before bed ate at the hotel restaurant it was pricey for what you got but the food was good and saved us from trying to find somewhere to eat when i doubt we could walk another step it is a busy place mainly because of the location so convenient if you are planning a cruise and departing from amsterdam terminal this is a great place to start and end your holiday,1
1966,the hotel was lovely could have asked for anything else located close to central station so we were able to just get off train from airport and walk to hotel easily which was great because it allowed us to get checked in drop off our bags and start exploring though there are trams stopping just outside because we had nice weather we decided to walk everywhere so i advise to bring a good pair of walking shoes it was probably the best way to explore and see the city,1
1967,my only request would be that to get to your room you have the option of using the stairwell lifts were very busy at times for some reason stairwell could only be used in a emergency we had a lovely stay here rooms very clean staff very helpful and friendly close to city centre we would use this hotel again,1
1968,others recent reviews pretty much say it all i add that it not only next to the cruise terminal but adjacent to where the river cruise boats dock the room had lots of convenient electric outlets for cpap machines chargers etc the concierge spent quite a lot of friendly time with us pointing out sites on the central business district map and giving us tram advice,1
1970,stayed nights after a hour flight from room was ready when we arrived had a great view of the canal no outside size was excellent had and usb charging stations bathroom with was huge within site of the central train station and subway do pass up on the breakfast bar hot and cold rotating cheeses and breads espresso to decaf tea available go full european or all american its there,1
1971,if your planning on a viking cruise this is your hotel you can walk to the boats the service and staff are very friendly and the breakfast buffet is great free wifi and free shuttle to the trains,1
1972,the room was excellent and the view floor city side was spectacular not too bad a walk to and from the train station although i did take a nasty fall in one place where there was a surprising step down in the middle of the sidewalk and look out for the bicyclists who act as if they own the road the hotel provides free shuttle service to and from the train station as well but on a limited schedule that requires reserving in advance staff were very helpful and gracious,1
1973,i enjoyed my stay at movenpick amsterdam great room friendly staff good transport links dam square is close by and trams are regular there a ship dock and a river nearby which adds to the would definitely stay here again,1
1974,the movenpick hotel was fantatic we enjoyed our stay with the beautiful lobby welcome and quick check in the staff were so helpful and thrilled to assist our every need the room was great and clean the restaurant was lovely and the food was brilliant the waiting staff were obliging and happy to talk to,1
1975,wonderful hotel especially for cruise passengers as the terminal is right next door large nicely appointed rooms great buffet breakfast with lots of choices and very fresh food it was an easy walk to central station and downtown will stay here again,1
1976,excellent location large clean rooms shuttle service to the train and friendly staff breakfast had a very wide selection of food which wasexcellent good snack lunch and pizza for dinner at the silk road bar,1
1977,the movenpick is the ideal place to stay when taking a cruise from amsterdam cruise views no complaints about this hotel it also near the train station so easy to get into the city,1
1978,modern neat hotel with a very good service close to the central station they also have a shuttle you can book in advance but it is a minutes walk good breakfast we were adults staying in one room and the accommodation was comfortable,1
1979,we stayed after our viking cruise for and a half days very nice hotel chocolate hour was good ice cream shop on site bar area was nice with helpful staff hotel is close to down town and transportation was always available,1
1980,great choice located next to cruise terminal super convenient staff was very friendly and super helpful in providing tips on how to best navigate the city the tram stop was literally right across the street and took us to city center in minutes when debarking for our cruise the concierge staff assisted with our luggage and when my wife left behind her medicines they assisted in getting them delivered to our ship in a matter of minutes great customer service,1
1983,the hotel is very good the location is ten minits walking from centraal station and comunicate with tram and shutel from is good quality alittel bit crowded but good did like that i arrived at and i had to wait until to have my bedroom ready,1
1984,so this is a good hotel if you are cruising the location can not be cruise terminal is about yards away from the hotel entrance the rooms are clean relatively modern the hotel provided electric converters at no charge hotel restaurant is okay for sure but service is good in fairness everything in amsterdam is grossly overpriced for the biggest complaint i know this is an american thing the rooms can not be cooled to a point that is comfortable it would be nice if the hotel offered an oscillating fan to help move the not not believe signs outside of the hotel claiming it is a minute walk to the amsterdam centraal station it is every bit of hotel stay there if cruising,1
1985,we are really glad we picked this hotel the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel was spotless and breakfast was a real hotel has thought of all the little extras chocolate hour each day you can sample some of movenpick chocolates we also had executive access which aloud us complimentary soft drinks all day biscuits chocolate too in the evening a mini buffet wine and beer is served too which was a lovely staff were very helpful when it came to local knowledge and the free shuttle to and from the central station was handy,1
1986,one of the best hotels i stayed in to day clean and friendly good location lobby and business facilities were good staff were super friendly but not in the annoying way free shuttle service every minutes breakfast was also good,1
1987,could be closer and more convenient we loved the hotel close to the public transportation and next door to the pier all the places we wanted to see were accessible by the tram right in front of the hotel,1
1988,we had stayed at the movenpick hotel amsterdam city centre for a few days following a viking river cruise check in was fairly room was very large for a european hotel and our room had a large couch king bed a desk and closets one of the closets was taken by a safe and refrigerator so that we did not have as much space to unpack as we may have liked our room overlooked the harbor and gave impressive views of ships passing room had a flat screen tv with a huge variety of channels and the wifi was very good and bathroom was large withonly a shower but the shower had good hot water and the water pressure was did have problems with the in the room we could never get the room as cool as we would have liked and the lighting and was activated by having a room key in the slot so i think when we were out the room got warmed back ate at the bar area the first night service was very slow for the area not being busy the servers in the bar area did not seem to have assigned tables and when asked if we wanted an additional drink we said yes and were forgotten about the bitterballn appetizer and the pizza we had for the main course were good but expensive for what they were the breakfast buffet was huge but the immense selection made it a little chaotic with so,1
1989,we had a wonderful two night stay prior to cruising clean and efficient hotel we took taxi from airport for euros from hotel it about minute walk to city center and we taken the tram system to museums from there note on public transportation americans should leave time to purchase tram tickets inside because you probably do have a pin and chip card back to hotel fitness room was basic but nice dinner in restaurant was excellent except for bar service was slow we ate their basic breakfast of coffee juice and croissant the ice cream was worth every calorie overall a little pricey but we would stay here again,1
1990,they offer early check in on internet but once you are on site they do have that there was no ac in the room and the front desk told us they would fix it but we later learned that there is no ac at all in the rooms it is just an air circulation system the windows barely open so it was suffocating,0
1991,it is a real four star is very is stayed here for five nights in a junior was amazing with beautiful was a bar for suits guests from to was would like to thank a very kind staff in this bar whose name is was so kind and it is a great hotel,1
1992,it is very nice modern hotel overlloking the cruise port so you wake up and you see a huge cruiseship outside from your window large rooms with very nice view to the city and the river very close to main station there is a bike rental shop just a few meters from the hotel,1
1993,wonderful clean conveniently located hotel to amsterdam crazy conveniently located to the cruise terminal minute walk upon arriving in amsterdam we were picked up at centraal station by their free shuttle service that runs every half hour and taken to this very lovely hotel located right next to the cruise terminal our room was very large in comparison to other european hotels with a king size bed lots of storage space for clothes as well as a nice long lounger that runs the length of the windows you can on tram located just across the street which is only one stop from centraal station which is the point for all of the other trams and buses which made travel a breeze concierge desk sells and hour travel passes which is very convenient we had a corner room overlooking the water which provided gorgeous views at night woke up the day we were sailing and our ship was right outside window,1
1994,great location great service wonderful experience the staff went out of their way to make us feel special and welcome our room was comfortable quiet and clean the included breakfast was top notch i would not hesitate to stay here again,1
1995,celebrity chose a good property for us the hotel was located right next to the cruise terminal very near to the train station and the central tourist area the best part was the luggage service they took our bags from our cabin and delivered them directly to our hotel room without us even seeing them in the terminal the front desk assisted in acquiring taxi service to the airport very nice service the meals dinner and breakfast were very tasty and served with friendly waiters,1
1996,very good overall experience clise to teain ststion dhort wxlkvto tosn centre easy access to all of amsterddm wonderful sights would happily recommend tge movenpick to our friends and family difficult to find fault,1
1997,very good hotel in perfect room was with a great view to the canal and perfectly clean and relax zone was also great both in the gym area and in the bar at the ground floor,1
1998,located just outside the centre this hotel is around walk away it has shuttle service to trains station every mins booking at the concierge desk room is spacious and well maintained however the front check in counters staffs should smile more no point working on the front counter with sulking faces the concierge staffs however are beyond great overall hotel need to constantly monitoring smoking weeds in the room some time the corridor is stunk with the odour hope management with take note,1
1999,welcoming staff at reception very slow no eye contact we have to approach and asked the staff for checkin we were the only guest at that time should explain to the guests the facilities hotel offer while giving the room keys,1
2000,the central location stunning views pleasing breakfast and general comfort made our stay enjoyable front office staff were friendly and helpful we appreciated being able to leave luggage at the hotel prior to booking in and we would return again to this location in amsterdam,1
2001,we stayed at the movenpick prior to cruising and came back to the location twice between and post other travels hotel was excellent and the staff were excellent we particularly liked the bar area great food and drinks but exceptional service the staff remembered us from our first stay and even helped us with our luggage when meeting friends back at the bar fantastic experience,1
2002,located on the cruise pier there is no better location in amsterdam the hotel prices keep rising but it is still worth the price the rooms are airy well appointed and look out on the water always clean quiet and the breakfast has many options try the three course dinner special the bar burgers are great,1
2003,this is a lovley hotel which is part of a wider chain it is good value for money on a bed and breakfast package the breakfast was very nice and well stocked the bar during my stay was understaffed as i believe the bar staff were off or on a training course the location is good although expect a min walk to the centre or a short taxi ride very clean and comfortable place to stay,1
2004,we stayed at the movenpick hotel in amsterdam for one night and were very pleased the hotel is very well decorated and designed the rooms very comfortable and we loved the location it walking distance to the central station and city center only a minute train ride from schiphol airport we booked a connecting room for our children and the two standard rooms were a perfect size for the four of us,1
2006,we requested a room with a view and received a free upgrade to the floor the breakfast was wonderful we had dinner our last night at the restaurant with gorgeous view fantastic service and an exquisite mea with delicious ice cream dessertl we are hoping to visit amsterdam again and will definitely look at staying at the movenpick hotel again,1
2007,my friend and i went for a long weekend in amsterdam we stayed for nights on a bed and breakfast hotel itself was really easy to find from the central station it was approx a minute walk away check in was very smooth and reception staff very room itself was spotless clean but a tad run down it could do being refit with new furniture and a friend and i probably would stay here again but was fine for a cheapish hotel in the centre of amsterdam,1
2008,although we were exhausted from the long flight from the moment we entered this historic family owned hotel we were welcomed and cared for rick gave us a handwritten map of the important sights and we took a canal tour to further our orientation of this beautiful city the hotel is in a lovely residential area within five minute walk to vondelpark van gough and other beautiful museums center the delicious breakfast is included and served in a beautiful room by warm welcoming staff highly recommend,1
2009,we visited amsterdam to celebrate our wedding anniversary and stayed in this lovely hotel we met a family member gamed rory who told us about the history of the are spacious we had a family room breakfast was great in two stunning rooms one with an amazing stained glass window and another darker room with an old fireplace and chandelier service was great little bar to relax and gave an evening drink before bed was best thing is the location and good value close to the museums and park also team stops just round the corner get a ticket and just jump on and off all day walking distance of good selection of restaurants cafes and bars absolutely ideal,1
2010,comfortable very well maintained hotel with old fashioned freindly service in a very convenient location rooms were tastefully decorated and bed was very comfortable room on top floor had double opening windows and wonderful views over the top of buildings across the street,1
2011,we stayed for nights following a baltic cruise our first night was not pleasant as the room was really too small for people should be a single room and lacking air conditioning my wife took ill on the second morning partly due to the heat we think too weak to tour or even vacate the room to allow the room to be cleaned the staff could not have been more accommodating we had requested a move to a larger room and they let us occupy it as soon as it was prepared after the previous guests checked out and it had air conditioning a real godsend much larger and more comfortable i had breakfast at the hotel the first morning but we very much enjoyed a cafe blushing just around the corner the next days the hotel is in an absolutely ideal location close to museums restaurants and parks and on a quiet street we would recommend aalders hotel highly,1
2012,the lady helped me checking in is very friendly and helpful during the staying the manger is very responsible on making the staying may not detailed but they do correct issues very responsive and smoothly,1
2013,great location just steps from several of the museums easy to walk everywhere the street is gorgeous the hotel and very comfortable we were a family of four and found it a perfect perch from which to explore amsterdam,1
2014,everything from the staff to the facility was first rate our room was clean comfortable nicely equipped the location near the van gogh and rijksmuseum was wonderful we enjoyed walking out each day from the leafy quiet street of the hotel into the city,1
2015,very nice and familiar hotel we lived in a beautiful triple room with balcony towards the garden the location nearby museumplein is also very good it easy to either walk or take a tram to the center of town,1
2016,delightful hotel in a wonderful location near rijksmuseum tram restaurants galore and express bus to the airport room rates seemed high but were comparable to others in amsterdam which are always high especially in single room was quite small with no view but the friend i was traveling with had room also a single but slightly bigger and brighter with a view of the homes across the street so if you booking a single ask for room also lonely planet said something about complementary pastries in the morning but we were offered any were just told that there was a breakfast for overall we were very happy with the hotel facilities super friendly helpful staff cleanliness and location we would hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend,1
2017,a clean and comfortable hotel in a really good location just round the corner from the major museums in the museum quarter a quiet location which felt very safe the staff of this hotel are so friendly and helpful i could not recommend it more highly,1
2018,we were very happy with this hotel you could not beat the location right near the tram restaurants the park and museums the staff was extremely friendly and helpful they were always able to give us directions and advice and we were even able to buy tram tickets and museum tickets directly through them the room was nice and big and they were able to put the two rooms we had booked next to each other which was very nice only small complaint is that the room was pretty hot as there was no air conditioning,1
2020,stayed on business on a few times the rooms are spacious and the beds are huge and probably the most comfortable i have ever slept in never want to get up especially with the blackout and restaurant great but can get very busy where there are event on at the stadium or concert really lets it down only thing hot is scrambles eggs bread pastries meats cheese and some fruit nothing special and not enough choice very boring on a night stay coffee is awful stayed several times and for nights last time and on the last morning heard someone asking for fried eggs cooked to order did realise you could ask for eggs cooked to order they do tell you this when they take your room number as you come in not a patch on the breakfast at hampton by hilton,1
2022,the room design is reduced to the max if you like simple bauhaus style the bath is dominated by orange good fit for the netherlands good burger bar downstairs perfect for visiting the stadium or companies like informatica,1
2024,the jaz amsterdam hotel was very nice and comfortable a little gym sauna and steam room on the top floor was a great about min walk to the metro station and about to the center of the city,1
2025,visited the jaz for a works conference in a large music themed hotel that is adjacent to the amsterdam arena very close to both the overground and underground were a good size and the hotel was ultra modern with a great shower breakfast was a typical fayre of continental type which was hotel had a decent bar and restaurant that had a great selection of beers which was a big plus point,1
2026,i think the best hotel in the area much better than holidayinn express which i also stayed place is really good which has easy access to everything rooms are really clean and clear with a really good bf,1
2027,this is a very practical hotel for my needs the location being a short walk to the business offices i was heading to the hotel is easy to access from the airport and it is easy to get to the city standard rooms are well designed and people who work here were mainly excellent i enjoyed staying here,1
2028,this is a very good hotel and i had a lovely stay it a very easy minutes walk from the metro stop to the hotel metro will take you amsterdam central in the hotel is directly opposite the arena where ajax football club play we got lost finding our way to the hotel initially but once we got it right it was a breeze the internal decor is really lovely complimentary breakfast was however average the bath and toilet was clean with a very easy to operate shower we were checking out very early and i ordered for a breakfast at about the previous night the lady at the desk told me was the last time to request however she was able to speak to the kitchen and put in our request the breakfast was water one banana a bar of granola and two very tiny check your bill well when checking out as one of their staff included an extra night we did stay in our bill it took the intervention of a more senior member to sort it out as it appeared he did understand us saying we stayed only nights all in all a lovely stay and wo hesitate to return travelled with my husband and daughter and room cost per night,1
2029,i always stay here when i travel to amsterdam for work and student hotel has just the atmosphere i hoping for not too formal all the facilities i need and the perfect location also the personnel is super friendly,1
2030,stayed in this hotel for a few nights for my boyfriends birthday in july and it was perfect rooms were really spacious and had one of the biggest and most comfortable beds i ever had the pleasure of sleeping in it is a little walk from the centre of amsterdam but there is an underground tube stop just outside the building nothing like the british underground everything there is so clean cheap and on time and it cost like for unlimited travel for hours this included all the trams and stuff in town so was the perfect way to get around al hotel staff were friendly and inviting and rooms were spotlessly clean would definitely stay here again,1
2032,excellent hotel for all ages close to metro and trams and places to eat we got the transportation card which gave us quick and unlimited metro use and tram use for a specific number of days not until the end of our trip did we realize we could have gotten that at the hotel it would be a good idea to specifically and individually not with other information give guests that information when checking in and then telling guests where to find other provided information helpful for their stay,1
2033,my boyfriend and i enjoyed our stay at a this hotel staff are very nice close to city centre minutes away in a tram rooms are basic but all we needed was air con by bed and a was nice the gym looks good did use it there was table tennis snooker and football game in lounge,1
2034,the rooms were excellent the beds were comfortable and huge and there are black out curtains which is perfect if you want a deep sleep they also had a coffee machine in the room the only negative was that our coffee pods were replaced one day with all decaf the hotel is a little bit out of the city but with the metro right at the door it is perfect if you want to go into the city it takes around mins to walk into the city but it really is a beautiful walk and would definitely recommend it,1
2035,lovely hotel very cool and fun lots to do within the hotel which was lovely but on our last night we went to the restaurant called the pool well safe to say that its put me off ever coming back which is a shame we sat down in the restaurant and ordered drinks which they forgot and then had to wait minutes for them to make a mint tea wait it gets worse they then told us that the food that was advertised on the menus and boards was available when we finally ordered our food it came out minutes later to which my friend ordered the cheese with bread and she received a tiny camembert with very thinly sliced pieces of bread for she asked for more bread and the staff walked off and did bother getting wait sorry they did bring out some pita bread mins later when the cheese had hardened ridiculously overpriced for what you get rude staff and food was that great hugely disappointed but the reception team were incredible the girls are amazing and the rooms are insanely clean and so comfortable,0
2036,they did give me enough info when i checked in so i did know that cleaning was once every two days so i had to go to the reception to get amenities since there no phone in the room no hair driers in the room could stop the air conditioner and could turn off the lights completely at night to i had to take out the room key from the pocket i do think this hotel was a good choice in terms of the cost effectiveness wo come back,0
2037,this hotel is very easy to get to with a metro stop practically outside the door inviting and comfortable with good amenities it is suitable for any low to medium budget traveler the ground floor has comfortable social spaces to sit and talk with friends and an attached all the staff were friendly and helpful,1
2038,i yrs old and this hotel was great so not just for young people the room was comfortable and very clean just metrostops from centraal station it was easy to get to lines and took the shuttle bus right outside the hotel to get to the airport euros,1
2039,this is a great concept of hotel for young people that want to work and have fun at the same time good public areas to work with a laptop and chill staff is great and they really make you feel at home and free to be yourself excelent wifi,1
2040,would really recommend this hotel the rooms are a good size there is a bar restaurants and a gym as well as table tennis and pool it only a minutes journey to the centre of amsterdam also the room we stayed in had memory foam mattress and black out curtains which gave us a good night sleep,1
2041,i was a little skeptical about booking the student hotel for my boyfriend and i trip to amsterdam as we not really anymore but i was very wrong first location is great easily accessible by metro seriously so simple and one of the best we used in europe second the reception is inviting and the place itself is a trove of colourful areas to sit lounge and enjoy we loved the pool and tables as well as the photo booth in reception fun ways to pass a little time or cap off a hard day of sightseeing and drinking the staff were great the room itself was really big and the bed very comfortable as well as surprisingly big we really enjoyed our stay at the student hotel including drinks at the pool and all the many things to do in the surrounding area volkshotel has a rooftop and behind the tsh is a long street with some great places to eat overall would recommend and would definitely not hesitate to book again for a return back to amsterdam,1
2042,absolutely perfect place to stay staff so friendly and helpful nothing was too much room was a brilliant size and everything worked perfectly and was cleaned almost every day with new towels hired the bikes from the hotel which i would definitely recommend as it is worth the money and helps you to get into the centre of amsterdam really easily the whole vibe of the place is perfect and i would definitely come here again,1
2043,possibly the best hotel i ever been to the counter staff were always lovely and helpful the free waffle at was a great perk the puns on the furniture throughout the room and hotel were great,1
2044,every service is good the position is near to the central station nice people and very good breakfast everything is perfect but the bicycle seats are too hard and the sunlight at the moorning through the windows,1
2045,this hotel was the perfect place to travel with friends we were concerned it would be too due to it being a student hotel but all ages of guests stayed there it was extremely clean and was convenient to the metro we stayed on one of the lower floor rooms while our friends stayed higher if you have a choice ask to be on floors better view and more privacy,1
2046,there is a happy and excellent hotel with very kind and helpful staff hotel has an excellent location and metro station is beside the hotel that you can reach the central of city in ten minutes and free wifi is great but it would be better if they put the slippers in the room,1
2047,i stayed at the student hotel because for reasons i can not explain expedia offered my stay for free after i booked the airfare must been a glitch on someone part but i jumped on it reviews were positive and i was very intrigued the space is always bustling with life and there are more than just students that stay there lounge areas in the lobby are cozy and active there was never a time while i was there that i did not see someone playing ping pong i was fortunate to meet a fellow traveler and we ended up touring the city together for the week i stayed in room was a deluxe room i believe so perhaps it was larger than different rooms i ca be sure on the floor it is on a corner had two large windows that overlooked the street a bit noisy sometimes even from up there and had a great view of the city there is a large support column in the room that makes getting to the window a bit awkward i know the building used to be a printing place but that was a big deal also a couple of other room notes housekeeping comes every other hand towel and one large towel in my has no curtain is open and will get the floor a little wet for outlets conveniently near the floor in the base of the bed so you may charge phones as you sleep are very thin,1
2048,the hotel was great rooms were clean and well equipped and though the location was a bit outside of the city center proximity to the trains made it easy to get everywhere we needed i would stat here again,1
2049,everything about our student hotel experience was excellent wish there was more of them around the world would highly recommend to anyone staying in amsterdam to stay here easy to just jump on team or metro to get into centre in minutes,1
2050,i stayed in one of the suites which was spacious clean and nicely the nespresso machine was a nice touch and the room even had a kitchenette the common areas were nice though i did really use them and the gym was surprisingly large and well equipped they even had a barbell rack,1
2051,great location only minutes walking distance from centre of the station is in front of the hotel reception staff are very friendly and ready to help with any question rooms are ok for few days stay quite and clean,1
2052,this hotel was a great find the location was priceless walking distance to the metro station at which all trains stop coffee in the morning was perfect at the coffee place downstairs the room was comfortable and spacious enough for adults overall very clean and felt safe,1
2053,fun and quirky hotel with lots of character suite rooms were great but single room was very basic good location nice with delicious pizza rooms air con was not up to scratch and it would be nice if irons were available in the rooms but overall very happy with our stay and would reccommend,1
2054,we have stayed in the hotel for nights the location is very convenient the metro is in minutes walk station to the central station the breakfast is very good and we had also one dinner at the hotel place has vital we had a plesent rooms are quite comfy and the lobby areas are huge eith alot of sitting areas ping pong and bilirad i want to mention jiska she was so adorable and supportive in every request that we also helped us with our rental children enjoyed alot off ice cream on her behalf here are some pictures from the lobby i forgot to take some from the room,1
2055,really good location very helpful staff with great tips and advice definitely hire a bike from the hotel and ride around the city rooms are a good size and beds are comfortable pillows are a little lumpy though would definitely stay again and recommend to friends,1
2056,we stay in this hotel three nights and almoust everything was small looks nice in pictures but in real life almoust everything is something else than nice walls is dirty floors is dirty our bed was old and cleaner need to do much better job to future we had problem with keycard every day and last day reception lady say reason to that looks like your keycard activite only one day we stay three nights there and every day we had some problem first you go to upstears walk long way to your room door and then you see that your keycard dose work anymore then you go back to lobby and somebody activite your keycard again and nobody from reception say next think sorry about that they just activite your keycard and you get feeling maybe it was my fold and it say three times our bad and old mattress to reception in third time they try do something first two times reception lady just wroute some post it paper and say we fix it but nobady newer fix it after third time they give free breakfast voucher thats nice but we still have same problem than first time bad and old mattress and what we do breakfeast voucher if there is only empty cups and almoust every food was finish no coffee no juice no cups no bread no ham or cheese no butter or no class and worst thing was that nobody refil these things quit difficult,0
2057,very friendly service from the staff very convenient location next to a metro station rooms are basic but clean and hotel but a little pricey more powerful ac in the rooms would be nice too,1
2058,the student hotel is a very funky quirky hotel different from the norm in a very good way rooms were very comfortable quiet for a good night sleep breakfast was very good not too expensive highly recommend this hotel,1
2059,it is a really updated hotel wich me and my friend loved we were just in amsterdam for one night and only stayed at the hotel for some hours to sleep so we didnt get to see as much as we would like to but we loved the big size of the room the fact that there was a bath tub and the room design was cool we will book our next stay in amsterdam here,1
2060,skip the breakfast was totally not worth it especially since you can easily travel out on metro to get nice amsterdam pancakes for breakfast the suite rooms were large in size and comfortable love the new looking nepresso machine too,1
2061,when you walk in the decorations and little quotes everywhere are very inviting and makes everyone feel welcome the staff are always friendly and welcome questions the free little treats the reception gives out is a treat as well no complaints except for the hair dryer and iron,1
2064,we picked this hotel for its proximity to sloterdijk station to attend a festival beware it does look much from the outside but give it a chance and on the inside it got a cool relaxed admittedly very studenty vibe the decor is much like if urban outfitters decided to make a hotel there a table at your disposal and everyone gets greeted with a glass of prosecco and a smile from very efficient staff and of course one of the great things about going to a hotel used to young adults and students is that amenities are presented to you with a smile at any hint that you might need help tickets are available to buy from the desk maps info and vouchers are laid out for you the only reasons i gave this stars was because putting the room style shower on made the entire bathroom into a swimming pool which became mildly annoying and because the options for having breakfast in the morning were pretty poor tiny muffins the odd piece of fruit or a yoghurt if you came very early the rooms themselves are purely the double beds are huge and comfortable and there everything you could possibly need presented in a clean and pleasant environment however if you are people who like a luxurious hotel experience as part of your holiday this is for you thanks chaps x,1
2065,thank you for making our stay in amsterdam extra special the room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed location is also convenient and accessible the staff were very helpful and friendly,1
2066,very friendly service good location and clean room unfortunately there was no hairdryer at our room there is a metro station nearby the hotel and de hotel also offers a bike rental service so you can get to the inner city in about ten minutes,1
2067,the hotel is located too close to the center but every place is easy to reach with public transportation we enjoyed the playing corner and the cozy lounges near the reception the staff is very friendly and ready to help you with anything you need,1
2068,great hotel great location inspiring decoration and a coffee machine with coffee and a tea machine with tea just made us feel like home and the stroopwaffle at was the cherry on top of the cake you can see that everything has love and care in loved staying there,1
2069,such a warm and welcoming hotel we stayed here for three nights and really loved it clean fresh youthful with a cool atmosphere not just for students the best ting was that it was so easy to rent bikes we did that every day and found out that it was a great way to discover the city,1
2070,it is all about good staff friendly and young i love amsterdam it was my first visit and stay in this hotel clean rooms also and good food and drinks in the pool rest this hotel is close to everything walking distance to center of the city and next to the metro station,1
2071,a very happening lobby which is fun and very quiet rooms restaurant is really yummy the amstel river is a couple blocks away and there are great places to eat in the area there is no hair dryer or hair conditioner or in the room but other than that it was just right,1
2072,the hotel is situated at the edge of the city and only metro stops from the main train station the front desk staff was always friendly and gave some great tips on where to eat and what to do they also hooked me up with a hair dryer for the duration of my stay the hotel itself is like a big college dorm with ping pong pool tables a tedex listening pod and lots of cozy hangout spots on the main floor the rooms are rather large for amsterdam this is my visit to the city and this is by far the biggest room i had and though there is it is set to go no lower than it was not so hot the week we were there so this was a big problem but sometimes you just need it a bit cooler the other issue with the room was that there were very few electric outlets there was one by the tv and one in the bathroom but none by the bed how can this be i wonder how students actually live there during the year with only outlets the bed was mediocre kind of hard and not all that comfortable but it was okay for a week the bigger issue was that the blinds at the big full wall window had a gap in them and since there was no curtain the sun would come in and blind me in bed early in the morning which was great,1
2073,fantastic stayed for nights with my husband there were a mix of ages from students to families to businessmen front desk staff were great we received waffle cookies on check in and a city map we were on the floor and had great views room was a good size and equipped with everything we needed shower room was also a good size with shower gel shampoo and hand soap provided the metro only takes about mins to and from central station and a walk from station to hotel absolutely loved our stay here and would definitely stay again,1
2074,despite the name i had no idea this was student housing seems that it mostly student housing during the year and mostly a hotel in the summer that said there were many young people which made us feel a bit out of place despite the excellent friendly and english speaking front desk rooms are spacious enough and thoroughly modern wifi is excellent although on a metro line this is mostly useful if coming from the train station or airport tram is much more useful figure minutes to get to the hub not a big deal given the frequency of the trams some basic and fast food restaurants close by we chose this hotel for financial reasons and it is great bang for the buck,1
2075,i stayed here for days in a double ensuite room the room was big good and everything was fine telly was also working fine the student hotel have good silent reading room table tennis bar and restaurant and much more drawback the bathroom do not have a cubicle but a shower curtain with no hand experience was really good i would surely recommend this hotel,1
2076,great hotel that very close to metro links the staff were very friendly and were happy to give helpful hints recommendations and suggestions would recommend this hotel to any friends who wish to visit,1
2077,a very nice hotel with very helpful and accommodating staff close to the tube only stops away from the city centre and central station good bartender who served good cocktails the breakfast was fine but not spectacular i only tried the restaurant once and the burger i had was well cooked and tasted good the best thing for me however was the always smiling and nice people in the reception who did everything they could to make you feel welcome that also extends to the staff in the bar and in the restaurant a very special hello to dirk who i shared some drinks with on more than one occasion greetings from your shoe and foodobsessed guest,1
2078,this is a very jovial place but it caters for the young at heart of all ages the interior design is playful and functional there are study rooms a nice gym and a listening center with comfortable armchairs that reinforces the youthful hotel is situated a bit outside the absolute city center but the metro stops just m away from the entrance and takes you downtown in a few was ok and breakfast really did their best to make the smooth and the stay pleasant,1
2079,i had a transportation issue that stranded me in togo africa for two days causing me to not be present to stay in the room i booked i was in africa as part of my studies assisting members of the peace corps i booked through and i did not choose the option to get a refund i acknowledge this fact i contacted the hotel to let them know the situation thinking that they might be customer service oriented and have compassion for a student budget i completely understand them charging me for two nights of three because i was going to arrive there on the third day but they gave zero leniency and basically told me that if i had booked through the hotel website that they would helped me and that i should contact which i did response was that they could refund me but the hotel could if they saw fit to do so when i finally arrived they had deleted my reservation entirely likely so that they could book out the room in my absence i had to wait almost an hour to have my reservation reinstated in the computer system the young lady that completed the reinstatement of my reservation was the only staff member that was in anyway helpful or kind i have worked in the hospitality industry including resort hotels and this experience in my opinion deserves a zero rating this pretentious frat house that calls itself a hotel is the worst i suggest,0
2080,i really liked the hotel its atmosphere and the facilities the atmosphere was professional but still young and fresh it has loads to offer a gym table tennis a cool bar and a place where you can order and enjoy some food and i received some icecream while checking in the only disadvantage is the relatively high price if i was privately going to amsterdam i probably would be able would want to pay as much per night yet i still liked my visit very much and would recommend it to everyone,1
2081,the student hotel at amsterdam city was overall just what we needed at the end of our week backpacking trip we stayed nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with people so we really appreciated the privacy cleanliness and an actual quiet and comfy bed however i do have two criticisms that i believe can be easily fixed firstly our room was never cleaned even though we put up the please clean our room sign not a big deal but just letting you know secondly when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city we accidentally biked all the way to the student hotel amsterdam west when we tried to return the bikes we were sure why our bikes did match the bikes there i checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at my boyfriend and i did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel when i was about to check my email receipt my phone died but we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel we started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when i saw that our bikes said amsterdam city and the other student hotel bikes said amsterdam west this was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place it turns out we were,1
2082,right next to the metro welcome cookie was thoughtful and delicious you also get a map of the city when you a day for bike worth it a day for breakfast cheaper to eat at a local place the rooms have energy savers so use key for lights and air spacious room beautiful decor no mini fridge free waters use room key to open doors for safety restaurant attached good for a quick drink desperados is like corona with tequila it sweet i would definitely stay here if we come back to amsterdam,1
2083,stayed here for two nights for our wedding anniversary in july we were a little apprehensive as with what to expect due to the hotel name but it was a fantastic stay there were students families and businessmen all staying here and we all blended seamlessly staff at the front desk we young enthusiastic and welcoming we even received danish cookies on arrival we were on the floor and had amazing views room was well appointed and shower room was a nice size too with good water pressure we dined in the connecting restaurant the pool on one night and it was great food and attentive staff and only for we stayed in amsterdam central quite late on our second night we would have eaten in the pool a second really would love to stay here again and would recommend it to any and all ages,1
2084,i would definitley stay here again the place was modern clean and the staff were very friendly there are many facilities in the hotel communal area such as table tennis and pool the bar area was also very nice the only thing i was a fan of was the pillows in the room but the mattresses were comfortable,1
2085,really enjoyed my stay at this hotel great staff good location and very good value would recommend this to friends and colleagues looking for a reasonably priced and interesting place to stay in amsterdam close to everything,1
2086,perfect stay for a city trip the hotel is just next to the metro traveltime to about rooms are small but nice and clean located in the hotel nice and friendly staff the only thing we missed are some facilities in the room no safe etc,1
2088,over our expectation cool and playful environment fresh and clean room and bathroom the hotel works fine even if your not a student extremely close to the metro i would definitely recommend this hotel the breakfast was good also,1
2089,we stayed in the student hotel at wibaustraat the location is very convenient with metro station literally just outside the hotel so you have access to the whole city so no worries location wise the hotel is very clean and the staff is just awesome the overall vibe is superb there is pool and ping pong table at the ground floor so played that quite a bit there is a vending machine in the lobby as well although overpriced but quite convenient late night when nothing is open in the neighbourhood the room was quite comfortable for people shower could have been better overall a superb stay and would recommend this to anyone visiting amsterdam cheers,1
2090,the hotel was really easy to find i got there very early in the morning and was allowed to check in right away the first time i went to the city center it was a very easy and beautiful walk if i wanted to save time the metro stop was right there the rooms were good did spend too much time in it but to sleep but the hotel was a great place to hang out and meet others we got a few good recommendations for our stay from staff and guests alike,1
2091,this hotel has unique decor with entertaining community areas biallards chess set with pieces that are at least a foot tall there a metro station right outside that makes getting around very easy,1
2092,this hotel is fab spent the weekend here celebrating my husbands it was worth every penny the staff were super friendly fixed a leak in our room on the sat eve whilst we were out the manager met us when we checked out to make sure we were ok to apologise the restaurant was exquisite and the cocktails were fantastic both with great service would recommend this hotel if you looking for a treat,1
2093,i stayed two nights in kimpton de witt and it was just perfect clean comfortable helpful staff conveniently located in the centre one of the best hotels i have been to it could not have been better thanks to the management and staff,1
2094,i stayed here when it was a crown plaza and had a good experience i love the new branding and renovations as a dewitt kimpton really great staff nice modern clean rooms and did i say great staff highly recommend this for business or pleasure,1
2095,this hotel is brand new and beautiful right near central station and damrak great place to be beautiful rooms and very accommodating to our dog truly recommend this hotel for anybody traveling to amsterdam,1
2096,would definitely stay at this hotel again staff could not do enough for us really friendly and helpful great bar and restaurant loved the room really clean and comfortable with free location too,1
2097,fantastic hotel staff were great and very helpful surroundings and decor lovely the room was great and comfortable absolutely loved it at this hotel highly recommended to anyone has concierge too so your bags are taken care of they are all polite,1
2098,we have just spent two nights in possibly the gloomiest and certainly the noisiest hotel room i have ever booked a king junior suite for the weekend we were then acknowledged at as platinum ihg club members and unfortunately as we were late arriving our son and his girlfriend were already waiting in the restaurant there was no time to take in any details of the room as we dropped our cases turned the ac to maximum cooling and went straight a very nice meal in wyers restaurant we returned late that night to be hit by the dreadful noise from trams and other traffic just yards from the windows the room was still warm as the single small ac outlet was totally inadequate and there was almost no light available the bathroom was tiny with no bath and only a shelf behind the toilet to balance soap bags etc our weekend schedule left us with no time to request and then move to a different room and i accept that the hotel may have done this if asked that said i can not believe that they are unaware of the problems with room visit amsterdam regularly but nothing would tempt us back to the kimpton de witt,0
2099,stayed here for days and loved every minute hotel is still brand new after a refurbishment so we were lucky to be some of the first to stay there the staff were brilliant and helped us to hire bikes which you can hire from reception and booked a couple of tours for us too you could get a more central location too right in centrum and about minutes from centraal station the room was absolutely brilliant comfortable and also had a massive tv not that we spent much time watching,1
2100,ca say enough about this place the location is brilliant the staff even better and the room was just delightful we loved the moonlit views of amsterdam from our dormer windows do miss wine hour,1
2102,such a nice place quite and the stuff are friendly recommended for the next travel you could find all what you need in this hope having time to come back again of luck for all who gon na try this experience,1
2103,wonderfully refurbished hotel in modern design featuring lounge bar restaurant and library areas that are not only accessible to use but give you the impression you are surrounded by unique pieces and furnishings in an art gallery the rooms offer a luxurious feel yes even the standard rooms and the staff are simply delightful and accommodating in every way this was our first visit and we did eat in the restaurant however we certainly look forward to doing so next visit the bar is a lovely pre and post dinner spot and all of central amsterdam is minutes away by foot highly recommend this glorious hotel,1
2104,we love every part of this hotel i love the design tooooo much we stayed at the little house room which has bedrooms so it fit us the staffs were very nice and me feel so breakfast was good everything perfect,1
2105,great location near central train station staff were very helpful getting us train tickets when we were checking out luxury hotel with nice wine social hour in early evening thanks for a wonderful stay and also for sending a complimentary bottle of champagne and gourmet cookies for our wedding anniversary,1
2107,this hotel is just stunning from the impeccable reception and staff to the beautiful sheltered hidden courtyard with suspended seats i loved it all our room was on floor with views of the city and was stylishly simple and luxurious top quality bedding and towels and quirky ornaments i loved the idea of the yoga mat and although i did use it it a really nice amenity we enjoyed the most exquisite food in the bar compliments to the staff in the hotel from reception team to bar staff are just lovely taking time to chat to us yet very efficient and nothing was too much will definitely stop at this hotel again and highly recommend it to all our friends and family when they visit amsterdam,1
2108,hotels that provide free water still and sparkling in this case coffee nespresso and internet get my high vote plus friendly service attentive and comforting plus delicious breakfast plus free paper in the morning many pluses definitely a great place to stay,1
2109,myself and teenage daughter stayed for nights i can honestly say it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in and i travel with work so have stayed in many across europe the staff were polite attentive and helpful with every concern so much so that we were truly able to relax my daughter has a life threatening allergy so the reassurances at the restaurant were food at wyers was great and the breakfast was varied and perfectly cooked there is a lovely wine reception in the evenings and an outside courtyard with relaxing swing chairs that we staff had advice for making the most of the holiday and able to supply tickets van gogh museum and gvb transport in our case and they were genuinely interested in what you have enjoyed in amsterdam for example we were advised to take care from pickpockets in the built up tourist areas we were also given an umbrella on the one rainy day given it is a hotel most guests respected this both myself and my daughter were so sad to leave this wonderful home from home we hope to return,1
2110,we stayed here for two nights the entrance of the hotel looks quite small but once you step inside you enter a large space with a very modern design the rooms are decently sized and are very modern it is very different from other hotels which makes it stand out we had a few issues with our rooms such as a missing remote and a broken light but the staff were very apologetic and gave us fruit baskets and did not charge us for a late check out you can probably tell now that the staff are very very friendly and cater to all of your needs the rooms are quite clean and are well maintained the breakfast at the cafe had a wide variety of food to offer and they all excellent i would definitely recommend someone to stay here there are many shops and restaurants all around but keep in mind the red light district is not very far from here,1
2111,i used to go to this hotel since it was crown plaza but now as kimpton de witt it became an excellent choice for my wife and myself excellent location super clean rooms and friendly staff i enjoyed my last stay and surely we will get back there,1
2112,great location beautiful design and friendly staff makes we can definitely recommend krimpton de witt for a stay in amsterdam there are two downsides the first do not take breakfast a breakfast costs euro and exists of only croissant some fruit and some yoghurt there are a lot of breakfast spots nearby second downside double rooms have very small beds it is actually something in between a single and a double bed overall we really enjoyed our stay and we would mind choosing the same hotel next time in amsterdam,1
2113,the location is good within min walk to central station space and decoration of lobby give a good first impression all the items of furniture in the room are nice and unique you will have the local amsterdam feeling not just a chain hotel the wine time is a pleasure the only problem is it only an hour per day i got some treats for my anniversary the service is great and sweet also staff gave me a good recommendation for dinner they know this city well and very helpful in giving a suggestion,1
2114,i was here for two nights with my boyfriend our flight to amsterdam was delayed with hours so you can imagine how bad our mood was i thought that out city break will continue in the same way but i was so wrong this is by far the best place i ever stayed the staff at reception are amazing friendly chatty really helpful i did not check the name of the girl who checked us in she was a really nice girl with curly hair if you read million times thank you for the warm welcome and for making me feel so special after we checked in we went into the center and after that we had surprise in the room welcome card and some snacks the second day we stayed was my birthday and i had reaaallly nice surprise in our room champagne and sweets you really made my day than the fact that the staff are amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous clean modern perfect until the last detail the rooms are cosy with new furniture and nice location is perfect for sightseeing it right in the center and it a couple of minutes away from the central railway station thank you for making my birthday holiday perfect we will be back for sure,1
2115,hubby and i stayed for two nights last week at this fabulous newly renovated hotel and we loved every single minute of had called the hotel prior to our arrival as we were due to arrive early ahead of the official time i just wanted to check that there would be somewhere for hubby to change as he had a meeting scheduled for early that same dealt with a charming young lady who informed me that if there was an appropriate room available we would be able to check in otherwise provisions would be made available for my husband to hotel is located just a few minutes walk from amsterdam centraal station and very easy to find we were warmly greeted and hubby duly changed and went off to his meeting carlos just one of the extremely helpful reception staff stored our bags so that we could retrieve them when we checked in later in the afternoon leaving me free to go room was perfectly charming with a wonderful bathroom featuring a rainfall shower and our bed was so very comfortable and this was in a standard room my husband and i have been visiting amsterdam for more than years and have stayed at a variety of hotels and boats as well as with relatives but i can honestly say that this is one of the nicest hotels in the city that we have had the good fortune to stay in every single member of staff made it his or,1
2116,this was my first stay at a kimpton hotel and it wo be the last i shared a twin room with my teenage daughter and it was a very comfortable exceptionally clean room very comfortable beds with excellent pillows nespresso coffee maker complimentary water still and sparkling and lovely warm bath front desk staff were incredibly helpful and as we had arrived after we were presented with vouchers for complimentary glasses of wine as we had missed wine hour until room service was prompt and not extortionate the breakfasts are excellent and next time we visit we will try definitely try dinner in the hotel is only a minute walk from the station and most major attractions are easily reached on foot too there are tram stops nearby if you wish to use public recommended,1
2117,everything about the hotel experience from the communication i had before leaving the states to our arrival room choice support from staff during our stay and our was flawless the managers and front line staff were all delightful and could not have been more dedicated to making our stay at the hotel and in amsterdam a great room had a lovely view of the area which helped us determine the weather each morning we used the hotel bikes to get around which was complimentary and easy to arrange there is a tram stop across the street and you can walk to central station easily it is also located in the middle of the city so you can walk to every neighborhood and attraction bring comfortable shoes overall one of the best hotel experiences we had culture and standards as well as kimpton style are well represented in this property you can not go wrong with the dewitt,1
2118,room was clean and quiet and i especially appreciated the tall shower an issue for me at or meters the staff was super friendly and helpful and the location is right in the heart of amsterdam hard to imagine how it could be any better,1
2120,i stayed at many kimptons in the states so was excited to see it made its way to amsterdam its a great location everything is in walking distance the onsite restaurant and bar are top end all the way the staff was friendly and the room quite cozy i would easily stay here again,1

2127,i often stay in amsterdam for one night during layovers between long flights it is a beautiful city and so easy to go from the airport to downtown by train to walk by the canals eat great food and take in some culture for hours it has been hard to find a hotel very near the train station that is stylish has the amenities a traveler on layover needs quiet room gym great room service proximity to lots of restaurants etc but this has it all and the style of the rooms is somehow hip but warm dutch but universal and so well thought out gym was terrific room service was prompt and food was great i can say enough good things about the hotel and staff i definitely be back,1

2129,we had an exceptional stay at the kimpton de witt the staff in every department was absolutely incredible the rooms were wonderful and the location is excellent we are huge fans of kimpton hotels and this first hotel in europe is an outstanding addition to the brand we will definitely be back,1

2132,the property is located very close to the train station very clean and modern inside but what really made our stay was the so friendly and helpful would absolutely come back because of them,1
2133,wow kimpton and here i thought i already stayed in the best kimpton hotel as an inner circle member i love the kimpton family and do like to choose favorites but has managed to break out in quite a sprint and is leading the pack in my humble opinion the place is beautiful the location perfect the food delicious and the staff amazing each room is different i had one of each of my sons and one for myself and each was beautiful and unique i was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the penthouse suite and my god was it amazing no spoilers there and experience it i took the time to read the not so stellar reviews left here and sure there may have been a few kinks as is expected with any new establishment also the merger has created some reward program issues that i sure will require time to work through but through my many many kimpton stays over the past years i have never met a mediocre kimpton employee they all behave as though they have a personal investment in the kimpton establishment i find that both impressive and refreshing dewitt is indeed keeping with the kimpton tradition and putting a bit of extra flare on top thank you so much for a wonderful stay i shall return,1
2134,this hotel goes above and beyond you can walk from amsterdam central and there is a great hour of complimentary wine and socialising every evening from to with complimentary tea and coffee and a dark quiet room with a luxury bed its superb value for money would not stay anywhere else in amsterdam,1
2135,this hotel is bang in the centre of the city only yards from the train station rooms are quite small but clean and very comfortable the staff could not have been more helpful and courteous and the cocktails in the cocktail bar were impressive all in all i have no hesitation in recommending this as a good city try to get a room at the front of the hotel so not overlooked,1
2136,great location great staff great service great rooms great beds everything was perfect during our stay at kimpton de witt hotel staff were extremely helpful with any issues friendly staff extremely clean and luxurious hotel,1
2137,the hotel is well situated if you are travelling into amsterdam arriving at central station it is literally entrance area is very smart but the checking in process and also the checking out was very slow patience is reception area lounge is actually quite a nice place to chill with free teas and other drinks rooms are also nice and clean we had the deluxe room with king size bed the bed was very comfy with a choice of pillows the room has a kettle nespresso machine and water which are all complimentary they also have very good umbrellas for the inevitable dam downpour the aircon works well although for some strange reason if you turn it off the aircon unit makes a lot of noise so you have to leave the aircon on all the were also well designed with large cosy bath towels and more than enough can tell the hotel has recently been refurbished as it all feels quite are also very pleasant and happy to do anything for you just ask,1
2138,spend a night at your hotel together with my wonderful experience front office employees superb super friendly and professional very nice room nice lounge area will come back for sure thumbs up guys,1
2139,nice hotel very central great service we come a qurter after closing breakfeast time but they try everything to full fill our wishes because i have an ihg status we get an very nice upgrade and gift,1
2140,very pleasant hotel with charm and guest treated as top priority newly renovated rooms and minute walk from the station staff goes out of way to make your stay comfortable and relaxing when we come back we will book again,1
2141,just returned from a fantastic weekend in amsterdam staying at the recently refurbished kimpton de witt lovely dutch designer touches rooms modern clean and in wyers is excellent also had brunch and evening meal over the must try the chicken bar is a bit of a hidden great place to wind down and relax after a hectic day in amsterdam,1
2142,amazing place to stay very accommodating coffee machine in the room with plenty of pods gym is super for a quick holiday sesh provides water and towels very convenient cocktail bar and restraunt in hotel,1
2143,it normally has to be perfect to get five stars from me but this is the exception as i really enjoyed my stay the down points were minor i did like queuing to check in especially as there was someone else at the desk doing nothing they were the concierge i was informed there was no bath in my room but i would not have used it and the shower was great the bathrooms were a bit small and the rooms had no view yet that is the end of my fault hotel was clean and modern the beds were really comfortable the staff were really helpful and i loved the idea of the free wine between and which brought everyone in the hotel down to the lobby and made it buzz a bit the bar staff were fabulous and although we did not use the restaurant it did look quite good it was walking distance to the riik museum and others in that location about minutes also easy access to the amsterdam museum about minutes walk if the red light district is your thing then that is not too far enjoyable stay,1
2144,kimpton is one of the best hotel i ever stayed with friendly staffs that gave good recommendation of restaurant reception the room is cool close to shopping good food van gogh and security is good i left my ipad in the hotel and they sent back to me in a week time by the way i stays in singapore will sure to stay there again if i visit amsterdam,1
2145,i stayed at the kimpton de witt for nights and had a really enjoyable stay i have stayed in in a range of hotels over the last years but this is easily the best hotel i have stayed process was a breeze and the staff were very polite and rooms are very modern and reasonably large with a great hotel has a and then another bar both are hotel is well located and only a min walk from the main train will be booking again next year,1
2146,my husband and i visited for the last night of our week trip to the netherlands it also happened to be our anniversary we were greeted kindly and check in was smooth i was impressed by the brand new remodel that the hotel just had finished it was probably one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in it was fresh and modern the room we stayed in was a little small but i did mind i absolutely loved the design and modern touches applied to the rooms after arrival we were provided a bottle of champagne with a nice note congratulating us on our how thoughtful the bed was absolutely so cozy and comfortable robes were provided and they were very comfortable one problem we had in general with staying in amsterdam was the noise we were so relived with this hotel as it was so so quiet we slept so well we almost missed our flight the next day room service was good but i have had better meals i really have no complaints our stay was perfect and i would love to come back,1
2147,great hotel very up to date the thing we liked mosted was the fact we had a kitchenette in the hotel room which was very handy as we cooked our own meals during the evening after a lovely day out would recomend this hotel to stay in to future guests staff are very polite and attentive the only bad thing i can say is we dodnt get any toilet roll during iur stay as no one vsiited our room we did ask for some and git some straight away overall really enjoyed our stay thank you to all at the element,1
2148,the staff was very nice the room corresponded to the description everything was super clean the mattress was excellent the breakfast buffet offers healthy options and even fresh lemon and ginger to add to your tea the location is very good in top of that with plenty of restaurants in the area it outside of the city center which is what i wanted but very easily accessible,1
2149,the element is very accessible by métro and tram ernststraat station it connected to a mall clothing stores shoe stores a japanese restaurant a vietnamese restaurant a food store a large grocery store etc the staff are more than helpful courteous and professional the breakfast was fine with choices of yogurt a variety of cereals hard boiled eggs bread jams croissants coffee and tea the room and bathroom are large very comfortable bed and pillows the wifi was stable and good there even a kitchenette plates cooking utensils cutleries glasses microwave and a dishwasher there a nespresso machine but i was sure why the coffee pods were not replenished automatically every day i had to ask room service for those pods also i thought that by hanging the towels up they would not be changed but they were changed anyway overall it was a very pleasant experience but i wished that whoever was in charge of room service would be more attentive,1
2150,very nice room we stayed on fourth floor hotel clean and staff very a good location with easy tram link to city centre got o amsterdam arena to see very easily on public had one very small gripe and i mean small would put me off staying again is that the breakfast options are too healthy after a night out in amsterdam some unhealthy fatty food is desirable,1
2151,the hotel does not have its own parking garage but one can park safely in parking of the shopping mall the hotel is part of more cost effective is to park for free in the evenings in the streets surrounding the hotel not sure if there are many safety issues with that the gordal restaurant downstairs is rather upmarket spanish but there are also other dining opportunities in the neighbourhood breakfast is in a separate restaurant upstairs nice details are multi system power plugs and nespresso coffee maker,1
2152,the element amsterdam is a great place to stay i stayed there for close to two weeks while on business the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly and it is in a great location right next to the mall and many other,1
2153,element makes you at home straight away with friendly staff checking you in the ambience amenities and people make the difference the location adds to its appeal which is ideal for a restful night away from the noise and pollution of the city,1
2154,not downtown but strategically located a ten minute train ride to the airport and right in the centre of the buidenvedert shopping center but just a short tram ride from downtown amsterdam fairly big rooms with kitchenette reasonable pricing friendly staff and bicycles for rent as well very quiet and safe neighborhood,1
2155,we travelled to amsterdam on the of july and stayed in element hotel for a period of nights our check in at the hotel was handled efficiently and overall the front desk staff were extremely professional and handled all my queries and requests extremely well i had an issue with the ac which was also handled very well the location of the hotel is a bit away from the city center and that not a bad thing as it is located in a calm neighborhood the rooms are quite comfortable and my year old son loved the large tvs that were in there not much of a view from the rooms as this is a business district the only area of improvement i would recommend is in the breakfast it was very and boring more fruits cheeses vegetables and a different additional flavor could help overall i would say it was an excellent decision to stay at this hotel and i would strongly recommend it,1
2156,recommend hotel for short and long trips little far from center but near airport and transportation the breakfast is not great hotel is clean quite friendly staff and great for business and family trips,1
2157,would take this hotel again without hesitation just outside town city center easily accessible with tram very clean small kitchen with utensils our comfortable home for three days staff is outstanding,1
2158,stayed here as a group of in apartments beautifully equipped rooms and very spacious lovely modern hotel friendly helpful staff restaurant very small with not a lot on offer ate out all the time,1
2159,the room is spacious clean and overall very pleasant breakfast was very good basic kitchen in the room and a wonderful supermarket in the mall next door public transportation is good once you check in your suitcase there is a walk from the closest tram to the hotel,1
2160,overall staff was wonderful and very accommodating area is a great if you want to just have some peace and quiet after hitting all the busy tourist spots the tram is just about blocks away housekeeping was good only delta would be the bed mattress is on the soft side,1
2161,breakfast can be much better vegetables are missing food for children is missingthe room is big and very nice looking the hotel is nice if you stay zuid thats the best place to stay also for families,1
2162,our stay at the element amsterdam was wonderful nicky the front desk manager was very helpful before we even arrived nicky answered all of our questions and even offered so many helpful suggestions making our trip fabulous the rest of the staff were also very liked the location of the hotel even though the hotel was about minutes away from downtown there is a tram stop very close,1
2163,very good value rooms are nice and clean staff is helpful breakfast is nice and with variety they also have a bar i definitely stay again in this hotel if we come back to amsterdam city center is min away and it is a nice walk,1
2165,our shampoo dispenser broke and was not repaired for days our toilet paper was ruined with a spilled soda and was not replaced for days we did like the way rooms were cleaned we killed a cocaroach in our room and left it there and it was not cleaned for days until we informed front desk there is no concierge,1
2166,as a no service hotel element has cracked a formulae the hotel is great rooms are big and comfortable with a built in kitchenette connected to the mall so there is a supermarket open till pm on hand but all this is perfect for the business traveller whose work is in zuid if you are liking to spend two days in amsterdam as a tourist this hotel is a bit far from all the madness while it a min tram ride from the city centre it not a super huge inconvenience but for amsterdam where everything is five mins away this does seem a bit of a shlepp since the tram station is is min walk from the hotel but besides this one small issue the hotel is great and the staff is very helpful do note the breakfast is super healthy and vegetarian,1
2167,since it very difficult to find a parking spot near the canals which are extremely beautiful the location of the hotel is good to drive to zaanse schans in the morning coz there are also limited parking lots,1
2168,this hotel has surprised me and excedeed my expectations by far from the booking moment and taxi from the airport reservation the answers were quick and professional we arrived at am kind of tired and met the night concierge a super friendly person that engaged with us inmediately with his smile and personal way this good and personal service continued in the morning with the check out and in the afternoon with the luggage pick up reception was constantly helpful and in an easy but professional way i felt like home our room was super confortable and the hotel is also really good located middle way between the airport and the city the breakfast was as it was prepared for me healthy selection of products and good croissants we will be back for sure,1
2169,great rooms with a kitchenette staff very friendly and helpful keta and fatima did a great job providing us with coffee at breakfast and were very friendly we left as friends hotel is part of a large shopping centre with a big supermarket does take visa or mastercard has a laundry,1
2170,this hotel was wonderful it is in between the airport and downtown the tram is right around the corner min walk and very easy to understand a cab ride from downtown was also not too expensive either if you were there late at night the rooms were very spacious especially if you get a corner room the breakfast in the morning was amazing the station was by far the best i have ever seen the staff was very friendly and willing to answer all questions our bartender who worked at night was amazing she was so cute also nicky at the front desk was excellent before and during our stay i highly recommend this hotel,1
2171,the property was great i would have liked to have my status as a lifetime platinum respected i got the same room as the people traveling with me none of them were even platinum i mention it to the checkin person but she said nothing,1
2172,stayed for days in this hotel i am a spg gold start with we reached the hotel at and the check in was promised for hrs left the luggage and went out to the nearby mall for lunch and came back at was told room is still not ready not ready not ready after telling the receptionist that as an spg loyalist i do expect this from the hotel she called the manager and finally we were given a suite which was an upgrade i would have expected the upgrade without asking and without delay but that the only grievance we had the manager called later on to apologise which was a nice gesture the hotel is clean and green room was great although room service did not replace the coffee capsules it is located in a quite area kms from dam square and adjacent to a mall you can buy eatables and can even cook as the room had a kitchenette the gym was functional and the equipments were of very good quality overall the hotel is good but i think the staff should be trained to be more forthcoming and also some knowledge on spg guidelines would help the hotel become preferred choice for the loyalists,1
2173,off this hotel is beautiful done from the lobby to the dining area to the room to the gym even the laundry room it very well done the staff are extremely helpful and go over the top to make sure your accommodations are met i would like to personally thank wise spellcheck bart for their assistance as well as everyone else on staff house keeping restaurant attendant who allowed me to use the tea strainer breakfast attendant who gave me a glass of apple juice when i was late to breakfast bottomline everyone makes you feel at home the room itself was very spacious and clean the location was perfect with a supermarket steps from the hotel i been to amsterdam many times this place was my best stay regards julian,1
2174,we flew into amsterdam a few days early to have some additional time prior to our cruise the travel instructions on the element site were enough to get us on the right train to the nearest station not a terrible walk to the hotel the room was easily large enough for our comfort we did have to squeeze past each other constantly and the bed was comfortable as well we really appreciated the included breakfast and the free wine in the late afternoon we had worried about location but it was a short walk to the tram station that took us straight through the key part of the tourist area to the central station short walk to a very nice park and lastly it is located at a mall with a couple of good bakeries and a couple of good chocolate shops we would definitely stay at this hotel again,1
2175,super friendly checkin really appreciated the room was available in the morning rooms are modern and very clean great idea to have the bicycles available this is a nice area to explore on bikes enjoyed the breakfast that was included will defiantly be back,1
2176,this hotel was a short tram ride to the city centre minutes the hotel was spotless friendly and helpful staff free bike hire from was included in our night stay which was self service good selection of cereals with a choice of yogurts dried fruit bread and cheese along with a selection of hotel focuses on healthy lifestyle which reflects the type of breakfast served our room came with a kitchenette which was more than adequate even had a dishwasher the hotel is attached to a small shopping mall so if you want to prepare a simple meal or a picnic it worth getting your groceries from one of the bed was enormous and so comfortable slept really well after being out and about all day,1
2177,stayed there easy bus ride from airport to front of hotel newer clean and modern hotel in a beautiful shopping mall with three grocery stores and three breakfast and happy hour drinks with wine included room was good size with good bedding and towels easy access to downtown with train or bus highly recoomended,1
2178,very nice hotel a little off the beaten path but not too far to walk to the tram that will take you to the center of things about mins the staff really stood out for us my mom was not well when we arrived early to check in the hotel was full so our room was not ready as it was only the staff made sure my mom was comfortable in their lobby which had lots of couches and private areas the woman at the desk said they would prioritize cleaning our room we requested single beds and there were only such rooms in the whole hotel they went out of their way to accommodate us and we were able to get into our room by noon full hours before their posted check in time the room was modern and bright with a full kitchen the bathroom was huge by european standards would definitely return to element amsterdam if the opportunity arises,1
2179,great hotel with great staff you can borrow a bicycle at the front desk free of charge location is a little out of the way if you vacationing but it in the middle of the business district if you here for had a minor crisis where i needed to place a phone call the front desk staff was very helpful understanding and patient and i was able to sort everything out,1
2180,this hotel had everything you need spa was great the rooms where nice with a lovely deep bath clean the food was little bit away from centre but a tram ride is all you need highly recommended i booking again for this year,1
2181,hotel was spot on very nice area and easy to get into dam square minutes on tram or all hotel staff were very helpful polite and were spotless with shower bath and a separate will return for you to all staff for all your kindness mr mrs ritchie,1
2182,had a wonderful time at westcord fashion hotel staff were so friendly and the hotel is lovely stayed only one night but wish we could have stayed longer safe parking onsite and access to the pool and gym the decor is modern and trendy plus the outdoor terrace is perfect for a hot drink and relaxation tram stop is a short walk away so easy to get to city centre,1
2183,modern hotel well located with friendly staff comfy beds and spacious rooms only two stops from the airport and tram stops to city centre makes this hotel an ideal base to explore amsterdam nicely decorated rooms with separate bathroom and toilet the room also has a kettle and a nespresso machine for tea and coffee for extra you can upgrade your room to add slippers fluffy robes fresh fruit water chocolate and a late check out of on day of departure skkybar on the floor has a great cocktail menu accompanied by barbites which are nice did eat in the restaurant except for breakfast which is well presented but at each a little expensive really enjoyed staying at the hotel and would definitely return,1
2184,we stayed for three nights as a family of four with two children the hotel was extremely accommodating they put us close together and made sure the boys had a frosted glass door on their bathroom we were able to check in early to one of the rooms helping us feel a lot hotel is quirky with great and unique design features really fun the rooms are really comfy the beds reminded me of the hypnos beds used by premier inn really comfy there was a choice of pillows and there loads of plug sockets mirrors and lighting there a nespresso machine and three free pods each day as well as english blend tea bags sweeteners milk and sugar however if we went back we might bring some of our own pods as we could see any in the local shops there also a free spacious safe which gives you good security really impressive there are two supermarkets about a ten minute walk away with a full range of goods to buy and they near the tram stop which takes you into town we bought a three day pass about euros each which gives free travel on trams buses and the metro get the number one to central or the to anne franke ate out breakfast at the de vondel tuin in vondel park minute walk is great and dinner at beer oslos was fabulous but i do a separate review on those the pool was lovely and warm for,1
2185,just finished a week long stay at the fashion hotel and i was most impressed the room was spotless on arrival and kept that way by housekeeping all week the reception staff were excellent polite and perfect spoken english very welcoming and full of information which help us on out trip the hotel facilities were also excellent the gym and swimming pool were well maintained and very clean and again kept that way by the cleaning staff access to the center of town was simple using the trams which stopped minutes walf from the hotel hop a number or which take you straight to central station mins ride make sure you get an i amsterdam card as this makes travel and visiting attractions really simple and cheap look it up the only negatives were the cost of the breakfast which was euros if booked and on the day nice but a bit steep really for what it was english buffet and the cost of drinks in the skybar whick looked great but we avoided due to the costs also avoid getting a room near an ice machine it makes a lot of noise when filling the metal ice bucket up at midnight who needs ice at midnight room could also do with fridge and not a vending machine like they have just a way of making more money im afraid despite the negatives they did not spoil our stay at the fashion hotel and i would be more than happy,1
2186,we knew when we booked that we were a tram ride away from the centre of amsterdam but the hotel was easily accessible from schiphol airport in the west of the city this suited us for our few days stay as we had a pleasant walk through the vondelpark to the museum quarter or could take the or tram only mins from the hotel which ran frequently a charming quirky hotel mannequins greet you in the foyer and breakfast which was included was good and varied very happy with our choice of hotel and a truly memorable stay,1
2187,we are here as part of a trafalgar european tour so the hotel was booked as part of the booking a lovely surprise this hotel is and this is day one of our highly recommend anyone to consider this when going to amsterdam,1
2188,the position of the hotel is really good and well served rooms are nice and clean and the personnel is kind wellness center is ok gym a bit old they have parking lot inside and a nice breakfast area,1
2189,myself and friends had rooms all spacious comfortable beds and the front desk were great in sorting things out for us we used the pool a lot which was great in the mornings to freshen up we did use the sky bar but it open late and has dj on apparently you can rent bikes cheaply from the hotel but be sure to book in advance as when we tried they had all been booked already,1
2190,great night break with friends in their extra large triple room fab stylish room super comfy beds and plenty of space relaxing chairs great having a separate toilet and wonderful deep bath to soak in we over looked the courtyard so lovely and quiet had fun operating the coffee machine they kindly sent us someone to show us but apart from that could a thing,1
2191,the westcord fashion hotel was lovely the staff were very helpful and approachable the room was really comfortable and well appointed the only downside of the hotel was the music from the floor i was travelling with my year old daughter and we were put on the floor we arrived quite late on the saturday night and the music was very loud from the sky bar above i did consider asking to move but as we were so tired we decided to stay the music was much quieter on the sunday and monday evening the only big downside was the shuttle bus transfer from and to the airport the outward journey did turn up at all and we had to pay extra for a private taxi the driver who picked us up for the return journey was very rude and reluctant to take us even though we had confirmation information with us,1
2192,i was a little worried about the location but once we got there the staff made me feel at ease we were able to buy a pass for the tram at the hotel front desk there is a grocery store with fresh produce a few blocks away plus a beautiful park even closer the rooms are very nice as is the pool and bar,1
2193,we loved this hotel it got a boutique feel and the location is very convenient for everything you wo get this type of hotel with decent sized doubles and good star facilities at this price in the centre we like being away from all the crazy light area action but it easy to get to if you want it recommend the happy bull restaurant for gourmet burgers etc which is just a minute stroll from the hotel we enjoyed hiring bikes at the hotel and cycling around and through the vondelpark to the museum district overall a very good location for a relaxing break for couples would definitively return,1
2194,majority of staff excellent older manager was very moody and unhelpful miles from central station easy access via trams excellent facilities and views would recommend to any couples or people who do mind walking a little longer to city,1
2195,stayed here for nights rooms clean nice coffee machine big tv and big bed hotel is more like mins from the centre which put me off so for that reason i would stay again did rate the sky bar either cocktails was very nice front desk staff were helpful,1
2196,spent nights at the hotel and my stay was excellent the room was clean and had everything you need free coffee tea toiletries and wifi member of staff was friendly and hotel is not in the centre but about tram ride out but there is a tram stop about minutes away which has frequent trams into the centre there is also a train station about minutes walk which has trains to the pool and changing area was also very clean and pool was eat at the hotel so ca comment on the food,1
2197,very nice hotel a bit outside of town centerthe check in was easy and quick the staff was very room had a good size and it was is easy as you can park at the hotel for eur pr regards to breakfast we only had breakfast at the hotel one morning out of the we were staying there the breakfast is very good and there is plenty of other two mornings we walked to nearby places to have our is about minute walk from the tram or metro station all in all we had a very nice stay,1
2199,this is my seventh or eight time staying at this hotel i love the proximity to the airport the city and the park the staff is wonderful and the breakfast buffet is top notch the room is very clean and the bed is huge short walk to the tram number and i suggest the for a shorter ride to dam square and central fitness facility is good enough for a short visit elliptical treadmill and free weights the pool is sufficient for a short was the only stay that was someone difficult and it was not the hotel fault the highway is shut down for weeks which means you will have to use side roads to get to the other highways during the week depending on where you are going it can add minutes or more to you commute if you are taking the tram into the city no will be back at this location again next year for my annual visit,1
2200,stayed for the second time within the year wonderful rooms and great swimming pool easy transport links to central areas away on tram lines or and airport one stop away on the train would recommend a stay here and i be back again soon,1
2201,just back from our first visit to amsterdam and the westord fashion hotel short taxi ride from airport and close to a tram stop for easy access to city a nice room on floor at the rear so very quiet large comfy bed with nice bathroom with large separate shower and hand basin and was separate from bathroom which we maker in breakfast with lots of variety tea and coffee used the restaurant which was nice and nice bar area alas never got round to using the sky friendly and helpful staff and would use this hotel again and would takes about mins from hotel to central station depending on time of day and traffic easy and cheap to use all in all a nice city break in a really nice hotel just wished we had stayed longer,1
2202,stayed here for nights for a hen dothe hotel was lovely the room was spacious and clean and had a great bathroom with separate toilet which was great as we were in a twin roomlittle toiletries were provided and bath towels there was also a coffee machine and facilities to make teathe sky bar was great with a good selection of drinks and snacks the hotel was just a few mins from the tram stop that took you straight into the centre the hotel sold and day passes for the tram at a really reasonable price would definitely recommend here for people to stay,1
2203,what really impressed me about this hotel was the wonderful staff from the moment walking in the door they were friendly attentive and helpful as we were on our first anniversary which they noted and we later we found chocolates flowers and a lovely happy anniversary card in our room they even found us a list of restaurants and then made us a reservation in a local steak house for our anniversary dinner look out for that review the staff do this hotel proud the hotel it self was up to standard the decor was a bit weird but that made no difference the rooms was lovely with a great shower and bath our safe broke leaving our passports and money trapped inside but the staff were straight on it and it was fixed with a new one installed within hours most areas of the hotel are accessed by your room and this includes the lifts so do do as my beloved did and forget yours or you may just get stuck in the lift as he did lol the location of the hotel is close to the main square but it is quite easy to get to with a short tram ride but do make sure that you get a travel pass for a few days the airport is super easy to get to literally a few stops on the train and then like two stops on the tram the whole journey took no more than about we had,1
2204,first of all the stay is breath taking you want to relax this is the best place to and stephane are running this restaurant at their best we came here on a few occasions me and my misses were really impressed with the service and the whole experience within the restaurant and bar all small issues were sorted in a professional and nice you for all of the staff members who made our stay memorable regards deividas ruta,1
2205,we had a really easy check in despite the website saying our room was ready as soon as we arrived at friendly staff member gave us maps and explained the tram system and sights to us other staff members answered our questions throughout the duration of the stay the room was nice with a large bed and clean bathroom only complaint was quite noisy and you could hear noise from the corridors clearly the only improvement i give would be to provide fridges so that guests can store there own food and drink the hotel was in a great location we bought the day pass for both tram and train the train from the airport was around minutes we then walked from the station to the hotel which was a minute walk on our way back we got the tram to the station which was less than minutes the nearest tram stop was a minute walk trams were frequent maximum wait time for us was minutes there was a few restaurants and supermarkets within minute walks all in all a great hotel if i return to amsterdam i would book here again,1
2206,excellent hotel and would thoroughly recommend clean spacious room with lovely bathroom and separate and drink very good although we ate out more in the city very few restaurants close to the sky bar which we used every evening on our spa area and swimming pool,1
2208,i booked the westcord fashion for my partner birthday and we were disappointed when we first pulled up to the hotel i was a little concerned about the location being right by a main road and seemingly in the middle of no where but it was absolutely hotel is tasteful and spotlessly clean the staff all friendly and helpful but not intrusive at all the terrace area is absolutely lovely as is the skyy bar at the top of the hotel i have seen some reviews saying that it a half an hour walk to anything but this is the case at all the tram stop is about a walk away and as soon as you get to that there cafes and restaurants around you tram into the centre take depending on where you want to go which was absolutely fine for us because it a nice way to see the city vondelpark is also an easy walk are only three relatively minor bad things we could think of firstly the bathroom door for the shower room is glass this was a problem for us at all since we a couple however i can imagine if you are travelling with friends or family it might be a little awkward the cleaning staff also come into your room before you have answered which also could prove a little awkward the final thing was that we found a dirty pair of socks in our room on the second day which we are,1
2209,the west cord fashion hotel is fantastic the rooms are modern and very spacious the bed is very big and comfortable bathroom has a shower and a bath the staff are lovely and accomodating the pool area is really nice the location is not too bad it a little out of the way of the main tourist part but it in a nice area with coffee shops and parks near by they main part of amsterdam is easily reached by tram or bike we walked and it was probably abit too long my only complaint is that they did have enough bikes we tried three days in a row to hire bikes and they were sold out each time on our last day i called at am and reception said they had bikes by the time i got down at am they were all gone,1
2210,this hotel is modern ultra clean trendy and has ten chanderliers in the lobby what more could you ask for oh and not to mention the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in i absolutely recommend this hotel for stay in amsterdam i booked four rooms for a hen party and the location is fab it is about a minute walk to the station and for you can get a hour pass which you can use for trams metro and buses grab tram to city centre or metro no changes just jump on the hotel has a lovely breakfast too which i recommend is well worth doing although there is a supermarket round the back of hotel italian restaurant called happy italy is right next door for a nice meal too the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and everything was so clean and new my friends also loved the hotel especially the drinks menu in the bar which was so good for the money cocktails for yes please the hotel was not in any way rowdy either just a lovely big hotel with all you need i do want to fault anything as there is no need but just to let people know there is not a kettle or tea in the room the most amazing bed ever makes up for this and the bar in the lobby sells gorgeous coffee for so you will be fine if you are considering booking this hotel click enter and,1
2211,no wonder this hotel seems to be constantly sold out it may have the best ratio in amsterdam the hotel is located in amsterdam zuid next to the rai train and underground station a tram stop line no and a bus stop the ride to the centre takes minutes and trains go frequently rai station is only two stops from schiphol airport our comfort room was sufficiently spacious with two large windows very comfy bed and the usual motel one bathroom now featuring cosmetic tissues magnifying mirrors will be introduced until end of as always with motel one there were no closets just a few hangers and shelves but that was ok for our stay the room was very clean so far but the windows and the upper part of the leather headboard were a very annoying thing the elevators have just a call button on upper floors which means you ca indicate if you want to go up or down wthich leads to many unnecessary stops of the already crowded was of high quality with many local dutch items as usual with motel one it was served in the bar lounge area meaning sitting pretty cramped sometimes at low lounge table sometimes on bar said we nevertheless enjoyed the stay very much and will happily return as we ca think of a better affordable alternative,1
2213,this hotel is fantastic as it is situated a few metres from the main train station and you can catch the number tram straight i to the city centre modern clean and swanky rooms the bar and facilities are superb will be back again,1
2214,for what i thought was a budget hotel this was a very nice surprise i dropped my bag off earlier in the day and i was immediately impressed i was expecting an ibis type lobby but this was very plush arriving back to the hotel at having been dragged to club smokey live music and open until by some clients i was greeted by the lovely birte and bart on reception i sure they were only delighted to chat to me for i was in jovial form and when i finally got to my room i was again very surprised it was a very spacious room with a very comfortable bed although considering it was i sure i would have found the ground comfortable and the was exceptional laid out with absolutle no feel that this was a budget hotel it also made the short walk to the rai very easy the next morning considering i may have had a headache i would highly recommend and i will definitely be back from my next trip to the rai,1
2215,lovely hotel we stayed for a stag weekend the rooms are great with floor to ceiling windows the decor in the public areas is really cool staff were all friendly and the bar is really well stocked with really knowledgeable bartenders especially hollywood public transport is really easy and there is a supermarket right next door breakfast was nice fresh fruit and pastries best of all was the value the lads on the stag could believe i found them somewhere so nice to be hungover for the happily stay here again if i return to the dam which i will,1
2216,motel one is far from the city centre and top attractions the central station is very far top attractions and canals will take you around minutes by the public transportation staff were rude no bath available just shower no iron or british electricity adaptors were given rooms were too small keep your passport and money in safe place as no deposit safe was there it is simply a motel not hotel i misunderstood the motel facilities due to reviewers comments and i made a wrong decision if i will be going to amsterdam again i will go for another option,0
2217,lovely room lovely decorated hotel even though it is not right in the city centre the public transport is really good there is a tram stop and train station across the road and you can even get a night back late at night the price of this hotel is so good in comparison to other hotels in amsterdam i have booked back here for september this year as it is a weekend i was having a really hard time trying to find something reasonably priced and when i found out this hotel could fit me in i was so pleased it defiantly worth paying less and doing the minute tram ride into the city and staying somewhere that very clean and comfortable for the price also the staff are very helpful and helped with all the tram numbers we needed to get highly recommend,1
2218,this is a very stylish motel in amsterdam south the room was spacious and clean the staff friendly and breakfast good it does not have english breakfast but for us it did matter there was plenty of other options just meter to metro tram and train and minutes by train to the airport minutes by metro to the city but note if you want to stay in a cozy or lively street this is not it it is outside the main part of the city by a main road and only one restaurant in the area we felt it was good value for the money and would stay here again,1
2219,before i arrived i was not sure what to expect when arrived it took a moment at the lobby to be served but then service was friendly the rooms are simple andsd small but clean also there are plenty plugs and also at th righ place wheter you prefr to sit at teh table or on the bed to work on your labtop this is something you often miss in much more fancy was also good and much better than i was expecting similar to star environment is comfortable and value for money is very good and for business trips this is a good place to stay in particolar when you are planning to vitis the convention are also plenty and good ones close a place that i would choose again for short trips,1
2220,two train stops from schipol and a short walk min to the room was not huge and only had one chair but was clean and the bed was comfy great shower as well there were limited spots to put your clothes as there are no dressers only shelves and only clothes hangers i imagine if you were staying for a longer time this might become an issue there is no phone or clock in the room the clock was no biggie but no phone seemed odd to reception staff was more than helpful giving us maps and tips on where to used the tram about mins to get into amsterdam and bought a day pass that was good on the tram bus and are restaurants nearby about a minute walk and a grocery store next would stay here again,1
2221,what a lovely gem close to the rai helpful staff clean with some eclectic touches like the fake fireplace nice breakfast if somewhat steep at but it was good and tasty lovely comfy sofas and chairs in the lobby the room was compact but well appointed lovely bathroom with shower lovely shower but could be more powerful great view from my window overlooking the road and highway but no sound intrusion from the full height full width window would definitely come back,1
2222,this is the best accommodation we have ever experienced in our years of travel location friendliness and knowledge comfort facilities i ca speak more highly of this place we had room and a view overlooking the canal our room was stylish and very modern quite large and spacious and the bathroom newly renovated with ritual bath amenities the staff are so helpful and friendly and we are a tram or min walk to main street ann frank house is a tram or walk close to everything i highly recommend staying here over any star hotel,1
2223,our extended family recently stayed for nights in rooms at the house everything about our experience was fantastic the rooms were spacious with great canal views and coffee soft drinks and snacks included the location was ideal within walking distance of vondel park the museum district and the leidesplein neighborhood the front desk staff garvey and joanna were exceedingly friendly and helpful with directions reservations bike rental and helped direct an ill family member to nearby medical assistance the breakfast was superb consisting of eggs cooked to order freshly made mini dutch pancakes poffertjes and great coffee we wholeheartedly recommend no house and would stay here again without hesitation,1
2224,the staff was friendly and very helpful our room was clean elegantly decorated and we loved having a big window overlooking the street and canal getting free bikes the first day was lots of fun we definitely come back,1
2225,i could rate this hotel enough i booked our visit as a little romantic trip for me and my husband and i used a party online booking site to book our room contact was very courteous and helpful as on initial booking the site informed me that i would be getting a ground floor room i contacted the hotel to request an room on an upper level with a balcony to get a bit of a view and i had asked for a couple of extra little romantic decorations in the room and champagne to make arrival that little bit sweeter and they certainly from schiphol airport to centraal station was really easy on the train this took about half hour and we decided to walk to the hotel to get a bearing on the areas as we only had handluggage this took half an hour but there are buses and trams which will get you there faster centraal is busy and a little hectic but as we got nearer to the hotel it quietened down alot the hotel is situated in the area right on the outer canal ring and our room overlooked the street and waters edge through a little french balcony location wise it was great though we were on a semi busy road the area was tranquil and calm and very pretty garvey checked us in and one other staff member out both were really friendly and helpful he hinted that we had got an upper,1
2226,super hotel super stay location was very central mins to the beautiful vondelpark and easy walking distance from most of the main room with balcony great breakfast and very large comfy were friendly and bicycle hire for one day was a great touch and enabled us to explore the city like then paid to keep the bikes for the rest of our we return to amsterdam we definitely stay here is a small boutique hotel so it does have a lobby or a bar area this was a problem for us as there are loads of bars and restaurants close by but it could be an issue for some,1
2227,the is a great comfortable and well located hotel we first stayed one year ago and came back again the location works well for trains to the airport and most good restaurants are within walking or convenient tram connections when we stayed in we had a minor problem at and management resolved it immediately and gave us upgrades on our return visit thanks great hotel staff and service breakfast is plentiful and well prepared loved it and we will be back in,1
2228,great location trendy hotel spacious clean rooms they have got it had a room on the second floor facing the train station and the room was surprisingly dark and quiet during the breakfast nice bar friendly staff i been searching for a remark but no nothing this is how it done it was a great weekend,1
2229,we stayed at the artotel july to from reception to to housekeeping to conceige to the doorman the team is helpful friendly efficient they are charlotte kitti cameron niam domenico thomas brian compliments to the chef and team for the delicious breakfast and dinner we had at please convey our gratitude to the team for making our stay a very pleasant and comfortable one yensingapore,1
2230,most comfortable by any means very nice staff young dynamic atmosphere very modern design with great attention to details high level of accessories and facilities the location of walking distance from the central train station even with suitcase and walking distance from the dam square and its surrounding is great,1
2231,if you value your privacy make sure you ask for a room with a bathroom door we asked for a quiet room when we checked in we were given an inside room which i m sure would have been quiet but much to our surprise it had no door on the bathroom it never occurred to me to ask for room that had a bathroom door i can t believe that anyone actually would want such a room staff was very nice and they agreed to move us to a room with a bathroom door but that room overlooked the street which was very noisy we were embarrassed to ask for another change in rooms i m sure the hotel is very nice and staff is certainly very nice but our experience with the bathroom door and noisy room clouded our whole experience,1
2232,fantastic hotel good environmental fantastic team very good facilities perfect location in the city the breakfast is fantastic and the quality of service is perfect fitness and spa area are very good as well i would be back for sure,1
2233,everything you need perfect location centre of city and near railway station friendly welcoming helpful staff rooms perfect temperature all comforts kitchette with proper coffee maker and refrigerator the bathroom is stocked with hairdryer and most toiletries there was also a large bottle of water with glasses provided upon arrival in room and every night when the housekeepers turned down the beds they left little gifts of toiletries on bed,1
2234,stayed for two nights amazing hotel perfect location in the city centre and the staff were very welcoming friendly and helpful rooms were well equipped and the free wifi worked really well breakfast was delicious with a variety of foods prepared to order as well as a small buffet the gym was adequate and the pool was cold but nice only slight downside was the shower flooded the whole bathroom so you got wet feet every time you used the toilet,1
2235,this hotel is hip and trendy definitely a quirky hotel for someone who enjoys having an experience that is a different from a regular corporate hotel from the moment you enter the hotel you feel taken care of our process went smoothly and since it was our wedding anniversary and we booked through expedia with privileges they upgraded our room and sent up two glasses of champagne the location is excellent if you looking to hop on the train across the street you can also catch a direct train to the the airport just be careful to purchase the correct ticket look for the yellow machines and be careful not click on bus ticket the night manager ivar croes was especially helpful one evening after exploring this beautiful city he welcomed us back to the hotel and was kind enough to give us a personal tour of the hotel including the art exhibit he took providing excellent customer service to another level needless to say we will be back soon,1
2236,great hotel great location great staff awesome vibe and the art is incredible all over the rooms are so comfy and unique and have all the touches you expect at a top quality hotel love the touches at the turn down service we had a great view and no noise love that the glass between the bedroom and bathroom that can frost for privacy when you want it every finish and detail is unique the breakfast in the mornings was delicious and elegant the location of the hotel to central station and all the tram stops makes it absolutely perfect there is a wonderful espresso machine in the room that i took full advantage of we ca wait to come back to one of our favorite cities and stay here again,1
2237,our stay at amsterdam was very was reasonable rooms very spacious and the service excellent and the location of the hotel is ideal will surly consider staying there again for our next trip,1
2238,stayed here for nights before embarking on a river cruise and can highly recommend the hotel check in was smooth room was great free crisps and nuts but beware the fridge and do move any of the bottles or you will be charged they did leave a tiny space for your own goodies though thought the peekaboo lights in the bathroom were cute but would probably have appreciated them more odd years ago right now we would have preferred a night light if there was one in our room it was working we had a quiet room with a small window and a view over the sperm art installation this was perfect we had jet lag we slept breakfast was superb lots of choice and serves not too big though you could still eat as much as you wanted of course no issues with any of the staff they all performed as you would expect my only complaint very expensive,1
2239,this is swanky modern trendy and has the best staff in amsterdam really enjoyed a night stay here and we were very well looked after the reception staff were brilliant and set the tone of the whole hotel friendly efficient and fun try the restaurant as well which is very good outstanding staff well done miguel,1
2240,stay here on a recent trip to amsterdam to catch a gig at the amsterdam arena hotel is right across the road from central station and close to any of the main attractions around staff are friendly from the reception bar and restaurant who all made sure we had a great stay decor through out the hotel is modern and comfortable with lots of expensive furnishings and gallery work rooms are comfortable with all mod cons nice little touches such as pillow spray and wake up balm we had breakfast included in our rate and both mornings we had an enjoyable breakfast which seemed to be pretty relaxed compared to a lot of hotels in the morning when it comes to the buffett fitness area gym is good the spa looks a bit of a mess and afterthought certainly not anywhere near the standard of other star hotels i have stayed at staff lying around reading books with top off relaxing with dirty laundry piled up in the corner it can get noisy at night with dj playing in the bars when you are trying to sleep i did mind this but it something to bare in mind if you are wanting a quieter hotel i really enjoyed my stay here thanks,1
2241,i ca find words to describe the the decor is sooo modern and funky the staff are amazing the location is right in the middle of town facing the central station and without the noise their breakfast spread is very good and it has shops and bars all around the sex museum and red light district are just a short walk away there is a very long street with lots of shops just behind the hotel i definitely recommend the hotel,1
2242,we stayed at the for four nights and it was one of the best hotel it is right across from central station and the main tram interchange minutes walk hotel is in an old bank building and the contrast between the classic facade of the building and the modern interior makes for an amazing effect there is something special about this hotel with the interior filled with wonderful pieces of modern art and sculpture a word of warning the rooms are purposely dark so the lighting is a key part of each room in itself having an expression we loved it the room was very comfortable and there was ample robe space for the two of us bathroom was also charming with the use of mirrors and light to create a feeling of staff were unbelievably helpful and attentive we received a complementary bottle of wine on two occasions when we dined in the hotel restaurant this was a first for us the food in restaurant at both breakfast and dinner was very tasty indeed the dinner menu is a mix of small medium and large plates to be shared we had the zucchini fries and duck as a medium entree and shared the sirloin on one night and the lamb on the second night both were was one of the best hotels we have stayed in and have no hesitation to recommend it highly for design location value and service,1
2244,this hotel is in a strategic location just across the main train station the brilliant harmony between the interior redecoration and the theme of art sculptures is mind blowing this is evident even in the finest detail such as the carpet design the theme has to do with the evolution of life with its daunting lessons we all come to realize being able to achieve such a powerful design impact on the inside while preserving the exterior shell of the historic building is a fantastic work of art this is on top of the friendly hospitality fine dining and comfortable lavish rooms,1
2245,located directly across from central station we expected noise and chaos while hectic our room was relatively quiet comfortable well designed with a nice bed the staff proved to be super helpful and patient they were excellent the breakfast was excellent expresso drinks cooked to order eggs fresh squeezed juices sumptuous baked goods hearty cured meats i would value it at will return,1
2246,left here earlier today after days in amsterdam the staff are some of the best we have ever come across from the guys on reception to the morning waiters and the evening bar staff every single one of them deserves credit for their efforts in making me and my wife feel welcome we will be back next summer and will only come to this hotel the location is perfect aswell bang opposite the main station tip is we did need the cleaners coming times a day to sort our room tho this is much appreciatedawesome work,1
2247,perfect location very slick breakfast is wonderful and spa is a brilliant bonus pool is open interiors all inspired by and polished great for only super small gripe is that there a chance of feeling a bit clinical,1
2249,the hotel is virtually right across from the main station which is a plus we found the hotel a walk for most things we wanted to do but not a overly taxing distance the staff was helpful pleasant knowledgeable and had very good recommendations on restaurants in the area not a terrific value but not certainly not bad very clean and meticulously kept hotel certainly not a bad decision to stay seems many rooms lack much of a view,1
2250,we spent three nights in amsterdam at this hotel it was wonderful they gave us some extra courtesies for being on a honeymoon the breakfast was wonderful and the staff was very helpful it was very clean and,1
2251,great team very professional but at least this weekend with fun personalities and a quirky sense of humour location is perfect very central convenient for trams and buses but quiet charming and an easy to walk to key sights restaurants and bars rooms are nice modern and not bad size beds are comfy the only negative was the wash basin outside the bathroom breakfast was fairly common for european hotels and not bad value after discounts the honour bar and vibe in the small but cosy reception area is a nice plus,1
2253,front desk a guy and a gal super hosts size of room incredible you could order strawberries or cordon blue chicken at no problem truly a nice experience breakfast was more than we expected very nice can not add or subtract from this fine property i dare you to try it,1
2254,the critical feedback follows the carpet in our room was dirty it took them a few days to clean it and even then it was quite stained management should either deep clean it or replace it before they rent out this room again i meant to talk to the manager about the rug but by the time i got around to it he was out and would be back till after we left he struck me as someone who would have been very responsive to our complaint the beds though comfortable did even approximate a double as in most hotels in europe it was singles pushed together but what was unusual was there was no pad over both to in any way connect them and they were separately made up with individual single sheets and tucked in etc the hotel staff and policy did seem concerned about recycling or the environment i had to ask if they recycled paper etc and bring it down separetly and i ended up hiding towels we had used just a few times so that the housekeepers would take them to be laundered and bring fresh ones i suggest that there be a sign in the room about recycling and a place for recycling and a note that if you want fresh towels to put any you want replaced on the bathroom floor as there is in most hotels conscious about the spite of these issues which need improvement there was plenty to like about,1
2255,we have been around and this is the most distinctive and charming hotel till date it has so much character but that never overwhelms reception staff is super friendly breakfast setting is so cosy and homely rooms are tiny not annoyingly tiny but romantic and cute tiny bus stop is right downstairs royal palace is a minute delightful stroll fun size bathroom is the only bother but you knew that so if you are healthy enough for some stairs and got heart for some romance then must stay here,1
2256,i can not remember how many times i had stayed at the nadia hotel but the welcome remains very warm indeed the staffs are as friendly as it was when i first stayed here many years back i was always greeted with a welcome home message from staffs and the hotel manager himself when i first arrived in the room was a vase of flowers with a welcome card on it and a basket of fruits the hotel is ideally located near the city centre tram station and a supermarket nearby,1
2257,we spent nights at this everything was absolutely perfect location helpfulness of staff communication when booking was always prompt breakfast selection was absolutely wonderful clean room but and this is beyond the hotel control on each of the nights of our stay weekend and weekday there was street noise that reached our canal facing room that ended between midnight and am i not talking about typical car noise i mean loud booming consistent music and yelling as if it were in the next room if i were to stay at this hotel insist on a room that faces the backside of the hotel if this can not be guaranteed book somewhere else it could possibly be noisier during the summer months,1
2258,hotel sebastian is a very clean comfortable hotel in the heart of the canal district we were able to walk to all our destinations very easily from the hotel and even just wandering up and down the canal streets was a delightful way to spend time the staff in both reception and the were friendly and extremely helpful we felt very valued and comfortable the bed was comfortable bathroom very beautiful and modern and the room size though we got a small room was spacious by european standards we had a canal view and our companions did not their room was much quieter at night when they slept with the window canal view also means view we did mind the sounds of the people walking and if you are senstitive to noise do choose a canal view room or do choose one but do plan to sleep with the window open they have if you prefer,1
2259,my daughter and i spent nights at the ambassade hotel the service was unsurpassed everyone was friendly polite and helpful with questions about the city there is a lovely library off the lobby where one can have coffee tea or a cocktail any time of day we had tea every afternoon after a long day of sightseeing the breakfast buffet was great plan on having that at least once our room was small but overlooked the canal luxurious bedding and modern updated bathroom would go back in a heartbeat,1
2260,beautiful hotel in a great area in the centre of amsterdam ideal location and very quiet lovely room and very clean staff extremely helpful and polite only downside was that we asked for twin beds for myself and my daughter which we got but the beds were very small only each when you are used to a or foot bed being classed as a twin does give you much room air conditioning was great and very quiet,1
2261,it no wonder that the ambassade is a favorite of visitors to amsterdam the service is outstanding and the accommodations are superb i stayed in a suite at the ambassade perhaps ten years ago and although nice i was reluctant to stay in the summer because at that time the hotel did have air conditioning the hotel has within recent years undergone a massive renovation including ac and is a pure delight to stay at the entire lower level is now a bar reading rooms and the lobby the breakfast buffet is excellent and eggs can be ordered the cook at breakfast does need to learn how to make an omelette mine was as flat as a pancake niels and femke at check in were a delight to interface with and my friend and i were upgraded to a spacious apartment the ambassade is borderline luxury but what makes this hotel is the staff all are eager to please and without pretense i typically stay at ultra luxury hotels but i wanted my friend to have a casual but highly comfortable stay in a pure dutch hotel prior to checking in we had stayed the two previous nights at amsterdam most luxurious hotel highly recommend the ambassade i be back,1
2262,we are on our day of a day visit to the ambassade i cant recommend the hotel highly enough the staff at all levels are highly efficient and extremely friendly nothing was ever a problem we had a really quiet room at the back of the hotel which helped our sleeping after a hour flight from australia breakfast was included and at a high standard and staff were very courteous and attentive it is also located close to all attractions highly recommend,1
2263,what a wonderful find due to our flight time we arrived fairly early in the morning and were offered a complementary delicious breakfast in light of our room not yet being available the staff were absolutely charming and could not have been more helpful or attentive on our return in the afternoon we were delighted with our room which had romantic decor and a huge bath in a lovely sparkling clean bathroom with and hers sinks our room looked out on a floral i understand that the rooms with a view of the canal can be a bit more noisy but ours was perfect with a very comfortable bed the hotel has a breakfast room so no proper restaurant but we were given a recommendation list of places nearby the french restaurant we visited was ideal and the food delicious we also followed the hotel recommendation for our canal cruise and were treated to an excellent and fascinating trip thank you to all of the staff for making us feel so well looked after we will definitely be back,1
2264,great location we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and there were many excellent restaurants in the area the hotel itself is a gem especially if you like purple the room was quite large for europe and very nicely decorated the bathroom was huge modern the breakfast was great with lots of hot cold choices the bar has a nice selection of wine beer etc and the bartender owner sister was friendly and fun to talk to and the front desk staff were quite helpful i would definitely stay here again,1
2265,sebastian is a small boutique hotel on a lovely canal the style of the decor is quirky lots of purple black orange and gold and the standard canal room is quite small that was ok for me as i was traveling solo perhaps one or two of the barrel chairs set by the windows could be removed i think what sets this hotel apart is the service all acted with the utmost courtesy and friendliness i got to know many of them by name including the sister of the owner who tended bar the front desk really came to my rescue on the last night of my stay i left my credit card at a restaurant and was slated for a cruise the next morning the hotel checked and made sure my card was safe and their communication with me was timely and friendly the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff was efficient and amiable there was a lingering scent of tobacco in my room when i checked in the management apologized sincerely someone in an adjoining room had been apparently with the management honestly i like a cigarette now and then but i would never smoke in a hotel room nor would i ask for an exception this is amsterdam however lots of smokers if sebastian completely banned smoking in rooms i would have given the hotel stars,1
2266,hotel sebastians is conveniently located near shopping restaurants and the train station it is a short walk to ann frank s house and many other popular sights in amsterdam our room for was spacious and had all the amenities one needs when traveling abroad the staff was one of the most helpful and conscientious that i have ever encountered i would definitely stay here again,1
2267,you would never know from the outside what awaits you inside gorgeous amenities and spotless spaces and rooms beautiful attention to detail the gardens and the restaurants and bars all add the final touches get away from all the hustle and bustle in this incredible hotel,1
2268,the room was amazing the concierge was phenomenal the restaurants fantastic the location unimaginable walking distance to the anne frank museum the canal cruise is informative and entertaining with arnold the canal homes are beautiful and the showers are great they arrange great individual tours as well mike was great for the windmills and fishing village,1
2269,this hotel is the only place i ever stay in amsterdam the location is just outside the touristy area with walking access to all the local restaurants and neighborhoods the hotel itself is a collection of townhouses over two city blocks that are connected by gardens and walkways in the center great bar and restaurant if you feel like staying in we had two rooms to accommodate our family and stayed almost ten days so we really had a feel for the place felt like home while still being treated like a vip concierge was wonderful highly highly recommend,1
2270,we stayed at this lovely hotel for nights in july the location is perfect in that it is within the picturesque streets area there are lots of cafes and restaurants small independents rather than chains and it is great to watch the boats on the canals the hotel has a lovely garden terrace where you can enjoy food and drink or just chill the pulitzer bar and restaurant janz are both top class and i would highly recommend them canal houses have been converted into a hotel so rooms are unusual and stairs can be steep although there are lifts the concierges are extremely helpful and taking their advice can really make your stay hotel has a daily boat tour in a special vintage boat that is well worth the charge,1
2271,the pulitzer has a lot going for it prime location on the banks of the canal amazing service by the staff great restaurant and a very enjoyable breakfast and a tradition of excellence you do have to make sure you pick your rooms because some are small and a little far to reach other than that this is first class hotel,1
2272,we had a great experience with the amsterdam all of the people working at the hotel made our night stay a rousing success food at goldfinch brasserie was wonderful afternoon tea was beyond our imagination with many summer foods being showcased in an unusual twist rooms were bright clean and location is convenient to everything in central amsterdam,1
2273,i ca imagine staying anywhere else in amsterdam the hotel is lovely the location is excellent the room was large and beautiful every amenity is available and the service was absolutely outstanding we loved everything about it,1
2274,staying in this hotel was most satisfying it is centrally located facing canal and a staying here was a lifetime experience in terms of quality service helpful and friendly staff make you feel at home,1
2275,the waldorf is a beautiful hotel that is centrally located the location and accommodations were as perfect as it gets from our gorgeous room that overlooked the garden to the lively lobby to the bar in the basement everything was perfect the staff is as helpful and polite as you can possibly be they always greet you with a smile and do whatever it takes to exceed your expectations the waldorf is a storied iconic brand and the waldorf amsterdam lives up to it reputation service style are their hallmark,1
2276,the hotel is centrally located and has every amenity one could wish for the unique combination of several town houses creates a quirky maze to navigate with numerous ups and downs that said it is a masterpiece of engineering and design the outdoor gardens is special however all this comes at a price which is at the very high end of reasonable,1
2277,the friendliest most caring hotel we have stayed in the service was over the top everyone knew your name and always wanted to know how you were and if there was anything they could do to make your stay better the canal cruise in their vintage boat is a do not miss,1
2278,a beautiful building wonderful staff central location ours was a weekend break and the staff did everything to make it memorable our short stay meant that we did use most of the hotel facilities but we will in the future and are looking forward to another visit one of amsterdam lesser known treasures is the handbag museum just across from the hotel an amazing collection telling the story of women lives in europe and elsewhere linking change the textures of daily life and fashion,1
2279,although it at first glance is on the pricey side it truly is a good value hotel in a wonderful location on a canal close to rembrandt square beautiful hotel excellent service and with our amex platinum card free breakfast and enough of a free hotel credit that we had a beautiful lunch included as well and with both of our rooms upgraded which of course is good luck so i gave my hubs a high five on his pick for a place to stay in amsterdam,1
2280,great place to stay while in amsterdam hotel is beautiful and the location is absolutely perfect staff was very accommodating and provided excellent recommendations for sight seeing and restaurants,1
2282,booked for a birthday weekend to see room upgraded when they found it was my wife birthday to room which is glorious customer care was beyond exemplary and lots of fascinating discussions with staff breakfasts to keep you going all day,1
2283,luxury hotel close to everything great staff and exceptional service it felt like being invited to stay at an exclusive mansion rather than a hotel our junior suite was exceptionally large bathroom was large and modern,1
2284,the hotel is beautiful and top notch so you have nothing to worry about there if you choose to include breakfast with your room it is excellent rooms are so clean and nice but it is the people that keep us coming back no question goes unanswered and always with a smile ca thank them enough for making our visits wonderful,1
2285,probably one of the most amazing hotels in the world definitely the best one i ever stayed in the room was airy clean and comfortable with windows overlooking parts of the city we had breakfast in the hotel and the food is simply put delicious right outside the hotel is part of the canal making it even more spectacular the staff is incredible kind and helpful leading us to the best places to go to see anyone who goes to amsterdam should stay here because it is definitely worth it,1
2286,everything about this hotel location service rooms food is superb we were in room first floor canal view the room is gorgeous and the view fantastic the restaurant is great and the people could not be nicer and more accommodating,1
2287,this hotel was great the level of service from all the staff was fantastic from start to finish we really enjoyed our stay here the room was wonderful bed comfortable and bathroom very nice as well the room was a tad small but sufficient we had the king standard room the hotel is apparently several old residences turned into a elegant hotel and it showed this place was truly first class and the service from everyone really set the tone i used hhonors points to pay for it and felt that was a good use,1
2288,we had heard good things about the waldorf astoria amsterdam but we were totally blown away by this exceptional hotel the hotel itself is elegant and charming in size design and ambiance the staff is friendly and practically trip over themselves in providing absolutely top service no request was too small and all requests were met with a positive can do attitude,1
2289,we stayed here in and returned in the room gym staff location could be better they have a full breakfast in the morning and excellent dining options the michelin star restaurant is worth the splurge i ca say that about many others i have been too unfortunately i was sick but the kitchen made me an off menu soup this was from their casual dining even that was prepared and presented well finely diced chicken vegetables etc the rooms are comfortable excellent bedding and treats to boot everything went smoothly,1
2290,this was one of the nicest properties we have ever stayed at it hospitality with a capital h my only regret is that we were only there for one night the staff was outstanding as were the amenities we enjoyed a nice bite and drinks at the lobby bar i would recommend this property to anyone heading to amsterdam,1
2291,we stayed in the junior suite and the room was big and fabulous at the same time in the room you will find a mini window in the bedroom area the view was really nice from the small window and i recommend if you want to eat breakfast or mini snacks it would be nice sitting in the window seat the bathroom is really nice and there are two sinks which is really useful so your family or friends whom your travelling with does have to wait the bedroom is really nice clean and luxurious the services are really friendly i recommend this hotel for guests to stay with their friends family,1
2292,my fiancé and i spent some time in amsterdam during our engagement trip and we had such an amazing time during our stay at the waldorf astoria from the moment we walked in we felt immediately welcomed and were greeted with a warm congratulation on our recent engagement our room was absolutely lovely with a view of the canal you can tell that they truly think of everything when it comes to pleasing their guests during our stay we made sure to check out their bar vault bar and the bartender was so kind and make amazing cocktails i absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who visits the city the location is amazing in the center of so many activities and shopping,1
2293,after much research we chose the waldorf for our night stay in amsterdam what a perfect choice the location was within easy walking distance to all the major museums and attractions the service was impeccable from to room and bath was beautiful free and each night we returned to a little treat in our room with a thoughtful staff takes care of your every need without being overbearing had breakfast in the restaurant each morning lunch one afternoon and drinks in the vault bar one is what all luxury hotels should aspire to if we return to amsterdam we will definitely stay here again,1
2294,only three years old but is the best high quality option in amsterdam beautiful hotel amenities and service top notch michelin restaurant largest garden in amsterdam in a location where you can walk everywhere,1
2295,visited for two nights after a close friend recommendation hotel is front to one of the main canals as many of the old buildings in amsterdam the arrival was perfect as they we expecting us and after short check inn we were presented to our lovely rooms you are also offered one of four aromas scents for your personalized ambiance in the rooms the hotel is small and has the feel of palace with modern elegant decoration it boast two main restaurants one brazerrie and one international with two michelin stars its also has a small very coozie bar perfectfor a date or nightcap breakfast is also fantastic with a buffet of high quality ingredients and some to order items such as eggs or pancakes only drawback some rooms dont have a door in the bathroom so if you are in the bath all is know in the room last staff is highly trained fluid in english and attentive to detail cost is high but if you can paid for this luxury option it worth every euro highly recommendable,1
2296,beautiful hotel excellent location impeccable service and attention to detail we loved everything about it would hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for a five star property in a lovely neighborhood,1
2297,to start with location is top notch on beautiful canal and within walk of most major sights the hotel is strikingly beautiful with a sleek contemporary feel to complement its classic brick and stone exterior rooms are bright thanks to huge windows and high ceilings and furniture linens and bath are service is excellent and friendly throughout and restaurant is among the best in amsterdam creative and brightly flavored true cuisine i hosted lunch for four where everyone was shocked by its quality hint some rooms have better views than others but all are bright and airy,1
2298,my family stayed at the toren for nights for the first leg of your day trip in europe the toren staff goes above and beyond to make guests feel welcome the rooms were beautifully decorated with large and modern bathrooms there is a refrigerator with snacks and an amazing coffee maker in the room we were unable to stay for breakfast the second day so they sent us off with coffee to go the locations is outstanding we were block away from the anne frank house i would definitely stay here when we return,1
2299,after reading the great reviews of the hotel we decided that so many people from all over the world ca be wrong from the moment we made the reservation untill the out we have only good things to say the explanations how to arrive the welcoming neomi when we arrived the breakfast room the amazing room with the canal view every small detail has made our great,1
2300,hotel lovely and clean hotel our room was romantic beds are comfy fridge hairdryer coffey maker in room customer service perfect they will give honest advice on where to go and what to eat etc the staff ca do enough to help location on the canal front a few minutes from ann franks house it in a relaxed quiet area but only a stroll from dam square and the centre getting there from the airport you can get the train to central station and then tram or to westermarkt it a min walk from there will be staying here again on my next visit,1
2301,very friendly and informative reception with clean and comfortable rooms happy to accommodate our request for two rooms close together ideally situated for tourist attractions and restaurants and shops,1
2302,we stayed at the toren for a night trip to amsterdam and found it to be the perfect choice this boutique hotel location is wonderful on the canal side in a quieter area of the city but only a few minutes walk from some great restaurants the tram at westmarkt and just around the corner are the canal cruise boats the hotel is located in two beautiful old buildings about a minutes walk apart not a problem plenty of umbrellas provided to cope with any showers what makes this hotel stand out from all the others are the staff who are brilliant efficient courteous and ever helpful they even remember your name and the drink you ordered the previous night in the bar staff are an hotels most important asset and this hotel is rich in had a room in the annex building on the first floor overlooking the canal the double glazing kept it quiet and the aircon cool the stairs are very steep as you would expect but there is a lift if needed the room was a good size perfectly clean and interestingly decorated we had a jacuzzi bath in the room which was wonderful and relaxing and could be curtained off also separate shower great nespresso coffee maker free to use or kettle for tea did watch tv but the wifi connection was very fast the highlight was the extremely comfortable bed with a topper great sleep breakfast is served in the main building in another,1
2303,i highly recommended this hotel if you are looking for services and nice boutique hotel staying experience i have booked for nights executive suites given i have impressed by the hotel photo that this suites come with a patio with garden view and i expect the suite will at ground husband got the room first as we flighted with different airlines however the hotel have allocate a rooftop floor executive suite to us when i arrived the hotel i shared my concern and expectation on the booking all staffs in the hotel are so helpful and the manager have allocated back the suites i chose promptly the reason why they allocated the rooftop to us because that room is newly renovated however the rooftop one with no balcony and have to take stairs to the room the room also in smaller size i suggested the hotel spell out clearly with customers on the executive suite on ground follow with patio and rooftop one customer choose hotel rely heavily on the photo in the web site i accept deviation if the hotel prices is cost for night other than this little story everything in the hotel is perfect nice caring helpful polite staffs i feel so warm when u walk around my room is perfect with the patio beautiful garden view luxury buffet breakfast the room with a sauna shower room and jetted tub hardly find this in any hotel around the world when the stream it can come with tea,1

2305,friendly welcome at reception rooms clean comfortable and smart terrific location right by the canal and surrounded by great restaurants and amsterdam attractions i have to say that i have never encountered such attention to customer satisfaction,1
2306,this hotel is absolutely great we enjoyed our stay very much the hotel is absolutely gorgeous the best part was knowing the hotel was built over years ago the bartender gert was an absolute gem very friendly definitely knows his history and loves this great city these are the little things that make a stay more memorable,1
2307,absolute stunning hotel with great the bar have everything not only the greatest gt on earth but they serve all kinds of champagne by the the room was soo cool with a bubble bath in the bedroom and interior was really nice breakfast have all you need and the best coffee enjoy will never live another place when i in amsterdam,1
2308,we stayed at the toren in july for four nights traveling with my wife and two daughters the service and communication are impeccable we booked their two new top floor suites these rooms are amazing and spacious the location of the toren is ideal on a quiet canal ring and centrally located i will definitely be staying at the toren the next time i visit amsterdam i understand why the toren is rated on tripadvisor after my stay,1
2309,loved our stay at the toren is a charming old amsterdam canal side building decorated with old school charm location could be better and the staff wa attentive and helpful from the minute we checked in we had a room facing the back so was very quiet with a comfortable bed,1
2311,this is a beautiful hotel in a unique canal house in amsterdam the room was gorgeously appointed and luxurious and perfect to treat myself to location was perfect and there are plenty of excellent restaurants within walking to the best part the staff were wonderful and unfailingly enthusiastic and friendly if you are not the blessed of the population to have your own butler and household staff and you would like to see what it feels like book a stay in the toren i never had to tell anyone my room number after the first day because everyone from the front desk to the barman to the housekeeping staff seemed to know who i was service was impeccable and always delivered with a smile book for the building stay for the service,1
2312,the toren was perfect for us the staff was fantastic i can not say enough about them in how helpful and kind they all were really went above and beyond the hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the room really had a fantastic time here,1
2313,you ca beat the location right by the canal and walkable to all the best spots in the city lovely staff and i can not stress this enough lovely staff definitely coming back and staying here every time we visit amsterdam in the future the breakfast was really good as the whole experience was really enjoyable highly highly recommend,1
2314,the hotel is amazing the owner is very helpful as well the power went out in northern holland for the first time in years and we had our flight that morning the trains were not running so we risked missing our flight torren kept calling different taxi until he was able to get a hold of one and we were able to make our flight on time thanks torren,1
2315,this is a very special hotel the location is superior the decor is amazing and different every square inch of our room was decorated we had a car with us and chose to pay for the car to be picked up and parked for our two day stay knowing how difficult big cities are to navigate this parking option was so much easier than we could have was our first visit to amsterdam and based on reviews chose the garden view room with a spa bath tub located in the main building when we arrived we were upgraded to a canal view room mice surprise i would highly recommend a canal view room with the tub what still amazes me is how quiet the hotel area was big city and quiet usually do not go together but in this magical location it staff were so helpful and nice they really made us feel special and offered great advice in regard to restaurants and activities we were there during the of july and we received a free cocktail to celebrate the usa the special cocktails are excellent especially the gin and tonic there is a courtyard behind the hotel that is a nice place to relax outdoors we noticed there were several small buildings out side of the main hotel with rooms leading out to this courtyard i would not hesitate to stay in any of them i think this hotel may be the reason i fell in love with amsterdam,1
2316,we stayed two nights en route to croatia and it was a marvelous experience the toren sits canal side in an easily accessible and central location walkable and trammable and right around the corner from the anne frank house the style is a sort of eddie izzard meets the dutch east india company but in the best possible way our room was in the nearby annex and was gorgeous well appointed and unique the bar is cozy and frankly fabulous for quiet time as a couple the bartender was skilled the negroni ranks among the best i had anywhere in the world and my wife signature gin and tonic i told was delicious the staff is very pleasant and very helpful we definitely stay again of course it is expensive but with boutique hotels you nearly always get what you pay for,1
2317,i can not say enough about the staff of the toren everyone went out of their way to help the bed was super comfortable and the bathtub was perfect for relaxing after a long flight will definitely stay at the toren on our next trip to amsterdam,1
2318,the toren is located right on a canal easily accessible to all great attractions staff was very helpful with recommending restaurants our room was very an old world feel great breakfast buffet,1
2319,the best hotel the best staff and service it was our honeymoon and it was defo the best place to stay for the occasion we loved it and they treated us amazingly x x x we still felt like bride and groom there x x x special place for us forever x x x,1
2320,my family stayed here with our two girls and as long as your kids are well behaved then you will find no problem staying here we decided to book two rooms which gave us ample space the suite rooms are very large with a big whirlpool tub enjoyed by all of us after walking all day i would recommend booking a suite room as the amenities are worth it the staff is excellent they look after your needs well and are very friendly breakfast is served in the main bar and offered a good selection to start the day the hotel is centrally located a quick walk to anne frank house canal tours and many restaurants the hotel restaurant recommendation list is spot on,1
2321,i strongly recommend this hotel as it excelled in every aspect other than the check in process more on that later once we were checked in and parked the bartender walked us to our room in a separate building a bit down the street to tell us all the benefits of the hotel and instruct us on everything we needed to know about the room he was most charming and personal and did not leave before he was assured that we were satisfied with our room the room was nicely sized and decorated seductively with genuinely comfortable beds and a very nice and modern we especially loved the outdoor garden and intimate feel of the hotel though i am not sure whether it was part of their duties the three bartenders we met were keenly aware of what people generally needed at the hotel and quick to make sure that guests were looked after in every way my only criticism of the hotel was the check in process which left me ignored and waiting for too long while the staff answered phones and ordered taxis it should be noted that there is no designated place to unload leaving guests to utilize an illegal spot and risk being ticketed overnight parking is either on the street if you are lucky enough to find it for per day with a valet service that the hotel will phone for you at per day or in a garage that is a minute walk away,1
2322,the hotel is gorgeous food is amazing staff are friendly and helpful and rooms are lovely only a minute bike ride down the river from the city centre and bikes are available to hire from the hotel highly recommended thanks for making our trip,1
2323,we chose the hotel v fizeaustraat because the price includes breakfast and wifi and we were satisfied the lobby area has a hip buzz about it and the reception staff are friendly and welcoming our room was comfortable with a good bathroom and good wifi the decor throughout the hotel is smart and stylish the hotel is outside the center of town but we did mind that its location means you avoid the noise and crowds of the center of amsterdam though the hotel is a walk to the metro which will quickly take you to the was unenthusiastic about the breakfast which is a la carte and where you get to pick two items out of a list i much prefer a buffet and find it stingy that you will be using up one of your two choices if you would like a croissant with butter and jam that said there is much to like about the hotel and i might stay there again depending largely on how its room rates compare with the competition at the time,1
2324,spent three very comfortable and enjoyable nights here room was very well appointed with good air conditioning breakfast was good with really attentive staff reception staff were excellent helpful and friendly only a few minutes walk to the metro which takes you to the centre of amsterdam,1
2325,had a wonderful stay here the rooms are nicely designed and have everything you need the breakfast was excellent every day and all of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly great food and drinks at the bar too which we had after arriving at about some people unsure about the location i say the location is only an issue if you never been and would like to be more central and close to the touristy areas but i like to be a little bit out of the centre and love oost the beautiful frankendaelpark is only a minute walk away and it about minutes to walk to amstel station to get a tram i think which goes pretty central if you wanted to be more central then you should looked at a map before booking and chosen a more central hotel duh,1
2326,we stayed here for a short city break and found the hotel to be an excellent choice every member of staff we met was extremely helpful and friendly breakfast is of a very high standard with a wide choice available the hotel including bedrooms is designed in a quirky almost industrial style with concrete ceilings and exposed ducting yet is extremely comfortable spotlessly clean with spacious rooms good air conditioning and enormous shower rooms although the hotel is situated some distance from the centre it is in a quiet area and only minutes walk from the nearest metro and trams at amstel station giving easy access to all areas of the city we would highly recommend,1
2327,after a tiring flight from bahrain it was great to be welcomed at the reception by a friendly staff who very helpfully offered the city pass and the map with a clear indication of where the hotel was and what train and bus to use this was a precursor to a very friendly experience in the entire breakfast spread is generous and feel free to go for more helpings if you need them we are vegetarians and were very well advised and taken care hotel is a short pleasant walking distance from the amstel station which is the hub for train metro bus and adaptor for charging the mobile phone did fit no problem the guy at the reception looked for a spare one and offered one to us very helpfully very impressed with the room had enough space the bathroom was spacious overall great experience,1
2328,if you like to stay in a nice and quiet residential area and you do mind to use the metro or bus for commuting to the center this is the place to stay spacious and well equipped rooms rich breakfasts and friendly staff we stayed there for eight nights and loved the place in addition the hotel has a nice that serves good dinners and is very popular among locals it is located minutes walk from amstel station from where you can go everywhere if you come with car you can park it the garage for additional cost we travelled outside amsterdam as well and found it very comfortable to,1
2329,we were in amsterdam from july we stayed at this hotel based on reviews from tripadvisor the hotel is in a former office building but let that dissuade you it is fantastic inside it is funky chic modern and very clean the people working the desk the bar and the restaurant are extremely helpful the breakfast every morning is fantastic made to order and we heard that the dinner is great we had dinner at the bar one night and it was excellent the hotel had bicycles to rent and we took advantage of them if you ride you are about minutes from just about anywhere in the city that you might want to hotel is right by the amstel station which is serviced by the metro and by trains and by various tram and bus lines this makes it very easy to get to centraal station the airport or the museum area however there is not very much within a five or ten minute walk in terms of restaurants or bars or shops if you know this it makes it much easier to plan your is a great place to stay the beds are nice the bathroom is very big shower only and the area around the hotel is very residential,1
2330,a truly wonderful hotel their location on a quiet canal was perfect away from the hustle near central downtown but close enough to restaurants and shops the staff was top notch and very professional they went out of their way to help with anything and make or stay more than comfortable the bar off the lobby was a great evening respite and one of the little things that makes this a hotel feel like a home away from home the room was large and amazing appointments in the bath it was worth the price for this exceptional experience in amsterdam we will be back,1
2331,this hotel is a stand out hotel there is always the question mark when making a reservation at a foreign hotel will it really be as good as expected based on the reviews well this property far exceeded our expectations just a beautiful property i could sit in the library for hours yes with that nice cognac one can get from the bar just super breakfasts and lunches and the staff so very helpful and kind and friendly but not with that forced fake pleasantries that one can experience at other properties we had a canal view room which was important to us so thank you for that british airlines had lost our luggage prior to us going on an ocean cruise and they failed to get it to us for a three day period we were in amsterdam before we started our cruise ambassade hotel which was where we were staying upon our return was so gracious in accepting the luggage from the airline even before we were scheduled to arrive nice touch it was already in our room when we arrived,1
2332,we changed our initial reservations from a hotel to try hotel ambassade as a smaller boutique hotel recommended by rick steves that will as one of the best decisions we made in wow it was a great experience located on one of the main canals with a great view of amsterdam historical architecture the location was close easy walking distance to quite a few attractions sites and shopping plus city transportation hubs food in the restaurant was the best we had in the city exceeded only by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff our room indeed all rooms as far as we could tell was spacious comfortable and beautifully appointed like most buildings of old amsterdam the layout is somewhat up down and stairwells are narrow and often circular so care is advised and proximity to the elevators is helpful what a great stay we shall return,1
2333,ambassade is located in the city center and short walking distances to many excellent restaurants the hotel concierge was very helpful in recommending and making reservations for us and very knowledgable and easy to communicate in english the facilities are a row of very old beautiful houses that are now all connected internally i was in three different rooms of relatives and they each differed slightly although all were very nice,1
2334,we stayed at ambassade hotel after reading good reviews in tripadvisor what a great decision we are extremely happy with our short stay the location is perfect for exploring amsterdam it right by the canal and one can literally walk to most attractions there are also many wonderful coffee shops restaurants and interesting shops right round every corner ambassade is unlike most international brand commercial class of hotels it personable quirky and unique in its service decor and design i highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again when we next visit amsterdam,1
2335,we had a lovely stay at the charming and spacious apartment unit next to the hotel the rooms were clean and nicely furnished the spiral canal house staircase was a challenge initially but we quickly got used to it the hotel is on a quiet section of the street and yet close to the old town center many attractions and the tram lines would definitely go back,1
2336,this is a lovely hotel it is right on the beautiful herrengracht canal and is very convenient for the main sites in amsterdam our room was spacious very clean with a view of the canal the staff was very helpful getting us tickets to van gogh museum so we did not have to stand in line could not have been happier,1
2337,this hotel is centrally located in easy walking distance to the museums anne frank house and many shops and restaurants the rooms were small but well appointed and had bvlgari amenities our room was on the first floor facing the canal behind the hotel there was a little bit of street noise at night but mostly peaceful due to the layout of the hotel and the various in total canal houses linked together there are in odd places we had steps down from the landing immediately after entering the the bathroom this could be dangerous in the dark at night if you forget they are there we had in the lobby the prices were reasonable and the wait staff was friendly there were books from just about any author you think to look for as well as board games to play overall it was a pleasant hotel stay,1
2338,looking for a restaurant who could also offer vegan dishes we decided to try brasserie de ambassade the experience there was perfect since we had to stay a night in amsterdam city a few days later we made an online reservation while enjoying our food easier then walking down the stairs to the reception in short reception was fast and pleasant room was very nice and the service friendly and impeccablewhat can i say more than you really should try this,1
2339,great hotel great location the hotel is or so traditional amsterdam narrow houses together as a hotel so very amsterdam a great collection of cobra art here and the rooms are all different with unique character some large rooms overlooking the canals,1
2340,pictures can not fully capture the beauty of this hotel the rooms have the convenience of the most modern hotel with a level of elegance that makes one feel like this is a special treat the uniqueness to each room only adds to that staff was friendly and very helpful on top of everything without being too attentive or at all pretentious also the breakfast was fantastic the crepes in particular were the best i have ever far as i am concerned this is the only hotel i would consider on my next trip to amsterdam,1
2341,we visited in may i can not praise this hotel highly enough if ten stars were possible they would easily get them we visited with a poorly relation they accessed a wheelchair when required at last minute and looked after our relation as if they were looking after their own dear family member perfect rooms coupled with a fantastic restaurant brilliant brilliant staff central location this is one of the exceptional hotels in europe never mind amsterdam,1
2342,located equal distance from amsterdam central station the anne frank museum and the museum quarter sits the ambassade hotel a charming and quaint boutique hotel complete with a library bar where i enjoyed a few delicious beers and exquisite wines as well as a wonderful french restaurant the ambassade was the perfect long weekend location the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms beautifully decorated and charming and the quiet surroundings were a pleasant surprise considering the hotel right in the middle of everything location the ambassade is the perfect hotel to stay and fits the vive and nuance of this great city,1
2343,beautiful hotel and very friendly staff every morning we were greeted by the staff as we went out for the day they offered us an umbrella when the weather looked like it would rain was helpful with dining and the breakfast was wonderful great location i would recommend this hotel will use again when we return to amsterdam they made you feel like you mattered and was very welcoming,1
2344,we have made four visits to this wonderful hotel in recent years the setting is beautiful the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms are all full of only issue this time was access to room my wife has some mobility issues and so we were shocked to see the access was up a tiny spiral staircase it was our fault as we know the hotel has lots of small steps and two lifts but we never thought to mention my wife problems when we booked and we had come across this staircase in earlier stays if you have similar walking issues please ensure you inform the staff when booking or you may find yourself in room or the hotel was fully booked as it often is so changing the room once you arrive is not a practicable option the other initial disappointment was the lack of a kettle and facilities however this was quickly rectified by the hotel but it was odd it was there already our luggage had fortunately been taken to our room for us up the stairs so that was a bonus the advantage of the room was as it is so high it was completely quiet at night and the kept it just right but we could also open some windows and it was still room was very clean when we arrived and the hotel had thoughtfully given me a wonderful bottle of red wine as i was during our stay a really nice,1
2345,our experience at the ambassade hotel was perfect we were lucky to be upgraded to the apartment on the singel the next canal from the one the hotel itself is situated on the apartment is beautiful luxuriously furnished and has a view of the singel canal which we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the communication with the hotel before arrival was very efficient the hotel is located in de straatjes the streets area of the city which is full of interesting boutiques and restaurants an area you could spend days in other areas of interest in the city center can also easily be reached on foot finally we loved the breakfast both the quality of the food and the service we hope to be able to stay in the ambassade hotel again in the future and would definitely recommend it to others,1
2346,we just adored this hotel the location is impeccable with walking access to great restaurants and central station our room views were so pretty and we loved having a drink in the library bar to end our evening open till am the staff were friendly and helpful in suggesting activities or restaurants we ca wait to return in the future,1
2347,my new wife and i stayed here a total of nights as part of our honeymoon it is a beautiful boutique hotel with smart design and original art great location for walking around the city although challenging to get to by car and parking is several blocks away staff is very friendly helpful and knowledgeable breakfast at the brasserie is great definitely planning to return here,1
2348,great little hidden gem hotel that is perfect in every way possible we had a top floor room overlooking the canal and found it to be very quiet we had a triple room and found it to be quite large compared to other european hotels the staff was very friendly helpful and was willing to help in any way they could we will be back to amsterdam even if it is just to stay at this hotel,1
2349,a lovely highly professional staff a pretty room and refined public spaces located centrally to major tourist attractions but thankfully not in the middle of the staff are consummate professionals without exception their service is gracious and warm and we found their advice most helpful the room was tranquil and spacious with a comfortable king bed not two twins pushed together and ample sitting area we appreciated the period decor and attention to hotel is comprised of several adjoining houses on the herengracht and singel canals as such there are stairs to link various levels we stayed in room overlooking the herengracht canal on the fourth floor while there is a lift once you reach the fourth floor one climbs four stairs walks along a short hallway descends four stairs once you enter room climb more than a dozen stairs on a spiral staircase to gain access to the room it was not problematic for us but if you have mobility issues we recommend letting the hotel know when you book we would definitely return,1
2350,my wife and i loved this hotel excellent location for exploring the heart of amsterdam canals shops restaurants the hotel itself is lovely probably the most peaceful and attractive lobby and bar i have ever visited if you love modern art specifically the cobra movement the hotel is filled with little treasures that make it a lovely place to recharge after a day of exploring the city will return the next time we come to amsterdam,1
2351,the people the food the rooms etc were all amazing highly recommend purchasing the breakfast when booking the room could not have had a better experience thank you ambassade hotel for making our visit to amsterdam a time to remember,1
2352,stayed for days post cruise and could not have been more pleased with hotel spacious room and canal view with well appointed bathroom large closet and in room safe complimentary bottled water every day in your room bed was extremely comfortable and air conditioning worked well staff was very helpful and definitely stay again,1
2353,from martin who carried of our heavy bags nils linda and the very kind tall man whose friend is a literary scholar who also did some heavy lifting the staff were so friendly kind and accommodating we stayed for days in and the ac was a welcome amenity the hotel looks like an art gallery and the library bar is gorgeous there are comfy little nooks to read a book or enjoy a beverage and chat it is also is a great location to catch public transportation or explore little streets and alleyways with shops and eateries i even signed a book and left it with them to add to their collection of over books in their library so a little piece of me would be there always i highly recommend this hotel without hesitation great stay,1
2354,our stay at the ambassade hotel was the moment upon our arrival we were treated like staff at the hotel provided excellent service throughout our entire request we made was taken care of with total professionalism our bar and restaurant expierence were a bartenders and restaurant staff did everything to make experience highly recommend the ambassade hotel to everyone,1
2355,staff could not have been more helpful or more knowledgeable the entire hotel was clean and quiet the bathroom was fantastic and quite spacious by european standards would definitely stay there again,1
2356,the main positives we experienced the location is of the canal district everything touristy in walking distance radius the canal view room was tastefully decorated and a good size the bed was comfortable the large windows opened to a beautiful view the housekeeping was room was spotlessly cleaned every day the library area was a nice quiet place to have a drink the main negatives came from our first encounters checking in and the subsequent days there have been very good reviews about the staff so it was confusing to us to have such a cool reception the staff was distracted even though there was only one other person at the desk they overlooked us then when they did serve us they were not very hospitable we kindly asked for a recommended barber but were given the name of a hairdresser they thought might do shaves that seemed odd to us they said they would book it and get back to us and did neither my husband researched his own barber and found a good one within min walking distance should they know these things the interactions with the desk staff were disappointing we had lovely service at the four seasons and we thought a smaller boutique hotel would be just as good we wanted that more intimate experience over days and were disappointed the last night there was a female attendant who was warm and helpful while the other younger male attendants continued to stand around looking distracted and,1
2357,lovely quiet spot in a beautiful part of amsterdam walking distance to museums centre of town and other attractions staff were completely charming and helpful and breakfast in the restaurant is excellent too,1
2358,i loved this hotel the location is in the center of the city and i could walk everywhere it is on the most beautiful canal my room was lovely with windows that opened and a view or the canal the staff is most gracious and the place is spotless an excellent restaurant so i did feel like i had to travel out to another room service hours a day the breakfast is awesome truly i just can not say enough one of my all time favorites oh if there only was a hotel like this everywhere i went,1
2359,very comfy well appointed rooms that are spacious and clean and comfy wonderful buffet breakfast and very staff if you ca do stairs this is for you i had close to elevator but still had some stairs to negotiate quiet and some rooms on canal side very happy just the stairs lose a star and would only really be half off as you need to understand how old the buildings are just something to remember i would go back,1
2360,very good location in the middle of the old town of amsterdam situated in the more quiet part of the old town the staff is very friendly and helpfull and try to do whatever they can to give you the perfect stay standard rooms are very small but clean and there was fresh fruit and water in our room when we arrived there was a lot of choice at breakfast including champaign and freshly baked eggs,1
2361,our first trip to amsterdam and it can be quite difficult to find the place to we lucky staying at the ambassade in the streets area was perfect to us a cozy service is absolute top from all staff it will be our place to stay next time visiting was nice,1
2362,this is a cozy hotel nice rooms and nice location we had a deluxe room which was very spacious our friends had the regular one which was a little bit too tight the hotel is much bigger than it looks almost rooms breakfast is nice not overcrowded despite the number of rooms staff is very very polite and helpful especially at breakfast where you can have a more direct communication with them all in one nothing i can complain of,1
2363,haarlem is one of the nicest cities to spend time in the netherlands this hotel and joops hotel which are managed together are right in the middle of the action they are and a decent value,1
2364,we stayed at numerous hotels in amsterdam over the past years including the ambassade in the early after a recent visit the first week of july i wonder why we stayed elsewhere this is truly a magical place and the magic begins once you make contact with some of the best staff anywhere they will not only advise you on the best room for your needs but they will also make reservations at restaurants and provide directions to wherever you plan to visit the ambassade is located along one of the most impressive canals and those rooms overlooking the herrengracht will indeed be rewarding our room overlooked the canal but was also quiet breakfasts are a combination of buffet items and hot items made to order at night this room becomes the brasserie featuring dishes with a french canal house hotels can indeed be musty and dark not the ambassade with its sparkling interior and comfortable furnishings a rarity here is an elevator to service some of the floors and rooms if you have mobility issue be sure to ask for a room near the walked frequently to a vibrant section of town called spui ask a local how to pronounce it and has many restaurants and charming squares and streets surprises abound here in ansterdam and the ambassade is one of them the location service quality of rooms and food make this our choice in amsterdam,1
2365,from the moment you arrive you know you made the right decision the hotel is an attractive and inviting totally renovated place and staffed by warm approachable and knowledgeable people service is attentive gracious and quick all of the hotel common rooms including a bar are very welcoming relaxing quiet and houses a very interesting collection of cobra art copenhagen brussels and amsterdam artists a war ii art movement along with a collection of first edition books signed by the hotel restaurant is excellent and worthy of at least one dinner during your hotel room on the second floor was very roomy had a great straight on view of a canal two very comfortable beds and a great bathroom with a tub double sinks and separate shower the is fast and the connection is hotel is located on a canal with terrific views walking distance to major attractions the best of restaurants and shopping and charming upcoming hip and lively neighborhoods like the jordan spelling where people from amsterdam actually live next time in amsterdam we stay again for sure,1
2366,we had a deluxe room overlooking the room was spacious and with lots of natural hotel location is my favorite in amsterdam on the herengracht the second canal close to the center and to the streets area the room was very clean and the bathroom was good as well,1
2367,our room overlooking the canal was fabulous the service was impeccable and we loved the library bar the decor was incredible and the brunch was delicious location could not be beat close to everything but on a quiet and charming street we will be back,1
2368,totally injoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel the staff was always helpful and the rooms lovely furnished the bed matress was one of the best i have entcounterd in a hotel ever and last but not least we could open our windows and have fresh it is really central and you can reach many shops restaurants and museums by foot,1
2369,the ambassade hotel was where we stayed on our first visit to amsterdam the location is great very easy to walk around the city as you are right in the middle of everything everyone who worked there were pleasant and very helpful rooms are clean and typical size for a european hotel we would stay there again,1
2370,the ambassade is a beautifully decorated and maintained hotel in a perfect location for easy walking access to many places for sightseeing and dining in amsterdam we booked a classic double which was a little on the small side but would have benefited from slightly less furniture because while beautiful it was somewhat crowded it probably worth upgrading to a larger room front desk staff were very helpful and the breakfast and breakfast room are well worth the extra charge to include breakfast in your booking had a great stay,1
2371,we stayed here on a trip to amsterdam and loved it so much we changed our last night in amsterdam in order to stay here again the beds are comfortable the hotel overlooks the canal and within a short walk about minutes of the train station the breakfast is great they even had soy milk hard to find in many places the rooms are wonderful the staff go out of their way to be helpful we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in amsterdam,1
2372,the hotel occupies several old canal houses on the beautiful herengracht canal so the buildings have a lot of character it is just two short blocks away from major tram routes so you have all of the convenience without the noise the hotel is beautifully kept and filled with original art we had a fourth floor room on the herengracht canal and the view was so pleasant it was delightful to see all the boats of all sorts going by at times there would be a slightly exuberant boatload but never obnoxious and they pass quickly the room was very comfortable and with very nice amenities the staff is exemplary each and every staff member we encountered made us feel so comfortable and the staff at the front desk is extremely helpful with tourist questions there are three cozy areas on the main floor in which to relax have a coffee or a drink at the intimate bar the breakfast is bountiful and delicious we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would love to return someday note on our floor there were a couple of stairs up and down as you navigated from the elevator to our room because the hotel consists of four canal houses it was an issue for us but might be for some,1
2373,truly this hotel was the hotel highlight of our trip the room was very comfortable and well appointed bathroom was great shower was great we had a room for with of us and it was very comfortable for our family the location is phenomenal the perfect place to stay in amsterdam the customer service was outstanding they took care of everything suggested and booked all restaurant reservations and they also had tram passes this hotel is a first class experience and well worth it also the location is quaint but the facility is fully updated and modern,1
2374,truly beautiful hotel with friendly staff and great service the hotel is a series of connected and separate beautifully restored canal homes you can get a good idea of what it was like to live in a canal house on amsterdam most beautiful canal the only problem we could see would be getting to some of the rooms with physical handicaps as there are many steps so definitely check out accessibility when booking the restaurant was very good for breakfast and we heard excellent for dinner,1
2375,we stayed three nights at this fabulous hotel and would definitely return we stayed in the apartment which was spacious and beautifully furnished the stafff were very flexible and helpful throughout our stay no helpfully accommodating our family of adults teen and tween the was a peaceful and relaxing place which we all enjoyed with the backgammon chess and variety of newspapers the drinks were delicious and beautifully served the location was perfect easy for shopping sightseeing and restaurants,1
2376,we had a rough start to our stay as we arrived early in the morning on east coast time were hoping to get into our room early and didn t ultimately get to check in until late afternoon the prior occupants of our room were delayed in getting out the hotel staff was very accommodating however and gave us another room to lay down in also a chilled bottle of champagne was in our room that night which was a nice touch other than that experience the stay was fabulous we got a triple room for the two of us as we like space to spread out the room was quiet dark and cool which made sleeping wonderful we loved the nextespresso machine and large the location is excellent close to all the action but in quiet part of town there are lots of restaurants close by the owners prepare a list of recommendations to choose from we felt like we were in someone s home and would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers if you want a view of the canal ask for a room in the front of the hotel there may be some street noise we stayed in the back of the property which was extremely quiet,1
2377,i stayed for only one night upon landing in europe on my way to utrecht had the smallest bedroom which was indeed small but was excellent for one and would have worked for two i do travel with heavy luggage so walked from the train station checked out canals on the way breakfast was excellent so was staff very kind and helpful,1
2378,a great little boutique hotel with lovely views of the canal everyone was so helpful and friendly and the owners were kind enough to provide a bottle of cava in the room for my birthday thank you all for a great stay,1
2379,i booked this hotel not knowing anything about it we arrived to a warm welcome and received the same warmth throughout our stay the room was lovely and comfortable with everything you is easy to get to as the hotel is quite central but far enough away to be peaceful at are a lot of good quality around,1
2380,spent a long weekend here for my friends lads and the hotel staff treated us like royalty in a hotel you would expect them to turn their noses up everything was perfect such a beautiful hotel quiet at night but minutes away from anything in the centre,1
2381,the wonderful treatment started before we even arrived with welcoming emails from the arrival the staff could have helped us more with explainations of the area where to go and where to avoid also recommended restaurants was modern and really well had a really nice view from the window of the was on the smaller side but we had no complaints it was cramped just would stay here again in a heartbeat,1
2382,what a fabulous hotel minutes from the central station and on the chic keizersgracht canal this boutique hotel has stars but should have more our room overlooked the canal and was spacious for a city hotel the décor was brilliant and nothing was too much trouble for the reception staff i had many visits planned on our itinerary and we managed them all plus some others due to the location of this hotel in fact we walked everywhere the furthest museum was sledelyk museum which was about minutes leisurely stroll watch out for the bikes anne franks house was no more than minutes and much the same for dam square so this hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but so peaceful we were there for just the four nights and because of our busy schedule we only had breakfast in the hotel on the last day we should have got up earlier because for the price of an orange juice coffee and croissant in a café we could have had a full continental breakfast including omelette in the hotel for the same price all of the staff were very helpful and if you stay here you really wo be disappointed when we go back to amsterdam again we will definitely book this hotel again,1
2383,we walked from the station in under minutes would have been less if we not trusted g maps very friendly and helpful welcome and check in the staff here are young friendly efficient and bright good english and great at telling you everything you need to know to make the most of your time in amsterdam our room was a little dark but had everything we needed for nights and just a short walk from jordaan in our opinion the best of amsterdam we recommend sebastian,1
2384,we stayed here for one night before our viking river cruise the room was small but very clean the staff was so friendly and the location was great we walked to anne frank house and we were right on one of amsterdam lovely canals it was in an older building but off the beaten path i would describe it as more of a boutique hotel with quirky hallways just what we were looking for after an exhausting overnight flight,1
2385,it was a very nice hotel but with some shortcomings the single room was nicely decorated but was so tiny that after putting a luggage it was hard to walk around the bed the location was beautiful by the canal but not great if you value convenient location most major attrations are a little far to walk to yet tram stations were not nearby the central station was min walk but was not easy to walk with heavy luggage so took taxi anyway also quite pricy considering the room size these could be tradeoffs considering that it is a canal house hotel but not worth the money especially if you are in town for short time and want to manage time efficiently,1
2386,this is a fantastic hotel the staff are so friendly and helpful the room was beautiful and quiet definitely go for a canal view the location is perfect for tourist places as well as mixing with the locals,1
2387,great location in a quite area that is close to everything our room was way beyond very large room with a view of the canal the staff was incredibly helpful myrthe and simone were outstanding this hotel has our strong recommendation,1
2388,we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel our room was quite spacious and had a beautiful view of the canal it was very quiet we almost forgot we were in a big city while being only minutes away from various destinations the staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and knowledgeable,1
2389,my fiance booked this for my birthday present night break and our first time in amsterdam on the way to the luxury suites our uber driver much cheaper than taxis even said what an ideal location it was in from the moment we arrived we were taken good care of a complimentary glass of champagne suitcases taken up to our room and shown around the room was so impressive large comfy bed massive tv complimentary coffee machine and tea robes and slippers we did have the option of purchasing items from the mini bar but chose not to as we found it to be over priced so purchased our own from local shops it rained on our last day but was a problem as the hotel provides umbrellas free of charge overall we are delighted with the accommodation and service we received and would imagine staying anywhere but the luxury suites apartments when we return again in future anywhere else would certainly be a big downgrade absolutely perfect in every way and two extremely happy customers going home today,1
2390,spacious suites with lovely view on the canals staff was wonderful helped us out with everything restaurants tickets they really know the city would recommend it to all my friend to stay in this hotel,1
2391,we booked the royal penthouse for something special for our trip to amsterdam and it did disappoint i have special needs as i ruptured my achilles tendon just before our trip and i have to wear a moon boot on arrival we were met at the front door and given every assistance the checkin in process was seamless and our suitcases were whisked of to our suit was fantastic i had arranged for the vip black diamond package and there were beautiful red roses and a lovely black diamond encased in glass in a nice presentation box and a bottle of veuve clicquot on ice throughout our stay the staff could do enough for us from ordering taxis fast room service when required suggestions for nice restaurants close by making special cocktails etc would highly recommend the luxury suites in amsterdam if you are looking for something we will certainly return,1
2392,i would like to thank the hotel management for being very professional from the check in day to the check out day hotel room is large compare to others also the house keeping excellent room is furnished with all what you need to make your staying comfortable hotel location in the middle of the city and few minutes far from the downtown peter will be able to explain and book for you any place in amsterdam or europe myself and my wife would like to thank him also to thank the hotel management for having great week in amsterdam,1
2393,stayed here one night july hotel staff including concierge peter were outstanding in their courtesy and extending themselves to ensure a wonderful stay very helpful in planning our limited time in amsterdam and we were given a spectacular room upgrade highly recommend,1
2394,loved our time here the room was huge and the bathroom is big enough for a gymnastics routine the concierge peter is top notch lovely outgoing and beyond generous with his expertise which is vast thank you peter location highly recommend,1
2395,with its central location and its helpful staff banks mansion proved to be a wonderful choice for our stay in amsterdam full breakfast is provided as are drinks all day and a cocktail hour with snacks our room was wonderful and overlooked the canal definitely would stay there again,1
2396,location was great facility was staff was tremendous we stayed three nights and had one of the best experiences we ever had travelling definitely a great value for the price open bar and beverages cheese and wine offered daily quaint and clean,1
2397,we had an amazing time in amsterdam and this hotel made it so much nicer all inclusive was great drinks in your room and in the foyer coffee machine in your room and the breakfasts were divine every morning the staff we super helpful would recommend this hotel to anyone,1
2398,stayed here from july to had room facing the canal loved this hotel the staff was amazing the location was perfect to min walk to anywhere worth going and the complimentary drinks and snacks were the icing on the cake i really miss that wasabi good can you guys ship me some here susan toronto,1
2399,we stayed for nights in a room facing the canal room was quite small but typical for hotel rooms in major european cities it was also a bit too warm however there was aircon we were unwell so chose not to turn it on service was friendly and efficient loved the room space where one could access and free bar in the evening breakfast was great with eggs prepared to order this is a well hotel and one we would definitely consider for our next trip to amsterdam,1
2400,we enjoyed our three night stay here a great location and room was very comfortable and well appointed little extras like dome nibbles and in room decanters of liquor nice the free bar and fruit and lollies in the comfort of the reception area was great we did have any of the afternoon cheese etc they put on but a great idea breakfast was pleasant enough nice to have freshly made omelettes etc is ridiculous that a ramp had not been installed at entrance you have to lug your luggage up the steps and no one helps even just stood at top looking at us a few times our interactions with the staff were not great little things like not listening to our queries correctly questioning us on what taxi service we called when they called it for us some small things that demonstrated they were prepared to go the extra mile something advertised as a feature of the hotel,1
2401,great location in the center of amsterdam really great staff an amazing breakfast in this small hotel entirely decorated in the art deco style i do recommend to take rooms with canal view much better than the big hotels nearby,1
2402,room quite small but a number of perks complimentary decanters of whisky vodka and brandy in the room breakfast freshly cooked with a good selection of hot and cold a nice treat after complimentary drinks and nibbles staff very welcoming,1
2403,we stayed at banks mansion between the and july the location was absolutely perfect for everything on arrival we were given room which despite being quite big was very dark i am partially sighted with a view out onto the street there was no noise as the room must have been sound proofed but it was the darkness i did like went straight to reception and the room was changed for which despite being smaller than the first was light and airy with a canal view perfect and thank goodness it was changed the bed was amazingly comfortable and so were the pillows normally when i go abroad i tend not to sleep too well but i did at banks mansion i also kept referring to it as home which is a great accolade as normally hotels are like that the breakfast was great and a perfect way to start the day fresh eggs etc cooked to order pancakes fruit yoghurt meat cheeses bread etc and copious amounts of and fresh orange juice i loved the cheese and saucisson at a lovely little pick me up before heading out for the evening the hotel is central to everything and we were amazed that a minute walk got us to rembrandt square and pretty much everything else we loved getting in after a hard days sightseeing and being able to have a hot chocolate enjoyed with a waffle that had been left in our room the shower was wonderful and fresh,1
2404,fully weeks before our visit we made a one letter typo on our nights rooms reservation necessitating cancellation of our reservation what did banks mansion do about this tiny error charged our credit card the full up front anyway as opposed to reasonable cancellation policy we offered not until after we left the city did they even inform us that they were able to finally resell nights of the on a busy summer weekend yet did even refund us fully for those they so if you like nights for a hotel you ca use enjoy and like management that does little to remedy any issue you may have then this is your place for terrible customer treatment be wary,0
2405,stayed at this hotel while visiting amsterdam this hotel is located in a pretty central part of the city and all the major landmarks are within walking distance the hotel offers a daily open bar and breakfast the breakfast is delicious the staff is friendly and the hotel also includes a happy hour with snacks and wine would definitely stay there again if i am ever back in amsterdam,1
2406,hotel was very clean staff were all extremely helpful could do enough for the breakfast was excellent and the cheeses were hotel i have stayed were spacious and very well equipped bed was large and comfortableall alcohol in the lounge was free as much as you want also take up to your room,1
2407,my wife and i stayed here nights at the end of may we would stay again without hesitation we had a room overlooking the canal herengracht i suggest booking early at least to months in advance the choicest rooms go fast and the hotel books up get the breakfast package breakfast is ample delicious and so convenient to have in the hotel staff is friendly and helpful everyone speaks adequate to good english rooms were clean and very quiet curtains were doubled to provide adequate darkness the hotel is located within walking distance to nearly everything in the city museum plane is a minute walk along a street packed with boutiques art galleries cafes and antique shops the flower market is minutes around the corner after an afternoon of museums and shopping it was nice to enjoy any kind of refreshment at no additional charge and did i mention the hotel is close to everything so you can pop back to rest a bit and venture out again will stay here again,1
2408,this hotel is a gem the staff is friendly helpful and welcoming ties my spelling is wrong greeted me with warmth after a very long and delayed flight i felt immediately comfortable the decor for hotel is reminiscent of louis frank lloyd wright styles it is understated on the outside but it is right on the canal and quite frankly everything i wanted to see was within a minute walk the staff made suggestions on where to eat within the area i had dinner at a recommended place that was superb my room was clean comfortable large the bathroom very roomy now on to the they mean all free mini bar liquor in room for your use a happy hour with wine soft drinks beer hard liquor cheese and crackers in their convivial lobby which has couches and comfortable chairs i was traveling alone and during this social drink time i met others and had a chance to share experiences the breakfast is excellent with a chef who has been making omelets for guests she said for years the food was varied and fresh again staff friendly and helpful does this sound as if i enjoyed my experience here i would not stay anywhere else in fact my sister and i are visiting amsterdam in the fall and our hotel will be this one,1
2409,other hotels have a lot to learn from the banks mansion their policy free breakfast free drinks in the lobby cheese platter at pm keeps the lobby lively and customers happy staff are very friendly and helpful and provided good restaurant recommendations centrally located in amsterdam close to many attractions good facilities strong shower ac best and affordable hotel in amsterdam,1
2410,i can honestly not say anything negative about our stay perhaps that it was just way too short stairs outside the front door appeared daunting but the ladies from the hotel immediately saw us and came to help with our heavy room with tea and coffee making facilities a small minibar with free water soft drinks and beer and a tray with decanters filled with cognac gin and whisky free the room had a tiny balcony and overlooked the gracht extremely central location the beds were excellent and the breakfast absolutely delicious with eggs to order tea and coffee with cake was available in the foyer area when we arrived nuts sweets and crisps and between and pm there is the most wonderful cheese and wine etc for free lots of alcohol that people could just help themselves too water and soft drinks excellent bread and lots of different snacks with the cheese and wine lots of people enjoyed this and it was fun meeting other people there we arrived very early so our luggage was safely locked away until we returned and were able to get to our room we had reservations for many attactions so time was of the essence we walked to the anne frank museum and later also to the rijksmuseum and van goch museum we are very glad we ended our day in amsterdam with a canal cruise and dinner as that showed us so much more of amsterdam that we would not have had,1
2411,the service was excellent the staff was the best friendly courteous and helpful we stayed for nights excellent service at breakfast with very good food the open bar at night was a great plus,1
2413,my fiancé always finds fantastic hotels to stay in all over the world and banks mansion was no exception the staff were wonderful as soon as we walked through the door they offered is drinks and let us relax in the well stocked all inclusive bar whilst they checked us is we were given a map and lots of recommendations the room was very comfortable and had everything we needed as well as a trio of spirits drinks breakfast was very nice and plenty on offer i would recommend the omelette the hotel is within walking distance from the centre and other places of interest there is also a selection of resteraunts near by we will be staying at banks mansion on our return trips to amsterdam,1
2414,fun art deco style hotel with abundant amenities reception staff was professional welcoming and unflappable we were checking in with a very large group of family and the reception staff remained calm and collected staff took the time to sit down with our extended family and go over the hotels location and provided a map and overview of the area complimentary wine and cheese are put out for guests each coffee and beverages available in the lobby all day i did have time for breakfast the day of departure but our teenagers did and gave the complimentary breakfast a big thumbs are small but the decor is fun the bathroom tile is beginning to look a bit worn and in need of a deep cleaning but dual shower heads were a nice touch the bed has a memory foam top not my preference but others in my family liked it pillow selection yes there is an assortment of styles was to travelers with small children you might want to request a room without a balcony there are no screens and a child not highly supervised could open the large windows and have an unfortunate accident the rooms with windows more complicated to open and higher up offer more peace of mind when traveling with curious young children,1
2415,stayed here nights absolute no hour open you be surprised how disciplined people drink when they know bar is always open good solid breakfast nice wine and cheese happy hour pleasant great choice for amsterdam by the great tempur beds,1
2416,excellent service friendly polite attendants spacious and cozy room all prepared with care and affection attention to every detail the breakfast was without many varieties but everything delicious and fresh it was the best scrambled eggs i have ever eaten i already miss you,1
2417,was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and service of this centrally located hotel the staff was very courteous and was always willing to help very clean and comfortable room good breakfast and other amenities,1
2418,great location close to flower market dam square vondelpark heineken experience riks museum etc super fresh cooked breakfast friendly staff clean comfortable room quiet at night full service concept free bar what more could you ask for,1
2419,it all starts with the staff the most accommodating i have experience yet ca say enough about them always have time to help with any directions recommendation making sure you comfortable and that your needs are met they really pull off the make yourself feel at home location was fabulous just a couple of blocks from flower market and rembrandt square or a quick ten minute or less stroll to numerous areas of interest with public transit just about at the front room was very accommodating as well i can not comments on standard rooms we upgraded to the suite this was by far the largest room we have stayed on our trips throughout europe very comfortable beds large shower with water pressure included mini bar pillow menu wife recommended beautiful view of the canal and for our friends in the ice machine,1
2420,we enjoyed banks maison hospitality on two occasions recently conveniently located in the centre of the city overlooking one of the canals with easy access to public transport if required walking distance to restaurants shops and many of the main tourist attractions staff were welcoming efficient and always willing to assist the open bar in the was an added attraction which encouraged guests to relax and mingle creating a homely would certainly recommend banks mansion sue and brianaustralia,1
2421,my wife selected and made a reservation at this hotel after a lengthy online were very happy with the choice we had a third floor room overlooking a canal the room was well furnished and of ample size well located a short walk to the museums tram line just around the corner short walk to rembrandtplein and numerous restaurants staff was friendly and very helpful with any questions we had we arrived at the hotel before noon and were able to check in to our room early a big help after an overnight flight from the hotel breakfasts were very good nice omelet bar and wide selection of other be back to banks mansion on our next trip to amsterdam,1
2422,we stayed at banks mansion for two nights the hotel is all inclusive which is still was its location about minutes from rembrandtsplein and plenty of places to eat and staff will go out of their way if you need help getting to amsterdam many the bed was sooo definitely stay again,1
2424,the location of banks mansion was excellent walking distance to everything so glad we chose to stay here the hotel itself was very nice and the staff as well the stay includes breakfast which was very good and your alcohol,1
2425,stayed here for nights in way to nairobi kenya happy hour each day at with nice selection of cheese meats and lots of liqueur selection red and white wine sodas all included in room pricing mini room bar items free as well as tumblers of bourbon gin and cognac staff is very helpful w wonderful breakfast selections just a great place to stay will stay here again in future,1
2426,this was by far the best hotel we stayed in throughout our weeks in europe check in was very very informative and welcoming and all the staff were only too happy to answer any questions we had and give great suggestions on things to do and places to go another great feature of this hotel was the open bar in the lobby area which is all included in the rate and also the mini bar overall our experience was fantastic here and would definitely stay here again when we visit next time,1
2427,banks mansion is a small and friendly hotel well located clean and very comfortable room was quiet roomy and comfortable great breakfasts close to the flower market a tram runs outside the front door however it is an easy walk to most of the main attractions the staff were always helpful happy to answer any questions every afternoon guests were invited to gather in the lounge over drinks and cheese this engendered a sense of coming home at the end of a busy day provided opportunity to meet others i highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to amsterdam,1
2428,the banks mansion is a lovely small hotel in the heart of amsterdam the hotel is surrounded by lively cafes and restaurants and walking distance from all major attractions the staff are friendly and helpful the free drinks in the lobby each afternoon draw a large crowd and people mingle and chat the breakfast is delicious we booked a room with a canal view the room was comfortable and spacious but there really is much value to a canal view i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting amsterdam,1
2429,would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to amsterdam close to everything and the staff were excellent if i could i give it stars rooms cleaned everyday and the stroopwaffles in the room were to die for will definitely rebook if or when i go back,1
2430,the location could not have been better for us the free drinks in the lobby all day were very helpful and the breakfast with made to order omelettes was a great start to the day not all rooms have a canal view and my only regret was not checking into that and ensuring my room had a view but we did spend that much time in the room anyway,1
2431,good location within walking distance of most tourist stops with tram stop a half block away our room on the ground floor street side was small and you could hear some street noise only one chair so the other person had to sit on the bed or at the desk shower with steam no tub prior to arrival we emailed the concierge for help making a restaurant reservation and got a reply but the reservation was not made once there staff were friendly and helpful breakfast buffet was good with eggs cooked to order fresh squeezed oj nice variety which changed slightly daily for those who take advantage of the free alcohol wine and cheese this hotel is probably worth the price lobby was comfortable although not enough seating during in the evening we prepaid the entire stay but were surprised with a rather hefty city tax to be paid upon departure,1
2432,this hotel is probably the best value for the money i have ever been to in all my travels my parents traveling with me could believe the hotel was double the price where else have you been to that offered free drinks and a nightly cheese course for a regular room rate the staff is amazing and the rooms were well appointed my first time in amsterdam wo be my last and we will absolutely stay at the banks next time,1
2433,we really enjoyed our stay nice location t a lovely property with caring staff the check in process was very easy note there are a few steps at the front entrance they helped with the luggage but it could be an issue if lobby has a living area with comfy lounge chairs and sofas they have coffee tea and sodas during the day then break out the beer wine spirits and snacks around they leave it out all evening fun the rooms are nicely furnished but quite small when we return we opt for a larger room the beds were really comfortable and the air conditioner worked complimentary breakfast was outstanding the evening desk staff was really terrific,1
2434,the banks mansion is a great hotel located in the heart of amsterdam on one of the most beautiful canals everything we did was in easy walking distance the hotel offers nice comfortable rooms knowledgable and helpful staff and an extensive breakfast we really enjoyed our staying,1
2435,beautiful hotel amazing staff friendly helpful the inclusive bar the location right by the flower market and spacious very clean and good but would say the only let down of the whole place is the breakfast room itself very small badly laid out and decor well past its hotel is expensive but worth every penny treat yourself you wont regret got a cab to and from the airport but its really not needed the train station centraal is walkable so much better to do this,1
2436,it in a very convenient location near van gogh museum rijksmuseum and the concert hall there are several other museums around it if you like art and museum it a great place to stay there are public transportation very nearby the room is spacious clean and the bed is comfortable the people are very nice and helpful gave us great recommendations for dinner and sight seeing tips nikki recommended the seafood bar it excellent and was crowded very early pm on a weekday and we had to wait for a table it within walking distance from hotel seafood was fresh and very reasonable for the value we took a taxi to the hotel from our docking location after our viking cruise but we used public transportation to go to the airport very convenient and it only costs each the breakfast was basic and sufficient but the pancakes were to die for so please asked for it there was a heat wave for the nights that we spent at the hotel there was no in our room but we opened the window and turned on the fan and it was every wednesday there are free concert at the nearby concert hall you have to wait in line to get the free ticket one ticket per person tickets will be passed out at am get there a little early to wait in line we really enjoyed it i like the location and the people running it,1
2437,we recently stayed at hotel fita for a two night trip to amsterdam from the time we booked our room to the moment we checked out the communication with hotel staff was clear and reliable directions to the hotel from the airport were very useful and easy to follow we asked for suggestions from different staff members and all the info we received was spot on and fun once at the hotel we were greeted by the amazing kees who welcomed us with warmth and as an ambassador of all things amsterdam our room was comfortable clean and ready upon arrival we enjoyed the size and configuration of both the bathroom and sleeping room with good amenities for a short stay the complimentary breakfast is not to be missed a full spread including wonderful fresh dutch pancakes made to order we found it easy to walk about or take the metro and while we felt close to the action the room remained quite and the buzz of city center was left behind once inside the hotel melo and donna were fantastic as well and apologies for not catching the name of our room attendant who did a terrific job as well thank you for a wonderful stay we hope to return soon,1
2438,small but excellent hotel staff very welcoming and friendly you feel right at clean and nice has tv coffee machine electric kettle central easy to travel to and lift good breakfast,1
2439,when i go to a hotel i want a clean comfortable room at hotel fita i got that and so much by a father and son the son the owner hotel fita is located a few blocks from the van gogh museum and the rijksmuseum plus restaurants and public transportation they provide nice clean and comfortable rooms with excellent sunlight and they provide a complimentary breakfast with pastries eggs bacon and wonderful wonderful it the people that make the fita so good to stay at the father greeted us checked us in and carried our bags up the elevator to our rooms he and the son serve the breakfast the staff are all friendly the only things i did like were that elevator i a claustrophile and it made me claustrophobic and the only alternative the stairs which are narrow twisty and potentially worth the price they charge,1
2440,my elderly mom stayed here and they treated her really well we wanted to stay here too but they were sold out great pancakes at breakfast lovely and helpful people and no hassles the nespresso machine in the room was a phat bonus,1
2441,what a find this hotel was the main reason for booking as it was the closest one available to my office in amsterdam but upon arrival i could instantly tell this was a family run hotel who are proud of what they beautiful lady greeted me and checked me in even took me down to my room and gave a little tour and explanation of the facilities a nice touch the room was spacious as was the bathroom with a shower large enough to fit a family not one for continental breakfasts but at hotel fita they also provide eggs and bacon and also freshly made to order pancakes again a nice can not fault the staff at all always smiling and always helpful location wise its great because its away from the hustle and bustle but still close enough to walk to or even hop onto a tram you have a number of museums on your door step and also one street away from your high end stores such as versace if that you thing guys if you brining your wife maybe this is the place to stay there were a couple of things that would have made my stay a bit more comfortable which is why i only gave do not have air con now whilst im sure of the year this would be an issue the day i arrived was quite warm and air con would have been a god send also the room i was given,1
2442,we spent two nights at hotel fita before a cruise of the baltic there was four of us between two rooms my brother and i had a corner room on the first european not american first floor and my parents were directly above us our room did not include an air conditioner but we had plenty of openable windows and doors out onto a small shared balcony it on a nice side street just a block over from the van gogh museum and another next to it and very close to the rijks and the canals there is a tram stop just around the block for the tram from the arrived in the morning and got to the hotel before noon they had my parents room ready and let us check in and go up the room my brother and i shared was ready within half an hour it was comfortable clean and the bathroom was in excellent shape my only concern was the staircase the building is an older one and is narrow and curved it very stable and has good banisters but if you at all scared of heights it may be unnerving they do have a little elevator so you do have to haul your luggage up and down the stairs at all do note that there is a school and daycare nearby so there will be children playing during the daytime i did not find however that there was problems with the noise when i was,1
2443,we chose hotel fita because we wanted something close to the art museums we chose wisely upon our early arrival we were met by a lovely young woman who checked us in and acquainted us with amsterdam the map and her accompanying details about how to get around and what to visit made us feel immediately comfortable with the city when we returned that evening we found our room to be fantastic we had asked for a large double and it was large and clean and included everything we could possibly need even an ironing board that slid into its hiding place breakfast was great lots of yummy choices with delicious pancakes at the had a one block walk to the van gogh museum and a pleasant walk through the park to the rijksmuseum there were at least two other art museums within three blocks too the tram which we rode everywhere stopped within the block too one block in the opposite direction was a street filled with shops and cute places to eat getting dinner was more difficult than lunch because most of the closed by which i think might be because this is a museum district and the museums close by owners and staff are absolutely lovely you can tell this is more than a job for them they truly enjoy talking to each visitor and look for ways to make them feel at home i hope i have a chance to return to both amsterdam and hotel,1
2444,we booked this based on previous reviews and were disappointed the room was spacious and spotless as was the entire facility the staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating as others have mentioned the breakfast was varied and good especially the pancakes made fresh on couple of things to be aware of the lift is small but can accommodate large suitcases the as is true throughout amsterdam are very steep there is a school playground across the street and is somewhat noisy happy noises during the day otherwise it a nice tree lined it a wonderful small hotel in an ideal location for food parks and museums you wo be disappointed,1
2445,a great place to stay if you have a room on the river the historic vibe is nice if you are not looking for something modern the service attentive and the spa good all in all just about worth the price,1
2446,love intercontinental hotels but this may be one of the best very attentive personnel a lot of details in the room great servibar great decor location is not the best but not bad good view from my room,1
2447,my wife and i recently spent a night at the intercontinental amstel amsterdam it is a charming and elegant hotel the staff were welcoming professional and helped in any way possible i would particularly like to thank aad van den berg for securing tickets for the anne frank house at short notice we were also grateful to the staff for their kind gift on the occasion of our silver wedding anniversary we look forward to returning,1
2448,this historic hotel was getting a when we were there the hotel rooms are large and the bathrooms are nothing short of magnificent you can stretch full out in the tubs and the showers have many options hand held rain shower head etc the decor in the rooms is a little dated but not awful the common spaces are gorgeous especially the restaurants which sit right on the amstel river the hotel is also central to the city center but not not in the midst of the chaos so it quiet and convenient,1
2449,i traveled with my mother to amsterdam for a long weekend to visit keukenhof as an early mother day gift and decided to stay at the ic for it large rooms indoor pool and waterfront location no other luxury hotel in amsterdam offers that combination service is impeccable we arrived before time on a flight from chicago and were warmly welcomed by the manager and staff they apologized for not having a canal view room for us but made sure to accommodate my preferences of high floor away from elevator indeed we were assigned a top floor room at the corner of the building and in the wing that was not covered in scaffolding our room was incredibly spacious for a standard room in a european hotel the decor is very old fashioned but well maintained and luxurious there were spacious closets windows that could be opened and plenty of space for my mother and i to relax although we were on the courtyard side of the hotel we could still see a canal from our windows so that was a nice surprise the bathroom was also old fashioned but undeniably luxurious having a separated wc was essential in choosing the ic the separate shower in our bathroom had natural light also despite the age of the hotel i was impressed by the condition and features especially the rain shower the only disappointment was the lack of handy electric we first got to our room we noticed that one of,1
2450,my friend booked intercontinental amstel amsterdam for her wedding what a great experience beautiful interior excellent service and great hotel is a great venue for hosting events with around persons there are many beautiful rooms bars ballroom did not book a room to stay overnight but will look forward to any opportunity to do that in the future,1
2451,we stayed at the pulitzer for two nights and had an amazing time the hotel is beautiful and is located in a lovely part of amsterdam our room was fabulous the food at the hotel was lovely we did need to eat anywhere else we really enjoyed the canal cruise so that is definitely a must we would love to go back at some point highly recommend,1
2452,we stayed two nights in amsterdam and one night was at this fantastic hotel we had a large room overlooking a canal we stayed with our daughter and although the room was spacious she had a bed in the living room but she said it was comfortable our room had a kitchenette with a lovely selection of complimentary teas and coffee breakfast was served in the jansz restaurant and highly recommended with a great selection of hot and cold breakfast choices our evening meal was also in the jansz and again a good selection was on offer there is a lovely courtyard to sit in and some adult swings too highly recommended is the boat trip run from outside the hotel on the tourist our captain tony was highly knowledgeable and a very funny tour guide,1
2453,as americans who travel a lot there is not enough praise that i can render to communicate just how outstanding this hotel was from the initial curbside service to the quality rooms to the depth and knowledge of the concierge this was was the best we have experienced we took another couple with us who actually live in northern germany and they agreed that the service and food were the finest they had had i can not recommend this hotel enough for the discriminating traveler,1
2454,uniquely authentic architecture chic aesthetics ideal location tasty food and drink star service the team will take care of everything what not to love i looking forward to my next stay,1
2455,highly recommend the pulitzer the hotel grounds are beautiful and our corner king room was very spacious and true to what was represented in the hotel website breakfast was delicious and included both a good buffet spread as well as a hot made to order menu the hotel is well located within walking distance to attractions shopping restaurants service staff are also well trained attentive all in we had a very pleasant stay,1
2456,wife and i stayed at the pulitzer and it was a wonderful experience must be a good place because it was full the three days of our stay a unique place from several building in the block made into a hotel nice rooms good bed shower and a unique place to stay in a very centrally located part of amsterdam easy walking to many sites and lots to do i would stay here again because of service comfort and location,1
2457,excellent location for shopping and site seeing spacious room with canal view breakfast and attentive staff building with interior gardens memorable experience,1
2458,if you come to amsterdam and do stay in this hotel you be missing property is beautiful and very rooms are comfortable clean and quite service is staff is faultless,1
2459,stay in the pulitzer amsterdam we will definitely return the recent renovation is superb with a lovely quirky intimate style all spaces throughout this hotel have the same fun vibe and the old canal houses give it a fabulous sense of character gardens are also beautiful very happy staff which says alot about a place we had a group here and everyone loved our choice the area it is in the streets is also the perfect place to be located i think it would be hard to find a better choice in amsterdam,1
2461,perfect hotel in ideal location the rooms are carved out of several canal houses so be prepared to walk up down many levels and corridors everything was tastefully done right on down to the paint colors and artwork the staff was very efficient and accommodating the pulitzer bar was certainly a highlight as was the center garden did i mention the comfortable bed wonderful i will be back,1
2462,we are a family of with teenage daughters we stayed in the family suite with a loft this was one of our favorite hotels on our recent trip the beds and pillows are so comfortable my teenagers hate sharing a bed so the twin beds in the loft were awesome we loved the wonderful buffet breakfast in the morning the hotel could be in a better location we were a very short walk from the anne frank house as well as many restaurants shops and scenic canals pulitzer is worth the price the customer service was excellent and they catered to every need and question we arrived early and they were gracious enough to take care of our luggage for us and call us when our room was ready we would definitely stay here again,1
2463,us we stayed at the pulitzer to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it special for us we were blown away by the special touches which really helped make our visit memorable special mention to megan the duty manager who was hotel the location was perfect for us we were able to travel to and from the airport easily by public transport and could walk everywhere in the hotel is absolutely stunning and a great level of care has obviously gone into every detail it so big that they hand out maps at simply travelling between our room and the lobby was enough to make me stop and take photographs that how pretty it all is our room was perfect the bed was amazingly comfortable the bathroom large the towels soft we had a nice view out over the canal no complaints whatsoever except maybe a mirror that you do have to climb inside a wardrobe to access but now i just being picky i would highly recommend the canal tour on their boat the tourist it pricier than the alternatives but you definitely get to travel in style it a great way to see the city from a different angle and without worrying about getting hit by a bike the whinge the only slight criticism we would have is the service in the pause we stopped in on our last afternoon before heading off to the airport our waitress tried to take,1
2464,i loved this hotel and can not wait to return the room was perfect as was the bathroom the lovely garden restaurant and bar is a wonderful place to have a drink or tea after a long day of walking the staff all of them were incredibly helpful and personable would return in a new york second,1
2465,i wish i could give the pulitzer stars this hotel is the perfect combination of luxury comfort style and character the staff went above and beyond in friendliness and helpfulness philip in the beautiful pulitzer bar is a gem concierge aided us daily with directions and dinner boat trip was a perfect start to our trip it well worth the price we enjoyed champagne and a dynamite sunset on the late evening cruise we chose to book a junior suite after reading that some rooms are very small we were so happy that we did we adored our room it had a living room incredibly comfy king bed lovely view of the courtyard stylish modern bathroom and plenty of room for our belongings it included the amazing breakfast i am still thinking about those perfect eggs and we were delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne housekeeping was spot on for us the room was always perfect with daily turn down service as well our shower did leak onto the floor quite a bit but this was always cleaned upon our return to our location is in our favorite area of amsterdam the nine streets charming boutiques bars and restaurants along the canals an easy walk or tram to everything you could want to see it was very nice to be able to retreat to this quiet but lively neighborhood after leaving the overcrowded hustle and bustle of other neighborhoods we are already planning our next visit thank you pulitzer,1
2466,back at home and we miss this place a july european trip with two of our daughters left us wanting to stay at the pulitzer indefinitely making you feel at ease the minute you walk in the door they offer everything a discriminating traveler could want wrapped up in the most unique and charming package the good beautiful comfortable cozy rooms many with a canal view excellent entertainment options ca fall asleep without a tv so i pay attention here and delicious food breakfast each morning was a delight and the staff could be nicer the hotel is made up of several different buildings surrounding a sunny courtyard complete with swings dining tables flowering plants and ringing church bells a delight to the senses the location is also amazing yet the area is so quiet you forget you are in the middle of such a large european city the hotel pulitzer marks the first time i have stayed in a bustling metropolis but felt as serene and relaxed as if i were on a remote beach we loved loved loved it and will definitely be back,1
2467,delightful hotel with superb staff and well thought out rooms elegant and in a great district nothing to fault best stay and wonderful breakfast loved every minute and would happily recommend rooms overlooking canals are divine but others overlooking the internal gardens are equally nice quirky artworks and architecture make this a real dutch treat bar was one of the best we visited in amsterdam,1
2468,we loved every minute of our stay the canal houses offer extreme authenticity a true gem perfectly situated and the staff are amazing friendly breakfast is very traditional and caters for everyone,1
2469,love this place very stylish and great service the bar and the restaurant are great take the time to sit outside in the garden if the weather is good cool room interesting artwork great location this place has it all,1
2470,we stayed here for night in july the room was really small with a corridor for a bathroom no bath the shower leaked on the bathroom floor so we needed a towel to stop the floor getting wet small windows very small with a beautiful view of a drain pipe we had to shuffle things around and put things on the floor in order to use the kettle to make a drink on the up side the valet was really helpful allowing us to park on the front whilst checking in we complained about the room and were told that we would not be charged for the mini bar we had only had nuts and pringles but on arriving home they have been charged this was a special treat for my partner the room cost over which i was happy to pay but unfortunately just it did feel like a treat and also did feel like value for money also on the corridor we were on there was a funny smell but there was a sign saying apologies for building work staff were pleasant but overall for a star hotel was really disappointed,0
2471,beautiful and different from many hotels as it has lots of character located in a stylish and relatively quiet spot but an easy walk to the city centre beautiful courtyard garden for enjoying the summer weather but unfortunately often full of smokers room was very quiet with unique canal house features and bathroom spacious and beautiful check in was very good pause bar and cafe lovely but service was at times slow breakfast in jansz restaurant simple but quite nice pulitzer bar full of character and good no iron or ironing board provided in room i consider this a basic provision no matter how glamorous it may be,1
2472,great hotel in a great location with superb service and excellent amenities can not say enough good things about this facility the complimentary breakfast was great with many choices staff was excellent and very personable all spoke excellent english would highly recommend this hotel to anyone,1
2473,truly loved it here from to our room to breakfast and drinks in the bar we felt really special and nothing was ever too much trouble the interior design is urban sophistication but does take itself too seriously an example would be the yellow telephone and the dutch bike hanging from our ceiling lots of curios to delight the senses it is expensive but you know what it was worth it you must go if only to have a naughty negroni in the bar a great birthday weekend in a wonderful location,1
2474,a perfect location a spacious modern room and a beautiful hotel the hotel itself is made up of a variety of buildings all joined together after the fact and all surrounding a central courtyard it takes up an entire city block and it bordered by canals on two sides very pretty and very interesting i would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat,1
2475,this is a great hotel and the perfect location in amsterdam the best canal views and really close to the anne frank house they pay attention to the details someone emailed in advance of our stay asking about our daughter and finding out more about her i unfortunately arrived with no luggage the airlines lost it and they were so welcoming and gave me a little bag with toothbrushes toothpaste razor etc it was really nice and made me feel more comfortable excellent breakfast and and attentive staff all over the hotel i would totally stay here again,1
2476,this hotel is situated close to the action in amsterdam within walking distance to the anne frank house streets and other activities the decor is modern and colorful while paying tribute to being dutch high end finishes particularly in the bathroom amazing shower with marble being set in an old canal house is particularly fun each room has a plaque that tells you about the history of the house great bar as well would highly recommend,1
2477,we spent a few nights recently at this perfectly located hotel easy walk to various museums the nine streets neighbourhood tram cafes etc enjoyed our stay and made better by helpful and friendly staff the decor is lovely it has a beautiful and garden there are outdoor seating to soak in the amsterdam sun book ahead for canal cruise on the classic hotel boat,1
2478,excellent choice for a stay in amsterdam very attentive service excellent location the only reason i did rate it a was that the maid service forgot to clean our room one night it was quickly taken care of when i inquired,1
2479,it is hard to know where to start the place is so good the room was most attractive with fine architectural details the bathroom was very up to date with a most delightful double shower with water coming down from the ceiling the hotel itself is full of interesting spaces fun to be staff were obliging and we found no annoying flaws which so many hotels seem to have the breakfast was the best i have seen any where you can be as health or as decadent is you wish and do go to the bar it is such a cosy space do go for a ride in the hotel boat great way to see the canals,1
2480,top marks for a great hotel in a great location lovely comfortable room make sure you ask for a quiet room if you do want to be on the busy canal side dinner and breakfast in their jansz restaurant were great can recommend the dover sole the first time i spotted this hotel was nearly years ago on our first visit to amsterdam and always hoped that one day we could afford to come and stay here it been great the service has been excellent and the concierge suggestions spot on of where to eat the seafood bar and canal trip the friendship as the hotel boat was full,1
2481,booked this hotel after a friend walked past it and said it looked nice wow is that an understatement gorgeous renovation of connecting canal houses with clever and inspiring interior design would love to spend a rainy day just enjoying interiors luxurious beds and linens plenty of room in the basic king rooms king room bathroom was a stand up shower not much storage space in bathroom but fine interiors a bit dark if you have vision problems but was a problem for in fact every waiter and bartender in amsterdam were personable and fun did not eat at restaurant but thoroughly enjoyed peaceful quiet garden boat tour was only drawback was the concierge nice but so busy they could use concierges service was great in all other areas would stay here every time and wish they had partner hotels in other cities,1
2482,my wife surprised me with nights at the pulitzer a wonderful experience perfect in every way one example they called ahead and asked about our four year old daughter hobbies and preferences as we checked into our room we found a personalised pillow for her they printed a sign with her name and some graphics which was then ironed onto the pillow the only sour note was the one waiter from the patio bar who was slow to get our orders and by the time we had to leave for an external dinner reservation minutes later had still not actually served our can also highly recommend the restaurant,1
2483,such a great hotel the service we got here was amazing after travelling all day checking in to this hotel was so easy and fast i highly recommend staying here its in a great location rooms are great loved this hotel,1
2484,i was not impressed at all with this hotel it is not somewhere you stay as a couple the rooms are tiny the bathrooms are dirty the internet does work unless you sit next to reception and not to mention i was not aware the only way up to any of the rooms is by climbing up ridiculously dangerous stairs the stairs were so steep and you had to go up sets i was never told this and if i had known i would not have stayed here as i have a bad knee this is something that should be advertised in bold and capital letters,0
2485,the staff were lovely and made me feel very welcome a quick and easy check in always very friendly i would highly recommend the hotel to others coming to amsterdam it is near one of the tram stops so very easy to travel around the city and around the corner from the anne frank house,1
2486,we loved our total experience in this charming room tourist hotel in the western end of a building originally built to house royal palace staff plusses location in heart of tourist amsterdam one block from anne frank house views some rooms have balconies and wonderful views of the westermarkt including its historic church rembrandt buried there and street and canal scene room has large balcony a great view is on main floor next to breakfast room room is two floors higher up in the cupola with a very small balcony but relatively large interior and a superb view office staff very helpful and considerate manager could not be nicer minuses no elevator and lots of steep stairs to the main floor and more stairs to the two floors above but note that the staff carries all of your luggage up and down and does not expect a tip for this service rooms are charming but compact with access to double bed from only one side internet wifi unreliable at periods of peak use apparently overwhelmed by too many users tips arrival when your taxi takes you to the hotel you wo see a hotel sign from the street instead go to the door at the hotel address raadhuisstraat and you will see a small hotel sign and a buzzer to ring for entry tips if you want to tip tips are collected in a can in the office and shared with all staff,1
2487,we really enjoyed are stay in hotel nadia we got a room with a balcony rooms are indeed a bit small but everything is very clean stairs are steep but that typical in this kind of building however staff was ready to take our luggage upstairs the staff is very friendly breakfast buffet was ok it a minute walk from the train station but you can also take a tram this hotel has a very good price quality,1
