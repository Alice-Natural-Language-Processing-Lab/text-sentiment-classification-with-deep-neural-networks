0,we visited athens and stayed nights we were a party of adults and children we received lovely large connected rooms the beds were huge and comfy the bathroom was beautiful the hotel seems new and has a modern styling everything went well and the staff were very warm welcoming and helpful the hotel is located on a main street and there were many coffee shops and bakeries in the area across the road there is even a cinema the hotel is located about a minute walk to the acropolis we enjoyed our stay a lot and will recommend it to others,1
1,we booked this hotel on short notice as it came up first on we thought it would be close to town and we could walk to the main attractions as we only had a short stay in athens this was not the case and it was very complicated to get anywhere without a taxi and most of the drivers do not understand english the hotel is situated near a district so that should be taken into consideration very difficult to cross the road as it is a four lane highway out the front with a fence in the midway the hotel is very new but very badly designed and finished off very small lifts to take you to the rooms so it takes two trips if you have a lot of luggage we ordered some food from the restaurant and bought it up to the room unfortunately my food had an eye lash in it generally the staff was very friendly though check in did take some time which i do not really appreciate the hotel finishes and location lets it down i would not recommend or stay here again,0
2,the hotel is brand new but it looks like it was adapted from a business building and they missed some details the staff was very friendly but i believe they need more experience the was free and good but a bit annoying to setup every time you return to the room i found the location just a few minutes walk to some busy areas with restaurants and bars and near business and metro stations,1
3,just recently visited city and i stayed here for with my mom and my two kids for my birthday and i was amazed with this hotel it great service as soon as we walked in the hotel we were welcomed by the staff who were super polite and friendly they took really good care of us and were really proactive the interior decor is top quality with well furnished marble floors my daughters absolutely loved the place and my mum was glad how the beds were set up granted here age she was happy with the comfy bed and how spacious the rooms location is decent and local shops are easy to access good cafes just around the corner wish i stayed,1
4,this was definitely not grand looks nice on the outside but very dirty on the inside this has to be the worst service i have received in greece breakfast was the worst and even when i stayed in cheaper hotels the breakfast was better cutlery and cups were also dirty got abused by the night manager that stunk and needed discinfectant and a bath the managers did care as he is so busy anyway avoid this place,0
5,we had the displeasure of staying at his hot er place you could call it while on a transfer from athens to beirut we had to walk up several flights of stairs and wake the reception guy up so he could check us in he checked us in topless which was in our early expectations of the place the room was cheap and big however the next day we discovered several cockroaches were on the ground beside us when we woke up we had a fan to help air the room but to be honest we were happy to leave the room at any chance we got we were planning to stay there again on our return transfer back to dublin but we cancelled and booked another place which was a lot better avoid if you can unless you are happy sharing with uninvited cockroaches otherwise you love it,0
6,just like the title the hotel is horrible nothing of hotel would be much more a pension dirty sheets and torn floor full of hair employee who does not speak english inserted in street also very dirty,0
7,was shocked at the state of the hotel compared to photos on site all furnishings are run down and broken elevator scary and not worth the wait was happy to climb the stairs there no bed spreads just one thin sheet and a paper thin mattress with a one inch pillow toilet disgusting has seen bleach in what looks like years shower basin too small for my partner to fit in water goes everywhere we where very rudely informed to pay an extra per night for air conditioning which is so loud it sounds like a helicopter landing all night long the cafe is permanently closed no fridge or toiletries no phone or kettle or any ammenities whatsoever in room when i politely asked if there was a share fridge to put drinks because it stinking hot was rudely told no i could sleep due to the noise outside very unsavoury area lots of homeless people and beggars outside all night long it also right next door to a betting venue for more noise in our room there are bed bugs and our view is of a burnt out building next door under no circumstances stay here,0
8,the hotel building looks very nice from outside but not comfortable from floor parket inside the rooms need to be changed every step you make has a different bathrooms are very small their is no air conditioning in the corrdidors it was like a sawna when you walk to reach your old elevators it takes to much time until you catch used too use the stairs instead of waiting for the rude receptionists,0
9,welcoming staff good location pool was a very nice addition since it was degrees in july rooms a bit tired but otherwise all are few good restaurants near by and lovely shopping street breakfast was return again,1
10,i had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend at the beginning of july the hotel staff were very helpful great breakfast amazing bar decor clean and fully stocked rooms with everything you can possibly need for a great time the swimming pool and gym area is out of this world the hotel location is in a beautiful setting with close by bars quality shops and a min walk to the metro i m looking forward to going back and staying at this hotel luxury doesn t even begin to describe how wonderful it is to stay here,1
11,perfect location for business area in the telecom industry but so far away from business world class standards to host important guest for meeting room high standard gourmet meals and on the palace is not so clean and quite for business travelers that regular to hotels,0
12,beautifully located building with restaurants shops and a park close by the rooms remind me of old italian hotels in bologna or parma rooms are spacious airco works well but furniture is somewhat breakfast is basic and smiles are hard to come by,1
13,rooms are old and barely clean but guess what this is no the problem i am a very frequent traveler and i have never seen such an impolite staff i mean all staff from housekeeper till hotel owner manager are way above rude except one guy in the reception they think they are managing a prison they shout at guests and lifeguard scare kids i was booking for nights but i had to leave on the back of a fight with super rude hotel owner i thought it was better to cancel the vacation and not to live with the stress of a bad room managed by impolite people btw pictures on the rooms on website have nothing to do with reality take my word avoid at all cost,0
14,hotel is very clean i booked in the third floor and room was up to the standard it worth every penny paid for staff is the is very helpful from reservation reception waiters and housekeeping breakfast was good and pool bar very professional towels and bed sheet are very clean free beach towel available also,1
15,the hotel was reasonable the rooms on higher floors have a nice view on the sea the rooms were shabby but properly cleaned the breakfast was not wow a small hotel located at walking distance from glyfada center,1
16,first of all i would not rate this as four star especially as the pool was closed for alll of our night stay hotel is situated overlooking the sea with beautiful view if you can overlook the busy road which separates hotel from beach rooms and breakfast were fine and the staff extremely helpful especially alexandra on the front desk the best thing about this hotel is if you use it to stay it took us just under an hour to get from our room taxi ride check in and into our stateroom on board maybe we just st had a good run but would definitely recommend it to other cruisers,1
18,first the positives very clean hotel and beautifully reception that it goes down worst quality breakfast we have had in an hotel and we travel only went in there twice during our day stay and the best we could manage was some melon a toasted croissant with a cup of lukewarm boiled eggs some strange mix of egg and tomato that looked terrible what was described as peach compote was tinned fruit cocktail with a very funny colour supervised by the most unfriendly and rude attitude was could go on and rooms were on the side of a very noisy gentlemans club pool only has sunbeds and when we went at it was closed off rooms and balcony very would not recommend glyfada much nicer down the the palmyra hotel,0
19,booked this based on the beautiful best western we used in london nothing like it do trust brand name terrible area did feel save old shabby hotel no help with luggage up to room smallest bathroom i ever experienced only thing that was okay was the breakfast wo be back there,0
20,i booked six weeks ahead made sure that i communicate our needs by email twin beds two single and good view non smoking arrived late in the evening checked in but was shocked with the room so smelly double bed no view the street was so dirty with the same price rate you can rent better rooms in the same area omonia square such as chic hotel dorian inn hotel,0
22,my mother and i chose this hotel for the end of our athens trip due to the price the hotel itself was fine very courteous and helpful staff moderately comfortable mattresses clean room the room was very much no frills with tile floor throughout and a miniature bathroom this being said location of this hotel is in a very unsafe block of town it is fairly close to a main street but i would never walk down those streets in the night and was uncomfortable in the day the closest underground metro station omonia is the most dangerous in athens we did know this about the area talking to many locals in restaurants and uber drivers confirmed how unsafe this area is if this hotel were transplanted to a safer street it would be the perfect basic affordable hotel however based on the location we do not recommend,0
23,this is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at from entering the lobby the first thing that hots you is the horrific smell the entire hotel smells like sewage and mold if you have the fortune to be in a room with an ocean view you will not be able to sleep because of the noise from the street below we had to by earplugs to be able to get at least a bit of sleep it is very dirty in the rooms the last day the cleaning lady did bother to enter out room in order to take a shower you have to enter the bathroom without inhaling thought the nose the toilet seat was the price of a night we did want you go into the hotel if there were any free rooms anywhere else we would have changed the hotel but unfortunately in july everything in athens is booked,0
25,location was kind of bad the area around the hotel was not good a lot of homeless people guys taking drugs i did feel safe metro was near by room was bit noisy in the shower you got only super hot water when it was hot outside and super cold when it was bit cold outside so it was inpossible to take shower service was good,0
26,the odeon is a small but nice hotel my room was small but clean the hotel has a good buffet breakfast included and a reasonably priced bar on the ground floor i stayed for nights my room was very quiet except for a am fire alarm which was evidently a false alarm and only stayed on for a minute or so despite the fact that the neighborhood is festooned with graffiti i never felt uncomfortable on the streets the hotel is close to omonia square a short walk from excellent dining and the ancient agora of athens and a medium walk to the archeological museum staff is friendly and rates are reasonable,1
28,stayed overnight in this wee hotel in athens is in the omonia area of athens convenient for the subway and a short walk to the famous omonia square one part was a bit shady but the rest of the area was fine like any huge just be sensible do be out and about late at night perfectly fine during the day hotel itself was brilliant value we had a room and breakfast for breakfast was a bit spartan continental but was rooms are painted in weird colours but are lovely and clean and the bathroom is tiny but really well thought out with everything you need we loved the quirkiness of this little place you could stay more than a couple of days there i think or the lack of space might get to you but brilliant for an liked this wee place and the reception staff were just expect beautiful views from your it in the middle of athens and not very but within walking distance to the acropolis etc,1
29,the highlight of this place was to stay on the top floor and when we looked out of the window we saw the acropolis fantastic experience i loved the location as it was very near the centre the price was reasonable i would pay more attention to the quality of breakfast if i were them,1
30,thank you very much for accommodating us and for providing my baby a place to sleep very nice staff unique hotel with beautiful decor good food and very clean love from america and fellow greeks from ellada panawiota stavros baby stavroschristina and dimitrios,1
31,staff speak good english and spanish they are nice a lift in case you are on the floor in the room set up for always but good cleaning every day such a helpful and caring cleaning lady good value for money perfect for backpackers and travelers on budget we felt comfortable and safe good breakfast without fruits quiet hotel omonia is said to be dangerous but not it looks less cared for but there are some amazing cafés and pastry shops,1
33,the guy that runs reception at night is incredibly rude for no reason the rooms are pokey and the bathrooms tiny the wifi does not work at all they told me you ca connect if too many people try to access it at one time but there a separate router on each floor servicing about rooms each so that nonsense,0
34,great place helpful and friendly staff especially at the reception the lady at the rooftop bar was amazing and helpful and you could clearly see she enjoyed her job the rooms were clean and comfortable pool was small recommend this especially for the young travellers as the rooftop was buzzing till early variety for breakfast would definitely recommend to travellers and especially young travellers who would like to meet other young travellers from around the world thank you for our comfortable stay,1
35,stayed here many times and was more than happy until latest stay made a friendly advice to staff that the toaster did work and was asked standards are slipping i will stay elsewhere there a many hotels in this price range with good srvice,1
38,the staff were extremely warm and room was pleasant and clean and was also cleaned free continental breakfast was simple but hotel is located just off of omonia square which seems to attract a rough and seedy wouldnt recommend going out late at night there are plenty of eateries located near by which served nice food thats also cheap the metro is located two minutes away with easy access to the acropolis and other sites,1
39,booked this place on hostelworld so i was expecting it too be more like a hostel than a hotel there was so social area to get to meet people and half the time my room was empty the shower was really temperamental temperature wise and the water ended up flooding the bathroom floor the light is so dim you practically have to shower in the dark two bunks crammed into the tiniest room and the wifi did work at the very top floor which was where i was also did feel safe walking through the square and outside the hotel there were so many men just lurking around cat calling me i felt very uncomfortable,0
40,well the rooms are superb and the air con is awesome for athens hot and dry summer also the staff in reception is very helpful but all these became a distant memory very soon after i entered my room i only stopped for hours to get some rest from a long ferry journey as i was catching a flight to holland and within minutes of settling into my room the lady cleaner did her best and all sorts to keep me and am sure other hotel guests awake do know where to start from but here as some of the noise some events that i heard from outside my room vacuuming next to my room and above me buckets loads of water being dropped for mopping cleaning cupboards being opened up and closed at least times the lift which is not the quietest to put it mildly must have been used for the cleaner at least times going up and down plastic bags being shuffled doors opening and closing for several times toilet seats being rigorously hit against the toilet base objects being dropped without care who sleeps in the hotel iam sure i was not the only one that was kept awake its only a small hotel for gods sake with probably around so why the f all this noise in the middle of the night will the queen of sheba arrive by any chance want a full refund and an apology for the inconvenience caused,0
41,felt very comfortable and the staff are perfect thank you all for a great stay walking distance to most destinations friendly encounters at almost every location neighborhood looks scary but is quite nice around lycabettus efcaristo,1
42,we stayed for nights and had a wonderful stay serge at reception was very friendly and gave us useful information the room had a jacuzzi however the bubbles did work but it was still romantic we had the choice to get breakfast at the room or downstairs sharing a table with other guests we did both options we also had free wifi and to min walk to the station but the area felt quite safe at all times not suitable for kids i would say mainly as this is more suitable for couples on a romantic break we did hear any dodgy sounds from other rooms,1
43,after traveling around for days this was very comfortable stay i slept very well and the rooms were very nice and clean they have a great breakfast buffet even though it was very crowed it few blocks walk to and from the metro but content location i was very happy with my stay,1
44,breakfast ok however too many guests which meant that we had to eat it in a conference room on plastic foldable chairs since no tables were available pool and rooftop is nice allthough small and over crowded restaurant overpriced the staff in the restaurant and by the pool were the most rude i have ever encountered apart from a man called dimitrios that was very service minded not interested to take orders when instead walking to the bar to order i was told to sit down and wait for a colleague that never came the last day we were asked to pay to use the pool since we were not allowed to be in the hotel after our check out even though we arrived late and planned to leave late the hotel in general needs an update and the room was old and smelled like mold,0
45,the hotel was very nice and the staff were helpful and courteous the rooftop was amazing and spectacular views the hotel was a little far from the sightseeing places but we took taxi and were very cheap the only thing i did not like is that they do have wifi in the rooms only in designated areas of the hotel which was annoying,1
47,we picked this hotel over another athens hotel because it had dedicated parking and a pool we arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there i was not happy however the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage he was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our got up to our rooms needed to book because of our big family to find twins bed pushed together in each room not the best but it worked the furniture is dated the tvs are ancient smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain it is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere to top it off they charge euro a day for internet access in the room and that is only for devices probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area they have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar however it is a very small pool area it is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground so you can hardly walk around the pool we arrived at the first day at knowing it closes at with kids in tow the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have mins to swim so we should come back tomorrow well my kids were,0
48,i stayed in that appartment because my company sent me is good because you can take metro and reach city centre and acopoli in less then minutes with for ticket employees very kindly and can give give good informations internet connection good and air conditioning bad thing is the barely accettable condition of fornitures carpets wallpaper ceiling kitchen curtains the staff do its best to keep at least clean the room but i can not understand fornitures years old price for the room space is good but i prefer having one fourth of the space in a room of this century,0
49,good basic hotel smallish room but enough room for my luggage and with an ensuite worked well which was needed as the days peaked at is very good with a short walk to the main attractions including metro station when arriving from the airport,1
50,everipidou street is located very close to monastiraki square the room has all the essencials including air conditioner witch is the more important quality in an athens hostel room in the what we paid the room was very good and i would rent it again and recomend it to someone else who planning an affordable central stay in is very nice and they even carried our bags to our room at when we arrived that was very nice of him and very apreciated,1
52,very pleasant hotel staff are brilliant and extremely helpful old hotel but very clean and well maintained tram stop opposite to town and tickets are available from reception recommend highly for mid budget travel some noise from main road but insulation is good,1
53,this hotel is very convenient to explore the center of athens very up to date in its technology tablet in the room from which you control everything while you are lying on bed lights blinds temperature etc and a large screen smart tv the furniture is brand new and stylish staff is friendly and very helpful for sure i visit again,1
54,highly room was great wooden floors so no hotel carpet internet easy password no space for two so both can get online without a and normal shower excellent for weary size bed with headboards against one wall too a really nice more than a bedroom touch makes the bed into a leisure area we did watch the tv but there a huge to ceiling window the place has a bit of a japanese feel but in no way the windows do can control mood lights and temp from a tablet if you want yes it all works or there are switches on the definitely be back it a dream to have found this place on a budget,1
55,i stayed in hotel moka from june the to june the its a decent hotel it has a lift the reception is open hours also theres a small fridge that sells of beer the staff were ok the room itself was big with an screen tv i only paid euros for nights so it was ok pricewise would i go back yea i would go back the area was a little shabby with up shops fly posters but the hotel was alright the main square syntagma was only around mins walking time from the hotel,1
56,good location and room for the money if you expecting something super ritzy maybe reconsider it was clean the air conditioner worked well i did have any issues with noise level and i found the staff to be very helpful well located in proximity to omonoia station,1
57,good location to get to metro and sights room was renovated but still basic hotel has few facilities but wo matter if you not spending alot of time at hotel get a room with balcony for extending the size of the room not so much for view employees very friendly and helpful bars and restaurants in area around hotel not so touristy which was fine i would stay here again but would like corner room with balcony on floor,1
58,the staff is professional and is always a pleasure to stay pool area is truly an oasis after a long day in athens when stopping in athens we go have been staying from the year like the area because we can walk to glyfada where you can find restaurants and shopping,1
59,next to the most famous street of glyfada with a nice swimming pool there is the hotel oasis you can choose it for couples families or for a business trip there is also a conference center you will be very satisfied from the service and the nice staff excellent choice nice n clean with a large swimming pool also you can walk and go to the beach but the water there is very clean so stay to the pool or take a bus for varkiza beach resort,1
60,my husband and i just returned july from a one month vacation our base was oasis hotel the hotel is spotless the rooms very comfortable and clean the staff from management to waiters and any other position go out of their way to make you feel relaxed and comfortable most any request will be met the food is delicious breakfast usually included beach across the street glyfada square about minute walk where you will find many restaurants and anything else you might require the tram is across the street and busses at corner we have stayed at this hotel on previous years and when we go back it will be our base again all employees treat each other like family and the hotel guests are also treated in the same manner we would like to thank them all for the hospitality i not going to mention names as they are all fantastic ευχαριστούμε,1
61,the night before we were supposed to go to a wedding a large party was happening on the ground floor we were on floor at midnight the music started it was so loud our room was vibrating we called down to reception times but nothing was done at we went down to reception and finally managed to get moved to a higher floor it did help much when checking out we requested a discount the reception staff were rude and point blank refused saying it was there fault they then threatened to call the police if we did pay i do understand why this hotel thought it would be a good idea to put families and people who had a wedding the next day right above a party that does end until from the other side of the hotel the party could be heard the refurbished rooms are grubby at best and most of the hotel has tired carpets plaster hanging off the walls and looks a bit old and well used only saving grace the pool was nice but the chairs are grubby,0
62,said it was four star hotel got given key went to room was cleaned from previous people beds not made breakfast stuff still there went to reception got given another room sat on bed went through the bottom of it as slat was broken went down again to reception got moved again to the most disgusting place i have ever had to sleep they said they had know other room available we asked for a double and got twin room even the first room was a twin when we got the the room there was a kettle bathroom was dirty the carpets we dirty and air conditioning did work the male receptionist could not give a hoot and was put out by the fact we had been down down to the pool got lunch at the restaurant by the pool side which was expensive and the very last straw was in the middle of the meal the waiter stopped us eating as he wanted us to unprofessional hotel who does put the of their customers,0
63,a very well kept property conveniently located in northern athens super easy access and amazing service the staff very friendly and courteous as well i would definitely recommend to all my friends,1
65,although the price of the hotel may seem cheap compared to others in the area and the pictures and description say it has been renovated do be fooled arrived at the hotel earlier than the standard check in time and were told that the room was not ready which was fine as we were early so went out and returned to the hotel about an hour and half later waited for another ten minutes and then received the keys to our room well the supposedly recently renovated rooms did seem to apply to ours the stench of smoke was disgusting the carpets were stained the shower which was supposed to be held over the bath was falling out the wall so you had to hold it and whenever you tried to have a shower the bath leaked all over the floor the air con may as well have been non existent and not to mention the bedbugs we found within hours of being in the room staff were extremely rude whenever asked for help the only thing half decent was the wifi a number of doors were left open to other rooms in the hotel all of which again did not look like they had been renovated at all how on earth other people have rated this hotel above a is beyond me i would avoid at all costs certainly do not recommend,0
66,exarchia is a area and a bit rough in central athens the hotel is situated close to exarchia square where you can some fast food joints restaurants and bars rooms a simple but clean in total it a rally good budget alternative,1
68,photos on booking sites are thought it will be a good deal given the price but then i understood why upon arrival furniture and all decor needs to be changed if it is to be called staff was very polite and helpful though position is quite good too,0
71,the room i got had a beautiful view of the acropolis but the air conditioner did not work and it was a very hot night luckily i only needed one night because i was leaving to the islands the next day the hotel is outdated and the towels looked old and overused like everything else you get what you pay for the location of this place is a plus thought it close to plaka and monastiraki the area is safe and it has a lot of restaurants at walking distance,0
73,i checked in my first day in athens before leaving on a week long drive through northern greece and booked a room for july and was assigned room a premium room it was mediocre at best but for one night did not mind it upon my return i had also booked a night august for one night also a premium room and was given room i had booked both nights before leaving on the trip room was substandard to say the least dirty and frayed curtains bad causing around sink old shower head was probably from the original construction low water pressure when i checked out and printed these out to the desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and ignored me i surprised this hotel still has it best western affiliation if it does i bet that room was not inspected,0
74,arrived at the hotel at only to be told that our room was not booked even though we had received a confirmation email and phone call our room was clearly given to someone else do not stay here i would also like to mention that the photos are deceiving,0
75,location right in the center of athens staff is nice rooms are nice in size breakfast is small but there a little of everything a little noisy inside the hotel as i have been woke up a few times beds a little hard and would be nice to have at least two pillows instead of one wifi is very unstable rooms wold deserve a little refresh a good value for money hotel,1
76,although we had booked a room for nights through email and a phone call to confirm our booking we arrived and to our disappointment there were no rooms available because clearly they had overbooked the hotel they blamed one of their employees who apparently was fired but somehow had managed to book us a room and confirm it excuses let me mention that the room was somehow booked for the next nights after our arrival whereas by email we had agreed other dates,0
77,the best thing about hotel niki is it location to tour ancient athens it is more than adequate it did have some repairs that cropped up but handled well it very good that they have capable and patient front desk staff and a maintenance guy on call day and night to deal with things we had to move to another room but effie was extremely helpful as was the maintenance man and the cleaning staff person all that made it very tolerable to stay there the cleaning staff keeps things nice and clean the breakfast is a full buffet of choices with the traditional fresh tomatoes feta and black olives and greek pastries anastasia the lady tending the breakfast was fun to talk to tip her she works hard effie at reception desk really went above and beyond to help us with changing reservations giving us two favorite places to eat helping us get our room problems solved and arranging coffee and early breakfast item when we had to catch a very early flight i recommend this place for all of these reasons,1
78,awesome location next to omania square where you can get in all the tourist buses the staff are so lovely and provide you with great restaurant recommendations the rooms are clean and spacious one downside is the size of the shower i made the mistake of turning around to wash my hair and knocked the tap to hot there also a lift for those staying on higher floors would definitely come back,1
79,we booked this hotel based on proximity to metro station although it looks close on the map it is actually not that easy to walk to with suitcases the room was terrible dingy curtains half falling off the tracks outlook onto dusty abandoned building the bed was hard the pillows flat worst of all though was the fact that the walls are paper thin we could hear every word from next door especially when they broke into a fight care factor zero from night manager it is in a really dodgy area with lots of homeless people in the street on the positive side the bathroom was clean way over priced for the standard of the room would recommend not staying at this hotel,0
80,location is very good and easy to visit interesting spots on food entrance of hotel is very nice and staff is super friendly and helpful rooms are basic but all clean and in good state for sure a hotel where i will be back as i travel several times a year to athens for business,1
81,i originally booked here for nights because of the reasonable price i ended up staying for a week the staff were all very friendly and efficient it nice to come back to your hotel and be greeted with a friendly smile and recognition rooms are simple clean and comfortable i was too keen on the breakfast but it was still neighbourhood is a little rundown but i always felt safe close to omonia square metro buses etc so convenient for getting stay at the hotel again when i return from the islands i plan to stay again,1
82,i actually quite baffled as to why this place is only classed as a hotel i stayed in places in the uk which were noticeably inferior to this the bedrooms are clean and spacious the breakfasts cater for pretty much all culinary preferences the bar is and operates whilst the owner christos goes out of his way to be helpful and accommodating to all his guests including solo travellers like myself not only that for seven nights is far better value than you find in most european capital cities including london i suppose that if i had to include one criticism it that the location is a little far from the city centre but it also close to the port of piraeus which makes it ideal for ferry trips to the surrounding islands and buses to syntagma square are frequent and very inexpensive,1
83,highly recommend everything is great it minute walk from the centre shops and restaurants and minute from the beach there is a direct bus from the airport that has a station right infront of the hotel so you do have to walk a lot workers in the hotel are super nice and helpful,1
84,nice and quite comfort place to rest days ground floor looks a bit old staff is not very handy and helpfull just what we some old hotels swimming pool helps in refreshing we stayed there nights just to rest a bit between sailing and driving around greece good place for such in a range of short walk there is commercial district with some nice tasty restaurants pubs and shops nice suburbs with a tram line to heart of athens,1
85,this hotel should be investigated by the tourist bureau in athens if one thing made me rethink my affection for greece would be this hotel by its staff anyone that has children should think twice before booking here as you may be find surprises,0
86,undoubtedly the worst hotel experience i have had room first on the left after exiting the booked paid for and had written confirmation double room with room measured sq x no balcony of course squalid would be the best was provided the accom i had booked for the following nights no apology and no can such accomodatiion meet any building rules how can the greek tourist regulators tolerate this when i said i was not accepting it i was told it was all that was available that night and i was given,0
87,this is a hotel that meets your needs it clean safe quiet and cool it simple so do expect frills but at the price point and location it totally worth it the neighborhood is gorgeous and the location is perfect,1
88,we recently stayed at hotel phidias and specifically chose this hotel as it was very close to the port of piraeus we need to catch a ferry to milos upon arrival katherina at the from desk greeted us with extreme friendliness she struck up conversations with my and year olds immediately she is was certainly a breath of fresh air after hours of travel our room was very comfortable but a little small for a family of the bathroom was also small but extremely clean the hotel offers a free shuttle service around the piraeus area they took us to the port its a short walk to the main town from the hotel where you will find supermarkets restaurants clothing stores etc,1
89,according to travel blogs and statements metaxourgio not that safe and you have to be careful at night well if you consider couple of balkanian travel agencies few abandoned buildings and some closed down stores than yes but metaxourgio my experience of days and has proven that it is an ok area and actually quiet and cosmos is located few hundred meters from the metro station in a tree lined quiet street across the street is the beautiful but abandoned building of hotel is a star hotel and provides you exactly what star deserves hotel is from the including the furniture lighting and fixtures but clean so are the are no frills everything basic and functional it is a very cheap hotel and you are metro stop away from the centre or minutes at the reception helpful there are bars coffe shops and restaurants an excellent price what else do you need karaca b from constantinople,1
90,we stayed nights in this hotel everything was fine the quality price ratio is pretty good the room is big enough and cosy air conditioning in the room perfect the only thing is that the cleaning staff make some noise in the morning while moving the furnitures underground not far from the hotel,1
91,hotel cosmos is a hotel which is located quite central in athens the room was basic but clean takes you minutes walking to many main attractions and the metro is min walking from the hotel hotel staff was friendly and welcoming despite the central location the neighborhood of the hotel is not the best especially at night you should take care as streets hardly have lights and you meet strange people apart from this recommendable for a short stay days,1
97,the hotel is a little far from downtown athens but it accessible by public transportation it a pretty little hotel with clean bathrooms and facilities with one exception they do not maintain their wifi when i checked in they warned me that if i needed to use the wifi in the evening i could sit in the lobby the desk attendant would mind but there was only one couch by the wifi on every floor was too slow to even check in for my flight so i had to sit in the lobby this was not well advertised and if you travel alone or care about using the internet i do not recommend it,1
98,the only good thing about this hotel is its location rooms are very small and becomes congested if you have even a little luggage very few options for breakfast wifi was bad especially in the floor,0
99,bit grungey but great location great price run by great friendly people i would recommend this place for or days stay just around the corner from great bars and restaurants walking distance to main shopping and main museums and attractions,1
100,we were given a room here after we were unable to stay at another hotel we previously booked at there were only of us but we were given a family room for the price of a double room with breakfast included for less than what we would have paid at the other hotel location is good only minutes walk to the metro at monastiraki the building is rather old but in reasonable condition the highlight is the old timey elevator room was quite good only downside was that it was not very sound proof wifi was very slow sometimes unusable one of the guys at the front desk whose name i ca remember was very friendly and offered suggestions for things to do around athens and greece the other staff were friendly too but did say not perfect but pretty good for the price,1
101,cecil is a low cost hotel in a very convenient area great location and value for money room is good size bathroom is compact but functional the room is very quiet even though we were facing the street and also very clean breakfast was very good as wellwe were fortunate to have a view of the acropolis from the balcony and hotel also has a view from the roof top although no facilities on the roof top the staff as also friendly may not appear that way to start but they are friendly when engaged location the right is the plaka and to the left are the food markets amazing fresh fruit and olives and cheese also antique shops overflowing with everything from chinese bowls to crystal vases to brass statues a homeware shoppers paradise,1
102,terrible do know where to start cheaply decorated tiny room and even smaller bathroom morning man on reception is by no means but not rude like the grumpy old man in the afternoon evening we never been spoken to in such a rude abrasive manner the only decent thing was the balcony,0
103,i agree with most of the previous reviews here in that this is an extravagant stay by any sense but if you are looking for a clean and comfortable home base while you explore the city it great bang for your buck we found staff pleasant and the breakfast with a great view of the acropolis was a real treat in the morning the location also cant be beat if you want to be near the only suggestions for improvement given what it is is we agree the air conditioning was spotty and there were times we were way too hot some more protein options at breakfast would be nice also,1
104,my friends and i stayed at adonis hotel for nights the room was clean and fit of us just fine the staff are all kind and are always attentive the bar upstairs has good drinks and a nice view of the acropolis my only issue there was only one powerpoint for of us which was hard but that is definitely not a deal breaker the location is also perfect minute walk to the acropolis and minutes to heaps of restaurants and market stalls,1
105,my friends and i had the most amazing experience with the lovely owner manager of this hotel we found out on arrival that our booking had been cancelled because of an expired credit card and were worried we would be turned away not only were we offered rooms instead of at the same price she was able to provide us with all the information we needed about transport laundry services and where to eat and drink she was able to organise a taxi for us for the following morning and extended check out so we could go straight to the airport we had such a great experience and she was incredibly warm and genuine with us the rooms were clean and spacious and the aircon worked well not a single complaint for this hotel,1
106,i booked this hotel at at night and checked in minutes later due to my other hotel being really average i chose this hotel because of the location it is a few minutes walk from the main shopping street buses train a girl travelling on her own it is a great hotel because of it location i would stay here again the staff and cleaning staff are really friendly and very helpful breakfast is included which is good it nothing special but it fine i have been having fruit and yogurt because it gluten free but there a lot of other is an amazing absinthe bar across the road down a lane way full of locals which is great the bed in the hotel was not good at all i could feel every spring having a terrible bed in a hotel is the worst because after a long day of walking and sightseeing you want to have a good sleep these beds do allow that the pillow was fine very spacious room with a large window bathroom is fine everything works they give you fresh sheets every day and mop the floor so it is very clean no kettle i thought that was unusual i like to make tea in my full length mirror aircon was great wifi works best at the door and the window i stay here again but the beds really let this place down if you love a comfortable bed then you might want to look,1
107,the hotel is conveniently located near syntagma and very near to the streets where university students and young people gather for pubs live music and easy going movida greek the hotel is part of an existing building the rooms are small but comfortables and they also have small balconies staff is helpful and prices are convenient the main advantage it offers is the location and easy fo access to all public transport to and from the airport at any time of the day and or night in syntagma square,1
109,achilleas has the perfect location for a tourist exploring athens it is just to minute walk from syntagma square and in walking distance of most of the highlights of the city we stayed for nights with our year old daughter and grown up daughter and never needed to take public transport there is a fair bit of graffiti in the area around the hotel and in athens in general however this is not gang related and we never felt in any kind of physical danger in the area at all our experience was excellent the hotel is run efficiently and has excellent front desk staff they give good advice and are helpful the hotel is clean and well organised there is a lift good for heavy suitcases breakfast was included in our rate and we found it to be excellent with a pretty good variety we had no complaints about our room and bathroom my only complaint was that there was no electric kettle however one could go to reception with a cup and teabag anytime and get boiling water,1
110,i came to athens without a hotel reservation took a chance on having someone at the airport arrange a stay for me at this place very happy i did the hotel is very clean very i checked every corner of the room so did a good from which to base my opinion you can definitely get a good rest here hot water and computer in lobby if you need it complimentary breakfast too which i unfortunately missed i got what i paid for if you are not sure where to go this is an awesome choice to book and you wo have to worry staff was also very helpful very friendly that was my experience anyway glad i wound up here for my short stay in athens,1
111,if your main priorities are getting an excellent location without having to pay much then this is for you it just a short walk away from monastiraki station and a number of the ancient sites and is surrounded by places to eat the price was amazing but the facilities were basic i had a private room with shared bathroom but the walls were and did block out any street noise there were some opaque windows for light but no view to be had but if all you after is a place to sleep at night it does the job and i no complaints,0
112,stars for perfect location for serviceminded staff for a few days of sightseeing this place is great very basic features good clean rooms with aircondition for warm nights location is amazing as you have a central base to explore athens from staff is friendly and helpful and available something that was very important as we checked in at am overall great place to leave your things as you explore athens during the day and to rest during the night dont expect a fancy room youre not meant to relax in your room all day at this hotel,1
113,the staff there are really nice they helped me to get cash after i lost my wallet also the location is perfect just three minutes walk to subway station it really enjoyable to walk around rooms have air conditioners so the temperature is not a problem for this hotel,1
114,very convenient and clean budget hotel in the heart of athens stuff is very friendly room was clean and had very fast wifi had a great stay at tempi hotel all nice sightseeing spots like the akropolis plaka and monastiraki are very close to reach by walking,1
115,wagalis was the name of our server he was quiye friendly and made us feel very comfortable he suggested us some unique drinks and good experience i will not rate the view so much as the area did not seem to have a pleasant scenario,1
116,best about this hotel is its rooftop bar and restaurant with a view of the acropolis staff is extremely friendly and service minded rooms are small but hey who wants to stay in his hotel room in a town like athens,1
117,the location was perfect just between syntegma square and plaka very easy to walk to everything in central athens room was small but comfortable and clean good sleep quality even during the day staff were nice expedited room cleaning so that we could check in early and loaned us an umbrella for the unseasonable rain only potential con to be aware of is that the shower is very small it was fine for us but my husband is and only just managed,1
118,was a nice hotel the breakfast was yummy and our newly renovated room was good could use a shower screen because water goes everywhere air con was great and the staff were lovely even arranged breakfast for us at on the morning we were leaving if your coming to athens great place to stay only downfall is the neighbourhood is abit rough,1
120,cons double bed smaller than bathroom could not literally fit people at the same time only two power outlets and shower gel was in individual paquets air conditioning was controlled by the front desk and therefore you can not chnage the temperature as you wish quality of the breakfast is mediocre the room soundproofing is great pros great location minute walk from the nearest metro station which has buses and metros straight to the airport ton of restaurants and shops nearby the view from the breakfast area to the acropolis was great as well,0
122,this property is very unassuming conservative in decor with very basic furniture but it makes up with a magnificent view and the friendliness of the staff who will do anything to accommodate hotel is located about minutes from the airport it also offers a breakfast buffet very basic but serves the purpose i had a room on the third floor overlooking the water which glimmered with many shades of blue although the room has air conditioning if you open the balcony door a subtle breeze comes through with the sound of waves they also coordinated the shuttle transport from the airport i will certainly consider this hotel again,1
123,although this hotel is a little dated the kindness and generosity of the staff made it one of my favorite hotel stopovers ever on the edge of the sea fabulous view lovely clean salt water swimming pool spacious value for be back again,1
124,this is the worst hotel i have stayed in all my life we got a room in the basement without any windows is that even legal it sas incredibly small dirty and had a shady look all over stay clear of this hotel if you going to athens this experience was embarrasing,0
125,a small hotel located in a quiet and safe neighbourhood very good staff friendly and professional with perfect english we felt very welcome here we were lucky to get a comfortable triple room with a very spacious and nice balcony air con was ice cold and room had a fridge too walking distance to all the sites and hour reception to welcome you back at the end of a long day sight seeing a fantastic cafe called kekkos just round the corner i would be back to this hotel in a flash if returning to athens,1
127,we stayed here nights over two rooms the rooms were fine although one had a musty smell that room also had some noise from adjoining rooms my right i was quiet and clean it is very close to the parliament building so we easily saw the changing of the guards and it is a short walk to the plaka area it is an easy walk to the acropolis too as long as you do get lost in the winding streets the top floors have a good view of the acropolis breakfast is up there on the floor i would say suggest booking the floors to if you want a room view the lower floors have terrible views fortunately for me i do not travel to sit in a room and look outside i am only there at night and do mot care,1
128,hubby and l stayed here nights location is superb staff were friendly and quite helpful dealing with our missed baggage breakfast is on the rooftop with views of the acropolis decent selection of food choices cereals cold cuts fruit yoghurt eggs bacon and potatoes and sweet pastry good enough for us had the rooms been modernised we would have rated it higher but l know other cruise travellers stayed at much higher rated hotels and were not in such a great location and felt less inclined to wander out at night we hsd no problem with that being so central a short walk to hop bus shopping cafes and restaurants the plaka district etc,1
129,we stayed for nights and from the moment we arrived we felt at home staff were wonderful rooms were comfortable yes it a bit dated but for the price you pay and for city hotel you vast complain location next to plaka and in walking distance to the acropolis and museums what more can you ask for will definitely be returning we stayed on the floor with views of the acropolis from our balcony,1
130,a comfortable hotel with good facilities clean and accommodating the area surrounding the hotel was alive with restaurants cafes shops transport and attractions the double bed was actually single beds put together and was a little hard the restaurant area had great views of the acropolis breakfast was ok,1
131,spent nights at the astor which is located in the historic area for us just perfect as we like to walk and explore and we certainly did close to everything and offers guests breathtaking views of the parthenon and acropolis hill from its rooftop open area the rooms are modest very clean and are wonderful and helpful and speak perfect is on the rooftop menu is simple fresh food in the panoramic restaurant you can enjoy drinks and a bite to eat in the panoramic rooftop restaurant and open area for lunch and dinner great place to unwind after a hard day exploring and shopping mihali michael will look after your drink order and also guide you to what to see whilst in athens,1
132,most welcoming and helpful staff lovely room stylishly designed varied breakfast buffet but food to transport hub many restaurants in the neighbouring wifi safe in room,1
133,i agree with all the positive reviews this hotel has the following positives great location easy walking distance to all the main attractions of athens central city which is handy for a short stay great value for money normally accommodation in such a good location would cost or times as much great staff who are helpful and friendly and professional good adequate breakfast property may be a bit old but is very clean comfortable and well maintained with basic inclusions in good working order mini fridge tv free wifi negatives room is small for more than people we are a family of and once the bed is out not much room for suitcases but this was a problem for us as we were only staying for night if staying for a longer period i would book rooms next time for a family of and it would be perfect and still affordable i would stay here again if i return to athens and i will be recommending this place to others,1
135,my wife and me have spent our honeymoon at this were happy that the hotel looks great the staff was very friendly and helpful from the first room has view to the room was nice there waited us as present a bottle of wine and some air conditioner was cleaned the room every breakfast was swedish buffet with plenty of food some were changed every ate dinner once from buffet with once from the menu both were delicious and plenty aswell and good bus stop tram stop are at min walk the centre of athens is at min with across the road there is shell gas station where you can buy something if you beach is public and it was clean and not single minus is the many cars that are going by on the main road whole day but that is not the hotels fault,1
136,we were in athens for a few days and spend our stay at this hotel it was very clean and comfortable staff very helpful and friendly breakfast included and had a good choice help yourself buffet and plenty of food orange juice and coffee very disappointing both from machines and orange was not fresh juice more like squash coffee dreadful good buffet for evening meals euros good value but we ate out as there was so much choice took the tram five stops to glyfada and lots of lovely restaurants there five stops towards athens syntagma a lovely beach restaurant there are two there we went to the first one on left looking at the beach it was fab food delicious value very good lovely setting overall would really recommend the hotel the pool is very nice really good and the beach is across the road from the hotel the bus from the airport stops right outside the hotel although there is a very busy and dangerous road to cross when arriving we did it with three children and lots of luggage bus stops on the same side of the road when leaving and runs hours every mins mins journey for a few euros tram stops outside hotel easy to get to athens and the opposite way also,1
137,we stayed for nights end july and would recommend the hotel highly the hotel is very central and a few minutes walk from the ambelokipi metro station on the blue line syntagma square and monastraki are a couple of stops along the blue line and also the airport is on the same line which is very convenient also it is important to say that the hotel is in an area which is extremely safe we were given room number which is on the top floor and was a lovely large room with a very comfortable double bed and two sets of french doors leading out on to a shared balcony a couple of things about the facility in the room the bath towels were beautifully thick and large and the hair dryer in the bathroom was extremely efficient unlike other hotels where you often get a pathetic air flow the french doors have silky net curtains which looked lovely and clean so i could resist smelling them and they were absolutely clean and fresh which is something that is always and i mean always overlooked in every hotel i stayed in the staff were lovely and friendly and very helpful with queries and booking of taxi the breakfast is continental style but does have hot food if you like it scrambled eggs slices of omelette and bacon and sausage the waiter in the restaurant was lovely and very friendly and efficient all in all we could not fault the hotel,1
138,i was there for two nights before exploring other parts of greece in those two nights the staff really made my stay comfortable and enjoyable the hotel is located about mins from the parliament there are plenty of restaurants and bars around the hotel to relax after a full days of sight seeing,1
140,let me start by reflecting on some of the reviews i read about this hotel before booking is a nice quiet hotel that is situated close to the metro which makes it good for exploring the city rooms are a good size and have all the necessary amenities you would look for in a hotel like this however the temp can not be regulated which is frustrating in high heat and wifi in rooms is checked into the hotel late in the night following a trip to the islands we had previously dropped some bags at the hotel before we left for our trip to the islands and found the reception staff to be in was fairly straightforward however it took a few attempts for them to understand we had bags left in the storage went up to our room floor and were instantly hit by the smell of stale smoke we had requested a non smoking room and there was a sign stating non smoking but on the other hand there was a ash try on the table the smell was really bad and when i called down to reception to complain and i was told the room was non smoking and that the hotel was fully booked and nothing else was available i was not happy and asked for someone to come up to the room the male receptionist was not the most helpful but i understood he had nothing else available and accepted that we were stuck,0
141,the hotel was very basic with only few amenities being provided they did keep any bottle of water and no dental kits were provided since plug points are different as compared to india we had asked for an adaptor to which the reception asked to come down and collect ourselves there was no hospitality in this hotel since we only needed to sleep for one night we adjusted through not at all recommending this hotel to anyone instead there are very good budget hotels in the main city which should be explored the area in which the hotel is situated is also not convenient,0
142,we had three nights here as part of a group tour the rooms were very outdated with lots of stains and the hotel often smelled like cigarette smoke the in the rooms worked just enough to allow you to sleep but they were not great it actually stopped working in the middle of the night one night but seemed to fix itself we had our breakfasts and dinners here and the food lacked imagination and flavor especially the dinners were very basic and did not stand up to what is available in greece,0
144,this hotel was close to omonia metro the area is that great but the hotel was a little jewel in this area lovely clean rooms hairdryer flat tv toiletries free wifi beautifully decorated breakfast was basic self serve but adequate and i do think you can do better for the price the staff were very approachable friendly and helpful when i had a problem with a refund,1
145,we booking this hotel for nights because it had a great star rating and it was well priced once we arrived we realised how bad of a mistake we made the hotel is rundown for the outside but the lobby makes it looking like it could be great lady at the counter was abrupt and rude the lady with the glasses is the nicest one of them all the bedroom had stains all over the floor and curtains smelt really bad and the bathroom had pubic hair on the floor which was so gross we decided to eat at the rooftop bar because we just flew in and did feel like walking to get food only to wait and how and no one shows up we ended up walking into the city and eating at one of our favourite restaurants we can back and though we would just watch the sun set with the acropolis we were there for two hours then a lady turns up and asks if we want to order we say no because we went out to eat and she said if we did order anything we would have to leave as it only for paying customers umm what we paid to stay at the hotel my boyfriend decided to just get a beer and she looked at me and when i said i still did want anything she gave me a death stare and snobed me off never seen someone so rude the first nights,0
147,i stayed at the epidavros as a one night stopover on the way to patras it is well located with nice clean rooms the price included breakfast which is always most welcome no roof terrace but this is definitely a good hotel to stay in for a short bus stop to kiffisos bus station is just around the corner from the hotel which was perfect,1
148,the breakfast was simple but good good bread and croissants the staff was nice and was just one plug on the bedroom this hotel was close to omonia metro the area is that great but the hotel was good,1
149,the breakfast was ok and the man from reception they can clean your room but the smell by old furniture and the view the location and people around you ca change that immigrants everywhere you do feel safe when you look at them i sorry but this is the true it was ok to be near to metro station that it,0
151,i absolutely loved it it not a luxury place but atmosphere was just amazing normally i go for more fancy hotels but non of them had such a lovely stuff reception was super helpful kind and friendly they even did charge me for extra water i was ordering great location everything around the corner supermarket beauty salon tram beach very good night clubs also i would very recommend restaurant the president beds was are super comfy pillows i wish to take them home yes bathrooms needs to be fixed but still i did expect perfection for much better place you pay double money,1
152,we did enjoyed the stay and we felt as home the staf is indeed first class they are worm and nice people and make you feel good and welkomed the hotel is indeed stars but only the bathrooms need an update in the days we stayed at blue sea hotel we started to love it and feel the pleasure of being well treated the site is good and quiet and away from noisy trafic the naiborhood is nice and cleen it has the beach close bolivar beach is amazing a must see i would have wanted more traditional products on feta cheez or original sweets or patiserie products i definetly recomend this place and for shure our next vacation will be at blue sea alimos,1
153,very good service clean hotel new things good offer for that price nice breakfast near the beach and the clubs they even offer more than mentioned mineral water coffee and tea in the room everything works tv telephone air condition recomended,1
154,cozy small hotel in a nice quiet part of athens rooms with new furniture and a nice comfortable bed there is staff service numbers if needed contact them immediately it is not in the historical center of the city but in the beach area minutes walk to the clean beach since the area is not a tourist all shops pharmacies cafes and restaurants are focused on local residents but there is no need for communication difficulties accordingly taverns cafes with good food not to sell high prices because the area thriving not far from the fashionable beaches of athens the historic center is about half a hour by public transport tram bus same number to go to the airport bus stops of public transport and bus eksperes to the airport five minutes on foot,1
155,my family and i stayed here for nightsthe staff were extremely friendly and welcoming the rooms neat and location within walking distance to beaches restaurants and public transport overall an amazing experience and would strongly recommend to all,1
156,we arrived in athens on the way to naxos booked this hotel last minute based on trip advisors rating i must say wow this place is worth all its stars they are experienced in the hospitality industry the front desk danae katerina and manager dominik and the rest of the staff are wonder and paid a lot of attention to rooms grounds and pool stars we then tried their restaurant which was also fantastic its minutes from downtown athens by cab in a very upscale neighborhood as i travel to my next island naxos i have already booked my next stay here as i consider myself a very hard to please and demanding guest but they came thru in such a grand i highly recommend this hotel to all,1
157,i went with my friends on a quiet warm weekday morning in july to have a swim even under heatwave tempeatures the water is chilly making the swim unpleasant the service is slow unfriendly and cold like the water never sorry,0
159,hotel is in a good location close to glyfada and not far from downtown athens sufficient activities close to the location prices are fair rooms on the floor are the nicest hotel and rooms were clean roof garden rooftop was the best feature with live music once a week and quality choices bartenders and senior staff were friendly and outgoing they are the best,1
160,i stayed at this hotel everytime i traveled to greece it feels like home from the friendly staff that welcome you upon arrival to the cleaning staff that always say good morning and take time to ask how your day was you ca ask for anything more the rooms are very clean beautiful roof garden with a pool witch you can enjoy a nice meal a drink or a great always chose this hotel year after year because makes it feel like home thanks to this great staff for making our stay once again pleasant,1
161,we chose to visit athens as it offered the best of both worlds a historic city close to the sea and the emmantina is the perfect place to stay to enjoy both located centrally between the airport a bus ride away with a stop outside the hotel and central athens a tram stop minutes walk away from the hotel you can either explore the city or stay closer to the hotel and relax on the wonderful rooftop terrace or the local beaches the hotel is a minute walk from glyfada which boasts a wide range of shops and restaurants to suit all tastes rooms were basic but functional and the breakfast good the staff were friendly and mostly helpful particularly julie who was always able to offer advice and answer our many questions only one issue was the busy road in front of the hotel the noise was loud and pretty constant which did restrict our use of the balcony however the glazing shut out most of the noise at night would definitely stay here again if we come back to athens,1
162,a clean and comfortable hotel maybe a little bit out of the heart of athens but in the evening it took half an hour to arrive from the airport and all around there are some taverna and restaurants with some typical greek food with convenient pricedefinitely i would advise this hotel to people traveling for business,1
163,let start with the positives friendly helpful staff great welcome cloud pool good food lovely place to chill out in the evening and barman chris was fabulous pool good toolocation mins from alimos marina so handy if you hiring a yachtthe tv worksso the negatives we booked a family room and got two rooms not interconnecting ok for us as we have teens but not great for younger rooms were functional at best decor dated patched up in places and they reeked of cigarette smoke shower woefully inadequate fell out of its holder several times bulbs missing it on a very noisy main road despite double glazed doors and seemingly some rooms have thick blackout curtains and others not breakfast basic meat cheese bread yoghurt etc all ok but overcooked cooked breakfast fried eggs like booked through ba and the reviews were ok but seriously this is a very basic hotel we were here less than hours and that was hours too many,0
165,absolutely loved this location they had a bus to the city every day through out the day the room needed a little updating besides that everything was perfect staff was super friendly great breakfast nice area it was located in we walked to a restaurant called koytoyki and had the best dinner ever and for people it was only great experience we wish we stayed here after our cruise also the lady who did my husbands hair gave him the best haircut he has ever gotten she is so talented very good customer service also we loved her please recognize her also management was great also when i thought i left my passport they searched the room and was there for me great customer service on the managers part also thank you all for a great stay ca wait to see the updates and to come back in the future with our family,1
166,fabulous hotel breakfast buffet absolutely amazing clean very fresh would give it a rating of out of travelled the world and i am extremely fussy staff friendly free shuttle service available drop off to acropolis museum marina and many more driver very helpful,1
167,the staff is extremely helpful rooms were spacious air conditioning worked great great experience totally recommend to anyone had lots of space for whole family kitchen facilities if we had chosen very nice,1
168,we stayed for nights at metropolitan hotel in july hotel is undergoing renovation and that is needed it old dirty and not in a good condition right now if i had no other information i would rate it a star hotel one time when i tried to open the door to our room from the inside the door handle fell off the renovation was noisy the eggs in the morning buffet were rotten and the dinner on the roof top restaurant made my boyfriend and one of his kids complained about the noise and they moved is to a room a couple of floors up so they did try to help but it was still the this description you might wonder why we gave it two stars they are for the well equipt gym and the nice lifeguard by the pool one of the kids forgot her go pro camera by the pool and he saved it for her for the next day,0
169,excellent cost satisfaction ratio personnel friendly breakfast sufficient some rooms are noisyposition is perfect walking distance to syntagma next to metro station along line to the be recommended,1
170,fabulous safe location minutes walk to the metro with easy access to plaka the acropolis etc staff were very helpful and friendly the rooms were comfortable and spacious extra dining area and separate kitchen is ideal for anyone who might be eating in the apartment the was a great benefit especially in the of in the immediate area with a small kiosk outside the hotel for improvement breakfast larger breakfast area and more food selection internet was hit and miss at times gone completely on occasions lift was out on service on a few days which makes it difficult when you on the floor have mobility issues,1
171,my wife and teenage son and daughter stayed here while on holidays in athens it is the perfect place for a family to stay the family apartment was generous in size with high ceilings good air conditioning and spotlessly clean the staff at the reception were so friendly and helpful the location is excellent with lots of restaurants nearby and it is a walk or short taxi to all the main attractions great value for money as well everything a family needs for a stay in athens,1
172,the delice and its staff are wonderful and it was a great five week stay for our course the breakfast is varied and healthy and the rooms are clean and have great facilities and social spaces excellent location,1
173,everything was better than expected nice surroundings nice pool good breakfast and nice rooms the beaches are nearby glyfada center with nice shopping good restaurants and cafees are five minutes away the tram takes you to downtown aten,1
175,rooms are clean small but all you need some small maintenance jobs required but the hotel is still worth going to the location is perfect the staff are very friendly and helpful and cleanliness impeccable the decor is very modern and nice close to a the beach restaurants and shopping all walking distance,1
176,had a great stay hotel was nice clean and modern staff were helpful was across the street from great paid beach and tavern balux hotel had cozy pool and outdoor lounge area only prob was safe not working but we did ask to fix it we would stay again,1
177,the athens mirabello hotel is a nice choice for a cozy stay the air conditioned rooms are very clean and wide with a balcony the breakfast does not have a large variety but the food is of high quality the hotel is very easily reachable from the famous omonia square and its metro station the hotel is overall a good choice,1
178,hotel mirabello is located at omonoia square which is the city center of athens and nicely accessible to metro and bus routes the hotel is in a small building but the rooms are of decent size and was very clean and the breakfast was of good quality but the space was quite small and at certain times it could be difficult to find an empty table overall i was happy with my only downside was the method of payment i booked from and i chose to pay at the property but the property had charged the first night without my consent it had not been indicated that the first night is charged in the booking and i was a bit upset about this confusion,1
180,this is very much a budget hotel we had the smallest twin with tiny shower room paid per night in july however we had a view of the acropolis from our bedroom and the rooftop terrace is amazing if like us you will use the terrace to rest after a days sightseeing or sit and have drinks watching the sun set this is a great place for you however if not then perhaps not we found the hotel clean in a great position and most of the staff were friendly and helpful,1
181,we stayed here in room for days and enjoyed the convenient location of the property very friendly staff always trying to room even smaller elevator but that is typical of any big european terrace is a great place to relax in the afternoon and is clean with decent size bathroom and functional ac with view of bank atm and stores are next to the property,1
182,well situated in plaka from acropolis close to many restaurants and shops great views from rooftop terrace friendly staff good for budget traveller stayed in room on third floor bathroom included clean and tidy good wifi cheap basic breakfast,1
183,during our visit to greece in june we stayed at the phaedra hotel for a total of five nights and six days and we are glad that we did kostas and especially marianna manolatou the business manager and mr george and the rest of the staff were individually and collectively accommodating kind generous with their advice and helpful language was never a problem also the reception desk personnel would call a taxi for us marianna put in touch with a local travel agency to arrange for our road trips to various archeological sites in the peloponnese the agency whose services were good is down the street from the hotel our room on the third floor had a small but cozy balcony with a lovely view of the acroplois and the parthenon the hotel also offers a similar view only better we made two late night sojurns there to enjoy the absorbing beauty of the famed skyline all lit up and looking beautiful as for the amenities the room had two twin beds a perfectly working system a clean bathroom and the bed linens were fresh and spotlessly clean every night we returned to the hotel to sleep the hotel has an elevator it works always situated in the heart of the plaka and a stone throw from the arch of hadrian we could not have asked for a better location the acropolis and the museum was less than a walk the plaka flea market took us about ten minutes to,1
184,this hotel is lacking in atmosphere basic facilities rooms and especially bathrooms in poor condition it an overpriced coach trip stopover in the middle of nowhere i did enjoy my stay here at all,0
185,my family had a lengthy stay at this hotel july it was my third time to stay here and the rest of my family second time the staff from front desk to housekeeping is extremely friendly and helpful the breakfast is great and open from to and if they know you be a little later they leave offerings out for you the rooms are clean and tidy and have most of what you need we missed having a box of kleenex tissue available in the room perhaps that a western thing and the bathrooms although clean and functional could use larger shower areas there a small refrigerator and a safe in the room and staff leaves a large bottle of water in it for you as needed it is a hotel but on our last there it was obvious someone was smoking on the floor i brought it to the attention of the front desk lots of shops and restaurants a stone throw away a large park churches art galleries and train to take you into athens overall good experience and would certainly use hotel des roses again,1
187,cons the location of the hotel is seedy and horrible as we walked from the metro stop to the hotel men were breaking areas of the sidewalks to fill bottles with water from the underground pipes litter was everywhere and the area is severely i was embarrassed to bring my family and international guest to this hotel and arrival we were informed our family room was on the floor once entered it was clear it was a double room in which they tried to squeeze in a single bed and a rollaway chairs from the desk were moved to the foot of our double bed and crammed against the my discussion with the staff we were moved to a family room on the floor facing the back streets of athens we were informed that the room on the floor was indeed a family room which i know it was not here the description copied from their official website dorian inn hotel offers a great variety of standard single double and triple rooms and from the to the floor we offer superior double and family rooms for an stay in athens spelling from hotel websiteupon departure at we saw a man sitting on a doorstep sniffing white substance and a woman sitting on the sidewalk with adult dog and puppies who appeared to be malnourished so very sad for all these reasons i will not stay at dorian inn hotel in the the breakfast was very good and the support staff,0
188,rooms were basic good value and fitted our needs during our night stay in athens the pool was refreshing after a day of sightseeing in hot temperatures we enjoyed the rooftop bar and the lovely view from it location was good,1
189,first of all location is horrible rooms are old dark dirty and bathroom smells of urine breakfast selection was limited and even the coffee was not appealing we stayed at dorian for nights because we could get a refund they never cleaned our room do stay at dorian it not worth it,0
190,we had a good stay at this hotel the lobby is very impressive the staff were overly friendly but still professional the rooms were clean and comfortable the buffet breakfast that was included was good too,1
191,nice new renovated rooms corridors and cleaning service excellent nice breakfast good value for money nice helpfull staff nice location walking distance from plaka and ancient athens the hotel is recomdnded,1
193,the hotel was well priced and conveniently located in between two metro stations the room was clean and all the amenities promised were in working order the reception was very helpful and made our early check out a breeze the room was fairly small and the view was great but other than that it a perfect choice for someone who just needs a place to sleep,1
194,the hotel lobby is beautiful you have several areas to sit and relax there is a little area for coffee and doughnuts bagels etc the staff is very nice friendly and helpful the room size was not bad for europe there is a fitness center however it is only open from i was gone before and did not return until after so i was disappointed because i love to workout daily the rooftop restaurant was awesome the views are breathtaking you can see the acropolis and at night it lights up the sunset views are amazing also there is a buffet restaurant the food is good but a lot of the same foods daily within walking distance to shopping district of plaka,1
195,we enjoyed our stay at titania hotel the staff were pleasant and helpful it was on the main hop on hop off bus route also not too far from the plaka by taxi the rooms were good and clean bathroom small but adequate delicious breakfasts,1
196,titania hotel is ideally situated in the heart of athens and is only a short walk away from syntagma square and the shopping centre my husband and i only stayed for two nights before and after our trip to syros but we ll definitely choose titania for a longer stay next time we visit rooms are spacious functional and beautifully decorated cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city we were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the parthenon as we had to catch the ferry to syros very early in the morning we greatly appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet consisting of a wide variety of jams bread rolls croissants cheeses delicatessen fruit cereals and sweets normal breakfast includes hot dishes as well such as eggs omelette bacon baked should not leave titania hotel without having a drink or dinner at olive graden situated on the floor and offering a superb view to the pathenon by night although the restaurant is a bit pricey it s well worth the experience the food is excellent and the service is impeccable all the staff are very polite and helpful for all these reasons i strongly recommend titania hotel for couples families or business,1
197,larissa metro train station is metres away the room was clean the pool on the top deck is a bonus only negative is that breakfast is basic and the bread on both mornings was stale reasonable value so no real complaints,1
198,right at the metrostation larissa and therefore are almost all the attractions in athens reachable within a few minutes friendly staff and nice pool with view over the city the room was large with airco fridge and bath and balcony a basis but nice hotel and very good value for money,1
199,third visit to the hotel oscar in the last three years and still as good as ever you wo be able to beat this hotel for value and it facilities are great we all love the rooftop pool and the district in which it is set is friendly and great for an evening meal very handy for the underground as well we will be back again,1
201,i honestly wasn t expecting too much before i arrived here but was really happy when i did the room was spacious with a comfortable bed and really nice bathroom the aircon worked great and having the balcony with a really nice view made it even rooftop bar and pool was amazing offering stunning views of the city and and a secluded way to relax even though the pool is fairly small it is normally quiet and so wasn t much of an breakfast buffet was simple but nice and there was a decent selection of hot and cold food,1
203,a very nice hotel in the plaka district perfect for spending some days in athens walking distance to the acropolis and to nice restaurants and bars the staff was very helpful and gave us great advices for visiting the city the hotel is kind of very charming,1
205,this hotel is in a great location an easy walk to syntagma square the plaka the subway and the acropolis it was a wonderful surprise the first night when i went out on the little balcony and i could see the acropolis lite up on the hill we were there during a terrible heat wave one day when we returned our air conditioning was not working panic the person at the front desk got us help immediately and we had a comfortable room with an hour the breakfast was quite good as well,1
206,dimitri is very helpful host he takecare of me and my twin sister with all advices regarding athens and all cafes where we can stay include our future visit to his country nikolas the morning host give us a free map and pin the imp locations for sightseeing as well as help us with the taxi service to go to the airport and our safe box when it was hotel location is very good the hotel is clean and amazing value for money the hosts are really friendly and attentive to the hotel customers they give great service all the best and success to that hotel and people working in it makes it successful,1
207,my wife and i stayed here on the tail end of our honeymoon before heading back home we really enjoyed our stay at the stanley it an old and historic hotel that has been well maintained and updated through the years we felt it was very well located with respect to the main touristic highlights and the view of the acropolis from our room was amazing it very well priced and i highly recommend it to someone looking to experience athens,1
208,we were a group of friends mid staying here for a long weekend and we loved it is top nice modernised room with a small balcony facing a quiet street the staff at reception and at breakfast very polite and helpful the receptionist going out of his way to recommend places to eat and calling them to reserve for us breakfast is at the roof top terrace with a view of athens and acropolis beautiful good breakfast selection with greek yoghurt fruit bread eggs cheeses etc the area exarchia is really cool with a very anarchist vibe lots of bars playing alternative rock restaurants with good and very cheap local food felt very safe hardly any tourists we loved it,1
210,whilst not in the most salubrious of locations the stanley is right for the price our spacious room was one of the refurbished rooms and it was very clean comfortable and quiet the front desk staff are efficient and very welcoming providing top notch personal service to all guests despite how many check ins they were dealing with commendable unfortunately i did really get the same vibe from the roof top bar of variety and choices in the buffet breakfast served in the sun filled livingston room and there seemed to be a greek barista on hand to personalise your coffee order so great start to the handy to the metro and there a bakery conveniently located on the corner downstairs if you looking for a clean economical hotel and not too fussed with location you ca go wrong with the stanley,1
211,when i first arrived at this hotel i was pleased with the look of it it was clean and well presented the streets around the hotel are not very nice but exploring the area further many streets in the athens area seem run down but once you are in the hotel you feel far away from it all the hotel is located right near the metro station so you do have far at all to go if you want to catch the stayed in a room on floor the room was a nice size and very clean the only let down was the balcony view it was overlooking other hotels and a dirty street but this did really bother me too much as i did spend much time in the room as i was out exploring athens the bed was very loud and creaky any movement in the bed made a loud sound sounded like it was going to collapse in the mornings from half to half is the breakfast buffet there is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up one night at the hotel i decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the floor top of the hotel it had a great view of the acropolis you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat the menu did have much food choice i went for the burger it looked great but came out cold so i had to,1
212,probably the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip around greece not only was the entrance of the hotel hard to find but the rooms shown in the pictures look absolutely nothing like what a standard room at the stanley looks like the management informed us that those are only the specialty suites it was outdated small and not renovated but thankfully after enough complaining we were upgraded to a bigger room but with the same outdated features the pool and rooftop bar are also highly exaggerated based on the photos and even with a discount card for your first drinks everyone gets as a guest you are paying more for beers than at any of the surrounding restaurants the bed was pleasant and it was convenient to get to the city center with a metro station out front avoid the taxis if you can they are quite expensive and the drivers are very rude the star rating is not justified with this hotel it is closer to a hotel,0
213,i stayed there for few days of a business meeting all in all i can say that i had a really good time in the hilton hotel athens i liked the pool area and the amazing view of the rooftop bar the price for a drink are not acceptable in my point of view rooms and floors are clean and quiet breakfast for an international hotel very good,1
214,this stay was just one but was during one of the hottest days in recent years and i was extremely comfortable during the entire stay beautifully air conditioned rooms pool to refresh and relax and the pool side restaurant so i did need to leave the property honestly i ca say anything bad about this property have been a customer for business leisure for years and have never been disappointed thank you for making my short stay perfect,1
215,the hilton is a nice hotel it is one of the taller buildings around the area and i had a direct view of the acropolis from the balcony there are many restaurants around the area and it under miles to the acropolis and less to mount if you walk to lycabettus watch out for a road about blocks just before getting to the tram station it has numerous restaurants which i recommend you was efficient and courteous room was clean there was a nice concierge lounge with great views no negatives that i can think of other than it could be a little closer to the tourist attractions but do think its fair to ding hilton too much for that and anyone should be able to walk miles as a did not try the hotel restaurants as i wanted to try the local cuisine for transportation uber works great but do think they have spread out beyond athens yet there are yellow cab taxi but i prefer uber because they speak english fares overall nicer cars and more i come back yes for business and with family,1
216,key points the hotel is one block from evangelismos subway we were able to easily take the subway and walk to all the major sites and museums from this hotel we enjoyed the outstanding breakfast buffet each morning we did not use but were impressed by the quality of the hotel fitness facilities and indoor and outdoor pools we encountered a problem with our first room and were offered another room immediately both first and second rooms were clean and rooftop bar overlooking the acropolis was a lovely capstone to an evening of touring front desk and business centre staff were all very helpful lastly we also very much appreciated how quiet our room was the windows are very well insulated like what we experienced in places with hurricane glass between that and being on an upper flooor we were not conscious of traffic noise at all there was minor noise transfer from the adjacent room through the wall hallways were thickly carpeted and sound was quite muted,1
217,staying here at the moment been here nights regularly stay in hilton hotels and various other stars around the world booked the hilton as one of higher rated hotels in athens and thought it was a good bet that it would be a good hotel with excellent hilton service unfortunately it is very disappointing the building does look great from the outside and the lobby area is average at best it was my wife birthday and emailed ahead to see if they could do anything to make our stay more special and asked if it would be possible to get a nice room with a view unfortunately the room is on floor right outside the noisy ice machine dispenser asked to be moved but rooms offered had no view and were very dark they said they had arranged a cake for her birthday when i flagged that i was hoping for something in the room but i was sure if they were just saying they had arranged something when i asked about it i asked for it to be in the room at as we had to go for a mealat nothing turned up when we returned from our meal the cakes were in the room but after a course meal we could eat them we asked for the cakes to be taken away the next day as they had been there over night and it took over an hour to come and collect the room is ok apart from,0
218,this hotel really gets service and perfectly looked after me and my family in athens they could not have done more to ensure a difficult situation was handled with real care understanding and empathy could ask for more and would never stay anywhere else in athens,1
219,i started here prior to a cruise of the mediterranean and it was great a free shuttle to the plaka and a great view on the top floor of the acropolis the breakfast buffet was delicious with fresh food and delicious greek room was nice too and staff was friendly and accommodating got there at am they were able to get us a room i recommend this hotel they even recommended a great restaurant near by with good greek food,1
220,although the hotel is about a minute walk from the plaka area it is one of the nicest hotels in athens beds are very comfortable and rooms are large with good air conditioning which is hard to find in athens spend the extra money and get a club level room the club level has breakfast every day which is very good along with snacks canapes drinks and desserts throughout the day sandwiches and wraps at lunch and free drinks in the evening this made it very nice to wind down after a long day of sightseeing in athens service was also very good and the club lounge had excellent views of the acropolis and out door dining,1
222,we stayed at this hotel for two nights with only one day to explore the hotel it was on first appearances very large and quite impersonal however the staff are very friendly and professional and the room was exceptionally well equipped large and cool we were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room you quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual smoked salmon freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals if you want a traditional english breakfast the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the where to eat at night if you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again you will see a sign for vassilios taverna it is worth a visit do be put off by the area the food there was very good and very reasonable rest on your first night if you are not sure where to exploring from the hotel we had a taxi to the acropolis at and it cost if you hold a student discount card nus extra use it most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about which was some saving we also used the tram back to the hotel and then back into,1
223,we arrived in athens on one of the hottest days our room was on the floor there is no lift but the walk was worth it as our room was a cool oasis a door by our room lead to the roof terrace with a view of the acropolis the air conditioning worked brilliantly and enabled perfect sleep the hotel is a short walk from a variety of places to eat and within walking distance of the major sites the room was spacious and clean and the staff friendly,1
224,i would highly recommend this hotel it was clean had a very comfortable bed was only a short distance to the acropolis had a spacious balcony with fantastic views especially at night and the customer service was outstanding the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and i am only sorry that i did get the name of the man on reception who did everything to ensure i found some taramasalata so that i could thank him by name at such a great price there are no bad words to say about this hotel and we will be returning,1
225,we stayed at this hotel for one night before heading to the greek islands this hotel was a good price and very well located for seeing everything we needed to see for one day in athens such as the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka neighbourhood the entrance area is nicely decorated and our room was a reasonable size and air conditioned there was free wifi however there is no lift so you must carry your bags up a spiral staircase a great stay,1
226,the room was clean and the decor was very nice and fitting to staff were very helpful and went out of their way to ensure a pleasant trip and the hotel itself was in a good location overall wonderful accommodation,1
227,great location and price easy to get to from syntagma square metro station re for airport small compact room and bathroom in case that is a concern i was travelling alone so all fine for me boutique hotel and decor lovely entrance to reception great for plaka for restaurants wandering around and shops reception staff friendly and great for any information fantastic restaurant about mins walk away called athinaikon mitropoleos street road parallel with the road the hotel is on recommend you go to the top floor and see the some of the acropolis from the roof top at night and in the day time i have added some photos from the roof top area they do serve breakfast but lots of places available within walking distance would stay here is no lift please be warned fortunately a lovely american guy came in just after me and very kindly offered to take my heavy suitcase up the flights of stairs to my room thanks again if you read this i managed to slowly carry my suitcase down and the young lady assisted me when she saw me descending once near the reception otherwise bring a strong man with you my room initially smelt of stale smoke,1
229,the bedroom was ok but the bathroom the worst one i ever used in a hotel the location is ok next to tube stations and min walking to the acropolis but the streets around were just ugly and i did feel safe the staff was nice and helpful i do recommend for people in holidays just for fast business trips,0
230,when the best thing you can say about the hotel is that you liked the front desk staff know it not great truly the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional we booked an eight day greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through italy for weeks through an aegean travel agency we had two nights in athens before heading to sifnos and serifos islands and then one night in athens again before ending our trip we were picked up at the airport and transferred to hotel economy by a great taxi driver i guess we should have known by the hotel name what kind of place it would be first of all it basically in the red light district as i would call it there are therese two minutes in any direction the hotel is very dated the beds are hard and the pillows are harder the bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind they could use plastic shower curtains you flood the bathroom when you shower thank goodness for drains in the floor you have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs actually sort of handy the refrigerator does work when you leave the room it connected to the key so there no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour it very noisy outside as well as above you the continental breakfast starts ta that late if you from the us it a pretty,0
231,i stayed at economy for two days before meeting a friend in the cyclades the room was nice with a small balcony staff were loaning me a charger for my computer when i forgot my converter providing directions etc breakfast is a very simple buffet but fine the location is great and i would stay there again,1
232,we have returned to the hotel since we have an outstanding stay the first time around i say outstanding as we believed small improvements could be made well we were in fact pleasantly surprised this hotel is really at the pinnacle of excellence decor service ordered room service which arrived on time and very well presented the front office staff is efficient and very has earned its place among the greatest and we look forward to returning,1
234,we wrapped up our long trip to greece with a very relaxing yet inspirational in terms of architecture and design stay here and loved it the hotel was a bit of a scene with trendy people and such but still felt comfortable for our family the kids absolutely loved the pool and simply seeing the pop art decor we loved it all,1
235,when i saw the photos of the hotel i did know what to expect in real life it not as over the top as you might superior room was spacious with a balcony and comfortable the staff were friendly and hotel is located in a nice area with a short walk to shops and would stay here again,1
236,it was our visit in athens and also in adrian hotel it was renovated since our previous visit in and all the facilities in the room were modern and clean we admire breakfasts on the terrase with acropolis view the best location close to the city centre we never use transport visiting different sites quiet place even the window is on the adrianou street a lot of restaurants and shops nearby we will stay again in adrian hotel next time,1
237,if you want a well priced hotel to explore the city then the adrian is perfect located on a bustling street in the centre of plaka within easy reach of all attractions lovely roof terrace for breakfast too,1
238,for our week in athens we stayed at the adrian hotel on one of the main streets of plaka and just around the corner from monastiraki square markets and metro the neighbourhood is full of taverns shops and sites it was the ideal location a short distance away is the roman and ancient agora plus if you look up you catch glimpses of the acropolis the hotel is small but very comfortable our room had a balcony overlooking the main street but was quiet breakfast is served on the rooftop with a great view of the acropolis what a great way to wake up in the staff were always helpful with suggestions for tours and sightseeing the air con was a lifesaver during the heatwave would definitely return to this hotel it location and facilities are a winner for me,1
239,the location is nice the room confortable the staff kind the breakfast could be more various but it ok the courtesy set is very good i got also a gift of small lavander powder but i wonder why out of italy only in few hotels the bidet is available it so useful i do like the all in one as they have,1
240,the hotel is located a bit north of athens in a nice residential area you are located far away of the touristic center so you get more i touch with the area seemed us very safe in the center of nea erithtrea some min by feet you find both local taverns and sophisticated restaurants by taxi it takes about to go to kifissià about min later you are downtown athens the advantage staying a bit outside is that the place is located a bit higher and so it is much fresher than in the lower you are sensitive to noise you should consider that the hotel is near to a street with plenty of traffic so you can not sleep with open windows but the noise is drasticly reduced with closed windows,1
241,i stayed at the hotel for days the rooms where clean along with basic toiletries provided however i would not class the hotel as a four star the breakfast was mediocre but the scenery of the coastline was a magnificent treat the street noise with the addition of cars driving past could heard at night as i am not a light sleeper it was much of an issue but you can request a room away from the main road coffee making facilities were provided as part of the stay one certain element which i was very impressed with was no clean tea drinking cups had been provided on two separate occasions i was left with dirty cups the main guest elevator broke down a few days into our stay noise can be heard from nearby rooms loud talking doors shutting and people pacing up and down the corridor on one occasion the kitchen associated with the hotel ran out of energy to supply the kitchen the cook was tad rude when explaining this the reception are happy to help with any queries our taxi requests were dealt with efficiently spare ice was provided for each floor as it was a warm it a clean hotel with a beautiful view hotel provides you with all the basic requirement to ironing fridge etch printing with no additional chargers you can access the nearby tram stop to make your way into the city centre the hotel is approx away from syntagma square on,1
242,i have stay many times in this hotel and always was clean it is in a very nice place close to nice shops and restaurants if you will have sea view room will be great do not forget to taste the food at the rastaurant it is perfect,1
243,very good place in a great the street from a beach min walk to a beach with chairs etc many tavernas and bars just outside connects with all public transport within athens loved was decent and is served in a room with amazing view over the sea,1
244,ok this was our first hotel we stayed at once touching down in a very hot athens was a little hard to locate but that was the fault of google maps so buy a gps with athens maps and you will find it without an issue the staff are great with there customer service and extremely helpful we had a room viewing the bay and it was along with the big balcony and comfy outdoor setting beds were very comfy as i find it hard to fall asleep in certain beds i we all fell asleep come night very quickly and woke up refreshed breakfast was part of our stay and boy oh boy it was tasty hot and fit for a king and you can help yourself as many times as you please coffee was real as to was juices and if you have a sweet tooth then you will love there greek cakes also they cater for the kids as well and plenty of fresh fruit cereals all you can imagine the pool was tops its built around of an accent setting along with modern and comfy sun lounges and sofas also very shady areas if you do want to tan oh and before i forget every room has a split system air con which will keep you nice and cool during this heat wave that sweeping greece only downside is the restaurant chef really go back and learn the basics of a good old fashioned greek meal,1
245,location is fantastic the staff are so friendly and helpful the overall appearance and cleanliness of the hotel is very good felt very welcome and safe here our room was cleaned and towels changed daily honestly ca fault palmyra beach thank you so much for a wonderful night stay,1
246,currently staying in one of the the rooms and very impressed excellent value pool is just right and bar food and drinks are good standard staff are all very good and professional and friendly too beach is literally two mins away seconds if you run min walk to the town with some really nice places to eat tram is about min away which is great although the buses seem quicker greek driving i think breakfast is really very good value good selection of hot and cold and all sorts cleanest hotel i been to for a while and i been to a few with work there a bus stop outside the front of the hotel worth looking into for the airport run otherwise expect to pay over for a taxi we did felt robbed although on a main road the hotel is accessed via a quiet side road and the beach is out the back over another not too busy road really it fine out of town about min on a tram but if you want out of town then book it,1
247,me and my girlfriend stayed there for about a week hotell was really nice and clean we got an economic room which was amazing tbh it was better than what we expected the staff are really nice friendly and helpful cleaning ladies are really good at their job it is very close to the beach like walk to glyfada beach buss amd tram stops are very close and it was really quite room tbh we get free coffee and tea and they were good service is,1
248,i am writing this review to inform people of this very beautiful hotel my friends and i stayed on the top floor room it was outstanding all newly renovated and soooo spotless every day cleaned with lively fresh towels and linens a lovely friendly cleaning lady also a wonderful air conditioning room to come back to in to every day the room was stunning amazing facilities in it and a balcony view to die for a gorgeous american breakfast awaited us every morning and once again so clean with lovely staff to greet us on arrival the reception staff were incrediably friendly and welcoming and nothing was to much trouble for them at all the pool bar restaurant was gorgeous opened daily serving lovely delicious food and drinks amazing coctails the life guard george was one of the loveliest people we met on the holiday just a pure gentlemen he had fresh pool towels for us and anything we wanted he hit amazing service from all of them i would recommend panorama resturant i will do a seperate review later about minutes away in taxi the most amazing seafood resturant on our trip also athens sailing tours amazing this hotel in offers everything yes it is hour by tram or daytime by taxi to plaka wonderful area but you have the beach and beautiful area of gylfada as well i can not wait to vusit thus beautiful country and hotel again tgank yiu to all at palmyra beach hotel for,1
249,coral hotel is a nice hotel with a great location this is not a resort hotel but a friendly local establishment that we would stay at again we stayed at the hotel because of a recommendation of one of our sailing coaches who lives in the area it walking distance to all the marinas in paleo faliro and there are a lot of restaurants both inland of the hotel and on the beach the rooms are a little small we had the family suite as we traveled with a friend of ours it comprised of two double rooms with bathrooms and a living room both rooms had balconies and the noise from the busy street in front was almost completely negated by the two layers of patio doors the only down point was one of the rooms had an older ac unit and it barely kept up with the heat in july maid service was good and overall the rooms were comfortable views were very good but only enjoyable after due to the heat the highlight of the hotel are their restaurants the breakfast room is on the floor and does a very nice job with full service its extra for the latte but go ahead and order one they were inexpensive and good breakfast is usually included but ask anyway when you reserve the breakfast manager was very helpful unfortunately we did get his name but he ran a tight ship and no need to go to starbucks blocks,1
250,i stayed in this hotel with my disabled daughter what can i say excellent from the receptionists to the cleaners to the pool man george and lefteris helpful nothing is too much trouble rooms are spacious with a small fridge and safe a tv is also in the room but maimly greek channels room cleaned everyday if needed towels supplied around the pool by the lifeguard who also supplied gallons of water if and when needed food was excellent and reasonably priced there no real downside to this hotel the beach is two minutes from the hotel with their own umbrellas plenty of transport to visit athens or down the coast to sounion hotel i will definitely visit again well done the palmyra beach hotel,1
251,my family and i stayed at this hotel for nights every thing is new in high is very easy to reach from airport to the hotel and to the main attractions as the metro station is only minutes by nice professional and very helpful staff thak you i recommend this hotel,1
252,my daughter and i just spent days at holiday suites and we had a great time the rooms are really large and well equiped and the staff is very pleasant and helpful we had most of our breakfasts at the nearby crowne placa as the selection is a little bit larger there and the view is magnificent but the breakfast at holiday suites is quite good also going to the city centre is very easy only two metro stops to syntagma and three to monisteraki the best way to get to the hotel from the airport is also by metro go off at megarou mousikis take the escalator to the left when leaving the station then you walk around the corner by the cafeteria go down the street two blocks then you see a blue sign saying holiday suites prices are euros for a single ticket but there are discounts for return tickets and for groups starting already at two persons although bus is cheaper i recommend the only complain would be the that was cumbersome and we constantly had to log in with a quite long and complicated username and password instead of being automatically connected,1
253,greece was the first stop for my family vacation and this hotel was just what we expected it a little jewel in an area that reminded me of brooklyn ny in the we loved the staff and the rooms are completely as pictured i would stay here again,1
254,ca say enough great things about this hotel it is located on a quiet residential walk street with plenty of greenery in a great part of town easy access to nearby metro and public transportation the rooms are first rate super comfy and great spacious bathrooms the breakfast buffet that came with our room rate was delicious service impeccable we are very picky travelers and we were so happy with our stay,1
255,amazing personel manue and constantine took the time to make sure we were totally satisfied with our room the room was large and private they took there time to recommend places to visit train location and how to get acquainted with athens you so much for our memories of athens mr and mrs ziad jawda,1
257,the hotel is located in one of the busiest streets in athens on the top of the hotel the pool overlooks the entire city with all the mountains is a nice bar on the roof and in the lobby with food options good prices also the breakfast is amazing with fresh baked goods and good variety of food,1
258,we arrived at zafolia after a day cruise we chose this hotel as we wanted room space and a pool the room did not disappoint it actually was more roomier than we expected it was clean and stocked with toiletries the roof top pool could do with some upgrading there were never enough pool lounges and we had to make do with the chairs by the food area we ate by the pool and the food was basic but yummy the kids were happy with the breakfast buffet however we needed to keep in mind we had just come off a cruise i was disappointing that the cold food was not kept cold enough for our preference otherwise for a basic buffet it was get to the hop off bus expect to walk minutes this was perfect however we got used to the walk in the heat and decided that the room was worth the walk restaurants near by were a little bit of a challenge however we looked up trip advisor and navigated ourselves around the streets and eventually found the ones recommended these were great overall a pleasant experience,1
259,we stayed here as we wanted somewhere with a swimming pool because the weather would be so hot in athens the hotel was every and more we needed the pool is fantastic and our room was huge the hotel is very well maintained and the staff are all very helpful the hotel is a little out the city but uber are very cheap so we did mind getting uber and getting out of the heat would recommend to anyone going to athens,1
260,i had the pleasure of spending a night at athens zafolia hotel for a quick business trip and i experienced a long lasting memory of which i urge to hotel is conveniently located for business purposes and has a relaxing pool on the roof top with extremely friendly staff reasonable breakfast and nice rooms and the reception personnel are very caring and helpful but why such an outstanding memory well i for personal reasons chose to change my room and mistakenly forgot about my belongings in the safe box half an hour later i was relaxing watching this beautiful traditional greek band playing bouzouki that someone knocks on my door telling me to go to my recent room immediately where i found my gold chain passport credit card and few thousands of cash euro left behind now i know they were suppose to do that but still this is not something to forget so i deeply appreciate such honesty by the zafolia staff from the manager whom chose and trained these personnel and also this lovely russian guy whom was so honest and friendly athens zafolia you represented the very rich greek culture again by such tremendous act thank you zafolia and thank you beautiful athens,1
261,the hotel was great and staff very friendly and helpful but ubication of hotel is horrible there is a lot of pakistan and afganistan imigrants they are all night screaming like fighting so i felt not secure and comfortable there,1
262,hotel is situated in center and metro is not far away minutes but neighborhood is big problem drug edicts pickpockets jobless etc at evening armed security in front of hotel so recommend to order taxi to leave and return to hotel we were warned each tome from taxi drivers to be careful in that part of is ok but not enough tables for all guests cue for elevator as it is small and there is only are old dusty and carpets are full of stains beds are comfortable units are silent so it is possible to sleep if you leave them switched is ok with hairdryer but we were missing liquid soap dispenser was empty for all safety deposit box in all rooms some have some not that was a problem,0
263,the place it self is good also old fashioned but the out side view is near to omania sq metro helps alot the printer thing was useful for printing your boarding passes the overall is ok,1
264,antonias is the man to look out for he will help you with absolutely anything you need and be dead cheeky about it breakfast is huge delicious and free try the tomatoes air conditioner works like a charm when you can figure out how to turn it on it just a wonderful place to stay at a wonderful price and honestly if you really afraid of the neighborhood as some reviews have suggested do go to athens neighborhood is fine and close to nightlife without it being a noisy distraction,1
266,this restaurant sits atop this boutique styled hotel it has an unencumbered view of the acropolis and serves elegant greek dishes with a twist the service was outstanding and we had the most romantic evening drinking wine and enjoying the view i highly recommend getting a reservation however as this has become the hot spot in athens for even the athenians well worth stopping by,1
267,first time in athens and picked this hotel due to location and great reviews it sure did disappoint breakfast was included and the food was wonderful with great selections and a great view of acropolis when we arrived we got upgraded to a junior suites extra small lounge area to put your luggage i guess if it was a normal size luggages can be difficult to find its space in the room hotel staffs were lovely and helpful location was central very close to syntagma square and monstraki square very close to eating places and shops it is also close to airport bus in syntagma square when i go back next time i will definitely go back to this hotel value for money,1
269,this was the first of several hotels we stayed at during our trip to greece and it was the perfect way to kick things off the room was so quaint and cozy and there is an amazing view of the acropolis from the room definitely book a room with an acropolis view if possible the rooftop garden restaurant is amazing for breakfast and and the location is perfect the acropolis is only a short walk i highly recommend this hotel,1
270,during our euro trip we stayed in different countries and hotels thankfully this was our final stop as it could not have been beaten we were greeted by roberta who was extremely professional and helpful she gave us a tour and took us to the rooftop terrace for a welcome drink excellent touch she then took us to our rooms where our bags were waiting for us the room was beautiful and clean it was a little small but we could have paid more for a bigger room in our booking the highlight of the hotel is the rooftop terrace and food in general we ate at the restaurant twice because the food was sublime expensive but fabulous if anything there could be more cocktail options on the drink menu but that if i being really picky the view is amazing and many of the locals came to eat there to take it in loved the breakfast menu and the fact you could order the day before this is a breakfast not a style breakfast the service was good and the food was fantastic great start to the day if anything the air conditioning unit could be situated in a better place in the room in order for it to work properly it was located under the desk and did get the air throughout the room fully but we were able to sleep overall the whole experience was fantastic if we visit again we will definitely book here and would,1
271,stayed nights in july room on floor was fairly quiet and clean and had a partial view of acropolis which was a special surprise us as we did not pay for a room with view breakfast buffet was above average but breakfast room was a little hot once the sun was up at night the rooftop terrace had breathtaking views of the parthenon staff members were pleasant and smiled at lot bathroom kind of had an odor at first coming from the drain it went away after opening the window and airing it out air conditioning worked well wi fi was not great but a couple of notes the elevator was the size of a phonebooth but did work well the hotel is located up a steep hill we did not mind but i would think it would be inconvenient if you were not used it our floor room you could hear footsteps of the workers in the breakfast area floor very early in the morning if you are a light sleeper you may want to get a room below the was a or minute walk to the plaka district lots of shops and restaurants and acropoiis museum a little farther to get to acropolis itself the metro was nearby and it was how we got the airport as i heard taxi cabs were very pleased with this hotel and it was a good value to boot,1
273,very close to very thing rooms are ok bathroom a little small breakfast was better than i though i would stay there again loved athens service was good and very freindly and helpful to good restaurants and shops,1
274,i stayed at this hotel twice two days in june at the start of my travel in greece and two days in july before i returned home i was very pleased with both stays although my rooms were very different this is a bright hotel with a lot of unexpected touches my favorite was the lobby chairs with outlets for convenient charging of cell phones laptops while you wait for friends or taxis breakfast was included in my price and you can get made to order omelets and orange juice the staff is the real star of this hotel they are friendly professional and superbly attentive during my first stay i stayed in a junior suite which was nice and roomy with a super clean bathroom and included great amenities such as a room safe flat screen tv hot water pot and a mini bar that leaves room for your personal food items free is included they also have an restaurant where you can get anything from a burger and fries to greek salad on my second stay i was given one of the newly renovated rooms on the floor and while they were and absolutely stunning it just was my style and so i asked for and received a room change they were even kind enough to have one of the bellmen take me around and show me other available rooms so i could choose what i wanted now that is service the room i have now is one,1
275,amazing lobby with free billiards table for are not fast and big semms remaind from old helpful staffs rooms are nice and clean they have shortage of the sharging connections also they dont have it in the bath roln for shaver try to ask for upper floor rooms cause thise are better and new to metro aroind will enjoy imantour leader,1
276,excellent choice of hotel if you want to be in midtown athens located two metro stations to syntagma square main city center you can also walk the min distance if it is not too room lacked space to hang clothes rooms in and floors have been recently renewed air condition worked and front desk excellent more than adequate eggs cheeses cold cuts salads bread coffee book long in advance to get the lowest rate,1
277,we stayed here for one night the hotel is nice and room was nice and clean including bathroom they offer rooms for ppl which was perfect for us it very central within walking distance are many restaurants the acropolis and direct bus service to airport that runs every and through the night price is also good with tasty breakfast included after it possible to leave luggage in a large locker downstairs for for as long as you like there air conditioning even though it on a busy street our room was quiet when we kept the window closed we were on floor go to the floor to admire a view to the acropolis would definitely go again next time,1
280,we only stayed here for a night the hotel is quite old but then so does the whole street of athens i think the room is pretty good in the sense that it is fairly spacious bed is comfortable the shower area is bigger than our previous hotels in ie x big tiles vs x square tiles location is the best imo it is less than minute walk from syntagma metro or the bus stop there are a lot of choices of restaurants around you can walk to nearly attractions easily we came in the summer so the weather is too hot for us to walk too far even though we are used to humid weather in singapore it might not be a good idea to return late to the hotel because athens can be dangerous with so many beggars thieves robberies breakfast is served from onwards it was fairly decent ie typical etc the lifts are really lifts are available it is very slow with a max of person capacity everytime you must the door to open this has to be the ever lift i seen in my lifetime thus far,1
281,we loved our nights in athens at airotel alexandros the room was comfortable ac worked very well unlike some european hotels breakfast was amazing walking distance to metro we felt like we were coming home to our athens family each night the front staff in the were not only accommodating but so fun to chat with if we are ever fortunate enough to come to athens again we will be staying here,1
282,stayed here for days the staff speaks perfect english and is always kind the rooms are very clean for a hotel of this price the rooms are big and confortable breakfast was also good and abundant the only shame is that the neighborhood is full of people just at the corner with menandrou street for the rest the hotel is perfect and near to the omonoia station,1
283,i think americans need to temper their expectations when they travel to europe was the room small absolutely athens is a city that is literally thousands of years old and this hotel is in the heart of it we walked through the plaka and had a fabulous dinner there a rooftop hot tub and restaurant at the hotel too the breakfast was amazing it had anything you could think of the staff spoke you can basically walk anywhere from here we took the subway from the airport and walked from sygmata square here maybe minutes we had giant luggage and managed just fine the hotel is air and that worked really yes it is a small room,1
285,we booked nights at this hotel as my birthday treat we booked an executive room and i emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion i received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this on arrival the hotel was full this was the least of our problems the hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel taxi at euros on our return to the airport we were quoted euros by hotel staff which we booked decided to take the metro as we thought euros rather expensive the metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband passport were stolen from my handbag this resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the british embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement day ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within executive room was nothing like executive the bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath i reported this but the engineer could make no were replaced each day although the quality was not is unusual not to have facilities in a,1
286,the royal olympic is a lovely comfortable hotel that is located in easy walking distance to the many of the major sites in athens its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant which i shall review separately with breathtaking panoramic views that include the acropolis and the lycabettus hill the rooms were comfortable and well maintained although not we stayed at the hotel and both the beginning and the end of our trip both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool although our second room had only a stall shower but no bathtub as had been in the first the swimming pool was another welcome feature though not very large it was clean temperate and enough for swimming short laps there were sunbeds which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel as well at patio chairs and tables the staff was uniformly courteous and helpful and finally the price which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was quite reasonable though perhaps not the institution that it purports to be the royal olympic is certainly a comfortable place to stay when visiting athens,1
287,my family stayed at the royal olympic hotel for nights during our vacation the hotel is beautiful and walking distance to many sights attractions and restaurants we had a suite which was nice at the end of the day to have space for the family to hang out after sight seeing in the morning we loved returning to the hotel and enjoying the pool in the afternoon the pool serves food and drinks and was very relaxing the food we had pool side was very good we ate several evening dinners at the roof garden restaurant which has an amazing view of the parthenon and athens the food was delicious the morning breakfast was also delicious staff was very professional nice and helpful,1
288,for our second family stay at the royal olympic the impressions were the same and have even worsened this hotel is a bit deceiving for a but with a perfect location in the city center of rooms are comfortable clean quiet and spacious the wifi is working correctly only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand despite the easy control system this was much of a problem for one night but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel beginning with the reception hall arriving at the royal olympic does feel like arriving at a we arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time similarly the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our snacks to come a bit later on i also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected this was corrected only after we noticed is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the acropolis and the city center there is plenty,1
289,this is a basic budget friendly hotel that was adequate for our needs what it lacked in accommodations was made up for by the wonderful staff that offered assistance directions etc the only problem was that we were offered only key card which wa a little inconvenient we were concerned about the area initially because of the graffiti on the nearby buildings but did encounter any problems it was located right across from the archaeological museum which to me was the best museum also was close to good restaurants roof top area has distant view of the acropolis,1
292,we arrived late with a transprtation arrenged for us through the reservation center we were very wolcome to a spacious room very clean and great and a nice balcony the staff was very nice location is good close to nice area with cafes open till late night hours and very early morning,1
293,if my room at this hotel was larger i would give it five stars service was highly professional yet friendly and warm breakfast was plentiful with warm and cold did not find the location to be a disadvantage it is walking distance from the exarheia neighborhood known for its artists bohemians and great restaurants at affordable is about ten minutes walk from the stations and near a beautiful museum on my last visit to athens i stayed at the posh and expensive hotel grande bretagne as it was a business trip payed by my employer sure this was better but it was not any better in terms of access to the acropolis and other tourist destinations the best western museum hotel offers very good value for money,1
295,visited athens to catch up with relatives from the other side of the globe we could have picked a better hotel to start our journey around greece and italy the hotel staff and rooms were great the staff were so friendly and could not do enough for you they joined us when we laughed and ensured our family and friends were looked after it was like a star establishment highly recommended and thanks to the staff and particular the evening shift in the dining room and bar we had a you and all the best you were fabulous,1
296,we tried this restaurant during our walk downtown athens we were surprised by the variety of the menu for a light dinner the salad with prosciutto was amazing we also tried the greek cheeses dish and it was also good the chef with the eyeglasses was very helpful and he was explaining with politeness and professionnalisme all the details of the dishes best choice for a light dinner downtown,1
298,it was not too difficult to find with gps while the indoor parking is a test of the driver skill esp we had a big car there are plenty of outdoor parking around the hotel room is quite the bare minimum novotel is a usual in asia but this one would be our amenities are at just minimum towels were very thin the room was that comfortable overall to make me stay in longer lots of choices at breakfast with both hot and cold dishes staff looked very grumpy though hotel souvenir shop got some interesting stuff i like that the hotel installed a kinnect at the lobby this keeps the older kids entertained,1
299,this hotel just gets it right their most important assets are their employees people who stood out for us were the front desk especially maria and dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend extra days in athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship the location is excellent and close to almost everything the area seems a little dodgy at night however it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world perhaps safer than most there are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel with an excellent dessert shop right next door the rooms are spacious the public areas well laid out the food really good especially the breakfast and room service and the decor is modern yet functional this is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment i especially like the interactive smart tv in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device the wifi is free and fast the beds and pillows they have pillow menus are extremely comfortable and all areas including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after they have plugs next to the beds and also a usb charging cable for telephones or ipads the ac worked well especially during the celsius heat whilst we were there the rooms have fully stocked minibars and a highly quality brand of soap body lotion and,1
300,we had an adjoining room king bed and bath in one room king and pullout and bath in the other fantastic rooms great breakfast in the morning and extremely helpful hotel staff hop on hop off bus has stop right at square very near flea market and many other fun parts of athens,1
301,the location of the hotel could not have been more perfect it just a short drive from the airport and the hotel is centrally located in athens city center great design and a short walk to all the chicest restaurants and shops,1
302,with good access to metro and easy walking distance to lots of sights and restaurants this was a perfect place to stay in the city good cool room to escape to when the heat of the day became too much,1
303,we stayed here for two nights although the second night we have to leave at in the morning for a flight it was clean comfortable and walking distance to the old town area and acropolis breakfast was simple but ok the only negative is the desk controls the air conditioning and will only turn down to a certain level not to your comfort level this part was not comfortable we had a view of an abandoned building but were in the room much anyway easy to find your way around from here,1
304,we stayed here for nights as a family of children room was spacious kids slept on the sofa bed is very good and effective flat screen televisions on the wall infront of each bed mini bar available coffee machine only makes coffee no kettle or tea making facilities available several sockets available for charging devices though no usb sockets bathroom has excellent lighting and storage for many toiletry bags jacuzzi jets in bath was an absolute treat shower bath is a in only received toiletries on arrival not again towels good quality face cloths not available in room bathroom drainage did work so well but maintenance took care of that very impressed with the safe where electrical devices can be locked up while charging a very well thought through idea breakfast was a same same every single day not even the slightest variation in dishes being served dissapointment with the two greek pastry dishes very basic and really did impress us at all basic juice filter coffee and tea available any other beverages to be charged though no signs mentioning this anywhere we loved walking in to his hotel after a long day and it always smelled so fresh and clean cleanliness is staff are well trained professional and all so friendly except for one terribly rude young waitress who screamed at me and made a big scene at breakfast about me politely questioning why i was charged for my cappuccino the previous morning a friendly explanation would have done,1
305,reasonably priced hotel in a great location just off ermou near sintagmamany options on the nice breakfast buffet but they do start until am which is a problem when you have early flightsstaff are all pleasantmany options for dining within a short walkthe rooms here are small and could do with some modernisation and revamped bathroomsin house caffe has reasonable meals at good prices tooin room mini bar and safe were handywalls are very thin and neighbours were making a porno with a goat i think overall would i stay here again yeswould i recommend to my parents and friends yesnot quite the star i used to but it served the purpose,1
306,we stayed at athens cypria hotel three nights in late june to booked several months in advance rooms for two families a family unit for four people that included two double rooms with a connecting door and a superior triple room for three adults that included one king bed and one single bed separated by a partition also had a jacuzzi rooms were spacious clean and hotel location is excellent in a small and quiet alley that starts from the famous ermou street within walking distance to all major sights in the city minutes walk from syntagmatos hotel has been recently renovated which is a big plus its design is modern and pleasant the breakfast was excellent it included everything needed to open the day staff was friendly and courteous a very good choice to explore the city by foot,1
308,nice clean hotel staff always smiling and ready to help any time of the day or night i had a problem operating the air con controls however the reception send someone who replaced the controls and everything was we had a kettle on the room to boil water for coffee and tea i would have preferred the room service staff to have given us more tea bags than the customary ration of bags a day although this was not a problem as we could always get extra supply from coffee shop located on the ground floor the breakfast at this hotel is excellent they cater for all hotel is very centrally located within easy reach of all the archaeological sites restaurants and shopping hotel also gave us packed lunch for our early am departure for will be using the same hotel on return from mykonos,1
309,the location of the hotel is probably the best one in athens as from the rooms you have a great overview over the entire citiy to the akropolis and behind to the harbour and the sea if weather is clear you can reach all museums and sights be feet have good restaurants in the near and an open air cinema with good films in the evening directly in front of the hotel in the morning you can swimm in the pool on the roof or walk up the hill to the very top to have a marvelous view,1
310,first stayed here in returned again for one night before joining a cruise same high standard of service lovely breakfast on a high floor to overlook the acropolis fab rooftop pool with bar and sun loungers to enjoy the magnificent view thank you to the lovely staff on reception who booked us a meal at kuzina to return where we had eaten a memorable meal on their roof top in it was just as good this time i would highly recommend this hotel for any stay in athens,1
311,my wife and i stayed here for nights after sailing from venice the hotel was well staffed the room was fine on the lower ground floor with what is described as a courtyard view and had a nice balcony with chairs and table on it it looked out to some trees and a close up view of the next door bathroom was well equipped and quite well maintained we had a very comfortable bed made up of two singles booted together the pool area was quite well shaded but sun beds were at a premium the pool itself was very clean and a nice temperature the hotel is in an up market area of athens with some very nice eateries and cafes close by down the hill a bit,1
312,fantastic view from the balcony excellent service good location we stayd one night can recommend this hotel egen you stay in athens we hasa nice stay and will probably book this hotel again if we travel to athens,1
313,we stayed here two nights the first night after arriving in athens for our honeymoon and the last night before we left anthens at the end of our first night we stayed in the acropolis view room on the floor this room was the worst room we stayed in during our honeymoon it was very very small did work no hot water and old bathroom not what you would expect from a star last night we stayed in a standard room on the fourth floor the room and bathroom were much more modern and front desk service was good however they obviously push restaurants they work with they charged us euros for a miniature pringles chip absurd we stayed in hotels in mykonos santorini crete and this hotel was disappointing compared to the breakfast offered was very limited and again the worst breakfast at a hotel we had while in the price i would recommend trying to a find a better hotel as in my opinion this hotel is not a star hotel,0
314,this hotel is next to platia mavili easy access to metro very clean and safe hotel great coffee shop for snacks or meals the service is outstanding good breakfast provided daily rooms with king beds only have shower in bathroom while rooms with twin beds have tub,1
315,i stayed for one night during this trip and was very pleased for the low price i paid i got a clean room very clean bathroom and breakfast and free secure was included it has a lovely little café attached where you can get a coffee or sandwich without having to brave the heat if you do want to if you are so inclined though the hotel is only steps from eateries bars and even a few small supermarkets which is convenience personified when you are traveling the hotel is also within easy walking distance of the megaro mousikis metro stop which will take you straight into downtown athens to see sights like the acropolis and to shop at monastirakis and the plaka for myself personally the beds are very firm but other than that this hotel is perfect for the traveler highly recommend,1
316,i and other friends from the uk who have been with me think that the location is excellent and the airport bus stops very close to the hotel despite the busy road the rooms are quiet and only once have other guests created noise at night the hotel is very clean the staff are friendly the restaurant is attractive with a very good buffet breakfast after a busy day its nice to be able to get back to a very comfortable bed and a better mattress than is usual in greece the rooms are always very clean my last visit prompted me to write a review at last excellent value for the price i did manage to speak to the manager on my last visit and told her that i always found the staff and facilities very good,1
317,we stayed at the divani palace in early july the room was clean not that large for two and a kid and a bit outdated the staff was helpful and friendly but very little english the rooftop restaurant was ok but street restaurant there much better a very short walk to the acropolis and the plaka the area seemed very safe and friendly overall we really liked the divani palace and would definitely stay there again,1
318,we stayed at this hotel two years ago when visiting athens and recently spent a night there again this hotel is great value for a hotel in athens it just two train stops away from syntagma square and the bus from the airport basically stops a half block away from the hotel the lobby and rooms are spotless and they provide a very good complimentary breakfast and are also open for lunch and dinner there are restaurants and pubs within walking distance i would definitely stay here again and highly recommend for an affordable hotel in good location,1
320,were there from to july and had a great time with the family and especially the dinners at the sky lounge with the scenic view of the acropolis at night is a sight not to be missed i never seen such hospitality of the staff at the sky lounge what love and courtesy they serve is just love to visit athens again and stay here congrats to the team for an outstand no show,1
322,my husband and i stayed at the divani acropolis for three nights and enjoyed it very much we could see the acropolis from our room esp impressive when it is lit at night it is close to walk to the acropolis and the museum we walked the few blocks from the metro station after taking the metro from the airport and had no difficulty finding the hotel the bed was a king size and comfortable the bathroom had a large tub with a shower our hallway and room was freshly painted did feel tired to us the air conditioner kept the room at a comfortable temp and we did hear outside noise there was an outdoor pool which we used every afternoon as it was over degrees the week we were in athens it is easy to use the metro to get to the other areas of the city the staff were very friendly and helpful and the lobby is large and impressive we saw many different restaurants nearby as we were walking around the staff told us where to catch the xpress bus to take to the port for the cruise we were taking we would definitely stay there again,1
323,it was excellent staff breakfast rooms view location all very good value for money beach very near just walking distance like mins walk same to trams buses even closer it was very clean too i ll surely go there again,1
324,very nice and confortable place the food is good and rooms are clean not so big but was ok personal are kind nothing more to write about this place we stay there from seven days in the summer august of,1
325,we just came back from a family vacation in glyfada it was a great vacation and the hotel was on top of the success factors for the vacation the hotel location is quiet convenient as it is very close to a bus and tram stations and also a min walk to the beach and glyfada is a very clean and pleasant hotel the staff are very helpful they offer beautiful breakfast with a variety of fresh international and national dishes our room was spacious beds and pillows very comfortable and with an extraordinary view of the beach as our room was on the floor we were offered a fruit basket upon arrival and complementary coffee and tea service our housekeepers were our friends that were spending the vacation with us has booked a family room but not with sea view they did not receive the same hospitality they were not offered any welcome fruit basket not service in their rooms their housekeeping was also sloppy as their bathroom was not cleaned regularly nor their waste baskets emptied i would go back to this hotel anytime i am in glyfada,1
326,this beautiful hotel in which we stayed for nights is situated in the heart of kolonaki a fascinating neighborhood in central athens it is just a walk from evangelismos metro station but we walked always to syntagma approximately minutes it is such a nice walk and you can discover so many shops and nice restaurants doing so from arrival to departure everything was perfect the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and we miss the delicious breakfast already so much the greek caffe frappe was my personal highlight this hotel has such a lovely and relaxed atmosphere we chosen the superior room and it was perfect for us the room was always perfectly clean we would highly recommend this hotel and we are already thinking about to come back,1
327,we stayed here for our two nights in athens and it was really a perfect location and the price could not be beat the boutique feel and breakfast were wonderful and the staff went out of there way to help us when their usual touring company was unavailable for us in fact one of their staff members put together a complete day walking tour for us with a map and print outs of information for all the sights our room itself was just ok which is why i rating it at a our shower was draining really slowly the first night and the window shade did not work both were fixed by the next day one of the outlets in the bathroom also did not work but i just dried my hair in the bedroom definitely recommend them for the price and location there are also a number of great restaurants right around the corner,1
328,great ac comfy bed clean modern not best location as you are min walk from acropolis nice upscale part of town free refreshments drinks and snacks all day will try breakfast in morning great water pressure best robes i have ever tried in my life tiny tv fresh fruit waiting in room got room with starwood points no parking whatsoever,1
329,my husband and i spent a couple days in athens while on our honeymoon upon arrival after a very long flight the staff was extremely friendly offered us local food options and answered every question they even had a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us both times the rooms were clean and modern and the bed was so comfortable after a kong day of travel the breakfast in the morning was delicious and they had a constant supply of free snacks and drinks location was near so many restaurants shopping and history could be happier,1
330,not being an expert in athens this hotel is located in the richest area of athens with loads of restaurants nearby and in a peaceful area the rooms are fresh the beds are super comfortable and there are housekeeping ladies around everywhere resulting in the cleanest hotel ever nice touch is the free drinks and bites section which has wide choice and is completely free nice lounging area on the ground floor everything seems to be brand new and extremely well maintained,1
331,excellent hotel great staff and attentive we were two nights at different times in different rooms and in both cases was great and cleanwe arrived early and received a room in fifteen minutes in both cases did not let us wait call us taxis minutes drive from all attractionthe rabinovits,1
332,that was a very bad experience hotel was ok but the manager was so roude and unprofessional with clients and we arrived we asked him some coffe and water and the answers was i am not am the manager in the begining we where laughing how proffecional management but after his check in we where angryyou should change him immediately,0
333,adorable hotel clean and brand new minutes away from the city missing some extra facilities like pool and spa helping staff and good buffet great room service food only thing i would suggest is for them to warn people from pocket pickers phone got stolen in a coffee shop in monastiraki ps greeks are lovely people very welcoming,1
334,reviewvery reasonably priced for those on a budget with a great location to the main tourist sites resturants and shopping special thanks to bill front office manager who was extremely helpful and accommodating offering useful advice and great recommondations to our group during our day stay,1
335,i was here for nights and i paid nearly euros a night at first i was given a room which was on opposite side of the street it was very small and it had no window so i asked them to change it then i got a room that has a balcony to the street but the ac was not working fine and it was hot i asked them to have a look at it the second day and they fixed it i was happy with the service it was a best western class so i was not expecting something extra i heard the street was a place for prostitutes before and the polis cleaned it up however locals told me to be sharp when i was going back to the hotel at night i could see weird and junky people when i walked to a museum close to this hotel but nothing bad happened,1
336,stayed here for two nights before joining a princess cruise on royal took a taxi from the airport to the hotel which took about minutes taxis have a fixed change from the airport to the was quick and easy and the staff very helpful with local room was on the fifth floor and was a good size with very good air was included in the room booking which was good although a new toaster is required hotel is in area with a lot of closed shops and the area looks run read reports on here about people on drugs outside in the evening we never noticed any in the is near two metro arranged a taxi for us to the port again for a fixed rate,1
337,the location is good minutes walking to the closer metro station omonia green line and minutes walking to syntagma square metro green line is quite convenient as it direct to piraeus friendly and helpful staff clean room and quite good breakfast,1
339,we found hotel staff very friendly very comfortable and clean hotel with comfortable beds very good location on main road close to city center continental breakfast has good variety breakfast dining room also has several couches and coffee drinks bar which operates most of the day we found this room ideal and comfortable for i drink or coffee without having to going out i booked online and when paying there was no mistake to original to room quote and think room rates are quite good we would certainly go back,1
340,clean rooms and very good the internet speed was not good enough and there was no option for premium paid your room is looking to the avenue the noise good be significant,1
341,this was my first visit at this hotel as arrive often for business my usual hotel was duly booked so i chose this one and it was amazing small very modern and clean reception super friendly and helpful great alcohol at the bar of the hotel room was spacious and clean modern and equipped with all that needed including cold drinks coffee and bottle of wine also a large balcony breakfast is on the roof and super cool with nice view area you ca choose better in the center city but quiet area super chic with lots of high brands store and restaurants close to all shopping and tourist attraction will definitely return and stay there again,1
342,fantastic friendly and helpful staff breakfast improved further since last time rooms very nice and good value area superb a few things to improve would be easier to use air condition another lift as waiting times can be high at times cooler bed linen for the summer as the bed feels a bit too hot in the hot season in my opinion,1
343,athens was our first stop on a day holiday in greece and i was a bit skeptical about the city post recession and the customer service levels i was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality shown by everyone at this hotel the receptionist xristina was particularly helpful as she helped us making reservations and figure out our itinerary even for our next stop mykonos furthermore they were very flexible with the checkout time and offered a great breakfast the hotel is and feels very new and the location is perfect if you do want to be right in the middle of the action but want to be close enough,1
344,we have been for nights the welcome has been friendly and warmpeople in this hotel are very professional and they make you feel like at homein a pedestrian road so very quiettaxies are just at the cornermany bars and coffee in the areastrictly recommended to travelers in athens also because the old town in just at min walkperfect see you soon,1
345,i arrived here yesterday after canceling three other hotels in the center of athens while this cozy beautiful boutique hotel is centrally located but it quiet and away from crowd front desk ladies were most friendly and helpful in suggesting several tours breakfast is great the hotel is located in a residential posh area surrounded with high end stores but just minutes walk away from metro parliament national garden and many other activities i am enjoying my stay and will most definitely recommend and will return in future it feels like home thank you,1
346,hotel and rooms are nice not much of a view though hotel staff was very courteous and prompt in any requests hotel is about mins cab ride from main attractions approx to euros per ride this hotel has a very unique elevator persons at a time inconvenience breakfast buffet could be better,1
347,i stayed here on occassions it was perfect on both times rooms are spacious and very comfortable breakfast wonderful location excellent located within walking distance of the acropolis charming little restaurants nearby downside was tv had no english channels,1
348,traveling with our children we needed a nice but affordable hotel in athens he hotel was perfect for our needs and we got two rooms very nice hotel and the man at the front desk spoke english and was very nice breakfast was free and had an excellent variety with something for everyone just remember that the key card needs to be in the slot on the wall in order for the lights and ac to work the hotel is not directly near the main attractions such as the acropolis but this is what makes it more affordable and it only a minute drive from acropolis area we highly recommended this hotel for the price,1
349,we arrived a bit early but the receptionist was very kind and after a few minutes allowed us early check in and with kids this really helped very friendly at no hassle gave us good directions and advice the room was huge very comfy beds clean aircon was working breakfast was good and freshly prepared people serving were very helpful and kind my kids enjoyed the jacuzzi bathroom is huge and the toiletries are fabulous nice hotel when travelling with kids the hotel is not directly near the main attractions such as the acropolis but this is what makes it more affordable and it only a minute drive from acropolis area we highly recommended this hotel for the mins drive to plaka,1
351,lovely place to stay very nice interior very central with great breakfasts room was a little small but that is probably typical of athens staff were very friendly and helpful and gave good suggestions as to where to eat,1
352,we spent one night in athens and the hotel location was great the room was a good size and nicely furnished the bathroom was not well laid out and difficult to manoeuvre the shower was located in the narrow bath and it was extremely slippery and only had a shower curtain which constantly stuck to you the room was not very soundproof and every time someone left their room you could hear every noise breakfast was pleasant with the usual yoghurt scrambled eggs assorted cakes and hotel reception smells of cigarette view from the rooftop bar is fantastic,1
353,soaking in a jacuzzi with a full view of the acropolis unbeatable blissfully quiet next to the pedestrian alley of the acropolis area no car noise great breakfast with home baked bread and cakes,1
354,herodion is in a great location right below the acropolis the acropolis museum and the plaka it has a great view of the acropolis from some of the hotel rooms as well as the restaurant they have a great breakfast buffet that included in the hotel price but what made it great is the cleanliness and the great staff they really make you feel welcome we stayed here multiple times between july and august and definitely will return in the future,1
355,our family of stayed in four rooms for a couple days before a sailing trip through the greek islands the hotel is ideally located with breath taking views of the acropolis and an easy stroll to old town i have been there before on business but had to return with my family because dinner on their roof with the views of the acropolis ca be overstated their food and their greek salad were among the best we experienced during our days in greece the staff is unusually attentive as an example my youngest son arrived separately from the airport as he entered the hotel one of the staff casually asked how much he paid for his taxi the staff member said he was overcharged and ran out to the driver and made the driver refund my son the overage where else have you ever heard of a hotel staff being so proactive there are lots of other examples of how helpful the staff was as well i would stay there again without question or hesitation,1
356,we stayed at the hotel for nights two weeks ago the hotel is very nice the public areas are well maintained and the staff is very helpful breakfast was very good the room was nice and clean but the bathroom was not very clean and needs some improvements i have to say that we did complain i guess that if we did talk to someonethey would have done something about hotel is not really in the city center if you are a tourist to get to the main attractions you need a taxi or a train,1
358,located near the ancient monuments the outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff constandina made our stay special with her recommendations on how to get around the city with her help we saw more than we would have thought possible,1
359,rooms are great but the airconditioning never worked properly the restaurant views are superb and the reception staff were exceptional and extremely helpful we had dinner one night the food was not great but the fried feta starter was superb,1
360,need a beautiful drink and some lunch or a snack with the acropolis within touching distance the athens gate is the place great drinks delicious food great staff and beautiful bathrooms a must for a well earned tourist break,1
362,location the view on the acropolis the view on the ancient ruins the staff is very nice and welcoming breakfast is nice the decoration of the rooms is nice rooms are small for the price even though the equipment is nice i think it a bit overpriced compared to the price in the surroundings nice hotel well located but a bit pricey for the room size,1
363,this hotel was wonderful it was very clean with modern amenities and a friendly staff it was reasonably priced and exceeded our expectations the location was central to all of the must see attractions of athens i would definitely stay here again,1
364,we stayed in two hotels while in athens we left for bulgaria and returned the amalia is wonderful great location friendly staff rooms gorgeous bar and a delicious breakfast i highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting athens,1
366,we stayed at the amalia upon arrival of our journey in the region and loved the was my husbands birthday and the hotel staff surprised us with a celebration the staff was accommodating to every need the location was fabulous located within walking distance to all the places we wanted to visit the roof top is a great place to enjoy a private evening and the balcony in our room was a great bonus the breakfast was wonderful,1
367,very nice and comfortable local boutique hotel with great amenities fabulous breakfast and awesome location we stayed here for nights total and felt like home it is a gem in heart of syntagma square,1
368,a bit tricky if you arrive to the hotel by car the street outside is a busy road and there are only a very small space to park while you check in the location is excellent with views overlooking the park and the parlament and with walking distance to a lot of the sights in central rooms are elegant and normal in size the bathrooms are quite big and very nicely designed breakfast offers a large variation so no matter your diet find something on the buffét the only disappointment was the lobby bar food was not that good and expensive and when i ordered champagne i was told it cold so please put the champagne in the fridge and come back joke aside i would absolutely come back to this hotel again,1
370,we checked in around after spending hours on the ferry the lovely lady at the counter welcomed us and gave us our room it was on the floor very quiet and nice and cool with the ac the room was spacious and very clean we were also stoked to have a queen bed hermes is a minute walk from the train station and the square the included breakfast was very yummy with plenty of options one of the staff members checked on us at breakfast and helped us with some sightseeing ideas very pleased we stayed we will certainly stay again if we come back to athens,1
371,i stayed at hermes hotel for the two nights i was in athens before heading down to kefalonia and could have been happier with my choice hermes was very modern updated and right in the center of plaka a minute walk from the acropolis and center city not to mention the staff was very friendly and accommodating a wonderful experience all around i would recommend hermes to anyone staying in athens,1
372,fantastic location across from the parliament building with an awesome terrace with a view of acropolis and the entire city of athens hotel amalia is one of the nicest and customer friendly hotels i ever stayed at it is luxury but everything you need it there front desk is souper friendly and helpful restaurant is actually very good we were avoiding dining there because we did expect good and reasonably priced food the last day waiting for a taxi to bring us to the airport we dined there and were very happy also we ordered a bottle of amalia house wine tasty and cheap definitely recommended,1
373,the staff at hermes are some of the friendliest i ever met in a hotel they genuinely care about your stay and are very helpful the room we had was very cozy and spacious and was clean and well maintained perfect for getting some good rest after a day in the hot streets of included breakfast is amazing and we loved that the location is within walking distance to everything we definitely stay again,1
374,my husband and i recently spent nights at central athens hotel we are very pleased with our decision to stay in this hotel the rooms are spacious by european standards clean and modern the staff is very friendly and were helpful with any of our questions about the city or traveling in the area the rooftop bar was excellent we made a point to have at least one drink there every evening of our trip and we were never disappointed by the drinks or the view in addition we very pleased with the complimentary breakfast buffet you get a wide variety of choices including those that are and more authentic greek dishes central athens will even pack you a breakfast if you must depart before the buffet opens as was the case with our last found the location to be fine it is an easy walk minutes from the syntagma metro station which is a major stop for most modes of transit to and from the airport it is also less than a minute walk to the major flea market area of athens which we loved the walk to the acropolis was a bit longer but it could not have been more than minutes evidently athens is currently summer experiencing some domestic unrest but we never felt unsafe during our only problem that we have with the central athens hotel is the spottiness of their wifi it is free but it is also incredibly unreliable just be aware,1
375,my wife and i stayed at the crown plaza for several nights after a cruise of the greek islands the staff warmly greeted us upon our arrival and provided us with a map of the area and suggestions for shopping and sight seeing our room was on the club level floor that entitled us to extra amenities that included the club room that was always stocked with a very nice selection of beverages and snack food this was a very nice extra that we took advantage of on a regular basis it was also a nice area to socialize with other guests we also paid extra for the breakfast package that i would highly recommend a very nice selection of breakfast foods in a very nice dining area our room was very nice with a very comfortable bed the bathroom was top notch especially compared to other european bathrooms very roomy clean and nicely decorated the room also included a stocked refrigerator safe and plenty of closet space there were two disappointments with the room that i would not expe,1
376,after a month of hotels eight in all hermes might be the very best in part the staff eva oana push my rating over the limit of stars this will be my first choice for my next trip to athens the location is perfect it is just outside the crazy plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets it takes minutes to walk to the acropolis ancient agora or the fabulous national archeological museum the rooms are solid and silent i never heard any noise from other rooms or the street the finishing is beautiful if you like polished marble bathrooms floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet breakfast food selection is great everything from the basic toasts different breads with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats there are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections the finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time for example eva knew after the first day that we had daughters she readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and i look for a table in none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four lastly someone on tripadvisor said the walk to the national museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea oana told us,1
377,my daughter and i stayed at the marble house while vacationing in athens and it was the perfect location with a cozy clean friendly atmosphere it close to public transportation and easy walking distance to all the sites and museums highly recommended,1
378,hotel is well situated very clean staff is very friendly and helpful the view is amazing pool was very well kept water could be a little warmer staff at the pool could be a little faster i would recommend this hotel to everyone looking forward to returning,1
379,my wife and i stated here for two nights the room was clean and redecorated with a modern standard the hotel is located in a walking distance to acropolis restaurants shops etc the staff was very helpful and service minded they even helped us booking bus and ferry tickets from athens to one of the islands in greece i have no problem staying here again,1
380,do be fooled by the aging exterior the rooms are very modern with high quality finishes several offering magnificent views of the acropolis pluses include amazing pool phenomenal rooftop bar setting and first class spa despite the amazing setting however service at the rooftop bar is nearly abysmal and a negative incentive to go up there overall the service was very good it a good mile plus walk to plaka so plan accordingly especially in the hot months i would be happy to stay here again,1
381,the hotel located in the quiet area very close to the acropolis metro station mins walking to the acropolis entrance and the busy plaka area the receptionists were friendly and efficient when checked in we told them that we needed to depart earlier than their restaurant breakfast opening of am they sent within an hour prepacked breakfast to our room when we returned from mateora we stayed in hera hotel again and enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the restaurant the breakfast had limited choice but still good quality and with plenty of vegetable standard rooms we stayed were well equipped but tight in space two of us slim in size with two pieces of medium size luggage found it uncomfortable to move around the rooms and bathrooms were tidy there were no clothes hooks in the tight bathrooms nowhere we could hanged the wet towel etc bedding was comfortable and towel smelled fresh soft clean the sound insulation with the neighboring room was weak one time we had a noisy neighbor and we could hear her talking whole night long,1
382,we stayed at the hera twice at the beginning and end of our stay in greece in june initially we were so tired from the long flight it was a wise choice to have allowed an extra day rooms are small but well furnished comfortable clean beds and a nice view on the upper floors facing the street front the breakfast buffet included foods we have at home with local sausages bread and fresh yogurt and staff is friendly and helpful even after we blew a breaker with a power strip plugged into an adapter they also arranged a taxi to the airport both times we had to leave and made sure our second stay was at an upper floor with a balcony street roof garden restaurant was also amazing see the separate review,1
383,if is what you are doing in athens then this is your place you can walk out and zip to the acropolis and the acropolis museum in about two seconds you are nicely set up to walk almost anywhere in athens our room had a nice view of the acropolis so pretty at night there a cute little restaurant on the top floor where you can grab a drink or have dinner with great views the staff at the front desk is so helpful and can advise you on anything an everything in the city love this place,1
384,we enjoyed our stay at this property excellent service great location comfortable rooms and great views the executive lounge had great options with friendly and helpful staff all staff spoke english and made sure they offered their help,1
385,marble house is really centrally located easy walking distance to the historical sights and fun shops and hotel itself is very clean and nice i loved our room it had a great deck and the staff were friendly and helpful at such low prices i definitely did not expect such high quality service i recommend this to anyone looking for a good value within walking distance of sites it does have a shared bathroom situation if that bothers you,1
386,hotel was situated in a great place near the acropolis the daily breakfast was very good we were able to walk to all major attractions from this location and many restaurants were very close by staff was friendly and rooftop bar was cool,1
387,we have just left from a night stay at hera hotel the hotel itself is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location walking distance to everything you would need for a stop over in athens the rooms are of a hotel standard with a delicous buffet breakfast what makes this hotel is the staff the reviews are all true the care and genuine desire the staff have towards making you stay in athens a wonderful experience is commendable thank you hera hotel,1
388,wonderful service nice breakfast and perfect location to meander around the acropolis the front desk staff helped with every question we had we had a very pleasurable stay would recommend if you are looking for star hotel,1
389,we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite upon our arrival at reception we were offered two double rooms instead which was a very welcome surprise this amazing service continued throughout our stay we were just minutes walking distance away from the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka if you get a chance book a rooftop table at their sister hotel herodion just around the corner for a spectacular sunset dinner with view of the acropolis,1
390,the philippos is always the best we love staying there and enjoying their fantastic hospitality there is no better location you can walk everywhere or catch the metro easily yet it is just enough in the neighborhoods to be quiet at night when you want it to be top rating every time,1
391,wien you book a hilton you know you are going to a top hotel this one has a fantastic pool a great gym and spa very much appreciated the welcome drink at the roof bar with a fantastic view great breakfast buffet and friendly employees who could ask for anything more,1
392,booked this place for our trip to athens got it as a steal the best cheapest way to reach from airport will be to take the express bus right side of departure gate and get down at syntagma square last stop this is almost an hour drive and take a taxi kms to the hotel not many know this hotel by name due to its location you need to specify that its on aristogitonos lane alternatively you can take the airport to monastiraki by metro mins ride and min walk to hotel careful if you have lots of luggage as this station is filled with few people who bombard tourists pros of acs colourful budget rooms with basic amenities top floor ones offer a good greek breakfast loaded with bread cheese served from early you can book your hop in hop off bus tickets at self service tea biscuits at the great location to access and enjoy local food street joints hard rock cafecons of acs very poor response to they are under staffed probably offseason may be location does get lonely at night as its in between a market,1
393,i booked this hotel last minute after changing my travel plans and boy did i make the right decision first of all this property is minutes from the new beautiful acropolis museum south slope of the acropolis itself as well as the plaka the location seriously could get better next the staff was so friendly and helpful at all times their hospitality is some of the best i ever encountered traveling the room was comfortable and the breakfast spread was very nice to fuel up with in the morning before adventuring out highly recommend this property,1
394,the hotel is perfectly located to visit athen s main attractions you can easily walk to monastiraki or the acropolis to the syntagma square but also to the national archaeological museum just to mention a few the metro stations at monastiraki and omonia square are just a five away we came back to the hotel for the second time and stayed two nights as the first time our room was clean the staff was very kind and helpful and the roof top terrace with its view to the acropolis is just door of the bathroom could not be closed well and during the night from saturday to sunday it was quite loud outdoors music,1
395,pros close to everything modern clean rooms two elevators a mini fridge eggcellent breakfast great roof bar spectacular view from roof helpful staff adequate wifi cons small rooms thin walls,1
396,we were invited to a wedding in athens and getting ready for such an event is not easy even in your own home the centrotel was a great choice spacious rooms clean comfy beds a lot of mirrors big bathroom surprisingly quiet i slept better than in any hotel ever the air conditioning works very well there are even small lights like stars on the ceiling that change colour the staff is extremely nice quick and helpful they make you feel comfortable they gave us a map of the city upon arrival and after that gave us tips on how to get to the places we needed to whenever we left the hotel we needed an iron it was brought to our room by the time we took off the elevator from the reception to our floor they even let us leave our car in the garage for a few hours after we had checked out because we wanted to do the free walking tour in the hotel is close to victoria and larissa ab metro stations which are just a few stops from the acropolis and the city centre but being close to the train station the neighborhood is a bit unpleasant not very clean weird people etc although we never had any problems even later at night the garage is underground and there were enough parking spots but it is narrow so if you have a bigger car you will need to manoeuvre time we are in athens,1
398,do let the entrance to the hotel worry you from the outside set pretty much in a bustling market the hotel seems like it star but once you get to your room you realise you truly made a great choice by staying here we first got a room on the floor and had to ask to change rooms as the window was literally looking out directly onto another building just a stone throws away it was so claustrophobic we asked to change rooms and we were given the top floor room wow what a difference we were literally looking at the acropolis the bed is comfortable works well loved the laundry service where they do a whole bag of your laundry for a very small fee within hours the breakfast was excellent too varied on different days with extremely friendly staff the location is perfect so close to everything sensational local eateries right around the corner wine bars local shops coffee shops no tourists in sight i would definitely come back if i could be guaranteed a higher floor room the bar on the rooftop has wonderful views just feels like it can do with some more decorating,1
399,we stayed here for two nights we got an upgraded room that was words of staff but do know if it was real or just our room the room was very big bathroom too the room was very well soundproofed the staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was just normal instead of others comments i do think it is super basic plates orange juice greek yogourt croissant breads cake few jams peach eggs and bacon coffee and tea that all i think so the price is a bit expensive but it is vacation after all anyway the hotel is at a good location by feet from victoria station green line and by feet from larissa station red line or regular trains,1
400,this hotel should have at least stars and maybe even four i could not believe how nice it was for the price the room is comfortable and well equipped i loved the tiny lights in the ceiling above the bed that change colours you can opt not to use them best of all you get a hydrobath basically a spa tub which is wonderful to relax in at the end of a hard day touring round athens my room had a lovely little balcony as well the areas downstairs are comfortable everything is spotlessly clean the restaurant offers breakfast for euro a buffet where you can stuff yourself with a selection of sweet and savoury foods cereals fruit coffee juice etc staff are friendly and knowledgeable about pretty much everything in athens room service was so quick i barely had time to put the phone down before a lovely member of staff was knocking on my door they go out of their way to help you with directions advice on local places to eat this hotel was recommended to me by a friend who lives in greece and when i read the reviews i was a bit concerned about some of the things people said about the area this is a very well located hotel it about minutes walk from the metro victoria station a lovely square with nice restaurants on it and even more places to eat within a minute walk and all incredibly good and cheap it takes,1
401,we stayed at centrotel hotel for four days and it was fantastic the hotel interiors are very clean modern and comfortable the location was perfect for us very close to victoria metro station which is two stops away from monastiraki station square which is excellent for restaurants views of the acropolis and the famous flea markets we were able to get from the airport to the hotel no problems via the metro at the cost of you can also purchase a metro ticket for the city for days at each which was also perfect for us due to our early flight home we preferred to book a taxi back to the airport which the hotel was more than happy to arrange for us taxi was fixed price they also provide breakfast for euros if you are hungry in the morning the staff were super helpful recommending local restaurants on the first night as we arrived late providing us with a map and advice on how to get around the city i ca fault was a little apprehensive about the reviews regarding the neighbourhood but i would say there is nothing to worry about yes there are some migrants walking around but it is like that all over athens not just at the hotel even in the main tourist attractions there were migrants walking around and begging so do let this stop you booking this gem of a definitely would stay again and also try out the jet stream baths in,1
402,very nice hotel in athens the location around the hotel do look that great but i thought it was very safe walked around in the night with no problem and people who lived around there were very nice the hotel is clean and very comfortable and the bathroom was nice too,1
403,we stayed at the areos hotel for nights in july at first sight the area a bit intimidating but actually it not bad the hotel is well located and many places of interest are within walking stayed in a superior room and deliberately requested a room at the back of the hotel away from the main road it was quiet and very comfy the bathroom and shower were huge it was also nice to have a staff were all pleasant friendly and extremely helpful they booked a couple of tours for us explained the metro system and how to get to various places overall our stay was very pleasant and we definitely go back,1
404,great hotel great staff love my greek peeps harris british george frank lopez stefania dimitri sweaty hands mr george vanessa calypso maids amazing rooms great loved my stay there thank you,1
405,we stayed nights in the upper floor suite it is a very spacious apartment with a seating area facing lykabettus hill bedroom is comfortable very bright and has glass on both sides there are also a large terrace and even additional balcony from bedroom which we did not use due to some chilly weather in april but we enjoyed our inside seating area with a view while having afternoon tea with sweets from local bakeries long corridor leads to a spacious bathroom honestly i think that the design is too unnecessary fancy and i did not figure out how to use it except as a shower it was slightly uncomfortable for me to get it and out because of very high bath tub and narrow glass door access nevertheless shower head was wonderful and water pressure was excellent needless to say all was very personal is young friendly and helpful breakfast buffet was good wifi worked well we were not disturbed by street noise to notice it or to comment about it we found hotel location as totally safe walk to metro station was easy and short and one time we walked down to monastiraki without transportation archaeological museum is really close to the hotel and it turned a bonus for us as we went to this museum twice during our short stay archaeological museum collection is so marvelous and rich and grand that one visit is not enough,1
406,myself and two friends stayed here for a girlie city break the hotel as expected is on a hill clue in the title and about a minute walk from the entrance to the acropolis to head up to the parthenon it is also a min walk to the panathaneic stadium and about to monesteraki which has nice restaurants and the markets the hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful haris was great and as three ladies in athens told us how to stay safe even offering to challenge any taxi that tried to over charge us the room was fine we had a triple which was two singles and then another bed across the base of them bathroom and shower were adequate and there was a little balcony but it overlooked the adjacent property and there were alot of trees so we did not use it breakfast was included in our deal and was continental with usual pastries yoghurts cereals meats etc but also scrambled eggs very good plus bacon and the little frankfurter sausages the hotel does have a small pool to cool off in and a roof terrace with a nice view of the parthenon overall really lovely place and would absolutely recommend it,1
407,my boyfriend and i stayed for nights at acropolis hill and enjoyed every minute of it the room was clean and spacious with a comfy bed and modern decor throughout the breakfast buffet was lovely my favourite was the greek yoghurt with fruit our room was on the floor which meant the rooftop terrace was a few seconds away we made use of this in the mornings and evenings the view is just too good to miss the hotel is located very centrally which means you can walk to all the best attractions we spent the whole holiday on foot i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an enjoyable stay in athens,1
408,we didn t really know what we were getting when we reserved rooms at this hotel but we were soon to be very information said the hotel had a view and it sure elevator holds three bags and a thin woman but the stairs are rooms are small but nice and the air conditioner workers were helpful and friendly especially terrace on the floor could use some umbrellas and other items to make it more comfortable we still enjoyed beer on the terrace with a great view of the acropolis met some other travelers from other countries sat next to the pool had decent breakfasts and could walk any and everywhere we needed including to the acropolis there is plenty of shopping eating and site seeing within walking distance i would stay at this hotel again without hesitation,1
409,i stayed at the acropolis hill hotel from june and it did not disappoint the rooms are modern and a nice size the hotel staff were very hospitable and helped get you where you needed to go the included breakfast was excellent and had many delicious options the hotel is conveniently located in athens just a minute walk to the acropolis and a minute walk to the plaka and the metro there a rooftop garden with a beautiful view of the acropolis at night it a nice spot to bring a bottle of wine and enjoy the fireworks i would definitely stay at the acropolis again,1
410,i was lucky they upgrade my room to suite and it was perfect the breakfast was very good it is a very good hotel clean and near the city center the service also was very good the staff was very polite,1
411,we had an amazing experience staying here the staff was always helpful and the breakfast was delicious if you ever called up the reception or room service they would delivery and cutlery you asked for within minutes it was a very small and cozy hotel with a homely feeling it also had many grocery stores and restaurants nearby and was not very far from the centre,1
412,stayed for days july thru the room was beautiful so was the bathroom the complimentary breakfast was excellent and consistently so every best thing about this hotel is the front office staff very respecful and helpful and honest my wife forgot her earrings and sunglasses in the room when we got to our next stop in germany we called the hotel and spoke to nickos one of the front office mangers and told us that they found them and sure enough he shipped them to germany the next definitely recommend this hotel it is a great symbol of the great greek hospitality,1
413,yes location fits around athens to a t first class location great service throughout stay even a complementary hair dressers nicely cutting ones hair to complement an extra good will part of trip very nicely situated all created by karen my trip adviser,1
414,clean rooms and bathroom good i recommend a room at the back as it in staff and concierge are very friendly and breakfast with hot and cold options and fresh fruit eggs can be cooked to order although this is not is an onsite hairdresser eleni who is fabulous she trimmed my fringe and gave me a fantastic blow dry out of days what an amazing service,1
415,guest relations nightmare two reservations made for the same night paid for in advance one through third party agent other through hotel website family is due to arrive into athens early september we only require one room i have asked the hotel if there were interconnecting rooms advised no rooms of that have paid close to aud for two rooms for one night i asked if it was possible to remove one of the rooms and perhaps use the cost in theory to upgrade to a room facing the acropolis request deniedi was told that i could just cancel the room via the third party agent spoke to ihg guest relations explained the situation the agent was helpful and understanding at no point did i ever seek a refund knowing that the terms were prepayment and the agent contacted the property directly on my behalf to try and negotiate some sort of upgrade given the cost of the room unfortunately the guest relations agent was advised no i would have to pay for have a young family two children under they can not utilise the other room to be honest i am not upset that i booked two rooms i take responsibility for that however i was hoping the property could see it was a mistake and perhaps compensate us a little so am i looking forward to my stay no sure all i know i have tried to contact a management and there is no response i am hoping,0
417,this hotel lives up to its brand name the service is always pleasant the breakfast is great and the rooftop bar has a fabulous view all this is to be expected from a star establishment however if you do get a refurbished room the decoration is passable the pool is too small the drinks are expensive in the bar a mojito nice little shop straight on and on corner right for cheap local food go to vassilis right and follow signs,1
418,we were two couples in june wanted to have a hotel in the plaka district but all the affordable stars hotels were unavailable so we ended with this lovely hotel the room is spotless and spacious the bed which is very important to me when i travel is very comfortable also the pillows the amenities in the bathroom is standard there is no toothpaste and toothbrush and no shaving kit but honestly i did expect due to its price there is also a free shuttle to the center but we did use it the breakfast is okay there not much variety but i was pleased with got a massage in the spa which was very very good the service is very good and very reliable also the business room is very practical we made a check in to the flight and had them parented without any the last day when we finished our breakfast and intended to get in a taxi to the airport one employee of the breakfast worker came and gave us an phone which our friend forgot in all it a very good experience,1
419,view the parthenon from our variety of breakfast clean bus from hotel to syntagma square is very useful for free since i am an ihg i had a good stay,1
420,i was very impressed to take my family to such a nice hotel we ordered a bedroom apartment which was very clean and modern beds were very comfortable and facilities in great condition we ordered room service as we had just left a full day tour and were very tired the meals were very reasonably priced and very tasty hotel was also in a quiet location and we all had a good nights rest breakfast buffet was included and offered a wealth of options thank you for your hospitality,1
421,staff very helpful serviceminded and polite room was nice and clean bed comfterable room cleaned every day as new towels and soap provided wifi available good positive experience,1
422,after weeks of intense we decided to splurge a little on some comfort and we were not disappointed golden age hotel had all the necessary amenities they had great food available through room service the greek salad and chicken fillets were oily but tasty the hotel was above and beyond but it was very well equipped and staffed and what was needed for rest and comfort there were some instances that we had issues with the wifi but the front desk was quick to assist however possible successfully the hotel is about a minute walk from all the major attractions such as the acropolis museum etc or a minute uber ride away during the time we were there we found uber to be much more affordable than the local taxis using an uber to travel to the airport or just outside uber should be driving directly into the airport will save you some addition the hotel staff member olympia who came to clean our room was incredibly friendly she had the most vibrant personality and was always happy to help teach us greek and make us feel welcomed kostas at the front desk was also incredibly kind overall a very positive experience,1
423,stayed here as part of a cosmos group and it was my favourite hotel throughout our tour of staff and concierge at reception were so friendly and not the fake friendly it actually felt genuine they spoke impeccable english and were beyond has a vast array of different meals to suit everyone sometimes the waiters are a little slow to offer address you and offer you coffee but a minor restaurant also offers lunch and dinner and has quite good are comfortable spacious clean and the air conditioning functions well a must in greece very good location minute walk to the metro which gets you to the centre in stops and the acropolis in stops with a line stay here again,1
424,stayed july hotel is located right in the heart of constitution square rooms are very clean and the staff is exceptional the breakfast buffet is very good this hotel is within walking distance from a lot of restaurants coffee shops and shopping there is also high end shopping within walking distance with the road closed off so you can walk in the streets,1
425,what a great hotel this was we stayed here for about days and were amazed and so happy about the hospitality and services at this hotel very friendly staff a big shout out to nikos who helped me with translating some greek meds the breakfast is very very good filling hearty and good coffee we felt weird if our day did start with the breakfast it better than the hilton breakfast there a gym but we did use it as we were out a lot but when we stayed in room service was splendid the restaurant is also fantastic very good food and quit affordable there also a myriad of good restaurants nearby too better room service pizza than italy in this reviewer opinion mini bar was stocked though but we bought our own cheap but delicious greek wine i called down and they even sent up an opener other hotels did not do this we even asked to use an iron and ironing board metro is close walking distance to city squares convenience store mins away for snacks and such and the are amazing we wish we collected some more for the rest of our trip without a doubt we would stay here again,1
426,this hotel was very nice the rooms were spacious the staff were friendly the only drawback was the room stunk of cigarettes even though it was supposed to be a nonsmoking floor the breakfast was great it right on syntagma so the location was perfect there are many nearby shops and restaurants and the area is well lit and safe,1
427,hotel is dated but well maintained in the center of tourism just across from greek parliament good nightly rates this said clerk talks of breakfast at checkin as though it included likely it not so ask prior to taking your breakfast otherwise you might get a surprise at the end a good star hotel with character and close to it all,1
428,sure there may be newer hotelrooms in athens but i may not use a calory to find it out best location in the city excellent service spacious comfortable rooms very good breakfast buffet and helpful staff i come back here each time in athens,1
429,my fiancée and i stayed three nights at the polis grand in may the room was fantastic the staff at the were helpful and the hotel itself is within a reasonable distance from the major attractions surrounding the plaka district best of all the outstanding array of cuisine to wake up to in the morning,1
430,clean hotel with good central acres to all areas friendly staff excellent breakfast buffet the roof top bar is one of highlights with view over the city the room is small but sufficient for persons,1
431,stayed here just one night hotel room is basic but was all everything i needed for the night easy to get to convenient location staff were very friendly and bed was comfy only walked around during the day time but area seemed safe enough,1
432,the hotel is a decent size building very clean and well presented the staff are unbelievably helpful nothing was any trouble all the staff went above and beyond but vassilis was a standout for us there were of us in total my family from america were unlucky enough to have a suitcase go missing from the airport but the hotel staff were non stop in trying to locate it for hotel is very well placed for the acropolis and syntagma square etc and most attractions were within walking distance the rooftop has a real wow factor when you first walk in there at night but the service seemed a bit slow for drinks as has been mentioned in previous reviews the breakfast is really good lots of variety to cater for all tastes from fruit various breads drinks etc it was a very nice experience the bedrooms were a little small but about right for a city hotel why only stars the lifts were very small hot and slow and there were only two in operation the kids were happy to use the stairs but it was a little frustrating sometimes waiting for the lifts all in all a very easy going and positive experience which i would recommend to anyone next time we are in athens i will certainly you for looking after us,1
433,our stay here for a total of three nights during our honeymoon recently was great the people working at the hotel were very kind and their service was amazing the location was very central to everything we had planned the acropolis and many great restaurants and bars were in walking distance we will definitely be returning here on our next stay,1
434,as a professional hotelier of some years i can say our time at this gem of a hotel was exceptional we stayed here for four nights from july till the andreas and his team are super friendly professional and bend over backwards to make sure nothing is too much trouble we are a family of four and did not feel uncomfortable to the contrary felt very comfortable as some rooms can accommodate four people as i would say this hotel is more suited for couples very cool vibe with beautiful bedrooms the hotel is beautiful with very tasteful decor quality furnishings huge bedrooms gorgeous bathroom with a cast iron tub in the room in addition to a shower in the bathroom luxury toiletries nescafe coffee machine plush towels and bathrobes andronis is extremely well located in the heart of athens in a very cool and trendy area of athens called psirri full of restaurants and quirky stores and located near all the major attractions of athens but did not feel touristy at all we would definitely stay in this area hidden secret of andronis has to be the restaurant it is highly underrated and not much advertised but hands down i have to say as a massive foodie and a hospitality professional the food is exceptional although we only had the pleasure of the breakfast i can safely assume the rest of the menu which looked very scrumptious indeed has to be amazing overall i must say with all the,1
435,nothing happens for a reason we were not even supposed to stay in athens but after our flight to milos was cancelled we had to quickly find an hotel in athens for the lucky were we to find this gem first the service was just great we felt welcomed as we stepped on the restaurant floor there is no hotel reception very friendly but yet very room we had the room on the floor so we had this huge deck with a nice little place to sit outside with a nice overall view you ask for a nicer room the bed was really comfortable nice bath little kitchenette the room was extra location we stay long enough to experience the city but it is really centrally located it is located in a little street with some bars and restaurants so it can get a bit noisy but we mind it and being on the floor kind of cut down the restaurant we ate at the restaurant for a late dinner and it was great we went with recommendations from the waiter and were not disappointed a lot of items on the menu did look only sad thing is that we were there for only one short night as we needed to leave at to take the ferry but they were nice enough to bring us a full cabaret of things yogourt fruits croissants etc for breakfast the night before so we could eat even if the restaurant was not opened,1
436,june we arrived at our hotel polis grand in athens and were completely exhausted from the flight plus a hour time zone difference the hotel is a in my opinion the hotel itself is clean but like many european hotels the room is very small as is the bathroom however the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it they put out a lot of hot and cold dishes plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast too many things to list including the drinks overall this hotel is nice and the service is friendly and is good for a quick day stopover on your way to see other part of greece greek isles while i am here i will take this opportunity to mention our day stay in we got to our hotel at from the airport they told us that check in time was and after so we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of athens and eventually wound up at the monastiraki square we had a gyros and went back to our hotel to take a nap we woke up a little later and went back to eat dinner at monastiraki in the evening this is a very lively place full of lights music shops street vendors and live bands it was entertaining as far as the food goes it was good but unfortunately being from toronto i can not in all,1
437,andronis athens is not really a hotel per se it consists of only rooms which i was completely aware of at the time of booking we booked an acropolis view room which i not sure was the best room for us the acropolis view suite is on the top floor and consists of levels with the bedroom being on the top level accessible by a very steep spiral staircase even though my husband and i are both very fit and work out all the time the stairs were a pain not to mention pretty dangerous if needing to get up in the middle of the night or if one had had one too many cocktails the top floor location also made cooling it very difficult granted the temperatures in athens were in the but we had to close the curtains and keep the air on all day to ensure it was cool enough at the end of the day the staff was wonderful and the lack of lobby was fine given there was a charming cafe on the ground floor that was open all the time breakfast was included and customizable and was a highlight of our stay,1
439,a surprising find in the attractive area of plaka the room was plain and a bit disappointing on entry however everything else more than compensated super friendly greeting on arrival plenty of helpful information terrific breakfast and the very enjoyable four hour happy hour buy one get one free at reasonable prices easy walking distance to ancient attractions a handy super market at the end of the street there are plenty of places to eat in the plaka and we particularly enjoyed the gyros at the takeaway directly opposite our street this hotel could make itself even better by paying attention to a few easy to fix details in the room for example having two coffee mugs when two people are staying instructions on using the safe ensuring the tv is tuned and working and extra pillows in the room these were quickly fixed when raised but i feel i should not have had to ask,1
440,stayed just one night in airotel parthenon hotel room was simple but was clean and had the essentials however what stood out was the phenomenal service by the hotel staff from the moment we alighted from the cab velisarios and giota were the most friendly and welcoming hotel staff i ever met they did not hesitate to assist us in any queries regarding the hotel amenities the places of interest to visit whilst in athens and even recommended food options nearby as our flight was at midnight they willingly offered us to place our luggage in the concierge once we checked out so that we could tour the city and come back later in the evening to collect our luggage they are such an asset to the hotel and i would not have felt more welcomed and enjoyed our stay in this hotel if not for them the free breakfast provided was great and had a good variety would definitely come back to stay at this hotel because of the impeccable service from the hotel staff and the convenient location,1
441,minute walk from the acropolis and the parthenon which every one needs to see in athens minutes walk from la plaka which is very worth it alot of very good rooms are okay and the staff is very friendly the breakfast was excellent the hotel does have a pool or a would still recommend it,1
442,wow the location could be better right near the acropolis about from the entrance lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel itself is suit old and dated and could do with a refurbish bieber it is clean and adequate the staff are what make it they are so friendly and helpful and nothing is s problem we also were able to store our luggage there whilst visiting the islands the breakfast was amazing,1
443,the hotel offers delicious food breakfast was great huge variety and the staff was also very helpful too the floor there is also a restaurant with a great view of the acropolis my wife also agrees with me our experience in your hotel was great for sure we be back,1
444,i loved the venue and whole stay thanks to all friendly professional staff if you book bussines room you wont regret as the standard rooms would deserve some buffet breakfast has great selection of food so everyone find the right items to own satisfaction meeting rooms and its equipement together with av are great and offer variety of options for diffeent event astra rooftop bar restaurant are another great places you shouldnt miss having nice dinner or just drinks with a breathtaking view of acropolis is pricelles and of course you shouldnt either miss the rooftop swimming pool,1
445,we loved evripides for many reasons especially for the family and lovely friendly and helpful and full of room itself was huge with the very wide opening french doors to a big balcony with beach comfortable bed and lovely linen bathroom roomy and well recommend evripides very highly,1
446,this is a clean but basic little hotel that offers excellent value for money given its central location the highlight is the roof terrace from which to have a spectacular view of the acropolis recommeded,1
447,we have just spent a few nights at radisson blu park hotel and it was an amazing helpful staff informative and through our stay everyone made us feel very special and room was well designed spacious with comfortable beds and excellent bathroom was great internet covering all over the enjoyed very much the breakfast buffet which was generous with all kinds of options from light to heavy and everything in best part of the hotel was the pool area with great drinks and stunning views of the city where we also had a delicious dinner the food and the service were both at the highest levels overall everything was fantastic and we could not have been more pleased with our entire stay thank you radisson blu athens till next time,1
448,very nice decoration but expensive and location is not perfect as it is not very close to the shopping centers we went for shopping by taxi which took min to the center the weather was bad and we benefit from the swimming pool in the nice thing is that there is a view in the roof floor which allow to see a very beautiful view of athens,1
449,if you are looking into a good option for hotel while staying in athens the radisson blue is worth considering very good rooms friendly staff and a very good system in the summer time very important in my opinion good return from your money the only issue is that there are not that many restaurants within minutes overall very good experience,1
450,friendly and efficient staff great breakfast included and magnificent view of the acropolis from the dining room room was clean simple and neighbourhood is covered by graffiti and a few people hanging out in the streets just around the corner there are amazing lanes and little bars and restaurants i was able to walk to all the main sights around athens from here glad i stayed and would stay again,1
451,this is a really great hotel in an awesome location it is walking distance to several shops restaurants and the museum worth way more than the price the rooms are on the small side as all other european rooms are but super clean and the beds are really comfy the staff is super helpful as well when needing to book taxis or when looking for places to,1
452,i stayed in this hotel from until and am so happy i did to summarize rooms are on the small side but tidy rooms have a small balcony breakfast buffet is served on the roof terrace with a great view of the acropolis hotel is located near a church that will wake you up between and am walking distance of all hotspots restaurants stores and sightseeing points great service of personnel overall great experience what i loved most about the hotel next to the location of course was the personnel you are required to leave your key when leaving the hotel so there is always some interaction with the person behind the desk we met three persons and all of them had such great personalities they asked what our plans were for the day and gave some advice on where to go change of the guards that only happens on sunday in syntagma square i got sick on our last day the day of checkout and they arranged for us to stay another two hours in our room and even made us some pineapple which they said would help recovering i am very grateful as i did not see myself walking around the city with degrees when having the flu i will definitely stay in this hotel again when traveling to athens,1
453,stayed here for two nights the location is perfect for sightseeing at the main attractions in athens the room is average and also during the evenings you can hear some noise from outside when trying to sleep overall good stay and decent price for the location,1
455,this is good basic hotel in a convenient location just a short walk from the acropolis with plenty of restaurants and bars in easy reach the area looks pretty rough with all the graffiti some of it s worth a look though but we were two female travellers and had no problems at room was a decent size and clean and quiet another plus was sitting in the hotel bar in the evening with its fantastic view up to the parthenon only downside was the faint drain smell from the safe quiet and good value for money,1
456,we stayed for nights in july staff are very helpful gave great advice about where to eat and allowed us to store our baggage after we had checked out easy walking distance of the acropolis markets and restaurants breakfast served on a rooftop terrace with top views of the parthenon and you can take food and drink up there during the day rooms are small but clean and well appointed if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs to block out the local church bells at night overall great value,1
457,very serviceminded personal good and cheep breakfast with a lovely view at acropolis and the athen cathidral they send us a taxi to pickup at the airport and orded the return to the airport for free,1
460,the location of this hotel is very convenient it is a very short walk to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum as well as the plaka area the neighborhood is close to restaurants including those by the acropolis room was small but clean with included bath and balcony a nice touch was a small fruit plate and bottle of water provided worked it was needed as the temperature in athens was close to loved the breakfast with a nice selection of food including yogurt etc the staff was very friendly and helpful we let the hotel arrange our taxi to and from the airport would stay here again if we are able to go back to athens,1
461,this hotel was very welcoming and had nice rooms it is a short walk from the acropolis temple of zeus and olympic stadium it a good value for the money the complimentary breakfast was excellent,1
462,we stayed at the hotel for nights our first night was a quick stay as we were departing for hydra the next day the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly we were able to leave our larger pieces of luggage there until we returned from the island which was great the breakfast space is clean and modern with a good selection of foods to keep you going for the morning you can get to the acropolis within minutes there are also two amazing restaurants within a minute walk mahn mahn and sfika you will not be disappointed should you choose to eat at either spot overall the hotel is a great place to stay while in athens,1
463,we just stayed two nights and found it convenient as it is close to the under ground metro station the room and bathroom was small modern and clean breakfast and facilities were nice front desk staff was helpful and friendly,1
464,i made the booking at athens lotus hotel and mentioned that we will arrive by am from the airport however we arrived and they informed us the hotel full and they can not give us the room until pm we are honeymooners and did sleep since two days arrived the hotel so tired but unfortunately the receptionist was a bit tough and she could show any kind of helpful no sofas or any place to have short nap we were extremely tired so we slept at the chairs at the lobby few people checked out front of our eyes requested to have their rooms but they refused the first day in greece and the first hours in athens was as expected because of them were planning to have some rest and go around the city afternoon but they destroyed everything up for us,0
465,we stayed at the athens lotus hotel for five nights in july the accommodations we clean and everything that should be expected from a hotel in greece the staff was extremely courteous and helpful and the price ca be beat the location is not the most central in athens but the hotel is about feet from the metaxoughio stop on the metro the metaxoughio stop is very easy to transfer to other metro lines all three of the major metro lines are accessable within one or two stops of the one near this hotel grab a five day metro pass at any station and getting around in athens is a snap we would definitely recommend others to stay here,1
466,my boyfriend and i stayed here for one night in athens it was perfect for that amount of time the staff were very pleasant and the room was clean it also had a modern bathroom it a good hotel to stay in if you are getting the train to meteora which we were doing be careful walking around though we were in a beautiful area drinking wine and turned the corner and were in a very dodgy area i would recommend walking home in the dark comfy bed and excellent nights sleep,1
467,great location one block away from the subway which can be taken to the sites and the airport spacious clean rooms and on site restaurant the breakfast was fresh and plentiful front desk staff was friendly and helpful only con is that there are no irons in the rooms or hotel only option is to use their pressing service note they do not before but do keep your bags in case you want to start your trip asap it is also about or blocks away from a local delicious svylavki restaurant,1
468,the location is great a minute walk to the plaka and within minutes from the acropolis getting here from the airport is very easy simply take the bus from the airport for a few euro to syntagma square and then either walk meters downhill to the hotel or take a taxi for rooms are quite spacious and very clean the staff are super friendly the breakfast is fantastic from around to it also has a gym and a is a restaurant on the top level with great views a little distant of the acropolis and live music pianist the only suggestion i would make is that management relook at the pricing of drinks to attract their clients to stay and dine in the hotel i read a review prior to arriving commenting on the reasonable drinks prices you must be kidding the cocktails were double the price of those in the plaka literally exactly double this put us off and we ended up dining out every than that a great upmarket hotel i would stay here again hopefully by then we have a reason to dine in the restaurant,1
470,we stayed at this hotel twice and were not disappointed it is clean the beds were comfortable the staff were professional and accommodating the breakfast buffet that was included was superb we walked away feeling very full,1
472,location central about mins from airport and mins to ferry portstaff extremely friendly and helpfulappearance tidy and cleanroom comfortable and not too tightservices amazing restaurant a must see we only stayed here for one night and would recommend the athenian callirhoe to anyone traveling to athens no complaints about this hotel,1
473,it gives me great pleasure to review the stunning divani caravel hotel athens last week my family and i had the pleasure to call the property home whilst visiting the beautiful capital city of greece upon our arrival we were professionally and promptly greeted by concierge and reception staff our suite was that of above and beyond expectation and quality that was comfortable and spacious we could unwind within the suite with ease it contained flat screen televisions a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom the property is beautifully maintained spotless and reception is it a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us whilst we stayed with you everybody from check in through to house keeping food and beverage services were brilliant and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service you all made us feel right at home our experience was indeed sublime the roof top pool is very memorable for our and the food cocktails and stunning uninterrupted view of athens and the parthenon unforgettable breath taking breakfast was delicious and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay perfectly located in athens lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the but do yourself favor and savor the divani caravel club sandwich,1
474,we stayed at divani caravel during our stay in athens this is a star hotel and had all the amenities you would expect from a star hotel the customer service was great they helped us with all of our requests the hotel is a minute walk to metro also there are lots of cabs parked outside the hotel mount lycabetus is an minute drive from the hotel and the acropolis is metro stops away we did try the food at the restaurants so i ca comment on that,1
476,stayed here for nights and would definitely recommend it the staff would really helpful and friendly spent a relaxing afternoon sunbathing by the rooftop pool while having drinks served to our sun loungers from the pool bar the room was spacious and came with bath robes and slippers felt quite luxurious my only negative comment is that breakfast was charged at per person which is crazily expensive and not worth it so we just booked a room without the breakfast included,1
478,we were two families of four with some of us staying nights and other nights overall we were very happy with the divani caravel the rooms were very good sized although we had expected that the triple rooms would have had a true bed for the person not a sleeper breakfast as mentioned is overpriced for what you get if you pay out of pocket but was actually very reasonable when you booked the room with it pool was very nice although we were a bit surprised at the cooler temperature of the pool especially given how hot it had been in athens the two weeks before we arrived service was excellent and they were very helpful in the one area where we ended up having some because the people in our party had been in europe from weeks already we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry ultimately this is more of an expedia issue than a divani one but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service not the laundry facility we were expecting however the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant overall i would say it was good nothing special but it certainly hit the spot and let us get to bed earlier than if we went somewhere for food options there are several,1
479,we had a great visit at the emporikon we requested an acropolis view and it did disappoint the hotel was easy walking from the train station and very central to many sights would stay there again,1
480,we stayed at the emporikon last year and loved it we were nervous at first because there is no outside signage we were so surprised to find this completely renovated unique upscale boutique hotel the rooms we stayed in last year had high ceilings modern decor and great there is no room which is fine and almost preferred as there are restaurants bakeries so many options all around the hotel it is super convenient to the plaka area and the acropolis we loved it so much we went back this year with another family this year we stayed in room and had a and my kids thought it was the coolest the other family stayed on the top floor in this super cool family suite they were so happy and i was happy since i suggested the hotel this is now our place to stay in athens,1
481,this is a very quaint hotel perfectly located right in the heart of town the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff was nice and accommodating the only minor complaint i have is that there is no restaurant to sit and eat breakfast instead you have to order breakfast to be delivered to your room which we chose not to do however there are plenty of places right downstairs to go out to eat so that was only a minor inconvenience otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay,1
482,we found this a bit tricky to find during a recent weekend heatwave so you may pass by the front door before realising you actually in the right place look out for the red key sash on the room was very comfortable a wonderful oasis of cool from the athenian heat it in a fantastic location minutes from the plaka metro and the eating area of psiri the view from our balcony of the acropolis will not be forgotten we were not too sure how we felt about the bathroom it behind a glass door and the toilet hand wash basin and rainfall shower are all in one room so unless you on intimate terms with your room mate not all rooms are the same so this may have just been our room it did bother me as much as my significant other front of house staff are engaging and happy to assist with any of your needs during your stay and are interested to hear of your day when you return from your enjoy staying in smaller boutique style hotels where guest service is a core part of the business and this is certainly that,1
483,my sister and i had a really nice time staying here the concierges were all fantastic at helping us figure out our stay we were amazed at how easy it was to get help arranging a taxi for pick up the next day they even arranged for us to be able to get an early breakfast at no extra cost even though we had to check out an hour before the breakfast opened the daily breakfast selection was very nice food was delicious room was a good size and we had a nice time staying there we were able to walk to many major tourist sites without issue also this hotel is located right by the bus stop from the airport was very happy with our stay there,1
484,the hotel is located very close to syntagma square which is very convenient for taking the bus to and from the airport it is also perfectly situated for exploring the plaka and all of the historical sights on foot our room was small but clean and the hotel breakfast was good with a variety of hot and cold items,1
485,this is a small hotel in a very nice location just a few steps away from syntagma square the process for our group of ten people was friendly and efficient the elevator is quite small holding only four people without luggage or fewer with luggage as a result it took a while for our group of ten to get to their rooms after checking in our room for four people was reserved as but the configuration was a bit of a surprise there were two twin beds in one bedroom one twin bed in the other bedroom and one twin bed in the entrance area near the bathroom the larger bedroom with two beds had a plug strip with multiple outlets a stocked mini bar plenty of storage space and a small balcony with two chairs the room areas were clean and comfortable the bathroom had a small basin and toilet when leaving the bathroom there is a small step down just outside the door and all of us kept tripping when we left the bathroom we just weren t expecting a step there there is no computer available for guest use but the desk clerk helped print the boarding passes for our group using the staff computer in the lobby free wifi is provided but the service is quite good sometimes less nice surprise we were told upon checking that the breakfast buffet starts at our group had reserved airport transportation that was to pick us up at the,1
486,we stayed here on two separate occasions in a month very close to plaka monastiraki syntagma square variety of transport options near hotel including trains and airport bus shopping districts restaurants within minutes walk hotel is clean has a good breakfast good wifi a lift the staff are helpful courteous had to leave early for a flight but still arranged for breakfast to be available stored luggage for us after checkout time and arranged taxi when requested i would not hesitate to stay here again as it was great value for money given its proximity to everything given it met all our requirements,1
487,stayed here for a first stop on our honeymoon perfect location for foodies landmark lovers popular shopping and nightlife our taxi from airport had no trouble getting us here the front desk is very friendly helpful like margaretta sp who helped us find concert tickets for an event the same day as our stay as far as the room goes the bed is comfy the terrace is relaxing the bathroom is nothing special and the ac works wonderfully all and all it was a beautiful stay and we would love to come back again,1
488,the great thing about this hotel is that it near pretty much everything plaka syntagma square ermou street metro station national historical museum etc the room is lovely and very clean the staff was fantastic they really went out their way to make sure we have a good stay there was one day when the temperature went up to almost when we got back that evening we discovered a key card in the switch there was a note from one of the staff explaining that used the card to keep the on so that the room would be kept cool sometimes it the little things and details that made all the difference on the hotel and its service quality,1
489,wonderful staff and convenient hotel on the northern side of la rented the top loft for less than loft has a jetted jacuzzi the room has an entire patio although to hot to seat and relax the worked well as it was needed with touches need to be updated like all around the bathroom and the two people elevator is very slow but overall a very cool and convenient place for a day or two in athens,1
490,well situated near syntagma square and the plaka the diamond is a convenient and comfortable place to stay rooms are air conditioned towels and soap provided no shampoo so bring your own i caught the from the airport to the square for euro and a minute walk from there had me at the hotel staff were courteous and helpful and the included breakfast provides a variety to suit most tastes loads of affordable eateries within the area,1
491,i chose this hotel for location and price euro per room the room was spacious and clean yet in the pictures furnitures look new and modern some pieces turned out to be a little shabby reception hall though is nice and stylish personnel fantastic and helpful and would go out of the way to make you feel at home breakfast abundant location just min away from plans thank you for the warm stay would choose the hotel again but would pay more,1
493,used to be the imperial hotel is beautifuland serves a wonderful buffet breakfast included with the rumors are very clean and modern with plenty of roof top bar restaurant swim pool are excellent some say the the acropolis from here is bar and restauraunt are expensive but very nice the neighborhood is improving but not close to major attractions,1
494,first time staying in a wyndham have a generally good stay as expected from its reputation and was particularly impressed by the breakfast choices however had trouble with the front desk almost every time i tried to just get a quick information never got greeted nor the staff initiated or asked just kept doing their own thing although i did get the info when asked after waiting for what seemed to be a long while the location is good some very good or restaurants in the walking distance and subway station right across the roundabout on the other side,1
496,i want to point out and say unequivocally that this is the best massage i have ever had in my life perfect pampering for the body a once in a lifetime experience and i want to mention aspa and faye the two girls who do are just perfect,1
497,we stayed at the central athens hotel for nights at the end of march the hotel was in a great location perfect for sightseeing we booked bed and breakfast and requested a acropolis view the room was really nice not huge but perfectly adequate for what we wanted the room was lovely and clean with clean towels daily the breakfast was lovely with a really good choice of hot and cold reception desk staff were really helpful and knowledgable,1
498,we found the central to be a very pleasant located walking distance to the plaka and monistriaka areas minutes walk from syntagma square where the airport bus operates from and lots of restaurants clean and modern stylings in the room was compact but comfortable bathroom is well big feature that we loved was the rooftop terrace the view to the acropolis is fantastic and a great place to relax at night food prices are good for their limited menu but after each long day tourist tramping we loved it staff are exceptionally and genuinely give it a rating except for one lodged a minor maintenance request at reception on day one and it still was not attended to when we left three days later anyway we would definitely stay there again if we return to athens,1
499,as the saying goes it all about the location location location this hotel is within walking distance to all sites you can even walk to kolonaki and then head straight up to lycavitos wear comfortable shoes in addition to having a centralized location it views of the acropolis ate breathtaking especially at night rooms are small but clean and equipped with wifi and strong air conditioning breakfast is always included and the array of delicious food will leave you amazingly stuffed check out my pictures front desk always professional cheerful and willing to help advice have the front desk call you a taxi any time needed never hail a taxi on your own most cab drivers are crooks,1
500,very well located in plaka this hotel is just very simple worth the it provides we stayed for one night in a bed room with a nice balcomy overviewing the acropolis lots of restaurants coffee shops and souvenir shops around can walk to sintagma square friendly staff clean room,1
501,really great hotel everything that you expect from a quality place to be honest everything was clean cool and comfortable and the view from the top is just outstanding relaxing in the evening with a drink and that view is something i wont only negative is really about the hotel but more of a warning about the city itself parking is extremely tight in athens and therefore if you have a large car you might get a bit stuck and need some help small cars should be a problem though,1
503,we very much enjoyed to stay in this charming hotel with a perfect location in a quiet although central area thanks to the friendly staff and to the owner very short distance to good restaurants akropolis and most other interesting parts of athens,1
504,simple hotel but we got the top floors with enormous balcony with a beautiful view over acropolis the receptionist was really friendly as well and even gave us a big discount on beer fits both family and people who wants to party since it located in one of athens best areas fresh rooms as well for a cheap price highly recommended,1
505,stayed at adams hotel for nights early july were a family of adults and teenagers really know what to expect as it was a cheaper hotel but was disappointed the rooms though simple and basic were clean and perfectly adequate for our needs had a family room bedrooms actually on the first floor no views of the acropolis from our room but we did have a small balcony and the view of acropolis and surrounding area from the rooftop terrace was fantastic location was perfect right in the centre of plaka but off the main strip so was very quiet easy walking distance to everything all the sights and great cafes and restaurants almost at your doorstep would stay again and would recommend to anyone looking for a well located budget hotel,1
507,we enjoyed our stay at the attalos hotel very much we knew they had a great view of the acropolis from their rooftop bar but were amazed when we saw the view from our balcony as well everyone from the staff was friendly and helpful the room was spacious and clean we chose not to spend the extra euros for breakfast but rather chose from the many options very nearby the location is great very centrally located near major sites as well as multiple cafes and tavernas,1
508,very close to monastiraki metro station superb view from the roof top bar with the acropolis in one direction lycabettus hill in the other extremely well priced drinks less pricey than some bars in town small room but very clean with towels changed daily air conditioning worked well we had a balcony room on the top floor at the front with good double glazing breakfast was good with plenty of choice from cereals fruit cold meats cheeses cooked breakfast or pastries the only downside was that the juice was juice more like a diluted squash staff were very pleasant knowledgable helpful would definitely stay here again,1
509,second time to stay here in years we love the bang for your buck and great location the staff is always friendly and helpful plus the place is clean good variety at breakfast and lots of seating the rooftop bar or lounge has an exceptional view of the acropolis right behind the hotel is one of my favourite areas psiri which has so many great tavernas and a great area to hang at night and have a drink or coffee ermou street which is where most of the name brand stores are is only a few blocks away every thing like monastiraki plaka the metro are so close to get to plus the athens market to get a few snacks are within a couple of minutes,1
510,arian hotel is a great hotel acropolis views and restaurants right down the street close to idion square it may be a little hard to find but once you do you are in for a treat staff is great and the top floor garden with view to match breakfast prided and is also great you will not be disappointed,1
511,this is in the plaka area which is great if are just into the bar and night club scene there is a lot of graffiti everywhere so much that it is in your face everywhere you turn there are also a lot of gypsies constantly begging and following you around it is around the corner from a main street where you to go go if you want to meet a tour bus to the left of the arion you go right into plaka on the other side of plaka are the zeus and acropolis ruins minutes away so if you are in athens to enjoy the historical sights this would not be a convenient location with that being said the front staff at the hotel are unhelpful and seem to not care about customer service the older gentleman constantly smoking in front of the hotel is less good than the younger one he was also housekeeping and you call him if you need towels etc as we got out of the cab he remained smoking never said hello and offered no help with our suitcases we proceeded to the front desk and waited for him as he finished his cigarette about minutes later yes i timed him there was no coffee pot in the room or a mini bar they charge for use of the safe bathrooms are extremely small and there is no privacy the view from our floor room was a view to trash the free wifi never,0
512,if you are a city traveler what would you expect from your hotel a great location close to sightseeing night life and public transportation a clean room good air conditioner descent bed and a good breakfast and an helpful tips from the staff about what to see and where to go all of it should of course meet your this hotel fulfills most of it location is within spitting distance from most of what you want to see and do in athens the rooms are small but clean there is a small fridge and the hotel itself is renovated and good is in good value for money breakfast was just ok and the staff at the front desk were a bit apathetic maybe like in many other over touristic places and not that total not a fancy hotel but nice and welcoming small city hotel just for city take noticed that all the terrible and poor reviews are quite old it seems that at the last few years the hotel changed for the best,1
513,this hotel is at an excellent location both tucked away and close to monastiraki and pretty much everything the staff are also very helpful the rooms are well maintained especially with the beautiful acropolis view the only reason i went for a stars instead of is because of the beds they are quite hard to sleep on and could cause a back ache if they change their mattresses to quality this will be a real hotel,1
514,amazing experience excellent service very clean modern decoration so romantic the breakfast had many options the terrace offered the most amazing view i would definitely recommend it the only problem is that its a little far from the city centre but you can take the metro or a taxi and you get there in mins,1
515,this hotel is supposed to be a star hotel but i would give it more than stars it owned by spg but it worse than any spg hotel i have ever stayed at the location is close to the acropolis and its centrally located but the area is filled with homeless drunk people and you would feel safe walking at night couple of the staff were nice and friendly but some were not the rooms were really small and there was no space for suitcases we made a mistake of booking this hotel before going to the islands and after coming back i would go back to athens again but if i were to go back i would stay at this hotel again,0
516,i stayed here years ago and was impressed then by the style and atmosphere of this hotel located in the market district means you are away from the tourist hoardes but still close to restaurants and everything nice stylish rooms and the pool deck is wonderful for a hot afternoon or sunset drinks,1
517,we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast had a good variety the staff were extremely helpful and friendly they recommended us the best places to visit in athens some amazing restaurants they ensured we are all comfortable and nothing is missing very nice,1
518,the highlight of the melia is the rooftop swimming pool restaurant we ate dinner there overlooking the acropolis and went swimming the next morning as room was very well appointed and comfortable the air conditioning unit made some very loud noises in the middle of the night but we were given a fan to keep cool,1
519,first time to athens and chose melia athens omonia as my base and shuttle to santorini mykonos zakynthos and choice as even though the area is old part of athens omonia was first public square in athens but accessible was key with metro only blocks down from there everywhere was just so convenient with all the sights and things to was super friendly and professional in check in to luggage directions and arranging transport,1
520,my husband and i loved this hotel it modern and attractive with a bar and swimming pool on the roof our room was a good size and the service was excellent we had to leave early in the morning to catch a ferry and at checkout without our having requested it we were handed a breakfast to go nothing fancy just a sandwich and an apple but a thoughtful touch as for the neighborhood it certainly is a fancy one but we always felt safe at night and during the day there are some really great discount stores i bought a pair of italian leather sandals for e it just a fifteen or twenty minute walk in one direction to the plaka and the acropolis and the same in the other direction to the national archeology museum i highly recommend it,1
521,bad location the pool close at the area is dead about that time the check in tooks us too long our boys were adked to sign the check in document the receipients were unfriendly the rooms are good,0
522,after much thought my daughter and i decided to meet in athens greece for our first european vacation my daughter lives in south korea and i live in new jersey we thought it would be the perfect vacation we planned it for months and decided after much investigation to stay in the melia in athens greece our flight transfers and all of our plans went perfectly except for our choice of hotel there were many issues with this hotel the internet did not work well the room was not very clean the shower was moldy the blow dryer did work and when it was replaced we could use it in the bathroom we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it but that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced an electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet that what the management at the hotel said this worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open he said he had to check something n the basement this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by for more than five minutes i happened to return to the room to find that situation when i went to the management at the hotel they tried to tell me that the room was unattended when clearly it was the man who left,0
523,we had three bookings at the katerina hotel over a period of days stay in athens good location next to the metro friendly helpful staff clean well looked after rooms and amenities reasonably priced as well close to laundry bakery with a short walk to the supermarket and a great taverna,1
524,the katerina is a very lovely hotel it has a friendly reception and old fashioned decor overall it exudes a cosy charm the best thing about it is that our room was really really clean the downside would be the can be quite dodgy as many immigrants prowl the area waiting for any opportunity to pick pocket easy targets,1
525,the hotel is well linked with metro the service level is comply with the stars while the menu of the sky loung restaurant could be improved the panorama on the acropoli is amazing even if the area is not so attractive i will come back for sure,1
526,good location near the underground train room good breakfast wonderful view from the roof restaurant on achropolis licabetto and philopappo the the roof it is available a little swimming pool with a solarium area,1
528,rooms are a bit small staff is friendly and helpful breakfast is varied but due to limited it was difficult to keep up with demand location is perfect for visiting athens metro is onlusten aboutaleb m away,1
529,nice min drive euro in a taxi to the centre lovely hotel fab staff nice pool good breakfast would return rooms are big with a nice bathroom it about min from the airport and costs about excellent for a long weekend break,1
530,cozy rooms and old world charm i lovedi the antique decor of the common rooms breakfast rooms and the bedrooms breakfast was excellent lots of fresh choices great service the hotel is located near the archeological museum and is worth the trip it is within walking distance of many great restaurants,1
531,location of the hotel is great a minute walk to the nearest metro station the hotel is clean and modern beds very comfy good shower the variety of food for breakfast was excellent staff friendly and keen to help we stayed for nights and used the pool most afternoons it is not a large pool but really great to swim and relax around towels for the pool available at the rooftop bar which we used every evening fantastic views across the city the acropolis is lit up at night so its quite something to watch the sun go down there is a varied drinks menu and meals available also metro ticket for days is euros very easy to use the metro gets you everywhere you need to go only minus is the wifi free is great but that was the same all over athens nice restaurant close by called alexander the great would definitely recommend this hotel,1
532,i stayed at the hotel earlier this month as it was in a great location for visiting athens it is very close to the train station at syntagma square i realised on train back to the airport that i had left my ring somewhere in the room i rang the hotel and the receptionist christina said she would have house keeping check she called me back within minutes to say they had found it under the bed they obviously had to have a good look since i was sure where in the room it could have been the hotel arranged to have the ring shipped to me providing me with a couple of options on how i wanted it sent i chose tracked postal option the ring arrived safely in dublin yesterday thank you electra hotel,1
533,the electra hotel was a well priced and comfortable stay in athens the food was very good as well breakfast was included with the room close to many of the sights in athens the service was really great with the staff taking care of every request we had to top it off the use of any of the services offered at the other electra hotels was available to us,1
534,my family stayed at the novus city hotel during the last leg of our family mediterranean cruise vacation the hotel is in a great location with a subway stop nearby that takes you anywhere you would want to go in the city within a matter of minutes the view from the roof top bar and pool is just awesome as you can see a great portion of the city along with the acropolis the rooms are quaint and nicely appointed the hotel staff are friendly and quick to address any need that you may have there is a bar tender named jimmy hendricks who was the star of the hotel staff he made delicious hand crafted cocktails and always served them with a smile and a friendly gesture,1
535,it was our third time in athens and we needed two nights hotel our flight arrived late night and we had a ferry in the next day becasue we wanted to spend the only day in athens in shopping we searched for hotel near ermou street this hotel is right at the beginning of the street near syntagma square so for our purpose the location was great the hotel is good nothing bad to right about it although we order a room with a baby cot and when we arrived the room was without baby cot maybe a mistake that not connected to the hotel we ordered from the staff arrange the missing bad very quickly i think it good value for money stayed in diffrent vactions at two other hotels new hotel and electra palace hotel and if your budget can allow you consider them insteded,1
536,great hotel in the heart of athens we could see the parliament building from our balcony hotel was very clean there is a bar on the ground floor that serves food and drink breakfast is served on the first floor there is no formal restaurant all the staff were lovely we were allowed to use facilities at the sister hotel round the corner,1
537,stayed there for nights on my second visit rooms too small bathroom to small and thought the hotel staff were rude air conditioner in room did work properly location was good in the heart of the city do expect to get your clothes washed at the hotel it very expensive l will not stay there again had a very bad experience this time to star,0
538,we visited for days perfect location across from beach roof top pool and restaurant stunning view friendly staff and delicious breakfast air conditioned rooms made it so comfortable must stay,1
539,i a picky sydney sider on a budget and was very impressed by the service view and location of this hotel beautiful and friendly staff beautiful view from our room and rooftop pool delicious and wide variety buffet breakfast,1
540,the view to the saronic was amazing the staff very very friendly kind and helpful but the best of all was my cocktail i had a mai tai then a second one and then a zombie loved it going to visit again for sure,1
541,we are here for nights on our honeymoon could have picked a better hotel we did really want to stay in the hustle and bustle part of athens and this hotel worked out perfect for us we booked a couple tours from the front desk the staff upfront was so professional and helpful we spent one day going to the city to see all the historical things just enough no need to go back to the city the beach in front is very nice umbrellas and lounge chairs available nice sandy beach not to many waves also very nice to have a roof top pool available again great staff drinks were made professionally inexpensive and tasty we took advantage of the room service quiet a bit food was always fresh very inexpensive balcony off our room facing the sea was a nice retreat for us like everyone says it is on a busy road but it did really bother us part of having a centerally located hotel with good transportation options we took the bus from the airport pretty easy to figure out euros each we also spent a few days traveling from island to island piraeus port is a short taxi and from there you can take speed to various islands for very little money we went to poros egina hydra and mykonos all from this port great way to see the greek islands on your own time overall an amazing stay we kept saying what a great choice,1
542,staff was very welcoming and friendly location is the best near to everything the breakfast was regular and you come from the airport you can save money if you will take the bus for and walk meter to the hotel,1
543,stayed one night a tour everything was nice second time the room was much bigger with a large bathroom only complaint is beds are very are pretty slow and small there are great rooftop bar and pool area which is great if the beach is your thing located about mins from the main plaka area supermarket next door but this is closed on a monday resturant on site is very good and reasonably priced,1
544,this is a nice limited service hotel good location near tourist spots it was clean and comfortable the service was very pleasant the beds were soft both the ac and wifi worked well it fully met our expectations when we booked and was better than most similar hotels we have stayed at in europe,1
545,rooms comfortable and clean staff was very friendly and helpful breakfast was fine wifi worked location so much within walking distance and thank goodness for the air conditioning at the end of a long hot day perfect for what we needed,1
546,we had a fantastic experience at the best western amazon hotel last week our room was spacious and quiet we noticed that some other rooms were somewhat small there was construction going on nearby but our room did not face the construction and was quiet the location was excellent,1
547,this is a star hotel and this classification tells you what to expect it is clean service is ok not exceptionnal comfort is average single beds rooms are larger vs other european hôtels we had a mezzanine people narrow staircase no lights so you ca read except if you keep the overall lights open one particular point you can not throw paper in the toilet breakfast is included but standard a good thing you can prepare your fresh orange juice you can make your cappucino other good thing hotel is very well located walking distance from the parliament acropolis very near syngrou subway station one negative element noisy during the day because of the traffic clim is also noisy it may disturb your sleep this is a very good ratio,1
548,loved every moment of our visit to the acropolis we enjoyed the view as well as the scenery i thought the price was high but if you want to see it you pay it is a very long and steep walk wear good shoes,1
549,this is so central and easy to get round from close to stations and even easy to drive out of athens from here as it is on the main road down to the motorway staff very friendly breakfast ok but nothing to knock you out rooms we had were spacious and comfortable,1
550,i can literally see the pantheon from my room the rooftop is perfection the view is definitely worth a cheeky wine upstairs at night hotel is walking distance to so many attractions restaurants shopping staff are very helpful friendly spacious room comfortable bed,1
551,the view of parthenon was nice though no one informs the guest that when the cafe at the ground floor is closed there is no way in or out of the hotel during the night i needed to go out of the hotel and i realized that i was locked honestly that was a nice experiences,0
553,we stayed for the second time in six years in this lovley cozy and comfortable hotel located close to the the acropolis museum and some lovely was clean and beautifuly was great will definitely be back,1
554,the best of many good things about this hotel was the terrace on the top floor plenty of chairs and tables from which to survey the spectacular view the acropolis to the north and the city and the mountains beyond it to the east and south we took our breakfast up there on a tray no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift every morning and our coffee or wine every evening it was a spectacular way to start and end each was also well placed not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the acropolis so instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years and joined them a little further up only a little but it was more magical the hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times whether we needed to know about museums restaurants bus routes etc they telephoned hertz for us when our lack of greek and the hertz office busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting,1
555,traveling with two older kids in europe is a bit of challenge with small beds in regular hotel rooms their family room with beds worked out well room was clean with a fridge location was great for visiting acropolis and plaka staff was friendly and breakfast decent so definitely recommended,1
556,a fantastic hotel in the heart of athens so close to the plaka and shopping as well to the museum and the parthenon i would highly recommend staying there the rooms food and service were all amazing must do dinner at the roof top restaurant one night while you are there,1
557,in short the hotel has great the centre of to shops sightseeing restaurants rooms are clean spacious enough offering room service extra charge of course for those who remain hungry very nice breakfast with in my opinion rich choice of meals pleasant front desk staff and what is great plus free parking price for accommodation as well very reasonable i have to say would return with pleasure,1
558,great central location the hotel is traditional european with small rooms they are clean but nothing special management said they will be redoing rooms fall of bathrooms already updated do not pay extra for room with a view as you have to be out on balcony and looking left but the view from the roof top terrace is fantastic with the acropolis in full view we spent nights after very long touring days on roof terrace with meals delivered to us from a local restaurant the staff recommenced the food was excellent and cheap great pork gyros hotel breakfast was good with hard boiled eggs meats little hot dogs breads fruits and pastries,1
559,my sister and i spent just one night at and had such a wonderful experience from being prompt and eager to assist us with our travel questions and needs even before we arrived to designing a day itinerary for us to ensure we saw what we needed to during our short stay in athens before heading to the islands the service here is truly commendable nicos cristos and catherine were really great add to that an impeccably clean and very new hotel room perfectly located on a quiet side street just feet away from much more bustle and you have an ideal place to stay we will absolutely be back thank you,1
560,great location right off syntagma square within walking distance to bus and metro and many attractions the staff was friendly and personable especially appreciated leonidis and vasiliki at the front desk very helpful with bus and public transportation information always a friendly and personable greeting very adequate buffet breakfast every morning rooms are clean beds comfortable always clean towels the first impression of the room is that it is sparse looking like a college dorm room after getting over that first impression room was very adequate for our needs as visitors in athens enjoyed the hotel courtyard for food beverage and relaxation not a super luxury hotel but for the price a good value and very comfortable location we would stay here again when visiting athens the staff here is great,1

577,we stayed here in late june it was a family trip we had two interlocking rooms it is a beautiful hotel quite pleasing to the eye the service was great and the location is great there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance or within a short taxi ride the gb roof garden restaurant with a view of the acropolis was wonderful a great dinner at that restaurant was a highlight of our trip to athens if you are looking for a five star hotel in athens i very much recommend this hotel on the less positive side the rooms were a bit tight i could have used more room and it is not a cheap hotel one pays for the high quality so make sure that it is within your price range,1
578,we got to this hotel very late and were exhausted we were greeted at this hotel by a very friendly reception water and snacks the hotel is very clean and had the best shower of the entire trip it is also located in a great location close to all tourist sites,1
579,make sure you also dine on gb rooftop garden restaurant with awarded chef s en magnificent view all staff in hotel exceptionally good service and especially tzina at breakfast rooms comfortable and grand will definitely return when in athens,1
580,one gets the feeling this hotel has existed on the same basis for quite some time the service is very good and the place generally traditional with traditional facilities for a five star hotel rooms and in particular the bathrooms are in need of a face lift and for the price paid one would expect better the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring central athens which can be done on foot the roof top restaurant has spectacular views of the acropolis and it was a pleasure to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant every morning breakfast was the only meal we had at the hotel and it was good albeit extremely crowded and therefore not remotely peaceful there is also a small rooftop pool which is lovely to visit after a day sightseeing if you are lucky enough to secure a sun lounger everyone has the same idea about a dip sundowners at this location are good and service exceptional the only additional factor to consider about this hotel is that it seems to have an arrangement with cruise ships for us tourists and we had a huge influx from one of these ships,1
581,staying at this hotel was an amazing experience the decors are beautiful and the rooms lovely it has rooftop with a fantastic view of the acropolis we only stayed one night so we did get a chance to check out the facilities buffet breakfast was fantastic probably one of the best range and food freshness we have is also great right across the road is the parliament and the hotel rooms have great vista of athens if you are looking for a luxurious stay with the feel of exclusivity and professional service this is the hotel to choose,1
582,a very cosy nice hotel breakfast nice and satisfying you can sort get to may of the key sites in athens from this hotel the staff were helpful especially helping with how to get around around town and excellent recommendation on local restaurants,1
583,my husband and i stayed nights at the o b because we were planning to take a day trip to corinth and mycenae our first full day in greece we initially had a rental car the hotel was a little tricky to find by car at first but the location and service were very very good the breakfast was excellent as well,1
584,we stayed at the o b athens boutique hotel for nights while seeing the main sights of the city everything is walkable from the hotel and the furthest sight panathalenic stadium was maybe miles the front desk is fantastic and helped us set up taxis to pick us up from the airport and also drop us off for an early morning flight they even packed us a breakfast on the morning we left as we were up before the breakfast buffet opened the was incredible and we slept great we highly recommend this hotel and stay here again if in athens,1
585,not central as its in the northern suburb of kifisia very close to the metro station handy for the airport and in a very nice quiet and leafy side street very close to the shops in kifisia limited parking spaces in front of the hotel but there is a parking garage close by with good prices nice boutique decor modern and tastefully furnished rooms monsoon shower good wifi throughout comfortable bed and very helpful staff by nice buffet breakfast too would happily stay here again for a staycation,1
586,we spent two nights at the o b athens boutique hotel upon arriving in athens and then one more night before heading back home both times we were contacted by email before our arrival asking if they could help organize our transfers from the airport we said yes and we had a taxi driver waiting for us at the airport with the name of our party on a sign the hotel also arranged our transfers from the hotel to the airport note that it about a minutes ride to get to and from the airport upon leaving after our second stay the taxi showed up late and the hotel apologized and said that the euros transfer fee would be on them this was much arrival staff quickly brought each and everyone of us a large glass of cold water we also received a plate of hors and drinks in our room right after our luggage was brought up the hotel itself is clean breakfast is tasty and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable we had a room for four and it was quite large the bathroom was also very large and impeccably clean the hotel is conveniently located close enough to the major attractions that you can walk there in minutes depending on where you are going but at the same time just far enough to be out of the tourist zone it location on the edge of the psirri neighborhood makes it a perfect place to be within,1
588,the area of kifisia is one of the most beautiful areas in greece the experience of the y hotel was very beautiful the hotel is a wonderful place clean and comfortable security close to the shops and restaurants green view from the rooms hotel is new so the staff are happy and enthused with the guests i have loved it,1
589,out of the way of all the history but makes up on everything else the breakfast was so much and fresh and they made us a bag of food when we left early for a were only to minutes away from the acopolis but our hotel was walking distance to some great restaurants and awesome deserts would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,1
590,brand new bed linen fluffy pillows new bathroom appliances an immaculate room and a healthy and fresh breakfast location is great if you like upscale neighborhoods shopping stores cafes restaurants all within walking distance,1
591,this hotel was perfectly located and very comfortable do yourself a favor and use indoor pool and spa next door at the britagne it is amazing and do be disappointed that you ca use the outdoor pool there the indoor pool and spa is wonderful my daughter was upset that she could not use the outdoor pool until we visited the spa it was one of the highlights of the stay the service over all was great the beds are great pillows are great we were very happy,1
592,wow we moved here from our bad experience at the royal olympic i recommend everyone stay here beautiful hotel great breakfast buffet awesome staff who all smile and greet you the bellman gave us a whole run down of everything in our room from the lights which have dimmers how to work the safe and the tv anything we needed they accommodated the best turn down service ever when you come back to room in the evening the bed had been turned down chocolates on the pillows a mat and slippers for you feet on each side of the bed and curtains closed loved our stay here and hope to come back,1
594,prior to my stay i knew i would love this hotel due to the attention and detail the concierge team provided me they arranged from airport pick up to acropolis private city tour as i arrived to the hotel the location was amazing across from parliament house and walking distance to most of the key sites you would want to see in the lobby is a grand decor marble lobby yet with a cool modern twist the david bowie portrait as you walk in put a smile to my face the staff is top notch from the doorman housekeeping and front desk i booked the grande suite category facing with a view of the acropolis the decor is traditional and had all the amenities you need when staying in a luxury hotel i loved the deep soaking marble tub a must after walking all day in the heat of athens the sister property next door is wonderful and we had signing privilege i used the barber shop and ate dinner at the roof top of the gb hotel king george hotel you will always be my home away from home when in athens the general manager name is tim ananiadis and i must commend him for a fantastic team,1
595,i can not write enough good things about our stay at king george hotel it was flawless the location is unbeatable the front desk and concierge were extremely helpful and courteous our rooms were available for early check in as requested the rooms were quiet impeccably clean and the beds very comfortable highly recommended,1
596,the place is so clean and organized once u enter the place u will feel that you are in the right place the stuff are very helpful with a beautiful smile the location of the place is too close to the beach and the shopping area also the place surrounded with many great restaurants,1
597,my family has taken suites and we all agree that this was a great choice of hotel suggested by a cousin who lives friendly good service nice breaky efficient staff close to the beach and to dozens of restaurants and shopping malls,1
598,we recently lived in the above accommodation for a family recommend this small boutique hotel to you most service was exceptional the facilities great and the position in glyfada perfect with the beach nearby and a min tram ride to the city centre as well,1
600,what a wonderful experience my travels take me to many countries and can say that this hotel is up there staff and service is of a high standard sundeck view is amazing with a great pool area drinks on a summers afternoon overlooking the acropolis is sensational will be back,1
601,best good is not on the roof with great the breakfast an outdoor swimming spa with fair prices for money realy recommended,1
602,close to syntagma station and right by lots of shops and restaurants got a prepaid sim card with local minutes and of data from the cosmote store just next door for on a summer on floor was modern and clean quite a bit of water would leak from shower onto bathroom floor through the shower door minor issue no other pool area on the rooftop but not a lot of seating view of acropolis is obstructed from pool area but view is excellent throughout most of the restaurant,1
603,the hotel itself is great we had a junior suite which was quite spacious for european standards nice updated bathroom comfy bed huge balcony with a wonderful view of the acropolis the location is fantastic as well very central and within close proximity to most main areas of the city the only downfall was the service it was terrible but not what i used to front desk is just there to give you a room key or take your payment waitress at the hotel restaurant upstairs was the friendliest nor very quick to take our order calling room service was good but when we just needed some extra coffee pods or towels etc it was forever and we still could get what we needed all of the time only one gentleman downstairs bellman was extremely helpful throughout the whole trip it a shame because such a good hotel could be great with just some tweaks to their customer service,1
604,great hotel in a very calm and green area in athens really friendly staff relaxing atmosphere in the entire hotel very good beds excellent breakfast no problem to park your car in the street the entire hotel including the rooms are completely furnished with nice cocomat products the metrostation to the centre of athens is on minutes walking distance and it takes around minutes to get there this is a quaint hotel in a very positive way,1
605,our cruise started in athens so we decided to come days before to explore this hotel is exactly what we were looking for great location beautiful design esthetic clean and nice rooms do miss the roof top restaurant with views of the acropolis the food was delicious service was way too slow but it vacation so no real rush we had a suite and it was the perfect size with a sitting room so if you want a little space i would recommend this type of room,1
606,very friendly and helpfull staff that tried to make me feel like at home the rooms are clean and cozy the gifts on arriving are very nice touch the breakfast was flaw that i noticed not good sound isolation since my room was almost next to the exit i could hear very well people coming and going all the time,1
607,a lovely hotel find in the northern area of athens very near kifisia we were very impressed with the service and helpfulness of all the staff the room we had was lovely with a very large sitting area outside and lots of space to relax the spaces in this hotel are amazing from the main dining space and sitting area to the lovely deck outside the hotel exudes an air of calm and its easy to relax and just watch the world go by we did venture out to kifisia which is a lovely little area to explore with great eateries and went into town by the metro which was very easy the food here is good but i would also recommend eating locally to make the most of your time here thanks very much we will be back,1
608,famous for its mattresses which are indeed very comfortable and make for a good nights sleep is a nice minute amble into kifisia a leafy town outside athens and a perfect base if you want to avoid hectic athens or just like good food and excellent shopping our room was quite small but you can upgrade to larger it had everything you need including a balcony coffee machine lovely linen slippers and excellent local bathroom hotel operates an honesty bar which is just perfect after a busy day out coming back to relax on the sofas with a glass of greek wine bubbles or any spirit you can think of and breakfast is just adorable so many nice touches such as tiny bottles of milk fresh orange juice fresh pastries less calories surely and eggs cooked to lovely way to start our holiday before setting out to the islands thanks team,1
609,an excellent hotel in a quiete suburb of athens excellent beds clean and carefully furnished rooms breakfarst is very good and the restaurant is also recomented if you want to stay in the hotel the staff is polite and extremely helpful,1
610,we ended up staying at the new hotel for one night unexpectedly some other plans had fallen through and we actually been to the hotel the night before for a drink on their fabulous rooftop bar it was one of the best decisions we made on our trip we loved the funky vibe of the place the staff were so attentive and the room was very well appointed we have stayed at many large and small luxury hotels over the years and we really enjoyed the slightly hipster feel of this one very much it made up feel young and trendy but in a nice up market setting which is central to all the key attractions in athens if you are looking for a somewhat different experience to your traditional big chain hotel setting then we would have no hesitation recommending this to you finally you simply have to have a cocktail on the rooftop bar views of the on one side and lycabatus hill on the others breathtaking stuff,1
611,the new hotel is a good choice when you wish to skip the large chain rooms are quite small with trendy furnishings you can not find a better location for shopping restaurants and historical sites roof top restaurant was lovely and the staff was very friendly,1
612,we stayed at the new hotel in athens and were very pleased with our choice from the time you enter the hotel the staff was very friendly and accommodating the location was fantastic it within walking distance to the national gardens the plaka and parliament to name a few the hotel was very clean the price was reasonable the room size was larger than i expected and the view of the acropolis from the rooftop is fabulous i highly recommend this hotel,1
613,trendy good food good team and amazing decoration in the room you feel good in that place and it s very well located the brunch is very good and a rrof terrace is nice for the view in loved with the bathroom full of day light,1

617,this lovely hotel is well worth it price they offered amazing breakfast in the morning and even packed us a breakfast box on our last morning as we were too early for the breakfast hours it is well located near syntagma square and about a minute walk from the acropolis it is located close to a train station about a uphill walk and has loads of restaurants and stores in the area,1
618,can not rate this hotel enough rooms are immaculate beds are amazing location is central with trendy restaurants and cafes on your doorstep service is excellent and breakfast quality and variety is exceptional rooftop view whilst enjoying a glass of local wine is spectacular have travelled extensively through europe and this is clearly a top rated hotel you will not be disappointed,1

620,we stayed at plaka hotel just for night as we were passing through athens and getting a flight to santorini the next hotel is about a minute drive from the airport its in such a great location and everything is at your doorstep so if you are in athens for a short amount of time or a couple of nights this hotel is perfect lots of restaurants close by and little shops the reception staff were so nice and funny we also got an upgrade to a bigger room which was great ladies if you are after some amazing cheap leather sandals head out of the hotel and turn to your left across the road you see a giant sandal shop i was in shoe heaven also head up to the roof top bar to get a view of the acropolis very nice,1
621,as billed the hotel is practically at the bottom of the hill below acropolis and very close to the metro station and the shopping area around it with numerous restaurants in one direction and the cathedral and parliament in the other with ten minutes or so of walk the hotel breakfast area is open all day long with free lemon and cucumber water in the jar for guests,1
622,we are staying in the sister hotel hermes but roof top of the plaka hotel has great view of the acropolis and serves a basic array of drinks this review is primarily about the roof top and that is great having a quiet drink is a bonus i will that both hotels are very nice as well i will review that aspect later,1
623,great staff good clean room excellent breakfast located if you want to explore plaka and monastiraki areas easy walking to restaurants with a mini mart next door and a large supermarket around the is approximately a minute walk from the hotel suggest wearing good walking shoes with rubber soles to avoid slipping on granite steps and pathways qheading up to and in the rooftop terrace gives you great views of the acropolis especially at definitely return to this hotel,1
624,this hotel is in walking distance of all the archealogical sights and museums in athens as well as the airport bus the staff were extremely helpful with information for the side trips we took also the breakfast hostess was a mine of information about all things greek the breakfast is wonderful and includes greek specialities also free and biscuits are available during the day the view from the roof is wonderful especially at night when the acropolis is illunminated the room was clean and spacious and the price in mar was very reasonable that time of year was perfect for weather and less tourists we also made use of the supermarket next door we would definitely stay there again,1
625,the hotel is about a min walk to the center of athens the hotel is lovely chic had beautiful art displayed but what was amazing was the staff so beyond helpful we went to santorini for days and they let us store our bags there with no charge and made us to go breakfast packs to take with us on the ferry since we were departing so early they took so much time to show us where we should go and visit,1
626,we stayed here with friends for nights the rooms were clean the staff extremely friendly and the breakfast buffet just amazing a minute walk and you right at the bottom of the acropolis there are a lot of restaurants nearby and the nightlife center is very close as well we would recommend it,1
627,pallas athena grecotel boutique hotel makes our stay in greece wonderful the place is so accommodating the rooms are decorated beautifully the price is reasonable and worth it the breakfast served was delicious hotel staff are hospitable and caring they can be easily asked for favors and make way to give it to us recommended,1
628,great central location for exploring minutes from the acropolis and loads of local dining well served rooms and the optional acropolis view is well worth paying the extra for the roof top restaurant is a great place to spend an evening watching the city and acropolis light up at night very helpful and attentive staff complimentary fruit and wine in room a nice surprise the kids loved making their own waffles at breakfast a hotel first petite and bijou rooftop pool very popular a great place to immerse yourself in the wonders of athens,1
629,this hotel was a great surprise as it was a great value as well as a modern quirky fun hotel in the middle of the city the hotel was centrally located to walk to the squares and sites neighborhood was a bit sketchy at night and would recommend being in a group in the evening however we had no trouble and enjoyed our stay our room was huge with a large terrace and nicely appointed bathroom amenities the restaurant was lovely and the friendly waiter even taught us some greek to get us through our visit all in all the hotel and staff were pleasant and i would recommend this hotel,1
630,lovely hotel in central athens with really friendly helpful staff the breakfast is great but we did eat in the restaurant for lunch or dinner the rooms and bathrooms are big and most have a balcony i think although if you looking for a view of the acropolis you need to request it our room was out the back of the hotel and looked onto an old disused building did bother us but might some people i guess there a stop for the sightseeing bus tour in the square right opposite the hotel and it a walk monastiraki station where you find a good little flea market and only another to plaka from there lots of lovely cafes and restaurants no pool and the gym is tiny but overall pretty good value for money and a really handy location,1
631,we loved this hotel and location in plaka close to acropolis and other historical monuments we walked everywhere rooms were very nice clean with good airconditioning roof top pool with view of acropolis and nice little bar breakfast was excellent with lot of choices staff very pleasant and happy to help would stay again,1
632,it a below average dingy hotel with better alternatives for the same rates at nearby locations it very outdated hotel with outdated furniture that have stood the test time but their time has come reception staff were just fine but nothing to write home about location was good but i had stayed in a nearby hotel slightly better location for the same price but that was very modern and fully refurbished i think it was called definitely would stay here nor recommend i would highly advise a full refurbishment to the furniture and dirty carpets,0
634,my son and i had a wonderful stay the attalos hotel had everything we wanted in a hotel without being overly expensive warm inviting and helpful staff the manager came right to our aid when we did know how to work the and they were great with suggestions and tour arrangements clean rooms housekeeping did a great job every day the room was small but that was perfectly ok with us we had more than enough space to relax indoors when we wanted and we had a small balcony with a partial view of the acropolis comfortable beds and pillows and quiet at night we slept well even when it was degrees outside the bathroom was modern and pretty the free wifi worked well the breakfast was delicious with a great variety of food convenient location very close to the shops in monastiraki and a short walk to the plaka not the fanciest part of athens very urban location lots of graffiti outside and some people on the streets nearby asking for money but we never felt unsafe and the rooftop bar is a very lovely place to hang out with a fantastic view of the acropolis nice seating and a friendly bartender we stopped by every evening around sunset i would definitely stay here again,1
635,we stayed in two hotels while in athens we left for bulgaria and returned the amalia is wonderful great location friendly staff rooms gorgeous bar and a delicious breakfast i highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting athens,1
636,after reading lots of mixed reviews about hotels in the athens area we were apprehensive about finding a good hotel but we got lucky as philippos hotel ended up being a good spot it in a great location in a cute neighborhood with lots of restaurants and bars that are walking distance the acropolis and metra station are also about a min walk very convenient even though it near lots of things the hotel is on a quiet street which is great for sleeping they have a nice terrace on the top floor with great views of the city def take the trip up the hotel was clean and the breakfast was decent it a good spot to stay at as you explore athens,1
637,we stayed at the amalia upon arrival of our journey in the region and loved the was my husbands birthday and the hotel staff surprised us with a celebration the staff was accommodating to every need the location was fabulous located within walking distance to all the places we wanted to visit the roof top is a great place to enjoy a private evening and the balcony in our room was a great bonus the breakfast was wonderful,1
638,we did to pay for a room at the herodion and were very surprised by the standard of the philippos best place near museum akropolis and plaka we enjoyed our stay very much next year we will joice the philipps again,1
639,we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite upon our arrival at reception we were offered two double rooms instead which was a very welcome surprise this amazing service continued throughout our stay we were just minutes walking distance away from the acropolis acropolis museum and the plaka if you get a chance book a rooftop table at their sister hotel herodion just around the corner for a spectacular sunset dinner with view of the acropolis,1
640,wonderful service nice breakfast and perfect location to meander around the acropolis the front desk staff helped with every question we had we had a very pleasurable stay would recommend if you are looking for star hotel,1
641,the philippos is always the best we love staying there and enjoying their fantastic hospitality there is no better location you can walk everywhere or catch the metro easily yet it is just enough in the neighborhoods to be quiet at night when you want it to be top rating every time,1
642,a bit tricky if you arrive to the hotel by car the street outside is a busy road and there are only a very small space to park while you check in the location is excellent with views overlooking the park and the parlament and with walking distance to a lot of the sights in central rooms are elegant and normal in size the bathrooms are quite big and very nicely designed breakfast offers a large variation so no matter your diet find something on the buffét the only disappointment was the lobby bar food was not that good and expensive and when i ordered champagne i was told it cold so please put the champagne in the fridge and come back joke aside i would absolutely come back to this hotel again,1
643,very nice and comfortable local boutique hotel with great amenities fabulous breakfast and awesome location we stayed here for nights total and felt like home it is a gem in heart of syntagma square,1
644,fantastic location across from the parliament building with an awesome terrace with a view of acropolis and the entire city of athens hotel amalia is one of the nicest and customer friendly hotels i ever stayed at it is luxury but everything you need it there front desk is souper friendly and helpful restaurant is actually very good we were avoiding dining there because we did expect good and reasonably priced food the last day waiting for a taxi to bring us to the airport we dined there and were very happy also we ordered a bottle of amalia house wine tasty and cheap definitely recommended,1
645,cleanliness service and location close to the metro and acropolis all deserve stars in our opinion the only reason for a little lower rating is because hotel attalos could use a little updating in the hallways but otherwise we enjoyed our stay and even went back for two more days at the end of our trip take the blue line from the airport to montastiraki and you steps away enjoy,1
647,we enjoyed our stay at the attalos hotel very much we knew they had a great view of the acropolis from their rooftop bar but were amazed when we saw the view from our balcony as well everyone from the staff was friendly and helpful the room was spacious and clean we chose not to spend the extra euros for breakfast but rather chose from the many options very nearby the location is great very centrally located near major sites as well as multiple cafes and tavernas,1
648,we stayed here for one night the hotel is nice and room was nice and clean including bathroom they offer rooms for ppl which was perfect for us it very central within walking distance are many restaurants the acropolis and direct bus service to airport that runs every and through the night price is also good with tasty breakfast included after it possible to leave luggage in a large locker downstairs for for as long as you like there air conditioning even though it on a busy street our room was quiet when we kept the window closed we were on floor go to the floor to admire a view to the acropolis would definitely go again next time,1
649,we stayed here for days to explore the beaches the sights in athens the parthenon etc the flea markets the food it was all fantastic the hotels location is perfect the tram is literally a min walk away and takes you to the centre of athens the hotel itself is lovely spacious rooms beautiful pool the food at the pool bar is good but for us it was the staff namely alex marios mary and giannus who could not have done more for us from directions to beach recommendations they were so helpful and will definitely be visiting this hotel again,1
650,great well run hotel in a good location the hotel and rooms were very clean and comfortable the hotel was near the water and close to the tram station which takes you directly to syntagma square in central athens for just over euro it is a short walk to the glyfada shops and walking distance to some great beach clubs like the balux house project,1
651,location is fantastic the staff are so friendly and helpful the overall appearance and cleanliness of the hotel is very good felt very welcome and safe here our room was cleaned and towels changed daily honestly ca fault palmyra beach thank you so much for a wonderful night stay,1

653,we stayed here to use the metro to the airport the metro is two blocks away and goes to the airport with no changes the hotel was good well appointed room with a nice bathroom great water pressure and hot water lots of cafes and coffee shops very close by included is a buffet breakfast nothing unusual there most of the fruit is canned but there are other choices eggs yogurt breads sweets cereals cheese olives coffee and juice perfect location for us and a decent price,1
656,i had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend at the beginning of july the hotel staff were very helpful great breakfast amazing bar decor clean and fully stocked rooms with everything you can possibly need for a great time the swimming pool and gym area is out of this world the hotel location is in a beautiful setting with close by bars quality shops and a min walk to the metro i m looking forward to going back and staying at this hotel luxury doesn t even begin to describe how wonderful it is to stay here,1
657,great place helpful and friendly staff especially at the reception the lady at the rooftop bar was amazing and helpful and you could clearly see she enjoyed her job the rooms were clean and comfortable pool was small recommend this especially for the young travellers as the rooftop was buzzing till early variety for breakfast would definitely recommend to travellers and especially young travellers who would like to meet other young travellers from around the world thank you for our comfortable stay,1
659,stayed overnight in this wee hotel in athens is in the omonia area of athens convenient for the subway and a short walk to the famous omonia square one part was a bit shady but the rest of the area was fine like any huge just be sensible do be out and about late at night perfectly fine during the day hotel itself was brilliant value we had a room and breakfast for breakfast was a bit spartan continental but was rooms are painted in weird colours but are lovely and clean and the bathroom is tiny but really well thought out with everything you need we loved the quirkiness of this little place you could stay more than a couple of days there i think or the lack of space might get to you but brilliant for an liked this wee place and the reception staff were just expect beautiful views from your it in the middle of athens and not very but within walking distance to the acropolis etc,1
660,the staff is professional and is always a pleasure to stay pool area is truly an oasis after a long day in athens when stopping in athens we go have been staying from the year like the area because we can walk to glyfada where you can find restaurants and shopping,1
661,i arrived there with of my friends on the of june the hotel is located in the centre you can find a lot of coffee shop in the same street even starbucks bakeries supermarkets bus stops and the metro station is only to minutes away location was for the hotel service it was perfect everything was clean and staff was very helpful breakfast area is really big and the food was at last but not least the rooftop pool we went up there everyday the view was awesome drinks at the bar up there where perfect water was always clean and each time we went up the staff provides you with towels and makes sure to find you a good seat the price in comparison to the location of the hotel is very you for the pleasant stay,1
662,beautiful hotel roof top bar and pool we did see any of athens cause we were only there for one night but the hotel is perfect the staff are friendly there is a bakery across the road that has some nice foods in it for an extra euro we got a check out you have to organise this when you check in though would have liked to see a bit more of athens so next time maybe we have the opportunity to explore the beds in this hotel were the most comfortable we had during our four week trip in europe great views of the city from the roof top restaurant,1
663,disgusting smelly old rooms and floors and rude staff not worth the money at all you have to pay euros for wifi in the room for only hours a huge rip off no mini bar no extra locks on doors and when we asked the cleaning lady to clean our room she huffed and puffed and told us she did want to i think she might have hit her head and forgot that cleaning hotel rooms is her,0
664,we picked this hotel over another athens hotel because it had dedicated parking and a pool we arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there i was not happy however the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage he was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our got up to our rooms needed to book because of our big family to find twins bed pushed together in each room not the best but it worked the furniture is dated the tvs are ancient smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain it is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere to top it off they charge euro a day for internet access in the room and that is only for devices probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area they have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar however it is a very small pool area it is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground so you can hardly walk around the pool we arrived at the first day at knowing it closes at with kids in tow the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have mins to swim so we should come back tomorrow well my kids were,0
665,the place maybe was luxury and presidential in other times now in you have to pay if you want wifi in the room ok the hair dryer was from too and the toilet didnt work we arrive at the hotel to do the check in and the staff was very unpleasant with us to do the check out we arrived hour late and they want to make us to pay the extra day only for hour late we understand that we were late but euros only for hour and the negative attitude to make possible understand our position was very unfear unpleasant and disappointing we have to come back in days in this hotel because we have already made the booking but i dont think that i can change my mind about them we dont recommend this hotel not at all to anybody i hope my experience was helpful to everybody i can assure i will never come back,0
666,this hotel is very old the rooms are not pretty at all the wifi is charged expensive the hotel receives a lot of tours and school trips etc so it is very busy it has a pool on the top floor which is nice but the personnel is unfriendly as can be if you have children that can swim well you have to be inside the pool too to take care of them the pool can be visited from am to pm very short time the breakfast buffet is a bit expensive for what it offers so you are better having breakfast in any of the coffee shops there are just crossing the street to get to the center you have to take a taxi that will charge you around euros i would not choose this hotel again,0
668,after traveling around for days this was very comfortable stay i slept very well and the rooms were very nice and clean they have a great breakfast buffet even though it was very crowed it few blocks walk to and from the metro but content location i was very happy with my stay,1
669,breakfast ok however too many guests which meant that we had to eat it in a conference room on plastic foldable chairs since no tables were available pool and rooftop is nice allthough small and over crowded restaurant overpriced the staff in the restaurant and by the pool were the most rude i have ever encountered apart from a man called dimitrios that was very service minded not interested to take orders when instead walking to the bar to order i was told to sit down and wait for a colleague that never came the last day we were asked to pay to use the pool since we were not allowed to be in the hotel after our check out even though we arrived late and planned to leave late the hotel in general needs an update and the room was old and smelled like mold,0
670,the hotel was very nice and the staff were helpful and courteous the rooftop was amazing and spectacular views the hotel was a little far from the sightseeing places but we took taxi and were very cheap the only thing i did not like is that they do have wifi in the rooms only in designated areas of the hotel which was annoying,1
671,the rooms were clean and the size was pretty good our rooms were on the floor with a good view of the city though we did get time to use the open air bar we did have a look at it it was beautifully lit at night and gave a wonderful view of the city the bathrooms were neat and had enough space the breakfast had a wide variety of food overall a good stay,1
673,this hotel gave us a warm welcome taxis queue outside the hotel which are cheap triple room was spacious cocktails in the rooftop bar were too strong to enjoy pool was was great selection of buffetgood location near to paramou metro,1
674,stayed at this hotel for week hotel is nice room are big bit outdated but fine lobby downstairs is lovely room high up has good view good coffee shops etc pool floor is nice overall would stay her again,1
676,the president hotel is a beautiful hotel that greets you with an artistic foyer and welcoming staff the rooms are clean and well maintained though the furniture is a little old the room was comfortable and relaxing the rooftop bar and pool area is stunning though it was hard to get a lounge to lie on as they were always taken and thus we regrettably did swim breakfast was fabulous with a huge variety of food and drink available the service at breakfast time was perfect and any finished plates were collected promptly there were taxis always ready just outside the hotel awaiting to be used which was convenient the only drawback was we did feel safe walking around that area at night as we nearly had someone try to take our phone when we were at the bakery directly across the hotel we enjoyed our stay here and hope others will,1
677,lobby appeared semi decent pool area was small but somewhat decent service was terrible upon entering the hotel it appeared somewhat updated once we checked into our room it looked worn and old we didnt even want to walk on the floors barefoot and slept with our travel blankets because the linens were just disgusting the lamp that is suppose to be screwed to the wall fell on my head when at and woke me up i told the front desk and they did nothing the lady didnt even apologize we were scheduled to go back after our island tour and ended up changing hotels this hotel would get zero stars from me and i will never return,0
678,terrible hotel in this day and age dirty rooms ac weak in this heat and no tea coffee station in the rooms unhelpful reception staff with major attitude had to buy water and no room service after pm only the rooftop bar and pool were good but even there the life guard was like a policewoman do not recommend at all,0
679,dirty rooms and dirty bath towels unhelpful and rude reception staff with major attitude no mini bar in the rooms do not recommend it please note that this is the first time i bothered writing a review for a hotel,0
681,if your main priorities are getting an excellent location without having to pay much then this is for you it just a short walk away from monastiraki station and a number of the ancient sites and is surrounded by places to eat the price was amazing but the facilities were basic i had a private room with shared bathroom but the walls were and did block out any street noise there were some opaque windows for light but no view to be had but if all you after is a place to sleep at night it does the job and i no complaints,0
682,we arrived in athens on one of the hottest days our room was on the floor there is no lift but the walk was worth it as our room was a cool oasis a door by our room lead to the roof terrace with a view of the acropolis the air conditioning worked brilliantly and enabled perfect sleep the hotel is a short walk from a variety of places to eat and within walking distance of the major sites the room was spacious and clean and the staff friendly,1
683,my family and i stayed at this hotel for nights every thing is new in high is very easy to reach from airport to the hotel and to the main attractions as the metro station is only minutes by nice professional and very helpful staff thak you i recommend this hotel,1
684,we stayed at the coral prior to a sailing vacation and the hotel had been organized by the sailing group very nice facilities with a great view of the waterfront from the lobby lobby restaurant and breakfast rooms none of our party got rooms on the oceanfront but room rate was per night so no worries there rooftop pool with retractable roof for sunbathing was fun and relaxing and a swim in the ocean from one of numerous handy beaches was possible also getting to athens city center was simple enough by tram but took about each way breakfast buffet was included in room rate and buffet was fairly complete by north american standards bacon and eggs lots of pastries and fruit and fresh squeezed oj that you make yourself with the help of a machine that literally eats the oranges a couple of youth tour groups were i the hotel at same time as our group and hallway and breakfast got a little noisy with some their excitement but it was a big deal staff was very welcoming and helpful whenever we needed something safe unlocked bag storage tram directions etc rooms were good sized with comfortable beds and all conveniences coffee hair dryer etc elevator was a little tight ppl so some waiting involved there or get your exercise on the stairs floors max great oceanfront boulevard made for a few nice walks and a decent running location long or so mega yacht harbour nearby was fun to,1
685,very nice and welcoming hotel excellent service and very very kind stuff i been here now the second time and would go here anytime again too located in the heart of athens just a bit far from the airport nice roof terrace with a pool good breakfast with everything you can ask for again i stayed in many hotels but the stuff here is very very professional are big and clean,1
687,center of athens c we were ready to visit the pool of the zafolia hotel we go towards the reception to ask for permission to visit the pool for some reason the woman receptionist tell us that there is no space for us although the other stuff of the hotel was sure there was i have to say that i was pregnant and visiting the pool while i was min under the hot sun was the only relieving solution i believe that this was a very inappropriate behavior,0
688,the hotel is located in one of the busiest streets in athens on the top of the hotel the pool overlooks the entire city with all the mountains is a nice bar on the roof and in the lobby with food options good prices also the breakfast is amazing with fresh baked goods and good variety of food,1
690,great they let us check in at noon upon arrival even though it was supposed to be after the neighborhood was a little sketchy and someone hard to find but overall pretty convenient location to metro great price for the room with bathroom inside breakfast provided and computer to print boarding passes available,1
691,the hotel was great and staff very friendly and helpful but ubication of hotel is horrible there is a lot of pakistan and afganistan imigrants they are all night screaming like fighting so i felt not secure and comfortable there,1
692,absolutely ok place although nothing special clean and proper quiet at night not quite what i expected from the picture which showed both a view and a balcony got an interior and a small room but fine for a short stay for work travels and airconditioning slightly dodgy area good enough breakfast but what with swiching off the lights when the service finished,1
693,the place it self is good also old fashioned but the out side view is near to omania sq metro helps alot the printer thing was useful for printing your boarding passes the overall is ok,1
694,antonias is the man to look out for he will help you with absolutely anything you need and be dead cheeky about it breakfast is huge delicious and free try the tomatoes air conditioner works like a charm when you can figure out how to turn it on it just a wonderful place to stay at a wonderful price and honestly if you really afraid of the neighborhood as some reviews have suggested do go to athens neighborhood is fine and close to nightlife without it being a noisy distraction,1
695,hotel is situated in center and metro is not far away minutes but neighborhood is big problem drug edicts pickpockets jobless etc at evening armed security in front of hotel so recommend to order taxi to leave and return to hotel we were warned each tome from taxi drivers to be careful in that part of is ok but not enough tables for all guests cue for elevator as it is small and there is only are old dusty and carpets are full of stains beds are comfortable units are silent so it is possible to sleep if you leave them switched is ok with hairdryer but we were missing liquid soap dispenser was empty for all safety deposit box in all rooms some have some not that was a problem,0
696,hotel in a good position close to omonia station room very clean and staff kind and friendly ready to solve any your problem only things to improve is the breakfast i like to find more sweet staff and not just olives ham and egg i italian,1
697,the hotel was okay but the area was super bad we don t feel comfortable to go around that area as we have to go and come back to pass those area it is very creepy lots of drugs addicted people we saw on our eyes doing it very scary even for a guy,0
698,very clean and tidy great room with a large balcony great air conditioning for those hot summer distance from all the major sites in athens very friendly staff best value for money will definitely stay here again as well as recommend to others,1
699,nice hotel in a less than ideal neighborhood a little sketchy and not as close to central attractions as we would liked still a good value strong ac clean and comfortable really good breakfast too,1
700,it was a beautiful hotel i like the place in a few minuits you are in omonia and some minuits later you can be in synatgma or monasteraki stuff of hotel is lovely and very helpful we are looking forward to come back,1
701,it was absolutely wounderfull the hotel staff was very kind and helpful in all the respects climatisation has worked fine despite of the july heat breakfast is really opulent and deliciou i had a very quiet room as i asked it,1
704,i visited athens for business i booked oscar it was a very nice stay in this hotel quiet friendly personnel excellent service rich breakfast i am very satisfied and i recommend it no doubt just perfect,1
706,larissa metro train station is metres away the room was clean the pool on the top deck is a bonus only negative is that breakfast is basic and the bread on both mornings was stale reasonable value so no real complaints,1
710,every time we travel to greece through athens international airport we are spending at least one day at oscar hotel why we are coming back the personnel is very polite and knowledgeable about the surroundings of the hotel and the cheapest way to move around the hotel it a few meters from larrisa subway station you can travel with euro to the acropolis which is the station in direction elini super close to omonia station from where you can catch for the same price the train to pireus port or as they say in greek peierias the hotel has a lovely swimming pool that over looks the hill close to the temple of athena the breakfast is excellent and the room are big enough to accommodate people and from the roof you have the most amazing panoramic view over the athens,1
711,nice pool at the last floor staff very nice but not worth the price you payis not possible to smoke at night in the rooftop because it became restauant they gaved me the room before check in time so i appreciate it,1
712,just spent one night here but not a great place to stay putting it nicely it in a pretty sleazy neighborhood so we did feel totally safe arriving here late at night with that said it was quite easy to find a taxi immediately outside the hotel the room had crappy ac but eventually it did the trick weirdly the room only had one outlet in the morning there were tiny little bugs in the sink the elevators took forever to come the breakfast was actually really good and it was included in our stay but that probably the only redeeming quality also the hotel staff was nice one night was fine here but absolutely would recommend it for any longer,0
715,this hotel is lacking in atmosphere basic facilities rooms and especially bathrooms in poor condition it an overpriced coach trip stopover in the middle of nowhere i did enjoy my stay here at all,0
716,rooms were basic good value and fitted our needs during our night stay in athens the pool was refreshing after a day of sightseeing in hot temperatures we enjoyed the rooftop bar and the lovely view from it location was good,1
717,cons the location of the hotel is seedy and horrible as we walked from the metro stop to the hotel men were breaking areas of the sidewalks to fill bottles with water from the underground pipes litter was everywhere and the area is severely i was embarrassed to bring my family and international guest to this hotel and arrival we were informed our family room was on the floor once entered it was clear it was a double room in which they tried to squeeze in a single bed and a rollaway chairs from the desk were moved to the foot of our double bed and crammed against the my discussion with the staff we were moved to a family room on the floor facing the back streets of athens we were informed that the room on the floor was indeed a family room which i know it was not here the description copied from their official website dorian inn hotel offers a great variety of standard single double and triple rooms and from the to the floor we offer superior double and family rooms for an stay in athens spelling from hotel websiteupon departure at we saw a man sitting on a doorstep sniffing white substance and a woman sitting on the sidewalk with adult dog and puppies who appeared to be malnourished so very sad for all these reasons i will not stay at dorian inn hotel in the the breakfast was very good and the support staff,0
718,by day a busy area at night it a bit quieter you will want to stick to the main roads hotel staff are very nice and give a good friendly service easy walk to the flea markets and acropolis i would return,1
719,my wife and i stay at the dorian hotel in august this hotel has a pool and roof top restaurant late one evening we booked a reservation at the restaurant beautiful scenery over looking athens and the magnificent acropolis at night we and wine and a romantic dinner the restaurant provided excellent food and amusing service the price was very reasonable dinner for two the hotel is older but very comfy front desk is extremely they will answer all your questions the hotels offers tour daily to the important sited hotel is very close to the hop on hop off bus stop another plus is that you can pack you l suitcase and walked to the main square and take bus to airport,1
720,i had a very pleasant short stay at dorian inn on my way back to rome the room was clean comfortable and the staff was polite and helpful this is centrally located only a few minutes walk to omonia metro station the rooftop restaurant of this hotel was possibly the most remarkable place to be mentioned one may enjoy degree view of athens city from the top wonderful view of acropolis specially at night was excellent i could manage time to use the rooftop pool but enjoyed the breakfast they served would love to stay once more here if i come to athens for any reason,1
721,i stayed at this hotel as a solo guest and as part of a tour group and regularly stays at the hotel during peak season as a solo guest my room was nice and comfortable and the restaurant up on the top floor serves amazing food and the service was fine but coming back to the hotel as part of the tour group my experience much like others part of my group was beyond lacking i was put in a room that was made for people but the third bed was just a uncomfortable mattress on the floor which is unacceptable as i have paid the same amount of money for the room as the people who have proper beds and if the room is for people than make it for people we all later that night went up to the top floor to dine at the restaurant our tour group had to order and pay at the bar as table service was allowed for tour groups as in the past people have left without paying there bill which i was understanding of but after of us waiting hours for our food and then meals also coming out not the way they were described on the menu no wonder people have left without paying waiting and half hours for food is unacceptable and not apology was given to us for our would not recommend this hotel to anyone and would never stay here again in greece,0
722,good location near omonia station good food and good customer service rooms are good but need a renovations the upper floors are renovated so the room are better everything is clean and the lobby and the reception are well organized the best experience in this hotel was dealing with zeta always milo and ready to assist you with every queries she is the superwoman in this hotel she was our fred during our stay god bless her definitely i stay again in this hotel and recommended to my friends,1
723,try to always book in great location beautiful roof top restaurant with views of the parthenon i was told that a percentage of the profits go to a local orphanage which was a request of the owner when he passed away hope that still happens unfortunately it does have a pool but it a to monastiraki which has lots of restaurants great shopping,1
724,when we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed in an exceptionally friendly manner by the staff and as we were proceeding to our room our luggage was being carried for us the proper way the room was exactly what we hoped for because it looked rather old and the bathroom was really the bath and shower were what i would call marvellous nevertheless we slept rather well the lobby itself was absolutely stunning as it was decorated with beautiful mosaics but still looked very modern on the rooftop one has an absolutely breathtaking view on the acropolis of athens and the restaurant there is one i can really we had a very pleasant stay,1
725,we had a good stay at this hotel the lobby is very impressive the staff were overly friendly but still professional the rooms were clean and comfortable the buffet breakfast that was included was good too,1
726,nice new renovated rooms corridors and cleaning service excellent nice breakfast good value for money nice helpfull staff nice location walking distance from plaka and ancient athens the hotel is recomdnded,1
727,we enjoyed our stay at titania hotel the staff were pleasant and helpful it was on the main hop on hop off bus route also not too far from the plaka by taxi the rooms were good and clean bathroom small but adequate delicious breakfasts,1
728,the hotel lobby is beautiful you have several areas to sit and relax there is a little area for coffee and doughnuts bagels etc the staff is very nice friendly and helpful the room size was not bad for europe there is a fitness center however it is only open from i was gone before and did not return until after so i was disappointed because i love to workout daily the rooftop restaurant was awesome the views are breathtaking you can see the acropolis and at night it lights up the sunset views are amazing also there is a buffet restaurant the food is good but a lot of the same foods daily within walking distance to shopping district of plaka,1
729,titania hotel is ideally situated in the heart of athens and is only a short walk away from syntagma square and the shopping centre my husband and i only stayed for two nights before and after our trip to syros but we ll definitely choose titania for a longer stay next time we visit rooms are spacious functional and beautifully decorated cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city we were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the parthenon as we had to catch the ferry to syros very early in the morning we greatly appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet consisting of a wide variety of jams bread rolls croissants cheeses delicatessen fruit cereals and sweets normal breakfast includes hot dishes as well such as eggs omelette bacon baked should not leave titania hotel without having a drink or dinner at olive graden situated on the floor and offering a superb view to the pathenon by night although the restaurant is a bit pricey it s well worth the experience the food is excellent and the service is impeccable all the staff are very polite and helpful for all these reasons i strongly recommend titania hotel for couples families or business,1
730,an excellent hotel in the center of athens rooms are very nice and clean and the staff very polite the breakfast is very rich offering to visitors many things to enjoy on the top of the hotel their is a bar where you can see around the town of athens especially during nights where the scene is fantastic from the hotel you can walk easily to the market area or to akropolis also it is very easy to use bus or taxi,1
732,i have visited the hotel end may for about days at the executive level on the floor while the room was very accommodating and had a balcony i would not advise the executive floor at least not on the front side for the simple reason that the floor is the conference level and i was suffering the whole night from hearing furniture and chairs being dragged on the floor for the rest it has been a perfect stay great remodeling super location and fantastic friendly staff actually i am returning there pretty soon mind you this is the first hotel that i visited in athens that provides sockets on both sides of the bed and at the desk at reach level so one can charge the phone and the batteries and without having to crawl underneath the furniture to find one the restaurant at ground level is just perfect but the view on the floor restaurant is breathtaking and unbeatable,1
733,despite the renovation in reception area the room are quite dated and need rennovation our room had terrible view and it smelled very bad we asked for a room change but it was not possible until the next day,0
734,central enough but not in chaotic district staff is caring is a perfect accommodation for members family the view from the roof garden is amazing breakfast is truly abundant both in choice and quality,1
736,we were in athens for a few days and spend our stay at this hotel it was very clean and comfortable staff very helpful and friendly breakfast included and had a good choice help yourself buffet and plenty of food orange juice and coffee very disappointing both from machines and orange was not fresh juice more like squash coffee dreadful good buffet for evening meals euros good value but we ate out as there was so much choice took the tram five stops to glyfada and lots of lovely restaurants there five stops towards athens syntagma a lovely beach restaurant there are two there we went to the first one on left looking at the beach it was fab food delicious value very good lovely setting overall would really recommend the hotel the pool is very nice really good and the beach is across the road from the hotel the bus from the airport stops right outside the hotel although there is a very busy and dangerous road to cross when arriving we did it with three children and lots of luggage bus stops on the same side of the road when leaving and runs hours every mins mins journey for a few euros tram stops outside hotel easy to get to athens and the opposite way also,1
737,we have stayed at hotel astor several times the latest being last week for one night only we had a room on the floor with a stunning view of the acropolis even if you have a room with no view the breakfast room is on the floor and all guests can enjoy this the room was clean and comfortable as always and we were steps away from the metro station and ermou street shopping as well as other attractions highly recommended,1
739,night stay in july central close by to lots of attractions it cleanthe staff are fantastic and extremely helpful good rooms good breakfast lots of choicegreat views reasonable pricedhighly recommended,1
740,not a pleasant experience at all set back on a dingy street the hotel offers randomly poor customer service and staff with sticky fingers we booked our stay at the astor with a group of people so good business for them but after our poor overall experience they wo be seeing business from us again here why some of our group are and naturally occasionally forgetful while enjoying our breakfast out on the balcony which it has to be said offers a great view of the acropolis one guest my sweet nanna just about the kindest woman you ever meet accidentally left the door on the balcony open which separates the rooftop viewing area from the eating area as she walked through it instead of simply closing the door and forgiving the obvious mistake a particularly angry witch of a waitress who was on staff at the time decided to make an example of her slamming it shut and pointing and gesturing as if she could believe the incompetency of her guest i can only assume she got out of the wrong side of an empty bed that morning or perhaps was up all night in a full one and forgot her basic customer service training in all the excitement leaving the astor was an bizarre experience we had left our luggage at the hotel while exploring athens for the day and went back later to collect it order taxi so we could move on when the bags were rolled,0
741,we stayed here nights over two rooms the rooms were fine although one had a musty smell that room also had some noise from adjoining rooms my right i was quiet and clean it is very close to the parliament building so we easily saw the changing of the guards and it is a short walk to the plaka area it is an easy walk to the acropolis too as long as you do get lost in the winding streets the top floors have a good view of the acropolis breakfast is up there on the floor i would say suggest booking the floors to if you want a room view the lower floors have terrible views fortunately for me i do not travel to sit in a room and look outside i am only there at night and do mot care,1
742,astor hotel is located in the historical area of athens easy access to public transportation caring staff and a great view to acropolis having a good breakfast while watching parthenon is a great pleasure i will be there again hopefully,1
743,the hotel is located in the center of the shops in downtown and the most popular walking street in athens next to the syntagma square we did need to take taxis during our stay the room was fine maybe the bathrooms needed some maintenance but they were clean the staff were so nice and friendly,1
744,we stayed here during a short visit to athens it provided a nice central location to what we wanted to see rooms are adequate however no in room safe if you want to store valuables you need to use a personal safe through the front desk a bit antiquated but it worked out just fine the absolute best part is the breakfast view stunning view of the acropolis actually also went up in the evening to watch the lights come on surrounding the acropolis while we did find someone to serve drinks we were the only ones up there so feel that the hotel is overlooking a great opportunity in the evening to capitalize on their maybe having a bar set up and light bar snacks offered,1
745,stayed in this hotel for one night as a party of all family catching a cruise ship around the greek islands the following day several of us being forgetful and tired as did arrive till around forgot some of our items the next morning at check out despite phone calls and emails to the hotel to ask about our left items we were informed nothing had been found i find it hard to believe a full ladies outfit a man shirt one shoe and a phone charger all magically disappeared maybe the management need to vet their staff alittle more closely to avoid a cross dressing one legged member of staff hopping around the streets of athens swinging a samsung phone charger around their heads not a good advert for the hotel avoid,0
746,very mediocre hotel with a location carpet in the rooms reeks of old cigarettes and vommit the only person was the receptionist ala carte menu was a total disaster the worst food we ever experienced i greece disgusting house red wine we looked forward to a quiet night at the roof garden wich was ok with some food and a caraffel house wine and ended up speechless over the lack of quality and service,0
747,the hotel was very basic with only few amenities being provided they did keep any bottle of water and no dental kits were provided since plug points are different as compared to india we had asked for an adaptor to which the reception asked to come down and collect ourselves there was no hospitality in this hotel since we only needed to sleep for one night we adjusted through not at all recommending this hotel to anyone instead there are very good budget hotels in the main city which should be explored the area in which the hotel is situated is also not convenient,0
748,i booked this hotel at at night and checked in minutes later due to my other hotel being really average i chose this hotel because of the location it is a few minutes walk from the main shopping street buses train a girl travelling on her own it is a great hotel because of it location i would stay here again the staff and cleaning staff are really friendly and very helpful breakfast is included which is good it nothing special but it fine i have been having fruit and yogurt because it gluten free but there a lot of other is an amazing absinthe bar across the road down a lane way full of locals which is great the bed in the hotel was not good at all i could feel every spring having a terrible bed in a hotel is the worst because after a long day of walking and sightseeing you want to have a good sleep these beds do allow that the pillow was fine very spacious room with a large window bathroom is fine everything works they give you fresh sheets every day and mop the floor so it is very clean no kettle i thought that was unusual i like to make tea in my full length mirror aircon was great wifi works best at the door and the window i stay here again but the beds really let this place down if you love a comfortable bed then you might want to look,1
749,the only good thing about this hotel it food location yet they have poor wifi very small rooms super unfriendly staff and it always loud poor food and beverage quality in general i wo recommend it since it also over priced,0
751,stayed here late june great clean room lovely staff very centrally located pool area was fab to lounge by in degree heat lovely cocktails and the food and views were beautiful hop on hop off bus stops just around the corner which is handy the food in stanley was super,1
752,my wife and i stayed here on the tail end of our honeymoon before heading back home we really enjoyed our stay at the stanley it an old and historic hotel that has been well maintained and updated through the years we felt it was very well located with respect to the main touristic highlights and the view of the acropolis from our room was amazing it very well priced and i highly recommend it to someone looking to experience athens,1
753,whilst not in the most salubrious of locations the stanley is right for the price our spacious room was one of the refurbished rooms and it was very clean comfortable and quiet the front desk staff are efficient and very welcoming providing top notch personal service to all guests despite how many check ins they were dealing with commendable unfortunately i did really get the same vibe from the roof top bar of variety and choices in the buffet breakfast served in the sun filled livingston room and there seemed to be a greek barista on hand to personalise your coffee order so great start to the handy to the metro and there a bakery conveniently located on the corner downstairs if you looking for a clean economical hotel and not too fussed with location you ca go wrong with the stanley,1
754,we had such a lovely stay at the stanley hotel in athens from the moment we booked we were very impressed as the hotel sent us a lovely email with information about the hotel about athens and also a day suggested itinerary of places to visit during our stay we stayed in a superior room acropolis view and were super impressed to find it actually did have the most wonderful view of the acropolis and mount lycabettus these are lit at night and it was so wonderful having a drink on the balcony before bed and taking in the views be aware that there is a main road directly below you so it does get a little bit noisy but is easy enough to ignore once inside the room you do hear the road as there is really effective double glazing there is no furniture on the balcony but we brought the chairs and little table from inside out on an evening there was also a minibar with some complimentary drinks bottled water was replaced daily the room itself was very clean and comfortable with a tv safe tea and coffee making facilities plenty of wardrobe space and good air conditioning the bathroom was clean and toiletries are provided we were impressed with the friendly staff my husband had mentioned that we were there celebrating my birthday and someone came up to the room after we checked in with a bottle of complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries what a,1
755,probably the worst hotel we stayed at during our trip around greece not only was the entrance of the hotel hard to find but the rooms shown in the pictures look absolutely nothing like what a standard room at the stanley looks like the management informed us that those are only the specialty suites it was outdated small and not renovated but thankfully after enough complaining we were upgraded to a bigger room but with the same outdated features the pool and rooftop bar are also highly exaggerated based on the photos and even with a discount card for your first drinks everyone gets as a guest you are paying more for beers than at any of the surrounding restaurants the bed was pleasant and it was convenient to get to the city center with a metro station out front avoid the taxis if you can they are quite expensive and the drivers are very rude the star rating is not justified with this hotel it is closer to a hotel,0
756,it was out first time to greece we were a bit concerned about all the online stories about pick pockets i choose this hotel after quite some we were surely not the hotel as such is strategically located on a well known karaiskaki all taxi drivers knew the the hotel is surrounded with bakeries hr restaurants convenience stores taxi stands the open blue red yellow busses stop right by the the famous monastrisaki square is a good mins walk through main roads and interesting we walked all times during the say an night without any the hotel is good a bit the toilets need the staff are very breakfast though monotonous we stayed for a week was the view of the acropolis is something all buildings have at athens therefore not a big overall a good and safe hotel to stay,1
758,very nice view from the heat in the elvators the need to wait around minutes to the working at the reception think that they are doing you a favor by staying at their hotel they forget that the guests are paying their salaries,0
759,hotel staff are friendly helpful and speak many languages the hotel has all the amenities expected of a star hotel with the added surprise of a wonderful roof top terrace with pool and spacious sun lounge area and amazing views over the city prices of drinks and food in the hotel are reasonable for a city hotel room was very clean comfortable and well equipped a bit smaller than expected but in good condition and with a very effective air conditioner the hotel has excellent access to the local metro and a superb bakery which also does some take away food during the day in front of the hotel there are bars if you do want to drink in the hotel and a small estatorio lots of typical greek mezze and gyros as well a decent round the corner called alexander the great whilst the area is somewhat run down it is not that different from most of the other areas of athens unless you are right in syntagma square i would definitely stay here again,1
760,when i first arrived at this hotel i was pleased with the look of it it was clean and well presented the streets around the hotel are not very nice but exploring the area further many streets in the athens area seem run down but once you are in the hotel you feel far away from it all the hotel is located right near the metro station so you do have far at all to go if you want to catch the stayed in a room on floor the room was a nice size and very clean the only let down was the balcony view it was overlooking other hotels and a dirty street but this did really bother me too much as i did spend much time in the room as i was out exploring athens the bed was very loud and creaky any movement in the bed made a loud sound sounded like it was going to collapse in the mornings from half to half is the breakfast buffet there is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up one night at the hotel i decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the floor top of the hotel it had a great view of the acropolis you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat the menu did have much food choice i went for the burger it looked great but came out cold so i had to,1
761,we stayed at the stanley for nights it made us hate athens to be honest the location of the hotel and the rooms are not as they seem on the website we stayed in the executive room with double bed the bathroom was disgusting with old white shower curtains and you could hear everything going on in the next room while you in the bathroom there no ventilation and it just feels like you in a cheap hotel i did like it at all to be honest and felt it was unclean upon booking i thought that the hotel was in the centre and it not it mins away by car from the main streets in the centre syntagma square and monastiraki and you ca walk there because the streets around the hotel do look in addition to all this we were charged for a bill after we had checked out from the hotel and left for drinks at the pool bar where neither myself or my husband even checked out during our stay let alone stayed for drinks and when we requested to see the receipt it just had our room number on the top without even our family name or my husbands signature we told the hotel that this was not us and that we did even visit the pool and until now one week later the money had not been refunded never visiting this hotel again and i advise anyone going on a fun romantic trip to,0
762,my experience in this hotel is terrible my first night was above a noisy machine room and could sleep for most of the night i requested a quieter room the next morning and found out that i was put into a room next to another machine room i would not come back to this hotel again if i have choices based on the high chance that the room will be noisy,0
764,metropolitan hotel and staff have come through with very good customer service we arrived late on the ferry from naxos got picked up by taxi and made it to hotel was greeted and provided our rooms in a timely manner the breakfast is very good we look forward to staying at the metropolitan when we come to athens,1
765,first look at the hotel and its lobby leave you with a satisfying feeling but once you enter the rooms the illusion soon fades away the rooms are extremely small and unclean the housekeeping is poor to the next level had such a horrible experience staying here i strictly advise against choosing this place to stay the buffet too had very less choices of food to offer,0
766,a clean and comfortable hotel maybe a little bit out of the heart of athens but in the evening it took half an hour to arrive from the airport and all around there are some taverna and restaurants with some typical greek food with convenient pricedefinitely i would advise this hotel to people traveling for business,1
767,we stayed at the metropolitan hotel in june for nights and were incredibly disappointed with this hotel the lobby appears reasonable however once you enter the elevator that is where the illusion stops the hallways are old and dark and you feel like you are going on a school camp rather than an apparent star establishment the room was terrible a very old looking room in desperate need of an upgrade the bed was horrible a regular sized double bed which felt like we were sleeping on pins as the mattress was very thin the overall room and bathroom state was very disappointing once we saw the room we thought perhaps an upgrade to the suite may help once again it was marginally better however we had no choice but to stay due to our travel commitments the outside noise travels in very easily will never stay here again,0
769,this is a beautiful hotel with elegant rooms excellent breakfast lovely pool and spectacular views the staff was friendly and helpful we would stay there again and recommend without hesitation,1
770,athens was our first stop on a day holiday in greece and i was a bit skeptical about the city post recession and the customer service levels i was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality shown by everyone at this hotel the receptionist xristina was particularly helpful as she helped us making reservations and figure out our itinerary even for our next stop mykonos furthermore they were very flexible with the checkout time and offered a great breakfast the hotel is and feels very new and the location is perfect if you do want to be right in the middle of the action but want to be close enough,1
771,this was my first visit at this hotel as arrive often for business my usual hotel was duly booked so i chose this one and it was amazing small very modern and clean reception super friendly and helpful great alcohol at the bar of the hotel room was spacious and clean modern and equipped with all that needed including cold drinks coffee and bottle of wine also a large balcony breakfast is on the roof and super cool with nice view area you ca choose better in the center city but quiet area super chic with lots of high brands store and restaurants close to all shopping and tourist attraction will definitely return and stay there again,1
772,fantastic friendly and helpful staff breakfast improved further since last time rooms very nice and good value area superb a few things to improve would be easier to use air condition another lift as waiting times can be high at times cooler bed linen for the summer as the bed feels a bit too hot in the hot season in my opinion,1
773,i arrived here yesterday after canceling three other hotels in the center of athens while this cozy beautiful boutique hotel is centrally located but it quiet and away from crowd front desk ladies were most friendly and helpful in suggesting several tours breakfast is great the hotel is located in a residential posh area surrounded with high end stores but just minutes walk away from metro parliament national garden and many other activities i am enjoying my stay and will most definitely recommend and will return in future it feels like home thank you,1
775,the hotel is tucked off of a windy road at the base of lycabettus hill it provided wonderful views of athens and the acropolis we had a wonderful dinner at their rooftop restaurant and dessert oh my dessert was heavenly the included breakfast had a pretty varied selection to choose from sour cherry juice is amazing and refreshing a room for two is smaller by american hotel room standards but i expected it so i was bothered by it i did appreciate the bathroom having two doors separating it from the main room this is important when you sharing a room with someone it helped with privacy the room was nicely done and view was amazing as you walk into the room and open the curtain to the balcony you are hit with an awesome view of the acropolis i loved waking up and going to sleep to this view the hotel staff was beyond excellent everyone from concierge the spa and restaurant were very friendly and welcoming as a said they made the start of our trip wonderful thanks st george,1
776,st george is located in a nice leafy part of athens with great eateries and shops within walking distance it has amazing views of athens and proved to be a comfortable stay for one night rooftop pool was a great place to unwind and have a drink rooms require a facelift and hotel is in need of a little refurbishment room was overcrowded with arm chairs and fridge was warm,1
777,i stayed in different hotels in the last two months and this is the worst rooms that i was they put me in a room where the air conditioning water was coming in instead of going out and made a huge paddle inside when i complained they said to put me in a suite at no extra cost the air conditioning again was making some noises but no water leaking the bed was very hard the settee was partly reaped and part of the wallpaper was yellowish due to water leakage at some whole decoration must have been at least years old,0
778,we stayed here for two nights although the second night we have to leave at in the morning for a flight it was clean comfortable and walking distance to the old town area and acropolis breakfast was simple but ok the only negative is the desk controls the air conditioning and will only turn down to a certain level not to your comfort level this part was not comfortable we had a view of an abandoned building but were in the room much anyway easy to find your way around from here,1
779,we stayed at athens cypria hotel three nights in late june to booked several months in advance rooms for two families a family unit for four people that included two double rooms with a connecting door and a superior triple room for three adults that included one king bed and one single bed separated by a partition also had a jacuzzi rooms were spacious clean and hotel location is excellent in a small and quiet alley that starts from the famous ermou street within walking distance to all major sights in the city minutes walk from syntagmatos hotel has been recently renovated which is a big plus its design is modern and pleasant the breakfast was excellent it included everything needed to open the day staff was friendly and courteous a very good choice to explore the city by foot,1
781,reasonably priced hotel in a great location just off ermou near sintagmamany options on the nice breakfast buffet but they do start until am which is a problem when you have early flightsstaff are all pleasantmany options for dining within a short walkthe rooms here are small and could do with some modernisation and revamped bathroomsin house caffe has reasonable meals at good prices tooin room mini bar and safe were handywalls are very thin and neighbours were making a porno with a goat i think overall would i stay here again yeswould i recommend to my parents and friends yesnot quite the star i used to but it served the purpose,1
782,clean rooms comfortable beds good location helpful staff and rich to was my first time in this hotel i will prefer it again for my holiday and future bussiness trips thanks to whole the staffs for their helps they always smile,1
783,athens avenue hotelgrounds and amenities fairly new hotel with a much appreciated cleanliness the designs are very sleek and modern nice touch restaurant the food was excellent the breakfast buffet is does have a wide variety however it has items you will desire to start your day well done staff very pleasant staff front desk and restaurant staff were phenomenal i had several questions and they were able to answer them and provide recommendations for me the was absolutely quick and painless very impressed location i was a huge fan of the location i am a solo traveler and found it difficult to walk around the area at certain times of the day alone even before sunset i did feel unsafe but i felt uncomfortable the location has large amount of strip clubs and sex shops overall i certainly stay here again but not alone i recommend to family and friends,1
784,i am a representative of a dutch shipping company and we had a corporate event pax at divani palace acropolis in april accomodation conference facilities and meals were above our expectations super friendly personnel helped us in planning and implementation of our event and all our wishes were fulfilled location is just perfect i would like to highly recommend this hotel both for business and leasure purposes special thanks to ioanna and dina polina,1
785,i loved that the staff met us at the door to our room with cookies and ice cold water we had a great view of the acropolis from our swimming pool was nice and the surroundings were very roof top restaurant was very good but the soft drinks were over priced my husband ended up spending us on three diet cokes wine would have been morning buffet was very bar was open late and was willing to give me ice for my staff helped me find the roof top movie theater that does movies on saturday night there is nothing like sitting on a roof top and watching a movie and having the acropolis in the back ground,1
786,we stayed at the divani palace acropolis twice each time for two nights on our way to and from the greek islands the hotel can not be better situated for all the sights the rooftop bar has incredible views of the acropolis the hotel is within close walking distance of the acropolis the acropolis museum etc staff were always very friendly and helpful we booked an executive room which is a grade higher than the entry level deluxe room the room had air conditioning and free wifi that both worked relatively well the only downside to the room was the twin beds that are standard in executive rooms as a couple we would have preferred a double bed,1
787,for a chain for hotels the divani palace acropolis has given us extremely friendly and personal service the provide you with a service and add that extra touch to everything they do for you i am highly breakfast spread is wide the hotel location is fantastic a few mins walk from the acropolis and the acropolis museum and the rooms are cozy and comfortable i highly recommend this hotel and you to the staff for making our stay a great one,1
788,we are currently staying at the divani palace hotel this hotel is in the perfect location walking distance to the parthenon acropolis museum botanical gardens syntagma square and many more the are plenty of restaurants coffee shops mini supermarkets nearby the buffet breakfast is lovely especially as they have the greek cuisine on offer as well as the traditional western breakfast greek dishes included are the yummy rizogalo the egg cheese and tomato mixture the greek sweets and the creamy feta the rooms are clean and comfortable,1
789,we stayed nights at the hotel the room for was perfect for our needs and the location of the divani is exceptional as you can see the view from the roof top bar at night made the last night of our trip the hotel is clean public rooms very attractive breakfast is well done and varied the food in the pool bar and roof top bar is very good and well near the acropolis museum and plaka area cabs are easy to get but be sure you predetermine the price before entering,1
790,we were warmly welcomed into this beautiful oasis in the heart of athens i was traveling with two teenagers who were very quickly made to feel welcome during a summer heat wave we were fortunate to be allocated a triple room with a breathtaking view of the acropolis the breakfast were very well prepared and extensive lunch however was very slow and i am guessing most people do not have lunch here as the bar man who took our order seemed bored and made us feel as if we had disturbed him the front office staff were initially very helpful however i guess it depended which individual served you overall a very pleasant and well situated hotel,1
791,here we are the three of us having cocktails and dinner with the acropolis either directly in our vision or over our depending on where we magnificent food was really good and service friendly and attentive i have dined rooftop at the intercontinental this is good or better i would recommend the hotel and the rooftop to anyone tomorrow morning at we are off to climb the a place kinnaman,1
792,we stayed here twice in july before and after a trip to the greek islands this is an ideally located hotel if you are a tourist visiting athens you can literally see the acropolis from your balcony assuming an upper floor on the street side and you lean out a little be aware it an old style hotel with a very feel sort of place where the shower is over the bathtub and at least our room was a bit tired mattress a bit worn etc and we were upgraded on our second stay to what they call an executive room which is a step up from the standard room so on the star rating system it a more like to star than star but having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again the charming staff and great location more than compensate finally the breakfast included in our booking was a great range of greek and western style food hence the rating of which i have rounded to a,1
794,this is a great choice if you are looking for somewhere centrally located the acropolis is five minutes walk as is plaka highly recommended to reach anywhere further afield taxis are readily available all the staff were polite and helpful we especially appreciated the in assisting with luggage and calling taxis we only stayed the one night because we had just come off a cruise and were returning home the following day if we were in athens again we would stay at this hotel,1
795,the hotel itself is just as you see in the pictures and is in a great central location for visiting all historic places we were very glad we chose this hotel what stood out to us though was the incredible staff that helped with every minor detail and any minor concern we actually had a child get sick on the trip and the staff was fantastic they got us to a local doctor that spoke english had all transportation arranged for us and then found a pharmacy open on a sunday and arranged a car to take me to and from the pharmacy the driver even came in to help as google translate and myself were doing a poor job the driver translated for me got the medicine for my child and took me back to the hotel the rest of the week the doormen asked my daughter how she was and watched after us what an amazing group of people and what an unmatched level of service the amount of languages spoken by the staff was also impressive michael the doorman is one of the nicest people we have encountered in our travels thank you for everything and for going above and beyond,1
796,were there from to july and had a great time with the family and especially the dinners at the sky lounge with the scenic view of the acropolis at night is a sight not to be missed i never seen such hospitality of the staff at the sky lounge what love and courtesy they serve is just love to visit athens again and stay here congrats to the team for an outstand no show,1
797,excellente site with a stunning view ggod connection to public transportation beautiful rooms good and friedly service very helpful and supportive outstanding roof garden restaurant and staff breakfast buffet not very selected for a star hotel the movements of the chairs in the neighbouring rooms were much too loud pads under the furniture might solve the problem,1
800,we booked the divani palace because of its close proximity to the acropolis and plaka all of which are within walking distance the hotel itself is very nice it very clean and modern staff were friendly there is a gift shop pool and it all so has a rooftop restaurant the restaurant has a direct view of the acropolis which is magnificent at night something you really do want to miss enjoyed our stay in all oh there are also ancient ruins on the lower level which they built around when the were constructing the hotel,1
801,my husband and i stayed at the divani acropolis for three nights and enjoyed it very much we could see the acropolis from our room esp impressive when it is lit at night it is close to walk to the acropolis and the museum we walked the few blocks from the metro station after taking the metro from the airport and had no difficulty finding the hotel the bed was a king size and comfortable the bathroom had a large tub with a shower our hallway and room was freshly painted did feel tired to us the air conditioner kept the room at a comfortable temp and we did hear outside noise there was an outdoor pool which we used every afternoon as it was over degrees the week we were in athens it is easy to use the metro to get to the other areas of the city the staff were very friendly and helpful and the lobby is large and impressive we saw many different restaurants nearby as we were walking around the staff told us where to catch the xpress bus to take to the port for the cruise we were taking we would definitely stay there again,1
802,we stayed at the divani palace in early july the room was clean not that large for two and a kid and a bit outdated the staff was helpful and friendly but very little english the rooftop restaurant was ok but street restaurant there much better a very short walk to the acropolis and the plaka the area seemed very safe and friendly overall we really liked the divani palace and would definitely stay there again,1
803,the divani is in an ideal location the acropolis is within walking distance as is the museum and many other tourist attractions we have stayed in many hotels we thought the lobby was swish considering the price we paid for nights the rooms do have the best views onto residential areas but we only used it to sleep in beds were comfortable shower hot and plenty of water towels changed as needed and beds always remade we did stay long enough for the sheets to be pool was refreshing closed and shaded for a large amount of the day best time to go is as we found few people there and lots of sun drinks are somewhat expensive but the iced coffees are delicious however walking up the road to dive coffee gets you a bigger one for a cheaper price you must visit sfika for food it not far you can almost see it from the door to the hotel the food is delicious we went to the secret rooftop restaurant pricey and though everyone was so pleasant not really worth used the blue tour bus ticket allowed days of exploring just what you need we off to santorini now,1
804,divani palace acropolis is a wonderful hotel we stayed nights and loved the hotel and their very nice staff the pool area is very nice and lovely food the roof terrace has a fantastic view and the rooms a very nice and cosy also the area is so charming we can only recommend this hotel to everyone we loved staying here you divani palace best regards the engholm family from dk,1
805,a solid choice the location of the divani palace ca be beat it a two block walk to the base of the acropolis and we had a great view of the parthenon from our balcony it also only about a minute walk to the plaka district the hotel itself is older and a bit dated but the room was comfortable and clean the staff was great and very helpful when we had questions the rooftop restaurant was a bit on the small side but again you ca beat the view the food was also excellent the grilled lamb chops and the valrhona chocolate filled with crème brulée were fantastic breakfast was good with a wide variety of offerings and while the hotel itself does not have an airport shuttle service they were more than happy to arrange that for us all in all a great choice for us,1
806,clean nice hotel pool was a nice treat in the hot weather balcony faced the pool with a slight view of the acropolis but only had one chair in room safe did eat here as it was way too expensive lots of nice dining options close by very convenient for the acropolis,1
808,the hotel is in good location it has huge halls and pretends to be luxury but it is not especially rooms are definitely not stars they are ok with everything needed but nothing special when booking the description says that the executive rooms should be of better standard than de lux especially they should have better view this is not true we were able to compare because we reserved two de lux and one executive and actually the cheaper rooms had better view this so called view costs about per night the hotel stands perpendicular to the acropolis so all the rooms on the side with the view have similar not the best perspective it is beautiful but not direct look at acropolis this can be found at the roof breakfast is good very nice people working there as opposed to the front desk where a little more genuine friendliness would be nice there is a lovely pool area but the sun comes there only for a few hours during the day otherwise covered by the shadow of the buildings the prices in the bar are too high for example espresso costs it is a pity because almost nobody orders from that bar overall the hotel is good but i had much bigger expectations therefore maybe i am a little disappointed,1
809,this hotel is amazing it clean modern and centrally located the breakfast was delicious the room while smaller had enough amenities and facilities i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a nice hotel that is close to all things,1
810,a gem in one of athens best neighborhoods on a quiet street a great location on the foot of mount lycabettus with breath taking views of athens the acropolis the city all the way to the agean minutes away from kolonaki square and great shopping less than minutes from syntagma square and within walking distance to monastiraki and the heart of athens a boutique hotel that i would say caters to the eclectic customers who want it all but without the hustle and bustle of the noisy city sights the staff is most pleasant and accommodating the restaurant lovely as is the pool area on the roof top,1
811,first stayed here in returned again for one night before joining a cruise same high standard of service lovely breakfast on a high floor to overlook the acropolis fab rooftop pool with bar and sun loungers to enjoy the magnificent view thank you to the lovely staff on reception who booked us a meal at kuzina to return where we had eaten a memorable meal on their roof top in it was just as good this time i would highly recommend this hotel for any stay in athens,1
812,fantastic view from the balcony excellent service good location we stayd one night can recommend this hotel egen you stay in athens we hasa nice stay and will probably book this hotel again if we travel to athens,1
813,my wife and i stayed here for nights after sailing from venice the hotel was well staffed the room was fine on the lower ground floor with what is described as a courtyard view and had a nice balcony with chairs and table on it it looked out to some trees and a close up view of the next door bathroom was well equipped and quite well maintained we had a very comfortable bed made up of two singles booted together the pool area was quite well shaded but sun beds were at a premium the pool itself was very clean and a nice temperature the hotel is in an up market area of athens with some very nice eateries and cafes close by down the hill a bit,1
814,i love this hotel and come back several times a year great location wonderful rooms the best view in town and super friendly staff if you travel with your wife or husband you need to enjoy a evening on the balcony of the restaurant,1
815,we stayed here two nights the first night after arriving in athens for our honeymoon and the last night before we left anthens at the end of our first night we stayed in the acropolis view room on the floor this room was the worst room we stayed in during our honeymoon it was very very small did work no hot water and old bathroom not what you would expect from a star last night we stayed in a standard room on the fourth floor the room and bathroom were much more modern and front desk service was good however they obviously push restaurants they work with they charged us euros for a miniature pringles chip absurd we stayed in hotels in mykonos santorini crete and this hotel was disappointing compared to the breakfast offered was very limited and again the worst breakfast at a hotel we had while in the price i would recommend trying to a find a better hotel as in my opinion this hotel is not a star hotel,0
818,a boutique hotel is a hotel which typically has between and rooms in unique settings with upscale accommodations that what george lycabettus exactly is read my whole review on roxirose and find out which are the best things that we experienced here,1
819,we spent one night here at the end of a cruise from venice good accommodation and bathroom although no view as overlooked the hotel inner courtyard rooftop swimming pool and bar good but noisy from machinery good breakfast with super views across athens from the restaurant bit away from the city centre but only a short taxi ride,1
820,i have already mentioned the interest of this hotel for the outstanding sightseeing over the acropolis and the entire city of athens that you may enjoy at breakfast or for a drink at sunset on the terrace near the pool the staff is very friendly and helpful but i recommend climbing to the top of mount lycabetus nearby for the lazy there is a funicular mn from the hotel and up altough there is often a queue of tourists so count mn but it is better to walk up by the road and the partially staired path min from the hotel for normal people if you are trained at mountain climbing the terrace of the monastry is the ideal place to observe the sunset if you are lucky and observe carefully you will see the green light at the last second,1
821,the location of the hotel is probably the best one in athens as from the rooms you have a great overview over the entire citiy to the akropolis and behind to the harbour and the sea if weather is clear you can reach all museums and sights be feet have good restaurants in the near and an open air cinema with good films in the evening directly in front of the hotel in the morning you can swimm in the pool on the roof or walk up the hill to the very top to have a marvelous view,1
822,athens gets hot very hot so this is a great hotel because it has a nice rooftop pool with a bar the breakfast service is great and if you stay for more than nights you can get lunch at the hotel for free which was also delicious,1
823,the hotel view is unbeatable but if you stay somewhere else you can still enjoy it with a glass of wine on an evening the food was okay definitely prepared and presented but short on vegetables or things not drenched in oil or sauces but they went out of their way to find me salad ingredients and vegetables i will definitely stay there again if i go back to sure to ask what kind of room you getting some are stunning with big balconies and some are just tiny standard rooms with barely a window,1
824,nice hotel with an awesome rooftop pool that looks out over the whole city including the parthenon near a lot of upscale shopping and residences in an area that seems like athens upper east side also right next to the path up mt lycabettus,1
825,saint george was recommended to us by our daughter and son in law from the time we entired your lobby we were greeted with warm smiles and courteous service after checking in front desk offered us coffees while we waited for our room small gesture but very thoughtful staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in recommending sites in athens but best of all was our evening dinner and the incredible view of athens and the acropolis by night also a special thank you to our waiter kosta for treating us like royalty looking forward to visiting saint george lycabettus and staff in the near future,1
826,the hotel was great right in the heart of athens kolonaki suburb moments from the centre of the staff are extremely helpful the acropolis views family room was generous and quiet a great facilities of the gym and plunge pool were an added this up when you next in athens it wo disappoint,1
827,hotel was quite old and did look as advertised on the pictures for the price and the rate would have expected way better accommodation the rooms also smelled a lot of cigarette mattress was not comfortable at all,0
828,we stayed one night as a stopover before heading to spetses so did get to make use of any of the hotels facilities spa rooftop pool etc the location in elevated upmarket kolonaki suited our purpose as we were looking to explore the city this time whilst not far from town this area does offer a breather from the full scale madness of central athens we were warmly welcomed found the front desk crew to be outstandingly helpful efficient our room was in the new eco chic wing was spacious enough pleasantly but modestly decorated in a muted palette of beige white airy light with a balcony but not much of a view we slept well suffered no noise pollution the bathroom was fitted out in contemporary minimal style was fine though the silly vase like basin is a classic case of form over function we did eat as there is a superb restaurant right next door but we did have drinks in the floor bar the views are astounding surely the best in the city drinks are pricey for the privilege of such vistas but it worth a visit decor is a little dated up here as is the case in many other areas of the hotel from a decor perspective the hotel struggles to scrape a star rating for the price paid though i was more then happy with our choice the fantastic views excellent staff made it a winner for our brief visit,1
829,this is a fantastic hotel it has an incomparable view of athens please see our pictures from the breakfast buffet the facility is top notch the rooms are spacious the facility is modern the pool breathtaking and the staff is first class my only complaint is that is sits on the largest hill in athens and it is a long way from most of the tourist sites it was not that big a deal to us but if you decide to walk to any major attraction i recommend taking a cab back to the hotel it is a long walk,1
830,fantastic location great staff amazing views from room rooftop pool restaurant breakfast and great wifi this is our third stay with the family and it our place of choice when visiting athens,1
832,poor room very little with old furnitures old bed dirty walls small armchairs terrible views the swimming pool is not adequate for a star hotel the terrace is very poor it has a lot of possibilities the restaurant and specially the bar is very very expensive only the employees and the views from the restaurant save the assessment,0
833,breathtaking views from both the pool and the breakfast room over the acropolis and whole city of athens makes this property a great choice we liked the fact that it was out of the crazy of athens and set in the upmarket kolonaki district but it did mean taxis as walking in the soaring heat of july was just not an option it was a minute walk down hill to syntagma square which was a surprise as the hotel blurb states but that said taxis in and around athens are well priced so a taxi to the plaka was euros the rooms are not big but have all you need including a little balcony the beds are huge and comfortable but without question the highlight is breakfast because to be able to sit outside and enjoy a great feed with the best view ever was unbeatable,1
834,i had a short stay here the rooms were small and comfy slippers and a robe were provided the check in and check out process was quick and easy they were very helpful in securing an early morning taxi for me to the airport i was disappointed that breakfast was not included in the room rate,1
836,what a fantastic find this hotel was this modern hotel is exceptional value with modern rooms and helpful staff the highlight was the rooftop pool and bar wihch felt like an oasis with its wonderful views to the acropolis,1
837,we spent a in this hotel which is very convenient as many things are in walking welcome from the staff and a very good level for the rooms cleaned and nicely prepared the best thing is to enjoy a dinner at the rooftop enjoying the night view to the acropolis and its monuments food are excellent as sure you get a room with a view on the inner court you will have absolute silence the ac in our room was too efficient as it could not be regulated so i had to ask for extra blankets knowing it was outside,1
838,whilst the novotel did say it is in central it is out of the central zone for cabs the area surrounding the novotel may have been great in its day but at the moment it is in transition more of the less lovely parts of athens hookers addicts and homeless all harmless but none the less a difficult conversation with the younger members of the family about why these people had no home to go to,1
839,this hotel was clean the beds were comfortable the breakfast was plentiful and the rooftop was amazing however it is located in a ghetto with drug dealers and users all around if you want a hotel where you can walk around outside this is not the place to stay if you okay taking a taxi to go everywhere then this is a great choice,1
840,friendly clean quick metro ride to major sites despite the fact that the area is too pretty i never felt unsafe in the evening it gets stars for the stunning view of the parthenon from the rooftop bar pool area,1
841,great hotel less so staff was wonderful food and pool area wonderful centrally located but a shady area we walked to dinner one night met some interesting types taxi back i would stay here again knowing the area know but is not appealing as graffiti and other dominate the area,1
843,if there would not be this roof top pool with a nice view on the acropole i would only evaluate it as star the location itself is not very good quite unfriendly people on the street and at least from the metro station do walk back alone at night breakfast is also crowded with slow replenishment during peak time you sometimes need to wait to get rooms are to the novotel standard clean and staff very friendly,1
844,visited athens to catch up with relatives from the other side of the globe we could have picked a better hotel to start our journey around greece and italy the hotel staff and rooms were great the staff were so friendly and could not do enough for you they joined us when we laughed and ensured our family and friends were looked after it was like a star establishment highly recommended and thanks to the staff and particular the evening shift in the dining room and bar we had a you and all the best you were fabulous,1
845,we tried this restaurant during our walk downtown athens we were surprised by the variety of the menu for a light dinner the salad with prosciutto was amazing we also tried the greek cheeses dish and it was also good the chef with the eyeglasses was very helpful and he was explaining with politeness and professionnalisme all the details of the dishes best choice for a light dinner downtown,1
847,novotel had the potential to be a luxury hotel but it constantly let itself down to begin with they had mixed up the rooms and ours was a lot smaller than expected secondly the way children were allowed to run wild around the hotel made the experience far from relaxing the pool is smaller than it seems and was packed with small children swimming in it all day despite the pool rules saying that children must be accompanied in the pool however parents seemed to let their kids mess around in the pool making no adults want to swim and the staff did not do anything about it due to the lack of sun beds it felt like a race to get somewhere to sit on the rooftop the worst experience i had here was with the food on the rooftop not only were the prices generally extortionately high for a can of coke but the hotel prices were unbelievable we thought we would eat there due to the area surrounding the hotel having no shops or restaurants although the prices were very high we thought the food would be worth it and we could of been more wrong i ordered the lamb shank which came from frozen and i sure they had been using the microwave they had in the kitchen my boyfriends food was awful he ordered a chicken burger but what arrived was a plate of chips with two minuscule patties oddly flavoured i regret staying here,0
848,it was not too difficult to find with gps while the indoor parking is a test of the driver skill esp we had a big car there are plenty of outdoor parking around the hotel room is quite the bare minimum novotel is a usual in asia but this one would be our amenities are at just minimum towels were very thin the room was that comfortable overall to make me stay in longer lots of choices at breakfast with both hot and cold dishes staff looked very grumpy though hotel souvenir shop got some interesting stuff i like that the hotel installed a kinnect at the lobby this keeps the older kids entertained,1
850,we were in the hotel two days and the experience was nice the staff friendly and willing to help breakfast very rich and varied the hotel has good location to go to different places by walking or by taxi thanks for the attention,1
852,i was here for nights and i paid nearly euros a night at first i was given a room which was on opposite side of the street it was very small and it had no window so i asked them to change it then i got a room that has a balcony to the street but the ac was not working fine and it was hot i asked them to have a look at it the second day and they fixed it i was happy with the service it was a best western class so i was not expecting something extra i heard the street was a place for prostitutes before and the polis cleaned it up however locals told me to be sharp when i was going back to the hotel at night i could see weird and junky people when i walked to a museum close to this hotel but nothing bad happened,1
853,stayed here had rooms as couples guy at desk very friendly and helpful and he doubles as our bar guy in the small room where we ended each day to wind down after very busy day exploring the interesting city rooms with all the basics very clean but shower recess very small and water goes over floor but nothing a towel did fix the breakfast was very something for every one the lift is very small but it made interesting talking point no complaints and would return if ever in athens again value for money,1
854,this is a basic budget friendly hotel that was adequate for our needs what it lacked in accommodations was made up for by the wonderful staff that offered assistance directions etc the only problem was that we were offered only key card which wa a little inconvenient we were concerned about the area initially because of the graffiti on the nearby buildings but did encounter any problems it was located right across from the archaeological museum which to me was the best museum also was close to good restaurants roof top area has distant view of the acropolis,1
856,the staff were all great especially the barman who helped us organise a drinks party for our daughter he could have been more helpful he chilled the wine we brought with us in his fridge and provided glasses and ice buckets we would also recommend the breakfast,1
857,the hotel is a ten minute walk from the metro station and conveniently located to many sights around athens the rooms are a good size shower a little small and not enough water pressure but is was great to have a balcony too all the staff are very friendly and knowledgable and i would definitely stay here again,1
858,we stayed only for one night but the efficiency professionalism cordiality and helpfulness of the staff amazed us we arrived while it was raining and they insisted on going out in the rain to carry our luggage they did the same thing the following morning on our check out they quickly provided my elderly mother with a chair while we waited for check in which was fast and efficient they gave us an upgrade although it was a one night stay recommended a great restaurant for dinner and had us directions as well the room was spacious with a balcony and all the necessary amenities thanks to the staff hats off to you,1
859,olympia film festival authority booked the hotel for me i stayed only one night here before joining the festival at pyrgos i had very little time but i could use my time seeing the museum that was at a walking distance the neighborhood was quite and peaceful and the streets were full of ripe oranges they served a very good breakfast and i must say my short stay was wonderful,1
860,family of rooms hotel is in a good location however the neighborhood is very run down upon arrival a very cheerful staff greets you there are several stairs to climb to get to the central elevator which is very small the staff happily gets your bags to your rooms so this is not an issue very clean breakfast area with a lovely woman making sure you are seated and comfortable rooms are very clean bathroom is a decent size air conditioning is is no hotel appointed parking they suggest a parking garage but it is several blocks away and not a well lit walk back to the hotel many shopping areas are an easy walk in you need a cab to town the hotel will call you one we loved our stay here,1
861,arrived for two nights stay with other families staff could have been more better really helpful and pleasant good value restaurants and bars a short walk away hour walk to plaka for slightly more expensive bars and restaurants thank you,1
862,stayed here for nights as a solo traveler the rooms were very clean beds were comfy and the rooms were quite having a small balcony was a nice touch were very nice and always happy to answer any is in a good location i felt safe walking around the area and it is only about a walk away from the main touristy areas,1
863,this is a nice hotel mere steps from the metro and abundant shopping and a short walk to markets and the monastraiki neighborhood the hotel staff is efficient and friendly do miss the free breakfast i usually do care much for breakfast buffets but this one is full of fresh fruit bread pastries eggs meats yogurt the options are plentiful and the staff keeps the food very fresh the rooms are clean and the hotel is very quiet,1
864,located next to the metro station and also a taxi piazza outside the hotel makes getting out and about very a very modern design very nice and clean rooms children friendly nice prices are really good,1
865,we had an adjoining room king bed and bath in one room king and pullout and bath in the other fantastic rooms great breakfast in the morning and extremely helpful hotel staff hop on hop off bus has stop right at square very near flea market and many other fun parts of athens,1
866,we stayed here for nights as a family of children room was spacious kids slept on the sofa bed is very good and effective flat screen televisions on the wall infront of each bed mini bar available coffee machine only makes coffee no kettle or tea making facilities available several sockets available for charging devices though no usb sockets bathroom has excellent lighting and storage for many toiletry bags jacuzzi jets in bath was an absolute treat shower bath is a in only received toiletries on arrival not again towels good quality face cloths not available in room bathroom drainage did work so well but maintenance took care of that very impressed with the safe where electrical devices can be locked up while charging a very well thought through idea breakfast was a same same every single day not even the slightest variation in dishes being served dissapointment with the two greek pastry dishes very basic and really did impress us at all basic juice filter coffee and tea available any other beverages to be charged though no signs mentioning this anywhere we loved walking in to his hotel after a long day and it always smelled so fresh and clean cleanliness is staff are well trained professional and all so friendly except for one terribly rude young waitress who screamed at me and made a big scene at breakfast about me politely questioning why i was charged for my cappuccino the previous morning a friendly explanation would have done,1
867,the location of the hotel could not have been more perfect it just a short drive from the airport and the hotel is centrally located in athens city center great design and a short walk to all the chicest restaurants and shops,1
868,with good access to metro and easy walking distance to lots of sights and restaurants this was a perfect place to stay in the city good cool room to escape to when the heat of the day became too much,1
869,the service was decent the breakfast also decent people were helpful at the reception the best though is the location which is very accessible the only part i would compalint about is their lifts they are terribly small and can suffucate you especially with more than persons and when get in oh boy the plaka the acropolis the syntagma square etc are all walking distance so sourcing food and place to spend time walking is plenty and good even if you take a taxi the minimum fare is charged which eur please note the taxi people can be quite ecasive and demand much more so please be cautious,1
870,great location metro is a stone throw away convenient store right outside the hotel walking distance to most places of interests and eateries very safe area very comfortable bed very clean toilet with strong shower head good breakfast which serves till most friendly very helpful staff etc i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting athens,1
871,this hotel just gets it right their most important assets are their employees people who stood out for us were the front desk especially maria and dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend extra days in athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship the location is excellent and close to almost everything the area seems a little dodgy at night however it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world perhaps safer than most there are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel with an excellent dessert shop right next door the rooms are spacious the public areas well laid out the food really good especially the breakfast and room service and the decor is modern yet functional this is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment i especially like the interactive smart tv in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device the wifi is free and fast the beds and pillows they have pillow menus are extremely comfortable and all areas including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after they have plugs next to the beds and also a usb charging cable for telephones or ipads the ac worked well especially during the celsius heat whilst we were there the rooms have fully stocked minibars and a highly quality brand of soap body lotion and,1
872,hotel location looks good so we booked may be the cheapest room because we only spent one night in athens the room was too small and did have any window its ok thats why it is the cheapest room but what about the towels their colour went yellow and smell very weird and the bed also smells like that just try another hotel there are many options in the centre of athens,0
874,the hotel was beautiful the staff were professional and most importantly it was clean the rooms were a good size with all modern facilities nice and quiet for a good sleep and within walking distance to some delicious restaurants right near the train station made life easy thank you,1
875,went there after long fly and had found our hotel had no reservation for booked the room on line we went there the first thing they give us was a refreshment was friendly and they were sorry that we had some unpleasant was causy and was nice and clean as well water pressure was very was was was shop down stairs was in all highly recommended,1
877,the hotel is about a min walk to the center of athens the hotel is lovely chic had beautiful art displayed but what was amazing was the staff so beyond helpful we went to santorini for days and they let us store our bags there with no charge and made us to go breakfast packs to take with us on the ferry since we were departing so early they took so much time to show us where we should go and visit,1
878,absolutely loved this hotel room was lovely breakfast served on the balcony outside even made my milkshake mad boyfriend a milkshake for breakfast every morning felt really safe around the area and walked to all the main attractions day trip to one of the islands a must,1
879,we stayed here with friends for nights the rooms were clean the staff extremely friendly and the breakfast buffet just amazing a minute walk and you right at the bottom of the acropolis there are a lot of restaurants nearby and the nightlife center is very close as well we would recommend it,1
880,pallas athena grecotel boutique hotel makes our stay in greece wonderful the place is so accommodating the rooms are decorated beautifully the price is reasonable and worth it the breakfast served was delicious hotel staff are hospitable and caring they can be easily asked for favors and make way to give it to us recommended,1
881,this hotel was a great surprise as it was a great value as well as a modern quirky fun hotel in the middle of the city the hotel was centrally located to walk to the squares and sites neighborhood was a bit sketchy at night and would recommend being in a group in the evening however we had no trouble and enjoyed our stay our room was huge with a large terrace and nicely appointed bathroom amenities the restaurant was lovely and the friendly waiter even taught us some greek to get us through our visit all in all the hotel and staff were pleasant and i would recommend this hotel,1
882,lovely hotel in central athens with really friendly helpful staff the breakfast is great but we did eat in the restaurant for lunch or dinner the rooms and bathrooms are big and most have a balcony i think although if you looking for a view of the acropolis you need to request it our room was out the back of the hotel and looked onto an old disused building did bother us but might some people i guess there a stop for the sightseeing bus tour in the square right opposite the hotel and it a walk monastiraki station where you find a good little flea market and only another to plaka from there lots of lovely cafes and restaurants no pool and the gym is tiny but overall pretty good value for money and a really handy location,1
883,the rooms were a bit small but were well taken care of and clean the breakfast was really good and the dining area had a nice outdoor terrace which we enjoyed eating on the location was excellent as well it was within easy walking distance to the popular sites would definitely return if we were are in town,1
884,we stayed nights in this wonderful hotel and were able to walk everywhere in central athens our room looked out at the acropolis which is especially stunning at night the pool and cafe bar had an even better view and offered nice lunch and snacks,1
885,i had visited this hotel at the past for different reasons but now realize that is very nice also for business meetings and workshops my team meeting was there and was very successful the service was great the rooms nice not hesitate to use this hotel for this perpoze,1
886,i booked a suite and the room was very spacious we had a small balcony with a view of the acropolis which was a bonus staff excellent concierge ditto the room was immaculate and well furnished also the included breakfast buffet was out of this world with so many choices i never been to athens before and only had a few days so i wanted a hotel in a good location and this fit the bill min walk to the acropolis the new acropolis museum a metro station good restaurants and shopping around pm our first night there was a knock on our door room service which we had not ordered a nice bottle of greek red wine two glasses plates and or pieces of fresh fruit compliments of the hotel nice,1
887,we stayed here two nights at the end of a cruise it was a wonderful spot to complete out trip the rooms are spacious and very comfortable the reception desk was more than helpful in recommended restaurants and helping us with transfers,1
889,a fantastic hotel in the heart of athens so close to the plaka and shopping as well to the museum and the parthenon i would highly recommend staying there the rooms food and service were all amazing must do dinner at the roof top restaurant one night while you are there,1
890,great central location for exploring minutes from the acropolis and loads of local dining well served rooms and the optional acropolis view is well worth paying the extra for the roof top restaurant is a great place to spend an evening watching the city and acropolis light up at night very helpful and attentive staff complimentary fruit and wine in room a nice surprise the kids loved making their own waffles at breakfast a hotel first petite and bijou rooftop pool very popular a great place to immerse yourself in the wonders of athens,1
891,the hotel itself is older but very clean and the service can not be beat in the heart of the action and a short walk to the acropolis you can easily and safely roam the streets of plaka great shops and restaurants are to be found the hotel pool and bar on the rooftop offer a great view of the acropolis it truly amazing at night we do regret our choice,1
892,we loved this hotel and location in plaka close to acropolis and other historical monuments we walked everywhere rooms were very nice clean with good airconditioning roof top pool with view of acropolis and nice little bar breakfast was excellent with lot of choices staff very pleasant and happy to help would stay again,1
894,the hotel is centrally located a relatively short walk from the airport bus at syntagma and from the restaurant area in the plaka wifi is good rooms are spacious and beds comfortable there are a variety of offerings for breakfast which can be taken inside or at the outside garden the rooftop restaurant and pool one level lower also provide views of the acropolis there is no shade above the sun lounges around the pool though which is a bit hotel and its facilities are what one would expect for a hotel of this type our room had limited views of the acropolis,1
895,the hotel is at a central location the rooms are high quality and the service is great not expensive for a stars hotel good value for money breakfast is good and pretty basic the hotel is located in a safe area but you do have to walk a little if you wish to get to the bars area,1
896,for the price and the pictures i expected more the overall feel of the hotel is that it lacks the gloss of its pictures it is average the bathroom was in need of maintenance glass on the bath to stop the splash was falling off and most disappointing of all was the air conditioning or lack thereof after a full hot day of sight seeing sadly the air conditioner on the room provided little to no relief the final straw for me was the toilet making weird running noises all night so i asked to be moved the hotel obliged the next night and i was moved to a bigger room and the air conditioner worked a little better however when turned on you could smell very strongly cigarette smoke you ca beat its location i agree with other reviews but to be frank i could not wait to leave,0
897,we loved the electra palace location was fantastic right in walking distance of the plaka district and easy to get to all the sites the breakfast was huge and high quality lobby was spacious and had two computers we used to book our ferry tickets and some excursions room and bathroom were a little small but clean and in general could use some updates all in all i would stay again but a little pricey for what its worth,1
898,the hotel is located in the back streets of athens within easy walking distance to syntagma square monastiraki flea markets and underground metro hotel is rated is stars and the amenities and service from the staff is view at night from the pool deck and cocktail bar of the acropolis at night is rooms are presented very well and with all the accessories the only minor blemish they lacked spare power points in the the past we have stayed at other hotels nearby now that we have the electra palace we would certainly return,1
901,what a lovely place my girlfriends and i met here to start our greek vacation it is such a great value the pool is divine it overlooks the plaka and you can see the beautiful ruins it is by far the nicest hotel in the plaka i would stay here again and again the staff was amazing and very helpful during our stay ask for restaurant recommendations or the best way to get places they will help you,1
902,we stayed here nights total before and after a cruise the staff was friendly and helpful and the room quite comfortable if you do have a view of the acropolis from your room you may go to the floor swimming pool a floor bar and restaurant or the floor roof lots of restaurants and shops nearby,1
903,we stayed here for just nights at the tail end of our holiday the hotel is in a superb location within easy walking distance of most of the major sites and in the lovely plaka district fantastic view of the acropolis from the rooftop pool it a bit more luxurious than we used to but we chose it mainly for the location and with the idea of treating ourselves before going building is very nice and quite understated with a lovely garden area for breakfast complete with marauding turtle doves an interesting change from the usual pigeons our floor room was fine with a great view from the balcony and for the sunset breakfast was very good with something for everyone service was universally excellent and the staff were very friendly and extremely we arrived our fridge was working but was replaced first thing the next day i was surprised that the bed was more comfortable far too soft for my liking and probably could do with replacing the bathroom was very nice though the decor a bit over the in all a fine choice for a short stay and in the nicest part of the city i think it quite expensive for what it is but one probably paying for the location,1
904,very pleased with the location and rooms at this property did not spend too much time in the hotel room as we spent most of our trip walking around and exploring the area however we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel proximity to many attractions located within the plaka you are close to a variety of markets shops and restaurants only minutes walking distance from the acropolis museum acropolis and temple of olympian zeus,1
905,we have used the brand before this is a first class hotel location is city centre we had a panoramic view from our room of the acropolis roof pool was a great surprise sitting by the pool with a drink looking at the view fantastic could have stayed there all day worth every penny,1
906,we had a fabulous time at electra palace in athens it is a reasonably priced glamour style hotel in plaka we stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our trip and on our last night in greece the service was outstanding rooms were clean and the breakfast was excellent we also enjoyed sitting on the rooftop bar in the evenings with a beautiful view of the acropolis the friendly staff really went above and beyond to make our stay extra special the first night we received a bottle of wine and a plate of fruit during the last night of our vacation the hotel upgraded us to the presidential suite we felt incredibly lucky and could not have thought of a better way to relax in style before the long journey home the presidential suite was it had two plush rooms a balcony with a view of the acropolis and a private pool my favorite part of the presidential suite was the steam room hammam what a luxurious way to spend our last night in athens we already miss it so much and will definitely stay here again as for room choices i would recommend staying in an upper level room away from the street noise this is a great hotel for both couples and families,1
907,this is a hotel that really worths your money though is a bit heavy in style and furniture according to our taste we really did enjoy it located in the heart of the city we were expecting it noisy but on the contrary we experienced a tranquil sleep and stay rooms on the upper floors provide the best view indeed,1
908,smallish room but we upgraded to a suite for an extra charge as there were of us the service here is old fashioned hospitality very professional the breakfast is incredible and included loved the pool and spa very relaxing a short walk to the main sites of everything,1
909,pros old world charm and decorcourteous and professional staff not friendly we were upgraded to a suitelovely breakfastnice toiletriesgood and free wi fiwell located close to plakaawesome views of acropolis from swimming pool especially at pricey in high seasonentrance from a very narrow lane belying the grandeur of the hotelbreakfast area becomes very crowdedstaff could have been more friendly after getting super friendly staff at our hotels in mykonos santorini delphi and kalambaka we were a trifle disappointed we had a late night flight and i had a feeling they could have given us a late check out but did causing inconvenience to us as days were really hot to spend out in the open the bell hops always pointedly ask if you need assistance with the luggage implying indirectly in advance that a tip is in order one obviously does tip but to be implied in such a blatant manner in this quality of hotel was rooms though nice and large had no views,1
910,we stayed one night in this charming hotel in an excellent location in athens close walking distance to shops and sights the rooms are old fashioned but very comfortable and it was lovely to have the outdoor pool and bar area with magnificent views of the acropolis we ate at the rooftop restaurant and the food was wonderful one of the best steak tartare ever and delicious moussaka in a clay pot staff throughout hotel and restaurant very professional and those that like a hair salon there is an excellent one across the road and very reasonable,1
911,we have stayed here close to times and this hotel and the wonderful staff keep surprising us every time we stay here we are greeted by the amazing people who work here the hotel have everything you need pool overlooking acropolis fantastic restaurant gym spa beautiful atmosphere and again we have to mention the staff we love athens but this place makes the city even more amazing this has become our second home and we never want to stay in another hotel in athens book this hotel and you are guaranteed an amazing trip,1
912,we stayed for nights with my family loved the view if the acropolis from the restaurant at roons were comfortable and clean the staff was helpful breakfast was location was good it waa walking distance to the museum n acropolis,1
914,located in plaka this hotel is steps away from good shopping museums syntagma square and metro it is convenient for families couples and tour groups it has a nice pool although there are only a few lounge chairs and people fight for one throughout the day breakfast is included or it was for our booking and is an exceptional buffet with many choices including waffles,1
915,this is a very nice hotel in a great location in athens with very friendly and helpful staff the rooms are quiet the bathrooms are perfect size the breakfast was excellent the pool bar has a fantastic view of the acropolis,1
916,i was very impressed with the staff and facilities of this hotel the room is extremely comfortable and luxurious and the staff is extremely attentive and responsive breakfast and room service are delicious,1
917,we stayed two nights at the electra palace the view from the back terrace and the pool is unbeatable we did want to leave the hotel because of the spectacular view and the super friendly staff the wonderful streets of plaka are a block away with lots of restaurants and shops we were able to walk to everything we needed even though there were tons of restaurants we dined at the hotel because of the view of the acropolis food was amazing we would definitely stay here again loved it,1
918,stayed at this hotel with my family booked rooms found human faeces on the bathroom floor in one of the rooms still waiting on gm of hotel to call me back duty manager changed the room which for me should have been automatic and a free dinner which is very ordinary given price i paid for rooms i sure they will reply now did even refund the one room one would assume they would way too late not what you expect for a star hotel considering so many other star hotels do not book here how unhygienic and how badly to handle my complaint human faeces very disgusting i rarely post reviews however always read them i hope this helps others please check out other star hotels in athens i would hate for another family to have their last day on their holiday be spoiled like us,0
919,we stayed at the electra palace in june beautiful property the man at the front desk went out of his way to make our stay the best possible with a double upgrade on our room the rooftop restaurant has a spectacular view of the acropolis however the food was pretty third rate and over priced hence the out of review,1
920,great hotel in plaka district we would have stayed here the whole trip but unfortunately they were booked up so make your reservation early for summer travel we book end of may for july trip and some dates were already full the hotel is clean great location close to shopping and acropolis the staff was very helpful the breakfast was great as was the roof top pool bar and restaurant,1
921,really high quality hotel lovely pool on the roof with the view of the acropolis was worth the price alone also the balcony with the view of the acropolis was definitely worth the situated for the major attractions and really near the tourist area shops and restaurants do hire a car and drive here though the streets are a nightmare we saw many cars damaged on the side of the streets taxis are plentiful and relatively was well worth the cost very extensive range good quality and lovely courtyard to eat in with separate smoking area too dinner was nice for the view but we found the menu bit exotic or foodie for our tastes and not so much greek however if your tastes run that way you might really enjoy the food here alternatively there are some lovely traditional greek restaurants within a few minutes room was quite large relatively for europe with nice decor and a comfortable bed very clean as addition we left a dress and a jacket in the wardrobe and once we contacted them it was shipped back to us as a very reasonable cost so we highly recommend their staff and customer services,1
922,we stayed with our family and they made sure we had rooms next to one another with a shared hallway perfect when traveling with younger children the staff was very friendly and helpful you have to visit the pool area as it gives you an amazing view of the acropolis and you need it to cool down if you are there in the summer months breakfast was a nice spread,1
923,the hotel is in a perfect location for downtown and seeing the city and all it has to offer the staff was friendly and prompt they have to deal with early arrivals and enormous request which they do with all the grace and leave you feeling you to the front office team who really made our day a very special part of our holiday in greece,1
924,location the hotel is located in the city center next to the town of the in front of the hotel is difficult because of the small narrow in was done efficient fast and looking elegant ambiance of hotel and room old presidential suite located near the room had an awful or terrible strong mouldy sewage reason was found in the haman which is a separate room in the comes out of the floor from waste guess that the cleaning lady did know it because on arrival two windows were one of these two rooms a bin box was was not even one free bottle of mineral water in the bathroom has a very small washbasin with very small cupboard or are no towel toilet paper holder was on the balcony there are some sunbeds and a rooftop which can not protect you when it is raining it is more a design element the outside pool which belongs to this room was covered with leaves from matress for my individual taste was too weak soft and amenities are of cheap each room has a small tv with small number of channels is poor and not each channel was working room was not good somebody was cleaning the room next floor or moving suitcases you get disturbed because of the the room is looking old fashionedbut in general of good taste or former time well standard version is for free but working badly organized low quality and low somebody should control you,0
925,our second stay at the elektra palace athens was as good as our staff amazing breakfast in the courtyard is to die for and the rooms beautiful and location of the hotel is a skip and a jump for the shopping mall and everything else you want to do or see,1
926,stayed nights in august the air conditioning is almost non existent when we phonedthe front desk to complain we were told sir it is very hot outside and that is why the air conditioning does not work well the rooms are very small with ugly decor the room was very noisy you can actually hear people in the next room and especially in the hallway on the plus side the shower was good and the staff was nice small rooftop pool with very few travel quite often and stay in upscale properties and this hotel is not worth the high price that they charge do yourself a favour and avoid this hotel,0
927,we had a rough beginning at this hotel due to us arriving late however they more than made up for it by upgrading us to a suite overlooking the hotel is located right next to the plaka in a a great staff at he hotel go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful hotel is in excellent condition has has a fantastic rooftop pool and bar area with outstanding highly recommend this gem in athens,1
928,visited with family for a night trip to athens and the hotel was really good location was brilliant with minute walk to both the main ermou street shopping area and syntagma square min walk to adrianou street and mins to parthenon entrance rooms were spacious and elegant breakfast was great with huge variety definitely get the waffles i would recommend this for a great stay in athens,1
930,this hotel is situated in the heart of athens right next to the acropolis and museum we spent nights there the breakfast was had a surprisingly large selection for one that had no extra charge staff were friendly and the scenery around there was fantastic definitely recommend for a future stay,1
931,we stayed here on the recommendation of a friend and had a fabulous experience the location ca be beaten and the rooms are spacious with a fantastic view of the acropolis the rooftop bar also should not be missed amazing views expertly mixed cocktails and delicious snacks highly recommended we will be back,1
932,the staff at herodion hotel was terrific especially helping out a couple after our wedding hours earlier we had a delicious dinner at the hotel rooftop restaurant saw the sun rise over the acropolis the next morning it was a great start to our only downside was the size of the room and elevator was a bit small it did matter too much since we were in the room very often,1
933,really lovely people at reception which straight away gives you a warm feeling the hotel is quite beautiful with a stone staircase and two upper floors open to the sky one a restaurant and the other a spa and treatment area with a small nicely designed garden the hotel caters for large american tour groups which makes the breakfast buffet a bit difficult to navigate but once you know how to navigate it without bumping into other tables then there is everything you could want to eat the roof restaurant and bar however have a rather pretentious modern variation of authentic greek food and you could do better by eating in nearby makrigianni,1
934,this hotel was a perfect location right next to the acropolis the accommodations were very nice but the absolute best part was having dinner on the roof with the best view of the acropolis and amazing food it was such a nice surprise i would have upgraded to a room with a view had i known i could enjoy that i would highly recommend staying here,1
935,soaking in a jacuzzi with a full view of the acropolis unbeatable blissfully quiet next to the pedestrian alley of the acropolis area no car noise great breakfast with home baked bread and cakes,1
936,when we first visited athens three years ago we relied on a cruise ship company for a hotel recommendation it was a nice place but not within walking distance of anything a rare miss for the cruise ship line on that experience we did our research for this trip and selected the herodion it was perfect within a block of the acropolis museum and the restaurant row near by it was easily within walking of the acropolis hadrian arch the plaka even monastriaki if you push it a little walking the other way there were wonderful shops some featuring art the location us hotel is very clean with a very relaxed feel and a courteous staff to help with everything we relied on them for directions suggestions and just general things the rooms are nicely decorated and well maintained the hotel also features breakfast including european style my wife day can not start without breakfast and coffee she was completely satisfied with the herodian offerings especially the coffee the hotel also has a rooftop bar and restaurant we visited for the view of the acropolis but we did not dine there as we had other plans the restaurant was packed regret i did not take pictures my mental lapse but i know the pictures on the hotel website well depicts the a great place if there is a third athens trip in our future we will stay here,1
937,located near the ancient monuments the outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff constandina made our stay special with her recommendations on how to get around the city with her help we saw more than we would have thought possible,1
938,very nce hotel wit an excellent location you are able to go everywhere in the city center on foot very good view from some rooms and the rooftop to akropolis charming atmosphere nice staff a hotel where you really feel comfortable,1
939,lovely hotel with amazing views of the acropolis from some rooms and especially from the roof garden which all guests can access for a meal or just a drink very close to the acropolis museum which is well worth a visit very friendly staff nice breakfast clean and tidy good air conditioning we stayed twice and were upgraded once to an acropolis view room which was very special,1
940,just loved the position of this hotel so close to the acropolis and museumsthe service was fantastic and the hotel had a great feel about itbreakfast was good but a very small area and got very squeezy the rooftop restaurant and bar looked up to the acropolis which looked great of a night under lights there was also a sundeck and large spa that had great viewswe would hesitate to come back to this hotel,1
941,loved the location quick easy check in and bell service to help with luggage the rooftop restaurant lounge is over the top very special the breakfast is free but not very well staffed or organized they only have one automatic expresso maker for the entire hotel breakfast so coffee is hard to get and refill food variety is good as is quality not crazy about my single room very dark bathroom really small best location in athens so worth the stay would upgrade the room,1
943,this hotel has a great location next door to the acropolis museum and a short walk from the entrance to the was small but that is like other european hotels great which is not always found in some rooftop restaurant with the best view of the acropolis and the parthenon and the nighttime view of the new acropolis museum is fantastic great food at good prices and the staff was perfect we ate there three times,1
944,we came to athens for a long weekend and chose this hotel for main reasons its central location and its views of the acropolis we were not disappointed by either the hotel is next door to the acropolis museum on the edge of the plaka district and has a metro stop minutes away every member of staff we encountered during our stay were friendly and helpful and the rooms were very nice the air conditioning worked perfectly which is not always the case when you stay in hotels and is very important in athens were it is still very warm even during the evening and said we chose this hotel for two reasons which brings me to the star of the herodion the roof top bar a lovely relaxing bar with attentive bar staff and a stunning view of the acropolis beautifully illuminated at night,1
945,the hotel is lovely and our room comfortable the food was very good also the view from the roof terrace where we had our dinner were great we only stayed overnight on our way to one of the islands but it the second time we have visited the hotel would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to family and friends,1
946,this hotel is in the perfect location to acropolis plaka and are very small however clean and comfortable the only reason giving it instead if is the size of the bathrooms they are tiny be careful not to bump into the door handles which are sticking out very odd days and enjoyed every minute of it,1
947,even though the room was really small it was so conveniently situated that it compensated for the shortcoming there was not enough room to open the luggage so there was a lot of logistics to get clothes ready for next helped a lot that the stop for the bus route was just a block from the hotel we had a pass then it was really easy to go to all tourist spots the staff was really nice and very accommodating we arrived at and they let us do an early instead of making us wait till the afternoon the rooftop restaurant is awesome make dinner reservations for a sunset dinner it is so worth it in this trip we stayed in hotels in greece and the herodion was the only one that had good ac we totally recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heart beat,1
948,herodion is in a great location right below the acropolis the acropolis museum and the plaka it has a great view of the acropolis from some of the hotel rooms as well as the restaurant they have a great breakfast buffet that included in the hotel price but what made it great is the cleanliness and the great staff they really make you feel welcome we stayed here multiple times between july and august and definitely will return in the future,1
949,restaurant roof garden on the hotel rooftop wonderful view of the parthenon but i came alone for my trip and i feel like nobody care about you when you are alone while eating hostess came to talk to everybody except with me and my plate was barely prepared when the others were just looking perfect see picture booked in this hotel because it just in front of the acropolis just minutes to walk perfect rooms are good and kind staff so the hotel part is very positive,1
951,great location and easy to walk to most tourist locations and restaurant on roof and breakfast room on ground downside which was minor was no ironing facilities in room,1
952,we arrived after sailing the greek island for a week excellent location for the acropolis museum shopping and the old town all are convenient walking first to note was the hotel was tastefully decorated and the staff went out of their way for us i have back issues and tried touring the acropolis the next day in quite a bit of pain mark at the hotel desk found a cane for me to use and was very helpful in suggestions on where to visit and did a double ck on the taxi we were to have on departure to the airport the lower bar was perfect quiet getaway after a hot day of sightseeing for a drink and or read quietly with a nice view of a garden area in the back the rooms were spotless very important to a retired flight attendant loved the deep tub our beds were turned down at night and we were nicely surprised they brought up extra luggage racks for our oversized luggage i read on a review that someone did like the dark hallways in some of the better hotels they use that as a signal to keep the noise down for people that may be resting very effective the biltmore uses that technique for the staff the rooftop restaurant was atmospheric and lovely the food delicious my husband at times can be hard to please since he travels for his job but he was a happy man with every single meal you,1
953,arrived late in the evening at this hotel and the staff could not have been more helpful to a couple of wary travellers room was amazing with a view of the acropolis and the location is within walking distance from all to see and do around plaka we headed off to the islands and the team were more than happy to store luggage for us for a week,1
954,our family of stayed in four rooms for a couple days before a sailing trip through the greek islands the hotel is ideally located with breath taking views of the acropolis and an easy stroll to old town i have been there before on business but had to return with my family because dinner on their roof with the views of the acropolis ca be overstated their food and their greek salad were among the best we experienced during our days in greece the staff is unusually attentive as an example my youngest son arrived separately from the airport as he entered the hotel one of the staff casually asked how much he paid for his taxi the staff member said he was overcharged and ran out to the driver and made the driver refund my son the overage where else have you ever heard of a hotel staff being so proactive there are lots of other examples of how helpful the staff was as well i would stay there again without question or hesitation,1
955,nice rooms good service nice breakfast thoroughly enjoyed the with a view on the acropolis no need to go to the hotel restaurant there are many delicious places within a radius,1
956,i booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews we wanted a hotel close to the acropolis restaurants and the plaka area the herodion is in the perfect location within walking distance of all the areas we wanted we were traveling with our and year old children and requested rooms close to them and we were put in adjoining rooms which was perfect when we arrived at about am after flying all night they were able to get us into our rooms even though we were hours away from time very appreciated as we needed to freshen up the bathrooms are very nice for european standards with a combo plenty of hot water and they even had wash clothes which most european hotels do not the beds are comfy and the free breakfast buffet was delicious and offered plenty of variety the housekeeping staff is awesome i highly recommend,1
957,very convenient and clean with great location rooms are nice but small upper floors are very noisy since the rooftop point a bar opened if they turned the volume down a bit problem would be solved food in atrium greek bistro and elsewhere in hotel is excellent,1
958,avoid the breakfast box much too simple and plain not worth the money and spend a little extra to get an acropolis view room they small but well appointed and the view up the hill is lovely in the morning my boyfriend and i stayed in a twin room with a view and it was great for our needs it was soundproofed which was sooo nice we slept deeply and did hear any other guests the whole time taking in the view with a cocktail on the rooftop at the end of the day was service and friendly reception all over a great experience,1
959,the hotel is placed at the new acropolis museum under the acropolis itseslf there is really nice view from the top the hotel where a restaurant as well as the section with two jaccuzi are placed so the position is the right one if you want to see the historical centre of athens it is around minutes from the airport by the taxi the buses stop from the hotel and it is the best way how to see all the main see the positives supperb nice nice personalsecond the neutrals the room was not very spacy our room was with the balcony over the street oposit the acropolis it was quite noisy when we opened the door but after closing them it damped it well i can not sey the walls were thin but we could hear voices from the other we slept good but the weather was actually a bit rainy and there was no need to run the which was not the kind of central had not negative experience in this will recommend the hotel to my friends for sure,1
961,fiance and i stayed here for two weeks in february lovely hotel staff was very professional and helpful great housekeeping staff breakfast is included and was the best way to start our mornings close to everything would stay there again,1
962,great service close to everything lovely rooms beautiful views we spent two nights before our tour then after our tour after all the dodgy hotels on our tour a night here with views of the acropolis from our room was just what we needed,1
963,booked a museum package acropolis view room on the floor not just a great view of the parthenon from the window but waking up at night you see the parthenon from your bed just down the block from the acropolis museum great creative cocktails in the rooftop bar and you can get excellent small plates in the bar from the adjoining restaurant good varied breakfast in the mornings on the ground floor,1
964,very good location for the visits to old athens and the plaka very friendly and helpfull personal the breakfast is very nice the restaurant on the top offers good food and you have a nice view on the acropolis it a pity there is no pool,1
965,this small hotel is very close to the acropolis museum and the acropolis itself it a short walk to the metro we had a great room on the floor with a large balcony the beds are comfortable the bathrooms a good size and the maid service a great restaurant on the roof with spectacular views of the acropolis be sure to make a reservation because it usually very busy the breakfast buffet is good,1
966,great location around the corner from acropolis acropolis metro and plaka area everything was on the doorstep tour buses souvenir shops museum cafes bars and tons of restaurants to choose from service was excellent staff friendly and helpful fabulous rooftop bar and restaurant with view of parthenon spa and open air jacuzzis on great for chilling after a long hot day sight seeing rooms were air conditioned clean and functional with coffee facilities and a safe breakfast was a self service buffet with a generous selection to choose from and staff happy to accommodate any additional needs there was also a lovely bar and lounge area with atrium on ground floor but we did use it as we went to the roof top bar instead as the evenings were so lovely would recommend,1
967,the hotel is beautiful clean and in an excellent location the rooms were comfortable and a great place to stay after a long international flight the rooftop restaurant and view of the acropolis were fantastic as well,1
968,we recently stayed at the athens gate for nights and were very pleased with this hotel it was clean welcoming and the staff at the front desk very pleasant the views you get are spectacular the included breakfast offered each more was fantastic and never mind the incredible view of the acropolis on top of it i would definitely book her again returning to athens crystal jamie looney,1
970,comfortable room with comfy bed and helpful and friendly staff all spoke english with views to die for of the acropolis on one side and the temple of zeus on the other side while enjoying your breakfast in the rooftop restaurant,1
971,rooms are great but the airconditioning never worked properly the restaurant views are superb and the reception staff were exceptional and extremely helpful we had dinner one night the food was not great but the fried feta starter was superb,1
972,people may choose the athen gate hotel because of the wonderful views but the location and the service is why i would choose to stay again the view from our room and from the roof top restaurant where you eat your complimentary breakfast is stunning you can view the acropolis from one side and the temple of zeus from the opposite side we walked to several of our tours and every evening for dinner because the hotel was centrally located if we needed to go to piraeus port the hotel staff secured a taxi for us every staff member we had contact with was courteous professional and helpful,1
973,we spent nights here and were sad to leave the staff at reception gave us a very warm welcome on arrival which we appreciated when we got to the room we loved it but found it warm combination of a brutal heat wave and being off when the room is occupied when we left for dinner a little while later we mentioned it to the staff since we knew it would cool down while we were gone and they went ahead and cooled it so that it felt pretty good by the time we got back we slept great on the beds there enjoyed sampling all the delicious breakfast items while looking out at the parthenon and got addicted to nightcaps at the rooftap bar with that glorious view you can walk to everything from the athens gate plaka minutes syntagma sq minutes acropolis museum min so the location is perfect and we not forget the kind staff who went the extra mile not only by packing us a breakfast for our early morning flight but also mailing to us in the us an item we accidentally left behind an wonderful stay,1
974,very close and handy to main ancient sites with friendly and helpful staff great view of acropolis from floor window good breakfast traffic busy outside front of hotel but not a sound from our room facing the other way,1
975,we have stayed at athens gate several times and always love it the rooms are comfortable and clean with great bedding the best pillows and their customer service is top notch on this past trip we have several stays as we popped in and out of athens while traveling around greece for each stay they had our room keys ready for us on arrival even though they did know exactly when we arrive and warmly welcomed us back they great at helping with transport arrangements too the breakfast can not be beat and it offered in a dining room with a spectacular view of the acropolis right next to plaka and short walk to acropolis so it is a great location for everyone you want to do in athens the only downsides are tiny elevators and limited air conditioning in the central hotel areas though every other small hotel we stayed at were the same also you do get some street noise in the rooms that face the main road but those are minor problems and are countered by an overall excellent experience,1
976,the hotel is centrally located a short walk from plaka monasteraki the national gardens etc right between the acropolis and the temple of zeus because these huge monuments are located on either side of the hotel many rooms have fabulous views so does the rooftop restaurant and bar where the complimentary breakfast buffet is served the greek yogurt and fruit was excellent the staff is also very helpful and courteous and rooms are the only downside to this hotel would be the size of the rooms which are quite small my husband and i each had a large checked bag and backpack and in a standard room there was no way to even set both of our bags down without having to jump over luggage to get to one side of the bed after our first night we moved to a superior room and it was larger but still small given that athens is a major metropolis and the location and quality of the hotel i do think the room size is a major problem but just be aware overall a very nice stay and we would return,1
977,this hotel was nice the location was excellent just a short walk to the acropolis zeus temple the museums and plaka the view from the rooftop was amazing breakfast was included and the sister hotel was a short walk away which we appreciated because it allowed us to use the pool there the staff was great and very helpful the wifi needs improvement as does the air conditioning we had to call down to ask for the staff to help us with that several times overall i recommend this hotel if you have large luggage you be entertained by the size of the elevator lol,1
978,need a beautiful drink and some lunch or a snack with the acropolis within touching distance the athens gate is the place great drinks delicious food great staff and beautiful bathrooms a must for a well earned tourist break,1
979,location the view on the acropolis the view on the ancient ruins the staff is very nice and welcoming breakfast is nice the decoration of the rooms is nice rooms are small for the price even though the equipment is nice i think it a bit overpriced compared to the price in the surroundings nice hotel well located but a bit pricey for the room size,1
980,this hotel was wonderful it was very clean with modern amenities and a friendly staff it was reasonably priced and exceeded our expectations the location was central to all of the must see attractions of athens i would definitely stay here again,1
981,athens gate hotel was perfect for our trip to athens it was in the heart of all the action steps from the plaka acient ruins and cool places to explore i would highly recommend for the newcomer to athens it is a bit pricey but you ca beat the location and friendly it,1
982,nice hotel in the heart of the city minutes walk from the acropolis museum and the old part of the city nice clean room polite people nice breakfast with amazing views of the acropolis and great coffee,1
984,at the athens gate hotel from the moment you enter the building you are greeted and helped right away staff is extremely nice there is wifi within the building and can be sketchy at times but if you in the lobby it works perfectly fine the lobby is pretty huge as there are multiple sofas also has a tv fireplace computers a bar which is a very comfortable setting free breakfast in the morning there is no pool in this specific hotel however they do have a sister hotel nearby about minutes away walking and you will have access to that pool the views are second to none as you can see the temple of zeus across the street and the acropolis from the top floor amazing hotel,1
985,if you only have one day in athens stay here can walk to everything the rooftop is great for evening drinks and breakfast i would recommend the were out of of fish entrees and the food was mediocre it is clean quiet and the best location,1
986,we stay for nights it is within walking distance to the acropolis and all attractions we arrived and the attendant parked our car for us you really do not want to be driving in athens park and walk the view was great as was the room we had breakfast which was included on the roof terrace the wifi did not work that great but we found this through greece i would defiantly stay there again,1
987,fabulus rooftop terrace go at night to see acroplos in lights location is great blocks from acropolis metro staff quite rooms are anything spectacular although many have small terraces,1
988,this hotel is a gem in the vibrant touristy area of plaka you really ca beat the value here nice amenities walking distance to everything and incredible views of the parthenon and temple of zeus the breakfast is abundant and delicious i especially loved the dolmas well done athens gate,1
989,this is a beautiful hotel within view of the acropolis it has a roof garden restaurant with magnificent views of the parthenon i would have given it five stars except that its two tiny elevators are not quite sufficient to get guests up to the floor roof deck for breakfast while getting other guests and their luggage out for and the stairs mostly lack hand rails,1
990,the hotel is very conveniently located near athens gate and walkable distance from acropolis the famous plaka district is also at walking distance from the hotel all the archeological sites are in close i found the hotel a bit expensive for stay and nothing exceptional but i must say that they have a breakfast box service for people with early morning flight which you dont find in many hotels,1
991,the view is to die for not to mention the food we spent a lazy afternoon relishing greek cuisine and sipping wine here the weather changed from hot to cold to wet to hot and cols again all within minutes worth a halt,1
992,we stayed for a week in a floor superior room overlooking the temple of zeus the room was modern clean and spacious with a mini bar fridge and balcony the ensuite had a walk in shower with complimentary toiletries and slippers it was very hot while we were in athens so we were very grateful for the air conditioning the bed was comfortable but the road outside was very busy with the main noise from horns and motorbikes it did occasionally affect our sleep but in my opinion was worth it for the hotel is in an excellent central location within easy walking distance of all the main rooftop has excellent views of the acropolis on the restaurant side and the temple of zeus on the bar side breakfast was a wide choice of hot and cold buffet food which was delicious on the last evening we had dinner in the restaurant with an excellent view of the sun setting over the acropolis the course meal was of a much higher quality than anywhere else we ate in athens and was delicious all the staff from the bar restaurant front desk maids and doorman were without exception friendly polite efficient and helpful thank you for making our stay so our final morning we had an early start and were able to arrange a breakfast bag to take to the airport with us,1
993,the location is perfect and within walking distance to the most important sights breakfast was wonderful at the rooftop restaurant with great views of the acropolis and surrounding areas staff was very polite would definitely recommend this hotel to others,1
994,our fifth year this year this place is completely reliable the staff are ongoing and there year after year therefore the service is excellent focussed and attentive the rooms are clean and have amazing views of the temple of zeus every year we come we feel at home safe comfortable and with the best view of the acropolis and breakfast meals this is what i call excellent value for money nothing to fault just praise,1
995,rooms are clean and simple with hardwood floors the location is perfect for walking around athens and seeing the sites the free breakfast on the rooftop can not be beat we stayed before and after our cruise and stayed in two different rooms the first nights we stayed overlooking the temple of zeus floor the view was great however there is a lot of traffic noise all day and night it was fun to watch the crazy motorcycles from the balcony after our cruise we had a no view room out our window was a deserted office building wrapped in large black tarps this room was definitely not as welcoming with the black tarps right outside the window the cost of the hotel seems high based on the rooms and amenities however the room was very clean the staff was nice doormen were always helpful breakfast was fresh and delicious internet was available but very slow and difficult to load any pages,1
996,we stayed here for three days and were very happy with it the staff was awesome the hotel was clean and the food was great what more could you ask for we were central to everything we actually walked to the acropolis in just minutes the thing that really impressed me was the staff they went out of their way to help with anything and everything you needed we had to leave really early in the morning before breakfast was served so they made us a breakfast to take with us without us asking for it very nice touch that the way they were the whole stay there,1
997,my year old son and i stayed there last week and really enjoyed it the location is walking distance to almost everything you would want to see and do close by there are great restaurants and shopping there staff where very helpfully especially and doorman named john from montreal the rooftop restaurant had very good food and amazing views it is not inexpensive but great dollar value,1
999,this hotel was in a perfect location everything was within walking distance we were able to walk and see beautiful sites as well as spend a day at the acropolis great restaurants were nearby at sunset the hotel has a great rooftop view there is a restaurant that looked good but we had other plans the service was great and they even packed up a great bagged breakfast for us to take the morning we headed to the airport great hotel and excellent service,1
1000,perfect hotel to stay at if you want to have easy access to all the historical sites clean rooms good view from the roof terrace buffet breakfast included ask for high floor as it quieter the higher you go staff very friendly helpful great restaurants bars around the corner in the plaka area very reasonably priced hotel restaurant expensive and not much of an atmosphere when we visited athens a great city to visit would love to go back,1
1001,nice hotel had all the amenities close walking distance to all the tourist sites many restaurants and cafes close by nice rooftop restaurant good variety of choicesfor breakfast dinner is also nice at the recommend this hotel for those planning a trip to athens,1
1002,this really is the gate to athens fabulous service rooms are great and clean fab food the views of the acropolis and temple of zeus are not imaginable until you are there close to all the things you want to see and right near the plaka the old shopping district,1
1004,this hotel has a great view of the acropolis with a five star restaurant the rooms were quaint and very modern the beds were very soft and the bathrooms were roomy the athens attractions are in walking distance if you are coming to athens this hotel is an amazing choice,1
1005,this is a quality clean hotel and staff is efficient friendly and professional the breakfast was fantastic what a great view of athens the elevator requires your room key to activate makes you feel completely will always stay here when we are in athens,1
1006,for years i have stayed at the grand bretagne but now i am wondering why as rich in history as the grand bretagne is the hilton is just a much more comfortable place to stay from the clean modern guest rooms to the wonderful breakfast buffet to the rooftop with unparalleled sunset views it is hard to fault this hotel my only complaint comes with the pool which was absolutely packed we could not find a chair for ages but once we had a chair it was a lovely place to hang out will definitely go back,1
1007,we have stayed here a number of times over the years and it is always a clean well maintained hotel the outdoor pool area is one of a kind in the middle of athens very comfortable clean and friendly,1
1008,we come to greece times per year and always stay here before heading to some islands the staff is great and the rooms are very clean the beds are amazing with nice pillows the galaxy bar is a must for drinks and dinner,1
1009,i have expectations as a diamond hilton member but this hotel exceeded even those let start with check in i was recognized as a diamond member and they insisted on an upgrade unlike the waldorf in rome that would rather charge euros for a martini the room with a view was awesome and i recommend it to everyone it was a surprise that was unexpected the best part however was the best executive lounge ever most hiltons have eli i aged this perk but this hilton upped the ante happy hour between to gives you not just extensive snacks but beer and wine and hard alcohol in a town that expects euros for breakfast this is an oasis in the crowd keep this up hilton you have reinvigorated my reason to be a hilton member,1
1010,this hilton is a perfect hotel on a perfect location great place for leisure and for conferences great service nice lounge and fantastic breakfast buffet close to kolonaki shopping and business area walking distance great restaurants in the area,1
1011,the athens hilton is a quality hotel close to all the athens sites within walking distance and the use of the metro great service and quality accommodation the executive lounge is a great place to unwind after a trip to the acropolis or the museum happy hour is fabulous from until dinner time on the rooftop at the galaxy restaurant with a view of the acropolis,1
1012,this hotel is in a great location with views over athens we stayed on the executive floor which in hindsight was a bad idea the room was next to the lounge and it was very noisy all day long i guess people ca keep away from free cookies room was very comfortable nice balcony check out was tedious tip to hotel at around noon it probably a good idea to have more than one person working at reception it took mins to check out,1
1013,the hotel can be reached easily by bus transportation from the airport you can save here for bus versus taxi that could cost approximately the outdoor pool is a must during summer period the hotel is about minutes walking distance to the acropolis area the complementary internet connection is ok,1
1014,this is our second year staying at the hilton as platinum member of another hotel chain we chose to come back to the hilton the staff is excellent and attentive room has a stunning view and pool is awesome i would highly recommend the hilton athens,1
1015,do be fooled by the aging exterior the rooms are very modern with high quality finishes several offering magnificent views of the acropolis pluses include amazing pool phenomenal rooftop bar setting and first class spa despite the amazing setting however service at the rooftop bar is nearly abysmal and a negative incentive to go up there overall the service was very good it a good mile plus walk to plaka so plan accordingly especially in the hot months i would be happy to stay here again,1
1016,outstanding property the pool rooftop bar and rooftop restaurant are a must the hilton athens is among the best properties in the hilton network and the beautidul views of the akropolis certainly make it a must,1
1017,hotel is well situated very clean staff is very friendly and helpful the view is amazing pool was very well kept water could be a little warmer staff at the pool could be a little faster i would recommend this hotel to everyone looking forward to returning,1
1018,a wonderful hotel in athens would recommend going to the galaxy bar as well as walking to the plaka at night stunning rooms and the service was consistently great throughout our stay would stay again in the future,1
1019,i had dinner at byzantino restaurant could not finish my meal after taking small bites i was feeling tired from jetlag i requested to have it in a to go box from my waiter he said that i could not take my leftovers to my hotel room he said he can have it delivered to my room but in a plate how am i suppose to place inside my small refrigerator to keep chilled very disappointed i just wasted my money i never heard such insane reasoning from a major hotel chain such as hilton that i have ever talked to the manager on duty mod before posting he was not helpful he left before we came to a reasonable resolution to my embarrassed to be a hilton honors gold restaurant supervisor approached me and offered to adjust off the main course from my bill that the simple resolution i was looking he did exactly what the mod should have offered to me before walking away the mod failed to make this hotel guest happy by mishandling this situation,0
1020,we loved the chance to go to a chain hotel after weeks in botiques this is a fun touchstone to have a concierge floor a happening pool and a really amazing in door pool with an above average health club you are not far from the national museum and can see the acropolis from the hotel,1
1021,superbly located in central athens near to the main conference center and tourist sites it is well meintained and its pool area is well designed generous and well managed the conference center was also excellent one of the restaurants in the hotel was closed a sign to us that the hotel is waiting for better economic times to fully blossom again,1
1022,wien you book a hilton you know you are going to a top hotel this one has a fantastic pool a great gym and spa very much appreciated the welcome drink at the roof bar with a fantastic view great breakfast buffet and friendly employees who could ask for anything more,1
1023,beautiful room great view particularly from the rooftop bar the only downside was the check in this was a mess all good otherwise several good restaurants within an easy minute walk room service and hotel food can be outlandishly expensive,1
1024,excellent price for an excellent locationenjoy the galaxy bar with a nice view of the acropolis pool and hymn quite nice as well and nice to enjoy after a hot and long visiting daywe reserved the olive suite which is quite nice for a is nice and some nice restaurant options close to the hotel,1
1025,we stayed one night before we traveled on to mykonos the hotel is very busy and mostly a business crowd the rooms are spacious and comfortable the hotel location is convenient staff were friendly and helpful breakfast was good with lots of variety,1
1026,hilton athens is really the best hotel in town and also has the best rooftopbar as well the hotel itself is really big and so you have a wide range of possibilities to pamper yourself and outdoorpool fitnessroom unfortunately just one bicycle that should be fixable executive lounge with a amazing view and as well an amazing service and hospitality i had the king olive suite and have not regretted it at all the whole suite has a really good atmosphere a private i would say hilton budapest could learn right here how to arrange a suite you feel perfectly welcome also my question after one more lamp was fulfilled within one hour without any problem the guide who was recommended from the executive lounge guest service was euro a hour and it fitted perfect for three hours for the akropolis and the museum i would recommend to not meet in the hotel you should meet with the guide at the container where the group and guide tickets are sold so you will have more time with the guide also the breakfast is really hilton like there is everything you are expecting the whole crew is friendly and is very helpful the only disappointing thing was with the outdoorpool as you only get one big towel which you lay on the sunbed asking for one mor even a smaller one which is handed out for fitness was denied which is not star hotel class at all but i strongly recommend,1
1027,i have stayed at this hilton for years its modern renovations and exceptional guest rooms with phenomenal views made it a treat to return the huge pool and diverse amenities are made possible since it is little out of downtown but how welcome to have a pool to relax at and cool off taxi are incredibly cheap in athens so this is perfect,1
1028,this hotel is located close to the acropolis and other local museums and park it has excellent facilities and very helpful staff the rooms are beautifully appointed and some have great views of the city,1
1029,we stayed two nights at the end of our vacation through italy and greece it was great to know that we had comfortable and safe accommodations lined up for the end of our trip and the hilton and it staff did an excellent job the rooms were clean quiet and comfortable the breakfast was extensive and fresh and the indoor pool has some fantastic features to help relax we highly recommend this hotel if you are in the athens area,1
1030,hilton gold member hotel was very helpful prior to arrival i was upgraded nice room great tub which we all took turns enjoying after a long trip if any complaint i think the exec lounge could have a nicer range of food and drink more to choose given the amount of people using facility very nice hotel highly recommend given points and price skybar fabulous view but a bit pricey i would recommend nice hotel great service,1
1031,we chose this hotel for the pool so our yr old can have some fun it made a difference as we could do the touristy things and then enjoy playing with her in the pool getting into town was quite easy depending on the weather we walked or caught a train the airport bus was right outside the hotel extremely friendly staff fantastic,1
1032,we enjoyed our stay at this property excellent service great location comfortable rooms and great views the executive lounge had great options with friendly and helpful staff all staff spoke english and made sure they offered their help,1
1033,had a great time and the room was amazing beautiful hotel and beautiful city service was very good as we got all our questions answered and we had loads as it was our first visit would recommend to anyone visiting this amazing city,1
1034,this is a perfect business oriented hotel in the heart of athens service is always good and friendly i particularly liked the prepared envelope in front of my door at very good idea breakfast is phantastic and the location ideal thus strong recommendation,1
1035,i would like to complain about the terrible experience i experienced during my vacation at the athens i got to the hotel i went down to the swimming pool of the hotel the service was shocking and no waiter came to me and took me half an hour until i arrived for a drink and glasses of water outside the temperaturethe outside temperature was degreesthe drinking glasses that came after minutes from the time i ordered were hot and the waitress did not bring the water and said she was coming back to get it just gone and did not come back i felt i was going to faint and that did not come water i went up to the room with a strong headache and it ruined my night and night i had to take pills all to the hotel but no one did with you nothing just the next day i spoke with the manager did a favor thatin addition we did not clean the room for two days the room was filthy we stayed in the shower without towels and leftover food from the night before we had to get out of the shower and call the receptionist to bring us towelsthis is something that certainly can not be for a star hotel and at the hilton chain i am a member of the club at the highest level i have never had such a service such a terrible experience of cleanliness and carelei will never go,0
1036,classy full service hotel in athens greece clean rooms excellent service workout room spa rooftop bar and pool rooms are solid with comfy beds and nice and well functioning bathroom and appliances it appears all rooms have hardwoods or faux hardwood floors and no carpet to hid the nasties also all rooms appeared to me have a balcony and can support fresh air it reminded me of the classic and the which are among the two finest hotels i ever stayed,1
1037,roof top bar is a must fantastic breakfast and rooms are stunning views are best in athens i would think location is pretty central and staff and very helpful additional drinks and food are expensive,1
1038,take the time to go to dinner at the hilton in athens the best view of the acropolis and city at night the food and service were just as amazing as the view whether you staying nearby or a metro ride away it worth the trip,1
1039,we were very pleased with this hotel despite the large size and location my family and i are hilton diamond members and enjoyed the executive lounge for the breakfast and the evening reception rooms are standard in size but have great showers and balconies we had an amazing view and enjoyed a glass or two of wine every evening while watching the sun set over the must mention that my teenagers loved both the indoor and outdoor pool this really is an oasis in the middle of a our travels ever take us back to athens we will gladly stay at the hilton again,1
1040,this hotel is in a perfect location of athens the hotel is superb the rooms are large and well appointed with every room having a balcony the pool and spa area offer great treatments the pool is quite large and offers drinks and snacks roof top bar has the most amazing view overlooks the acropolis breakfast in the morning was especially good staff is attentive and gracious can not go wrong with this hotel,1
1041,hilton staff and facilities were perfect they arranged shuttles to the airport and piraeus port which were reasonably priced and arranged at a moment notice the bar has a view that second to non of the acropolis the hotel proximity to museums embassies and parks makes it a great location,1
1043,top bar was the oasis pool bar at the hilton superb amenities relaxing atmosphere and the most charming hostess with the mostest all the guests during my visit in june found this bar and mary in particular well worth the visit again and hotel maintains the highest standards i hope to return soon,1
1044,visited athens for a family holiday abd athens hilton was the best choice we made it is by far he best hotel and service anyone can find in athens great location great food great service the rooms are minimal but functional the pool area was fantastic and their spa was an amazing experience,1
1045,the location of this hotel is excellent within walking distance to shopping about min breakfast excellent galaxy bar restaurant floor really friendly professional outdoor swimming pool pool bar staff was a bit unfriendly busy hotellin sijainti on loistava galaxy bar kerros huippu näköalat akropolikselle palvelu illallinen oli loistava,1
1046,for business or leisure our room had a view of the acropolis nice the hotel has several bars and restaurants we loved the galaxy restaurant at the penthouse what made it special for us was not only the excellent quality of the two dinners had there but the waitstaff especially grigoris the consummate professional with a great sense of humor stood out in the lobby level dimitri aka tall guy was outstanding with his professionalism and helpful and pleasant we ever go back to athens this would be our hotel of get to the hotel here from the airport it is fixed fare of euros each way the express bus costs euros for seniors so does the metro best to avoid of pickpockets,1
1047,my wife and i were here between day tours in mid june we found the hotel to be very clean and well appointed great views a quick cab to old town for eating and shopping and an easy walk to good moderately priced local restaurants we found the hotel employees to polite and helpful will stay here again,1
1048,we stayed at hilton for our honeymoon the stay was memorable the hotel is centrally located it is nearby to acropolis and other tourist spots service was professional i would recommend the hotel for stay,1
1049,as americans who had never been to greece we booked the hilton very efficient staff at the front desk beautiful spacious rooms including marble bathrooms we got an acropolis view and it was well worth the extra money the breakfast buffet is delicious with so many choices book it as part of your package the pool and pool bar were nice drinks at the rooftop galaxy bar were memorable and a great place to view the parthenon during the golden hour at sunset,1
1050,the location is perfect the room are clean and very well organized the swimming pool is amazing and it stay open till late night and the galaxy bar and restaurant are one of the best in the world not only breakfast is full of variety so every one can enjoy and the servies you get in all the hotel amenities is just flawless,1
1051,this modern hotel has always been great pay extra for acropolis view its worth it spacious rooms but the kicker is the amazing rooftop bar much more refreshing than the great britannia pool great huge and clean with all day sun with plenty of loungers a short walk to parliament square and to some nice bars and restaurants the breakfast is amazing,1
1052,this hilton was extremely clean comfortable and the rooms were beautifully appointed with very nice amenities gorgeous views of athens from all angles of the hotel if you are a hilton gold member you have use of the executive lounge for complimentary happy hour and continental breakfast courteous and helpful front desk staff gave great info regarding transportation local sites nearby restaurants and other helpful athens information all employees with whom we interacted spoke excellent english it is located close to the subway the original stadium of the new olympic games the foreign embassies the botanic gardens and the tomb of the unknown soldier convenient to many popular tourist sites i would absolutely stay at this hilton again,1
1053,was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a larger room for ourv night stay really appreciated it the hotel is about a walk to old town very pleasant walk in summer the breakfast and lunch was great with the chef taking extra care with our dietary requirements i used the gym which was well equipped with a fantastic indoor pool overall a great base for a stay in athens,1
1054,the quality and service at the hotel in no way complies with the requested sum of money there is chaos and incompetence in the organization of services we arrived at the hotel before and asked at the reception whether we could be accommodated earlier although we knew that the at this hotel unlike most of the other ones is at sic which considering the demanded higher price for accommodation we find totally inappropriate the receptionists promised us access to our room hour after hour thanks to which we spent almost hours waiting for the olive suite which we had several months ahead first we were sent to the swimming pool bar where we spent hours hearing repeated promises of access to our room after our third inquiry whether the room was free as an answer we were given a card to the lounge and were told that the formalities would be settled there the previous guest had left the room later and therefore the room could not yet be prepared we waited another hours during which we were offered the possibility of paying an extra eur for a suite supposedly the only one ready which we refused our room wasn t even ready at but as late as of a possible tour of the town or a business meeting we pointlessly wasted hours a businessman and owner of a firm i can not comprehend how a hotel of this category which days before our arrival had takings of roughly million,0
1055,when in athens on business i have resorted to staying at the hilton hotel based on previous amazing to the hilton normally stay at the king george or grande bretagnia being a five star hotel one expects excellent service and good value arrival we where greeted outside by the car concierge well received and a polite really nice guy apologize for not having asked his name a queue on check in however i was promptly checked in my first complaint here is that a hotel of this class should have a dedicated concierge as is the case of other establishments on this level and not have to rely on on checking in staff to do room allocated was away from lifts which was great however it looked tired and slightly worn only one tiny shampoo and conditioner no tooth paste or blade looking in the cupboard no dressing robes this was all disappointing i had to phone twice to house keeping to bring them along with toiletries when i received them thanked the staff with a smile how ever they were sullen and i got the impression they were doing me a favor i had a cup of tea and asked house keeping to replace it with a fresh cup and as i went shopping that day asked if they would remove all the empty boxes and packaging alasnone of the above was done and i just left a positive note got an invitation for a welcome cocktail thank you,1
1056,the staff on the executive floor are friendly professional and can handle any request with positive results they took care of us from start to finish the breakfast was awesome too we look forward to returning soon,1
1057,great hotel in athens very nice amenities that include several restaurants some small shops pool highly recommend a drink at the galaxy bar on the roof excellent views rooms are clean and modern if your a hilton honors member there is an executive lounge on the offering light breakfast in the morning along with light snacks in the evening,1
1058,stayed one night before heading out to the coast with family very comfortable summer stay and the large pool is very much appreciated for warm athens days in july great view overlooking acropolis decent complimentary breakfast in the executive floor all in all a comfortable stay,1
1059,we came on thursday for the very well advertized pool event in the evening the pool was dirty there were no sunbeds the service said very rudly to us to wait and that they can serve us but the worse thing was the lifeguard he was extremely rude saying to us that we can not take our cocktails near the pool we understood that and then he grabed our drinks and took them to a table of other guests unacceptable,0
1060,we had short visit to athens before returning to the states the athens hilton exceeded our expectations in service and amenities we especially enjoyed the indoor pool hot tub and fitness center dining at the galaxy resturant with it amazing view of the acropolis was the perfect ending to our day vacation to italy and greece,1
1061,stay in the middle of athens and enjoy resort amenities during summer try to spend a day by the outdoor pool the biggest pool in the city during fall and winter enjoy a day at hiltonia spa and of course do not miss the galaxy bar at the top floor,1
1062,for some days in athens the hilton is a very nice place to be business oriented but with a great sense for a more than relaxing stay in athens this is a perfect area do not miss the view from the it breath taking enjoy your well deserved vacation,1
1063,this is a good hotel in a great location its walking distance to all the major sites in the city and is only a few minutes walk from the acropolis museum there is tea and coffee making facilities and free wifi,1
1064,this was a nice hotel that was walking distance from the acropolis the parthenon the plaka the museum and the train station our room had a balcony and everything we needed there is a restaurant in the hotel that also offers breakfast,1
1065,great location easy walk to all things acropolis and many good restaurants closely the room was a bit small but we were out and about most of the time had which was essential great roof top bar with view of parthenon,1
1066,we stayed at the hera hotel for nights in july and really enjoyed our experience the staff were very friendly and accommodating of our constant requests for ice the breakfast had tremendous selection and the roof top restaurant was very good we booked a room with a view of the acropolis and i highly recommend doing this if you can the location was perfect for access to the main attractions of athens and there are a couple of great coffee spots close to the hotel we very much enjoyed our time here,1
1067,stayed at hera after a long flight from ny great location walking distance to plaka acropolis and museums room was small but very clean and neat we ate in the roof top restaurant the waiter was very attentive and the food was excellent,1
1068,the hotel located in the quiet area very close to the acropolis metro station mins walking to the acropolis entrance and the busy plaka area the receptionists were friendly and efficient when checked in we told them that we needed to depart earlier than their restaurant breakfast opening of am they sent within an hour prepacked breakfast to our room when we returned from mateora we stayed in hera hotel again and enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the restaurant the breakfast had limited choice but still good quality and with plenty of vegetable standard rooms we stayed were well equipped but tight in space two of us slim in size with two pieces of medium size luggage found it uncomfortable to move around the rooms and bathrooms were tidy there were no clothes hooks in the tight bathrooms nowhere we could hanged the wet towel etc bedding was comfortable and towel smelled fresh soft clean the sound insulation with the neighboring room was weak one time we had a noisy neighbor and we could hear her talking whole night long,1
1069,we stayed at the hera twice at the beginning and end of our stay in greece in june initially we were so tired from the long flight it was a wise choice to have allowed an extra day rooms are small but well furnished comfortable clean beds and a nice view on the upper floors facing the street front the breakfast buffet included foods we have at home with local sausages bread and fresh yogurt and staff is friendly and helpful even after we blew a breaker with a power strip plugged into an adapter they also arranged a taxi to the airport both times we had to leave and made sure our second stay was at an upper floor with a balcony street roof garden restaurant was also amazing see the separate review,1
1070,sure it been said before but it bears repeating hera hotel offers comfort friendly staff and attractive rooms but the overwhelming advantage is its location upon leaving the hotel you are within a minute walk to the acropolis museum not to be missed and minutes further to the acropolis itself this means of course that you can be at those attractions at any time of day and avoid crowds should you choose we were at the museum before and had the place virtually to ourselves also the hotel proximity to the plaka area is fortunate there are plenty of interesting shops cafés and restaurants nearby we hail from a big city so we know the value in convenience and ease in a neighborhood for us as residents and for our guests and the hera hotel offers that in spades i would stay there again in a heartbeat,1
1071,as per other reviewers this is a wonderful small hotel with character and charm incredibly close to the acropolis and easy walking distance to many other historic sites given its location it is excellent value for money far better than you get for the same type of location in other european capital cities easy to reach from the directions on the hotel one change at syntagma rooms clean light and a kettle for brits missing their yorkshire tea small fridge efficient aircon nice bathrooms friendly helpful on the terrace is expensive but worth tretaing would stay again without hesitation,1
1072,very beautiful hotel n a great location to all the major sites and metro station rooms were updated staff was very friendly with great restaurant recommendations and breakfast area was beautiful with a great selection including ready to make omelets would definitely recommend,1
1073,excellent location friendly helpful staff clean comfortable rooms and delicious food the rooftop restaurant is fabulous with a really good view of the acropolis and even better at night when the lights are on,1
1074,the hotel is located close to the acropolis and other attractions of ancient and modern greece it is close too to public transport the metro trams and bus to allow for ease of movement around the city the hotel is charming tastefully designed without being the top the rooms are comfortable though slightly small and are cleaned daily our room away from the street was very quiet breakfast was included in our tariff and well worth it with an excellent range of freshly prepared fruits vegetable dishes and local cuisine such as cheese pies the rooftop restaurant and bar though pricey is well worth at least one visit the views of the acropolis are spectacular i save my last comment for the wonderful staff who were extremely helpful and thoughtful with our leaving early on our final day they arranged for a breakfast plate to be brought to our room it is the little extra touches that make this lovely hotel truly special,1
1075,if is what you are doing in athens then this is your place you can walk out and zip to the acropolis and the acropolis museum in about two seconds you are nicely set up to walk almost anywhere in athens our room had a nice view of the acropolis so pretty at night there a cute little restaurant on the top floor where you can grab a drink or have dinner with great views the staff at the front desk is so helpful and can advise you on anything an everything in the city love this place,1
1076,every time my family i visit athens we always make sure we include a mid holiday break at the hilton athens the pool by far is the best in town we luv the rooftop galaxy bar with spectacular views of the acropolis lycabetos hill the breakfast selection is outstanding as well staff were extremely helpful in all areas especially can not fault this hotel a definite must,1
1077,we have just left from a night stay at hera hotel the hotel itself is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location walking distance to everything you would need for a stop over in athens the rooms are of a hotel standard with a delicous buffet breakfast what makes this hotel is the staff the reviews are all true the care and genuine desire the staff have towards making you stay in athens a wonderful experience is commendable thank you hera hotel,1
1078,hotel was situated in a great place near the acropolis the daily breakfast was very good we were able to walk to all major attractions from this location and many restaurants were very close by staff was friendly and rooftop bar was cool,1
1079,fabulous location two blocks from the plaka at the base of the acropolis one block to the museum which you can not miss room was large clean and comfortable the staff was very accommodating the rooftop restaurant was tasty reasonable and the service was fabulous complimentary breakfast was amazing i would highly recommend this hotel to athens visitors,1
1080,the hera hotel is a great little the grand façade is a very cozy hotel with lovely comfortable staff excellent room amenities that many hotels that charge a lot more do not comfortable bed but be aware that a double bed may be just two singles pushed together this is the only criticism i would fast internet a balcony with a table and chairs for gazing over the buildings and the acropolis in the restaurant and rooftop bar very decent breakfast breakfast can be very very boring at greek hotels but the hera does a good job great location meters from the acropolis museum and the underground station dozens of restaurants within a minute walk and the plaka area is minutes lovely people at the front desk organized a car to take us and our big suitcases to the airport euro for this which is a fair a really lovely stay at the hera hotel,1
1081,service and comfort of rooms are impeccable the view from the top floor bar is pretty great and defntly worth a trip eventhough this hotel is a bit pricey it is in a great location in the town centre the food in the hotel is also of a high standard,1
1082,very nice hotel with great service and food centrally located for access to points of interest the have an incredible view from the rooftop bar and restaurant with very personable staff i highly recommend it,1

1084,the hilton athens is a hotel that shines like a diamond the staff are efficient polite willing to help and professional the hotel screams opulence the olympic sized pool is a dream to relax next to the rooms are clean and allow for a relaxing visit rain showers marble everywhere balcony overlooking the acropolis mini fridge huge closets quiet and lovely this hotel makes it their mission to please,1
1085,our stay here was quite memorable the staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had about athens the breakfasts included were amazing and started each day we stayed at the hotel in an amazing fashion the rooms themselves were a little dated however they were very clean and had a great little balcony to watch the sunset if you liked the roof top terrace had stunning views of the parthenon as well as the city centre as a whole all in all we were very happy with our stay at hermes hotel,1
1086,my wife i were travelling around europe on our honeymoon were fortunate enough to stay at this hotel during our night in heard from greek friends that athens can be a bit sketchy to walk around in that you must constantly be on guard but i found the neighbourhood around the hotel to be quite pleasant as there is other tourists locals about full of places to eat a grocery nearby of course still be cautious like in any country yet still enjoy the surrounds as it is brilliantly located within walking distance of stores the acropolis mueseum the read reviews that the service at hermes is excellent that has changed at all courteous very helpful we were even given a small gift of wine local sweets as a gesture from hermes to greet us on our honeymoon this was a wonderful surprise that we room we were given was humbly small yet cosy enough for a couple was modernly decorated we did expect the hotel to look as good as a star when we spotted entered so we were free offerings were water tea coffee available for till at their lounge area beside reception there are seats a selection of reading material in this lounge to compliment a cup of what you fancy also we were encouraged to visit their sister hotel hotel plaka rooftop for a drink a nice view of the parthenon so that was great to in all we had a great time for exactly what,1
1087,our stay here was great the staff were very friendly gave great advice and direction and the breakfast was great with traditional greek foods as well as more general continental breakfast foods we probably missed this on the website but our bed was really two beds pushed together also we did have an issue with the hot water in our room and after a few attempts to fix it had to move to a different room while inconvenient the staff were prompt and helpful in their response we also took advantage of the roof top view from their sister hotel around the corner which had a great view of the acropolis and rooftop bar,1
1088,four of us recently stayed here for two nights in the family interconnecting rooms the whole experience was great the rooms are a decent size and the location is perfect it is in the middle of town but in a quiet enough area that you can not hear breakfast was a good mix of both hot and cold food and we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the cold breakfast is available all the time as we had to leave at to catch a ferry thank you for a lovely experience,1
1089,a small one of a kind boutique hotel whats remarkable about it is the super helpful and friendly staff i have to greatly mention oana tonya and eva they never failed to help answer an of my questions concerning where to go what best is to do where to dine and even where to shop i send my great appreciation for location of the hotel is great walking distance from any place one needs to visit where you can walk to your destination and enjoy experiencing all the greek life tavernas souvenir shops markets and all the hotel is quite clean and tidy it lacks some essentials like cotton buds and the free water bottle but that was last of my worries for it offered what was more important i highly recommend this hotel and i have to mind you that i was a solo traveler,1
1090,stayed in the hermes hotel in the centre of athens handy for acropolis and the popular tourist areas nearby very friendly staff and good rooms with the much needed free internet rooms are fairly small but decent and the beds are extremely comfortable the hotel has a good and deserved reputation from local taxi drivers and again position wise it is ideal the hermes has a sister hotel nearby which has a rooftop bar which has views of the parthenon and guests of the hotel are able to use this if they want a good basic clean and friendly small hotel with very good staff and perfect location,1
1091,great hotel the interconnecting rooms were very user friendly for a family my husband loved the breakfasts too much very handy central location to walk to the sites of athens remember to check the view of the acropolis from the roof top,1
1092,excellent hotel which is very central to all the shops restaurants and transport fairly priced lovely reception staff got upgraded to superior room with balcony and view recommended mcds close by which is great they have a triple cheeseburger omg,1
1093,we felt that the hotel was going to be a good choice as soon as we began talking with oana after orienting us to our room she shared pertinent information about athens each day she asked us how our day was and offered to help in any way we needed my birthday occurred on the first full day of our stay and i was pleasantly surprised to see a small bottle of wine in the room with a note happy birthday barbara when i thanked her she smiled seeming to be pleased that i was pleased eva who greeted us each morning at breakfast was also helpful when asking how we would be spending our day the room although small was sufficient for our needs the breakfast was incredible all the sites that we wanted to see were within walking distance oana told us about the roof top deck located at their sister hotel hotel plaka and suggested we have some wine there the view was breathtaking especially the acropolis at night i would definitely recommend this hotel to travelers to athens and would stay there again if i have the opportunity to visit the city again,1
1094,we stayed here for one night the receptionists are amazing very friendly and helpful they confirmed our taxi transfer and we got an amazing early breakfast would definitely come the room is very clean and min walk to the best restaurants and shops,1
1095,i stayed at hermes hotel for the two nights i was in athens before heading down to kefalonia and could have been happier with my choice hermes was very modern updated and right in the center of plaka a minute walk from the acropolis and center city not to mention the staff was very friendly and accommodating a wonderful experience all around i would recommend hermes to anyone staying in athens,1
1096,the staff at hermes are some of the friendliest i ever met in a hotel they genuinely care about your stay and are very helpful the room we had was very cozy and spacious and was clean and well maintained perfect for getting some good rest after a day in the hot streets of included breakfast is amazing and we loved that the location is within walking distance to everything we definitely stay again,1
1097,we checked in around after spending hours on the ferry the lovely lady at the counter welcomed us and gave us our room it was on the floor very quiet and nice and cool with the ac the room was spacious and very clean we were also stoked to have a queen bed hermes is a minute walk from the train station and the square the included breakfast was very yummy with plenty of options one of the staff members checked on us at breakfast and helped us with some sightseeing ideas very pleased we stayed we will certainly stay again if we come back to athens,1
1098,after a month of hotels eight in all hermes might be the very best in part the staff eva oana push my rating over the limit of stars this will be my first choice for my next trip to athens the location is perfect it is just outside the crazy plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets it takes minutes to walk to the acropolis ancient agora or the fabulous national archeological museum the rooms are solid and silent i never heard any noise from other rooms or the street the finishing is beautiful if you like polished marble bathrooms floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet breakfast food selection is great everything from the basic toasts different breads with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats there are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections the finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time for example eva knew after the first day that we had daughters she readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and i look for a table in none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four lastly someone on tripadvisor said the walk to the national museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea oana told us,1
1099,fantastic little hotel a short walk away from plaka district and syntagma hotel was kept exceptionally clean breakfast was your standard international breakfast that caters to all front of house staff were excellent and very helpful with things like storing excess luggage behind the front desk the standard rooms are small but the same as what you would get in most hotels in the same part of athens highly recommended and would definitely stay there again,1
1100,my family stayed in amalia hotel in athens for nights in june of we just looking for a place we can stay in athens for a short staying while doing some sightseeing for that purpose i think this hotel was perfect its location is really convenient it about minutes of walking distance to acropolis although it felt a lot longer under the blazing sunlight with degree it right across the street from the national gardens and just a few blocks away from the parliament building if you want to see the of the guards and literally a few blocks away from a thousands of restaurants cafes shopping places etc and it you want to ride one of those double decker tour buses the stop is right across the street from the hotel too there is a train and bus stop right there too we thought that as far as location is concern it just as good as it for the hotel itself it very clean nothing really bad to complain about however there were no bell boy services when we got there we had to lug all our bags to our room via a smallest elevator i ever seen in my life not a big deal but the sheer size of that elevator always brought a little smile to our family on each ride felt like that elevator belonged in disney land in some kids theme park room is an ample size and bed is just bed we all slept,1
1101,i stayed in this hotel for nights the location is perfect from the airport we took the bus right outside the airport and we got off at syntagma square which is the last stop from there the hotel is minutes walk going back to the airport we took the metro cross the street from the hotel blue line the hotel is walking distance to all the major sites breakfast is excellent room is very clean and comfortable with modern bathroom staff very friendly i totally recommend this hotel,1
1102,the amalia hotel is central to all things in athens the staff are friendly and professional and are willing to help the guest with a range of travel related questions the rooms were clean and well maintained the view from the roof of the acropolis is great and when we were there private will recommend it to family and friends,1
1103,amalia is well located one block away from the parliament and one block away from the plaka area the acropolis is minutes walk or one stop on the metro the staff are very friendly and accommodating the breakfast is great rooms are well appointed despite arriving at my room was not ready and i had a minute my room was not the best located at the back of the hotel and was quite small the shower was tiny and it was impossible to have a shower without the shower curtain constantly blowing into the shower overall great location friendly staff loses points on my room and waiting for checkin,1
1104,good clean well situated hotel with an excellent view of the royal gardens and the parliament building the breakfast buffet is extensive and well presented but if your room rate does not include breakfast there plenty of cafes with a minute walk to grab a coffee and food reception staff extremely helpful and knowledgable it also the starting point for many chat tours a great way to see the country attractions i took tours and loved them all there an airport bus and the metro within minutes walk save yourself unnecessary expensive taxi fares i loved my day stay and will go back,1
1105,we visited hotel amalia in june the welcome was very warm and even though we were way earlier than the regular check in time owing to our anniversary on that day the front desk lady julia was very kind to give us an early check in and a free upgrade of the room with a fantastic balcony and view she also included the breakfast for that day for us and recommended a very nice place for our anniversary dinner this made all the difference as such a warm welcome in the country started our vacation on a high note i will give stars to julia she is just super awesome and to their customer service as well as they responded to our needs in a timely manner however i will give star to the hotel for the appearance of the hotel from outside and inside the room we got was very nice with very clean and contemporary rest rooms however initially the ac was not working properly however they sent help immediately and the problem was fixed again stars totally for julia and the staff customer service,1
1106,we stayed at the amalia for two nights the location is great to be able to walk to all tourist areas very good breakfast for most but can be a challenge for someone who is gluten free elevators are very small the rooms were decent except for challenges the hotel staff are very friendly time to athens but if we were to return i would not hesitate to stay here again it is so close to parliament that you can easily time seeing the changing of the guard routine,1
1107,this hotel was very nice the location is great right next to the metro station and bus station it is also centrally located for many tours it was clean and the worked well the breakfast was one of the best breakfasts on our trip there were many options,1
1108,if you are planning for trip to athens and you do want to spend alot of money on stars hotel you defiantly must stay in this of all best location very clean and comfortable healthy breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff national garden is opposite to the hotel there are many small shops near by where you can buy water or snack phone company is near by where you can get sim card we came again to athens this is were we going to stay,1
1109,my second visit to athens brought to the amalia best on the wonderful reviews and read and the people are true my previous stay was close by at a popular star but i wanted to try something different and i impressed the property is located well to trains buses and taxis shopping is a two months minute walk to everything first impression on checkin around was friendly and quick the staff are open and want to help i had a superior room on the sixth floor which had a large balcony and king bed parents a note that the balcony has a low height barrier and i suggest kids should be supervised the standard of the room is good and clean including the bathroom and toilet the breakfast spread is well done and would be similar to a star buffet i liked it so much that i booked again to visit in day on my way back to the city,1
1110,did a little research but still largely flying blind because had not been to athens and unfamiliar with plaka but a real find great location in relation to plaka the gardens across the street the metro etc staff were very accommodating and the rooms and breakfast were very definitely stay there again,1
1111,stayed here before our cruise very easy to travel here from airport we took the metro from the airport to a syntagma swuare and it was less than a block walk to the hotel which is across from the national gardens excellent and varied breakfast buffet the room was nicely appointed although we were out most of the day go up on the roof at night for an excellent view of the acropolis and a parliament building this would make a great restaurant area not sure why it has to been developed it appears to be used for nothing,1
1112,we enjoyed our stay here clean room comfortable bed nice shampoo and very nice breakfast it well located in the heart of athens from acropolis and plaka district for shopping however being well located it on the main street so it noisy despite the double paned windows we ended up having to move rooms to the back of the hotel which was quieter but if there a house party in the back then it loud depends on your luck,1
1113,this hotel exceeded my expectations unbelievable location walking distance from quite a few important sites as well as the plaka shopping district very well maintained public areas as well as clean rooms also surprisingly quiet considering the fact that it on a main street i go back in a heartbeat,1
1114,we stayed at this hotel on two occasions within a week with a trip in best attribute of this hotel is its location it is just one block from syntagma square and the metro station in fact we hardly have to take the subway while we were there acropolis and its museum was just a short walk away and so is the flea market plaka and shopping district the meeting points for both the walking tour we tooks was also a short room of this hotel was ample and clean its bathroom was also of a good size there was too much facilities in the hotel which is fine by us since we are out most of the time the breakfast was sufficient but nothing to shout in all a decent hotel at a reasonable price in a great location,1
1115,this time i invested in a deluxe room which is value for money in a city where space and fresh air is rare great bathroom the best bed lovely breakfast where else do you find a balcony this size in the center of athens got the same room as last summer more perfect when they remove the carpet and change some of the faded curtains,1
1116,i have just concluded my stay at amalia hotel it has been quite a good experience for my friend and i who are traveling through the athens area it is in the plaka district which is a safe area in athens close to restaurants and shops and within a minute walk to many of the historical sites the rooms were very clean and the service has been impeccable the front desk is always at the ready to pull out a map and trace your directions to your destination their breakfast buffet was stacked with all types of goodies for those who are watching their waistline to the fellow gourmand there is a pretty good and tasty spread for all with some greek goodies that can add to the cultural experience lastly something that stood out to me was that the hotel provides breakfast boxes for travelers who have to depart the hotel prior to the breakfast buffet opening up i really appreciated this type of hospitality as it made our transition to our next destination that much easier if i am ever able to come back to the area amalia hotel will certainly be a place where i is my only con the mattress was a little hard that it,1
1117,the best thing about the hotel is the location right next to the acropolis museum highly recommended and a short walk from the acropolis and all the attractions the room was clean and basic too few electric outlets but the balcony was a plus especially in the evening breakfast was adequate the airport transfer suggested by the hotel welcome pickups was very useful,1
1118,this really is a very comfortable small hotel beautifully clean with helpful and charming staff the location could be better for visiting the stunning acropolis museum for central athens it is an oasis of calm and surprisingly quiet considering it location the rooms are small but perfect and i loved having a very much recommend this hotel,1
1119,fantastic hotel in every way great location clean comfortable beds wonderful staff very elegant our room had a view of the acropolis life does get any better then that top notch in every way highly recommend,1
1120,i have already reviewed this hotel but having stayed in many other hotels during our mediterrraneam holiday i would rate philippos hotel as one of the best we class price but top class all rooms were spotless and the breakfast was class service and the rooftop nighttime view of the acropolis was breathtaking central location gust below the acropolis,1
1121,our room was upstairs but there is an elevator if needed staff is always available to help out if you need anything maps advice anything we needed was give to us the deck outside our room was wonderful breakfast could have been better the greek yogurt was amazing and there was always plenty to eat location was also perfect so central to everything we wanted to see,1
1123,hotel was within walking distance to the places we were planning to visit we walked everywhere did not need a which saved us some money staff was polite and accomodating rooms were clean and comfortable we had a nice view of the acropolis from our window breakfast had a nice variety and was well stocked the only glitch is probably their wifi slow and unpredictable,1
1125,booked this place for our trip to athens got it as a steal the best cheapest way to reach from airport will be to take the express bus right side of departure gate and get down at syntagma square last stop this is almost an hour drive and take a taxi kms to the hotel not many know this hotel by name due to its location you need to specify that its on aristogitonos lane alternatively you can take the airport to monastiraki by metro mins ride and min walk to hotel careful if you have lots of luggage as this station is filled with few people who bombard tourists pros of acs colourful budget rooms with basic amenities top floor ones offer a good greek breakfast loaded with bread cheese served from early you can book your hop in hop off bus tickets at self service tea biscuits at the great location to access and enjoy local food street joints hard rock cafecons of acs very poor response to they are under staffed probably offseason may be location does get lonely at night as its in between a market,1
1126,the hotel is perfectly located to visit athen s main attractions you can easily walk to monastiraki or the acropolis to the syntagma square but also to the national archaeological museum just to mention a few the metro stations at monastiraki and omonia square are just a five away we came back to the hotel for the second time and stayed two nights as the first time our room was clean the staff was very kind and helpful and the roof top terrace with its view to the acropolis is just door of the bathroom could not be closed well and during the night from saturday to sunday it was quite loud outdoors music,1
1127,we really enjoyed the hotel breakfast and the bar on the roof the staff was very helpful and friendly the location was nice during the day but it was a little sketchy at night not far from metro station and good shopping,1
1129,the room was clean comfortable with a good shower good pressure and hot water the breakfast buffet was varied and good the staff was friendly and helpful we were able to leave our luggage in a luggage room in the lobby when we arrived early and our room was ready yet they also offered us breakfast that morning even though we had paid for it,1
1130,do let the entrance to the hotel worry you from the outside set pretty much in a bustling market the hotel seems like it star but once you get to your room you realise you truly made a great choice by staying here we first got a room on the floor and had to ask to change rooms as the window was literally looking out directly onto another building just a stone throws away it was so claustrophobic we asked to change rooms and we were given the top floor room wow what a difference we were literally looking at the acropolis the bed is comfortable works well loved the laundry service where they do a whole bag of your laundry for a very small fee within hours the breakfast was excellent too varied on different days with extremely friendly staff the location is perfect so close to everything sensational local eateries right around the corner wine bars local shops coffee shops no tourists in sight i would definitely come back if i could be guaranteed a higher floor room the bar on the rooftop has wonderful views just feels like it can do with some more decorating,1
1131,great hotel for a quick stay in athens walking distance to tourist attractions monastiraki square and plaka neighborhood for great restaurants comfortable and safe nice views from rooftop and good continental breakfast available in the morning,1
1132,fantastic service great location and excellent facilities the breakfast is delicious and the beds and bathrooms are fantastic staff are so lovely and helpful in booking transport etc would definitely stay here again,1
1133,pros close to everything modern clean rooms two elevators a mini fridge eggcellent breakfast great roof bar spectacular view from roof helpful staff adequate wifi cons small rooms thin walls,1
1134,everything was great service freindly staff great spot the only fault was our bathroom wasa little small it was clean and had tea coffee and cold water for you to have in reception area when ever you wanted,1
1136,the staff were extremely friendly and helpful the chef made some delicious greek treats the location ie minutes from monstraki is perfect to visit all of the sites the rooms were clean and newly stayed twice,1
1137,i spent two nights at the athens center square hotel as i wrapped up a business trip it about a minute walk from the monasteraki subway station and also close for visiting the top sights in athens it close to the city market so vendors selling olives dates fruits and vegetables are in front of the hotel entrance athens is a lively city at night and while the acsh is close to evening options i found it quiet the staff was friendly and helpful and i was even delighted to have a surprise upgrade to an acropolis view room on the floor the room was clean comfortable and convenient there plenty of counter space in the room for organizing and updated with plenty of plugs for charging all the devices we have these days the bathroom is small but it was updated and more than adequate lots of hot water in a comfortable loved athens and i eager to return on holiday i will stay at achs again,1
1138,i have to say this was my first time in an intercontinental hotel and it was absolutely of all the staff were very pleasant and helpful me and my partner have arrived very early at the hotel around and after a significant effort from the front desk and the cleaning staff we where in our room at with normal check in time at the room was very clean and specious a lovely mini bar which was very helpful in the hot athens quality of furniture was in a mint wise was very close to the city centre and there are different ways on traveling to and from the city centre hotel mini bus tram minutes walk and taxi which are just outside the hotel with a cost around roof garden has a breathtaking view to parthenon with the only problem the necessity of long trousers dress code definitely the hotel we will book again in our next visit to athens,1
1139,stayed here for nights bed and breakfast the hotel is very modern and has a complimentary shuttle bus service into the centre of athens our bedroom was adequately equipped and the king size bed was very comfortable we were disappointed at breakfast in cafe zoe on both mornings because the hot food was actually either cold or just luke warm fortunately there was plenty on offer in the cold buffet section but we would have liked to have eaten a hot breakfast the staff in the restaurant were a little on the slow side to ask us what we wanted to drink my husband prefers coffee and i prefer tea however tea was provided as a jug of hot water and a tea bag with a small jug of milk the waitress asked my husband twice if he wanted a refill of coffee but declined to ask me if i wanted any more tea it seemed to be too much trouble for them to provide the had dinner in the rooftop restaurant the first night which had panoramic views of the parthenon lit up at night which was very nice however expect to pay extortionate price as this was fine dining,1
1140,the hotel mainly conference geared but as a family we did not fell that large lobby is welcoming and the staff were all great rooms a little dated but very clean and spacious food and snacks are pricy by comparison to almost anywhere in athens pool was the real clincher as it offered a rest from the plus degrees temperatures of the city euros gets you the acropolis in about as many minutes,1
1141,we stayed recently for three nights the hotel is large and comfortable but it is a bit old fashioned the buffet breakfast is excellent and worth including the wifi is free if you join the intercontinental reward scheme the pool was nice but there were not enough sun beds there are two restaurants and a cafe but the prices are so high we could afford to try them the main drawback with the hotel is that it is too far away from the main sites of athens there is a free shuttle bus that runs to syntagma square every hour but it was a bit of a hassle to go out in the morning back to the hotel for a rest or to escape the heat in the middle of the day and then out again for dinner and back again at night ultimately i wish we had stayed in the centre where we could walk to everything,1
1142,this hotel really gets service and perfectly looked after me and my family in athens they could not have done more to ensure a difficult situation was handled with real care understanding and empathy could ask for more and would never stay anywhere else in athens,1
1143,although the hotel is about a minute walk from the plaka area it is one of the nicest hotels in athens beds are very comfortable and rooms are large with good air conditioning which is hard to find in athens spend the extra money and get a club level room the club level has breakfast every day which is very good along with snacks canapes drinks and desserts throughout the day sandwiches and wraps at lunch and free drinks in the evening this made it very nice to wind down after a long day of sightseeing in athens service was also very good and the club lounge had excellent views of the acropolis and out door dining,1
1144,we had a great experience on our first two nights in athens hotel staff were great and always friendly rooms and hallways were well maintained lobby area was beautiful with very cool artwork well located and took advantage of the free shuttle would stay here again,1
1145,i stayed in room from june checking in it was already quite late at night i had issues with my credit card and the hotel night team leader checked me in anyway and helped me resolve the issue with the bank the next day i found that very thoughtful of them the hotel room was very spacious and i liked the decoration the spacious bathroom and the toiletries provided had an excellent verbena scent which i loved while it is quite a distance away from the city centre the hotel does provide free shuttle to the parliament house area which is close to where the main shopping area is athens flea market definitely take advantage of this free shuttle and shop to your heart content at the athens flea market it was a walk from the hotel to the acropolis which i did you can not visit athens and not hike up to the acropolis buffet breakfast at this hotel is lovely selection of food and i especially loved the rich chocolate log cake the hotel concierge also helped arrange a to islands hydra poros aegina for me on my last day of stay the only drawback was i was not issued a receipt after paying the hotel concierge for the trip and when i reached the cruise ship i was asked to pay again after disputing and the cruise operator calling the hotel i was finally allowed onboard was the last person to board so if you use this,1
1146,very nice hotel good rooms nice and clean very friendly crew and front desk the pool is nice but a bit small with limited sitting place around it nice fitness room recommended hotel,1
1147,this hotel lives up to its brand name the service is always pleasant the breakfast is great and the rooftop bar has a fabulous view all this is to be expected from a star establishment however if you do get a refurbished room the decoration is passable the pool is too small the drinks are expensive in the bar a mojito nice little shop straight on and on corner right for cheap local food go to vassilis right and follow signs,1
1148,stayed at this hotel for nights visiting from montreal for business lobby and rooms are very nice and clean staff was extremely friendly and food from restaurants and room service was better than expected they are not in central athens but they offer an hourly free shuttle service directly into the heart of the city and back again which we used few drawbacks walls were thin and we could often hear laughing from the adjacent rooms immediate surrounding area seems to be quite really frustrating thing was the i paid for mbps which is much but all i needed to work during the day it was fine usually hitting around mbps but between pm it was so slow it was completely unusable i ran a speedtest and it was giving me significantly slower than even it seems their internet can not handle the traffic at night when people are in their rooms which meant i could not do my from that it was a very pleasant stay,1
1149,we stayed just one night in rooms and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful the room was great value about e and having stayed in other hotels in greece that were close in price it was far superior the room was much larger than standard and the decor facilities and cleanliness were top class the location was also really convenient to public transport and to drop off and pick up for tours at short notice i decided to go on a tour on a day when some roads were closed for a state visit the hotel staff very kindly helped source it and in the interest of time the hotel shuttle took me to a convenient meeting place for the tour they also allowed us to check in early which allowed us to see more of athens i only had meals there at an informal restaurent in the hotel ground floor and both were good,1
1150,have been there on business trips many times at least i would say around this time i came back with my wife for a night on our way to the islands always a great choice ca let you down positioned very conveniently can reach sintagma square in minutes thanks to the free shuttle bus service which runs like every mins i think very grand elegand luxurious they always leave a nice gift in the room which i ended up collecting strongly recommended,1
1151,we stayed at this hotel for two nights with only one day to explore the hotel it was on first appearances very large and quite impersonal however the staff are very friendly and professional and the room was exceptionally well equipped large and cool we were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room you quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual smoked salmon freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals if you want a traditional english breakfast the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the where to eat at night if you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again you will see a sign for vassilios taverna it is worth a visit do be put off by the area the food there was very good and very reasonable rest on your first night if you are not sure where to exploring from the hotel we had a taxi to the acropolis at and it cost if you hold a student discount card nus extra use it most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about which was some saving we also used the tram back to the hotel and then back into,1
1152,stayed there for nights while touring in athens am an ihg member and always stay at ihg properties across all my travelling but have to say that this one was different from other intercon across europe specifically the first nights we had a superior room which was great then we upgraded to a junior sweet with acropolis views on the night and this was magnificent did have breakfast there but couple times with room service which was so perfect and ofcourse the rooftop premier bar and restaurant made the stay even better it is minutes to syntagma square and plaka district the hop in hop off bus station is minutes walking at the corner of the house and taxis are there so you do have to worry about transportation staff are very helpful and this property has really a touch of luxury couple things they need to look at internet access which is different from otherr ihg chain hotel and their late night menu options which i found little bit limited other of that it was perfect yes drinks and food there is quiet expensive so you might need to watch your budget,1
1153,stayed for days with family the breakfast was good with a good spread the only disappointing fact was that the spread remained absolutely the same for all the days the hotel is a good minutes walk to plaka or a cab for euros or minutes walk to the nearest metro station the rooms were spacious with an extra bed for our little one the room service was very good the pool was nice the coffee lounge vienna was very nice overall a pleasant stay however the only regret was that i could manage a table in the roof top restaurant despite having tried on two different nights tried the guest relations if they could help but could thought a star hotel should have a mechanism to find a way to get a table for their guests who stays for days,1
1155,i stayed here a few times and am never disappointed the rooms are immaculate beds are super comfortable bathrooms are high end the spa is beautiful location is a bit off the beaten path but cabs are right outside the door,1
1157,stayed there for a conference for three nights comfortable rooms and mine even had a view of the acropolis could really fault the hotel facilities and less than minutes walk to the acropolis but the area around the hotel is pretty run down given the hotel itself is so upmarket not helped by the bin strike while we were there and i guess few guests tend to walk out but did feel great,1
1158,i called to see what complimentary spa treatments you would throw in for business travellers booking rooms for to nights the signal on your phones are so bad that you could not hear me i did not have such a problem with the hilton so why with you,0
1159,i started here prior to a cruise of the mediterranean and it was great a free shuttle to the plaka and a great view on the top floor of the acropolis the breakfast buffet was delicious with fresh food and delicious greek room was nice too and staff was friendly and accommodating got there at am they were able to get us a room i recommend this hotel they even recommended a great restaurant near by with good greek food,1
1160,we stayed here for one night and it is a good hotel service was good from all staff that we encountered and we were upgraded to a suite on arrival which is always a nice room was good but there was some to it such as the fan above the shower having a huge crack around it we also had to ask for the room to be as there were coffee splashes on the bathroom door it looked like it had been quickly but we did arrive earlier than planned so maybe that was only criticism is of the pricing of food and drink coffees are euros which is expensive for any hotel anywhere in the world coffee was nothing special in terms of size or quality either and a gnt from the minibar came in at euros which in my opinion is just too much given the same is euros in any bar in have read this comment before from others and the hotel has responded that pricing is in line with other hotels in athens just because others have crazy prices does not make it okay in my opinion i believe it should be seen as an opportunity to offer better value than the competition rather than justification to it also costs euros for wifi which given the room was over euros should be included in my in all a nice place to stay but the refreshments offer very poor value for urbanaut,1
1161,the region has numerous derelict buildings all around as grecian economy struggles yet the prices inside this hotel are astronomical ie small bear and a vodka tonic euros and i know your paying for your surroundings but they were no different to any other hotel i regularly stay in and although the rooms were nice its just kind of spoilt when you feel like you being ripped off with the prices for everything profit is a dirty word but greed would be a more appropriate one such a shame that this is the main thing remembered on a hotel visit,1
1163,i have tried many intercontinental hotel and the hotel keeps its promises the rooms are great clean good spacious and great breakfast service is generally efficient we took a suite and a family room and stayed nights overall concierge services are disappointing though we asked for a restaurant and were proposed one with a nice view but food was really not good an nowhere like a greek restaurant but more like a tourist trap we also asked for a pharmacy on sunday and were advised a pharmacy which was closed luckily the taxi had an app with all open pharmacies on sunday and brought us there he also advised us a great greek restaurant walking distance from the hotel we also did get our luggage from airport and asked the concierge to help but we did get any news luckily the airport sent the luggage hours later concierge services need some action plan,1
1164,not bad hotel however i would prefer to stay closer to the center we always took a taxi in so not a great the hotel was lovely as we were out all the time it was enough for was we was clean which is always an issue and it had a gym which is what i look for in a i stay there again yes if you could pick up the hotel and move it closer,1
1165,we stayed for nights on mid july the room we booked was really spacious with a very nice balcony overviewing akropolis clean and a good service from the club upstairs the only issue for this hotel is that is not in center but you can still get the bus shuttle to sintagma every half be back soon,1
1166,the service is excellent and there is a beautiful pool this is a good hotel for families with children the rooms are large and the staff is very attentive and courteous the neighborhood is a bit weird but it is not far from all the main attractions and is and easy to access,1
1167,we spend nights in this hotel and we were pleased especially with the club lounge services our room pool and hotel gym also the rooftop bar is nice in the evenings offering great views to the city our room was spacious with nice views to the acropolis and it was always kept very clean by the staff beds are comfortable hotel staff was very friendly and helpful we used the complimentary shuttle bus to syntagma few times but also taxis were everywhere easily available the shuttle taxi drive to syntagma takes mins and taxi costs euros overall a very good stay,1
1168,the hotel is really nice room was lovely and very spacious the area the hotel is locate is the nicest but it is far to walk to the tourist areas everything we needed was there but food in the lounge was overpriced and not very interesting,1
1169,ok so this was part of our family trip right after our wedding in cyprus and then a beautiful stay in crete we were to spend nights in athens prior to flying back home my parents and sister were accompanying us therefore i have booked rooms about months in advance informed the hotel that this was a special occasion from my profile they knew that i was top tier spire elite royal ambassador within their chain of hotels here are my comments although they claim that there is special for elite members on the club floor we had to wait exhausted at the reception in the before they could speak with us not the right level of they told me that my personal room got upgraded to the club floor which is a given benefit of this tier anyway however my parents room got a level upgrade but no club floor and no club lounge i have called the guest relations and the duty manager and have asked nicely whether they can at least give club lounge access for my parents seeing that this was a special trip lots of talking from them but bottom line was a no and even the gm the best he has done was to offer a discount for the club lounge this was a first for me in many years with ihg thumbs down to you yes the view from the balcony at the club lounge was amazing we could see acropolis however we,0
1170,such an amazing hotel with all commodities the pool is not really amazing and it can get really hot in there however the strong asset for this hotel is its staff everybody is extremely nice and smiling and welcoming from reception staff to housekeeping also the hotel is located just min driving from town centre and has a great shuttle service for his guests,1
1171,the hotel is big efficient and good family room was big location is ok but it only a short taxi from the centre and there is a shuttle bus back and forth but why in this day and age would you not give free wifi it feels a little churlish for a star hotel to try and make a few euros on this the best hotels do,1
1172,ok do know where to start location you are in the middle of a bad slum aerea and not minutes from the center no cafes and restaurant around stayed in a suite for euros per night and i telling you that i felt to stay in hotel very old furniture bad bed old linen no lights on the balcony the view was a disaster the acropolis very fare way too the bathrooms super old no even a soap rest to put your noice room with street noice too the housekeeping they miss the service couple times do know why they never replace the coffee and the water in the room hotel i think must have at list rooms and when you go to the main and only pool they only have around beds we went back to our room few times because no beds and no towels let talk now about food and beverage we checked in around the first night and my wife and i we are vegan so what we did we asked the room service and vegan menu or at list a vegetarian menu and after minutes they told us that there not a special menu for veg but you can check on the ird menu the story cut short they had only fruits steam rice and boiled vegetables at the end we had few tomatoes salads and hummus with some brown bread this is was the meals we had for few days before i realize i,0
1173,lovely place to stay very nice interior very central with great breakfasts room was a little small but that is probably typical of athens staff were very friendly and helpful and gave good suggestions as to where to eat,1
1174,perfect location in the heart of plaka close to everything shops restaurants and transportation great staff so helpful with directions rooftop bar and restaurant with amazing view of the acropolis delicious food syntagma square just a couple blocks away,1
1176,my title to this review sums up my stay for this hotel in athens my only critical aspects of this review has more to do with the room we stayed in the room was not overly spacious and the mattresses were firm to cleanliness of the room was staff at the front desk were very professional and helpful the cafeteria staff was also top notch as was the staff at the roof terrace bar the view from the roof terrace bar was spectacular and i would definitely book this hotel again in the future,1
1177,i think americans need to temper their expectations when they travel to europe was the room small absolutely athens is a city that is literally thousands of years old and this hotel is in the heart of it we walked through the plaka and had a fabulous dinner there a rooftop hot tub and restaurant at the hotel too the breakfast was amazing it had anything you could think of the staff spoke you can basically walk anywhere from here we took the subway from the airport and walked from sygmata square here maybe minutes we had giant luggage and managed just fine the hotel is air and that worked really yes it is a small room,1
1178,you know what they say location location location this is the central hotel in one word it is the perfect location to explore all plaka has to offer street restaurants shops acropolis temple of museums and yes the roof top bar is all its cracked up to be cool view cool cocktails cool service you can also sit inside the bar with ac and still get the great view the elevator the elevator i can live with the smallness people max load what had me pulling my hair out was the pace slow rooms were modern and had a recent update which included marble shower wood floors and new deco cool little hotel in an awesome location,1
1180,i am not sure how this hotel is getting anything over star reviews here the location yes it great the hotel not so much the bed was so hard we could hardly sleep the room was so tiny that we could even move our luggage into the room the wifi worked as fast as a slug walking backwards at best we had been so excited to stay here based on reviews we had read but were unfortunately disappointed with our stay pros staff locationcons just about everything else,0
1181,i really liked this hotel i was only here one night but the entire staff was very helpful and accommodating the street looks a little rough with graffiti and a homeless man sleeping in the street but i can attest that it is really a easy location to everything a lot of athens can seem a little rough but this hotel is a nice little spot for a great stay,1
1183,view the parthenon from our variety of breakfast clean bus from hotel to syntagma square is very useful for free since i am an ihg i had a good stay,1
1184,i have been here before so my obvious choice was this hotel inside the citythe rooms are very immaculately maintained and the shower is amazing breakfast was one of the most lavish ones i have seen in europe and i enjoyed it each morning only dissapointing factor was the spa the message was very dissapointing for the price which they charged do not use their spa it is a waste of good moneyapart from this the hotel is fantastic will come again,1
1185,me and my son spent two wonderful nights at this had accomodation at club lounge and it was breakfast great choice of starters all he son sometimes have problems to eat smth but not at this always find something for specialy l want to mark the comfortable matrasses and can fell like in a clouds room was cleaned twice per day like all hotels of this mind that is not in the center it takes min to go there by comfortable tram without any also have free shutle from hotel for the center,1
1186,pay the additional charge for a view of the parthenon on the acropolis from your room each night when i rolled over i could see lights on the parthenon it looked like a painting but it was actually my hotel window worth every penny hmmm the rest of the hotel a little dated but they do a good job keeping it clean and modern bathroom was luxurious with thick towels and strong water pressure breakfast buffet was delicious,1
1187,we spent one night in athens and the hotel location was great the room was a good size and nicely furnished the bathroom was not well laid out and difficult to manoeuvre the shower was located in the narrow bath and it was extremely slippery and only had a shower curtain which constantly stuck to you the room was not very soundproof and every time someone left their room you could hear every noise breakfast was pleasant with the usual yoghurt scrambled eggs assorted cakes and hotel reception smells of cigarette view from the rooftop bar is fantastic,1
1188,my husband and i recently spent nights at central athens hotel we are very pleased with our decision to stay in this hotel the rooms are spacious by european standards clean and modern the staff is very friendly and were helpful with any of our questions about the city or traveling in the area the rooftop bar was excellent we made a point to have at least one drink there every evening of our trip and we were never disappointed by the drinks or the view in addition we very pleased with the complimentary breakfast buffet you get a wide variety of choices including those that are and more authentic greek dishes central athens will even pack you a breakfast if you must depart before the buffet opens as was the case with our last found the location to be fine it is an easy walk minutes from the syntagma metro station which is a major stop for most modes of transit to and from the airport it is also less than a minute walk to the major flea market area of athens which we loved the walk to the acropolis was a bit longer but it could not have been more than minutes evidently athens is currently summer experiencing some domestic unrest but we never felt unsafe during our only problem that we have with the central athens hotel is the spottiness of their wifi it is free but it is also incredibly unreliable just be aware,1
1189,as the saying goes it all about the location location location this hotel is within walking distance to all sites you can even walk to kolonaki and then head straight up to lycavitos wear comfortable shoes in addition to having a centralized location it views of the acropolis ate breathtaking especially at night rooms are small but clean and equipped with wifi and strong air conditioning breakfast is always included and the array of delicious food will leave you amazingly stuffed check out my pictures front desk always professional cheerful and willing to help advice have the front desk call you a taxi any time needed never hail a taxi on your own most cab drivers are crooks,1
1190,we found the central to be a very pleasant located walking distance to the plaka and monistriaka areas minutes walk from syntagma square where the airport bus operates from and lots of restaurants clean and modern stylings in the room was compact but comfortable bathroom is well big feature that we loved was the rooftop terrace the view to the acropolis is fantastic and a great place to relax at night food prices are good for their limited menu but after each long day tourist tramping we loved it staff are exceptionally and genuinely give it a rating except for one lodged a minor maintenance request at reception on day one and it still was not attended to when we left three days later anyway we would definitely stay there again if we return to athens,1
1191,we stayed at the central athens hotel for nights at the end of march the hotel was in a great location perfect for sightseeing we booked bed and breakfast and requested a acropolis view the room was really nice not huge but perfectly adequate for what we wanted the room was lovely and clean with clean towels daily the breakfast was lovely with a really good choice of hot and cold reception desk staff were really helpful and knowledgable,1
1192,we didn t really know what we were getting when we reserved rooms at this hotel but we were soon to be very information said the hotel had a view and it sure elevator holds three bags and a thin woman but the stairs are rooms are small but nice and the air conditioner workers were helpful and friendly especially terrace on the floor could use some umbrellas and other items to make it more comfortable we still enjoyed beer on the terrace with a great view of the acropolis met some other travelers from other countries sat next to the pool had decent breakfasts and could walk any and everywhere we needed including to the acropolis there is plenty of shopping eating and site seeing within walking distance i would stay at this hotel again without hesitation,1
1193,we stayed for two nights a couple and a child and we enjoyed our stay there we had a single bed in our room for our child and the room still felt spacious enough even though most properties in the area are the breakfast buffet was really good hotel is not super centrally located but with a cab it only a few euros to the city center,1
1194,great a little out of the centre however a cab ride costs euros we stayed at this hotel due to an absolute nightmare apartment appolonos no power no curtains dreadfull avoid at all cost staff found us rooms at the last minute they were really helpful breakfast was great even cooked me an egg white only highly recommend,1
1195,i was lucky they upgrade my room to suite and it was perfect the breakfast was very good it is a very good hotel clean and near the city center the service also was very good the staff was very polite,1
1196,booked the divani caravel for one night as a stopover on the way to somewhere else and have to say it was great hotel was clean and staff were very friendly helpful and efficient location was great try oroscopo restaurant round the corner and the kids loved the roof top pool hotel offers valet parking for euro,1
1199,rude staff from the very was told off as i was the third person to ask for beds when given a queen hardly appropriate to share with my year old son was then ungraciously switched to a smoking room and when she acknowledged it was indeed a smoking room then tried to blame her colleague for giving me the wrong room to start with could be bother to move a fourth time but room was on a noisy bus to town is a ridiculously infrequent service at stupid times gym was denied my year old as he needed parental supervision not to mention the euros extra when already paying a reasonable sum for an average room then after room was serviced no bath towels were in the room and it took a phone call and several attempts before they finally materialized and then only one at a time and with bad grace i would never stay here again and would certainly not recommend anything about this hotel apart from the rooftop pool but make sure it before pm because then the staff come and almost pull the deck chair out from under you,0
1200,stayed here for nights and would definitely recommend it the staff would really helpful and friendly spent a relaxing afternoon sunbathing by the rooftop pool while having drinks served to our sun loungers from the pool bar the room was spacious and came with bath robes and slippers felt quite luxurious my only negative comment is that breakfast was charged at per person which is crazily expensive and not worth it so we just booked a room without the breakfast included,1
1201,we stayed at divani caravel during our stay in athens this is a star hotel and had all the amenities you would expect from a star hotel the customer service was great they helped us with all of our requests the hotel is a minute walk to metro also there are lots of cabs parked outside the hotel mount lycabetus is an minute drive from the hotel and the acropolis is metro stops away we did try the food at the restaurants so i ca comment on that,1
1202,it gives me great pleasure to review the stunning divani caravel hotel athens last week my family and i had the pleasure to call the property home whilst visiting the beautiful capital city of greece upon our arrival we were professionally and promptly greeted by concierge and reception staff our suite was that of above and beyond expectation and quality that was comfortable and spacious we could unwind within the suite with ease it contained flat screen televisions a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom the property is beautifully maintained spotless and reception is it a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us whilst we stayed with you everybody from check in through to house keeping food and beverage services were brilliant and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service you all made us feel right at home our experience was indeed sublime the roof top pool is very memorable for our and the food cocktails and stunning uninterrupted view of athens and the parthenon unforgettable breath taking breakfast was delicious and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay perfectly located in athens lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the but do yourself favor and savor the divani caravel club sandwich,1
1203,we were two families of four with some of us staying nights and other nights overall we were very happy with the divani caravel the rooms were very good sized although we had expected that the triple rooms would have had a true bed for the person not a sleeper breakfast as mentioned is overpriced for what you get if you pay out of pocket but was actually very reasonable when you booked the room with it pool was very nice although we were a bit surprised at the cooler temperature of the pool especially given how hot it had been in athens the two weeks before we arrived service was excellent and they were very helpful in the one area where we ended up having some because the people in our party had been in europe from weeks already we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry ultimately this is more of an expedia issue than a divani one but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service not the laundry facility we were expecting however the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant overall i would say it was good nothing special but it certainly hit the spot and let us get to bed earlier than if we went somewhere for food options there are several,1
1206,i am staying at the hotel as i right this review i originally picked this place as the internet is offered for free i have not been able to stay connected to the internet for any length of time my iphone and ipad will not stay connected i called the operator and she stated it was due to high usage in our bathroom i can easily hear the people in the next room over all the rooms are clean we have a boombox in our room for some reason little odd smell when we walk in but after that we ca smell anything there are some great places to eat just outside so that is a plus,0
1207,just a rather ridiculous place stupidly for everything just to park in the hotel car park each for breakfast and for a small glass of milk for our toddler just somewhat up itself with no obvious reason absolutely no charm the pool was poor the obligatory bag carrying felt agressive the staff were pompous there was a weird thing where someone came in to put a piece of paper on the floor beside the bed not sure what that was about but it made me feel our room was not private the room was cramped the bathroom big but badly designed all in all go somewhere else,0
1209,we stayed here for nights and the room was excellent very spacious very clean and comfortable with a queen bed the staff are very helpful and accommodating as well unfortunately the only issue we had was the noise room doors have no soundproofing at all and the walls between rooms are good but noise still comes through this meant that on our first night when the hotel was busy due to a conference we hardly got much sleep as we could hear the people walking down the corridor or talking in the corridor the elevator ping when doors etc our neighbouring room also had noise music and people talking which was exceptionally loud but due to the poor soundproofing it still kept us up and ear plugs did particularly help we called reception and they did talk to them after which point it was better but it still was great due to the other noises the second night when most people from the conference had left we managed to sleep better but the noise still travels through the room doors so i do think i will be staying there again soon i like my sleep too much,1
1213,we stayed with family for nights back in oct hotel location is quite convenient only min by foot from main attractions in the quiet area if you are lucky to stay on top floors as we did you will have picturesque views of athens including even acropolis being leaders club members we were upgraded to suite on top floor with big living room nice separate bedroom and huge terrace overlooking athens we did have a king bed which however was not extremely comfortable other than this all the amenities you would expect form star hotel were in place wifi was free and of good quality breakfast was sumptuous while just ordinary good breakfast nothing exceptional we also did use the rooftop swimming which was nice with very interesting feature if you go outside and down floor you can see people swimming through several big window in the pool very nice touch views from rooftop pool are unbeatable you have panorama of whole athens service was at all times friendly and staff was always trying to be helpful all in all we did have very nice experience,1
1214,before i booked this hotel i researched and read all the reviews good and bad i figured i will take a chance since i was going to be in athens for three days from the piraeus port to the hotel the taxi ride cost euro upon arriving to the hotel the bell hop greeted up and took our bags the checkin was simple and breakfast ia euro per person i stayed on the floor the view was terrible my room faced the back of buildings the was clean and everything was in place the hotel provide shuttle service to the city center the driver was extremely helpful and very informative i wish i remember his name the times are perfect starting at and the last pick up is the shuttle service has two stop the first stop is at the mcdonalds where you can shop at h m zara and other fine store the second stop is close to the acropolis museum the hotel is located in a area where plenty of restaurants are around in walking distance one of favoriterestaurant was the tavern second restaurant on your right the food was amazing the vegetables soup is everything simply burgers was also a nice place to eat for under erous all in all my stay at the hotel was okay i made the best of it they can extend your check out time if you ask in advance in plenty of walking drink coffee and eat spinach the swimming pool,1
1215,very nice hotel with nice room and very good service from the staff nice breakfast the wifi is good no top but good it is a good idea for the value for money i recomendeed it to all of you,1
1216,friendly and reliable food great shower the kind we are use to in the states atm machine in hotel which is quite rare for hotels in greece family owned for years and for a greek that ravels to greece every year and has stayed at many hotels in athens this is going to be your best bet for the top pool small but at least they have view of the city,1
1217,really enjoyed time at this hotel last week friendly staff always there to help out and recommended local restaurants and places to go we always used the free shuttle bus to go into centre runs from outside the hotel and drops in syntagma square but only a minute walk so hotel is in brilliant location the hotel offers free wifi and has great rooftop pool with amazing view over to acropolis and degree views over the city it is a little small and the pool bar is very expensive though the breakfast was euros so we did have this great stay recommended,1
1219,my sister and i stayed at this beautiful hotel during our stay in athens this is by far the best hotel in euope that we stayed at comparable prices to or star hotels so far it is located in a quiet area outside the hustle and bustle of the city there are not too many eating options at the hotel and is it quiet pricey breakfast buffet is euros per person however there are a lot of great restaurants and cafes near by there are also kiosks directly across the street that sell snacks and beverages at reasonable prices the level of service from the front desk to room service staff was top notch the room we were given was bright clean and a lot bigger than any other hotel we had in other cities in europe the bathroom was bright roomy and had a variety of quality towels and two bath robes the toiletries were really nice and also included a shaving kit dental kit vanity set shower and sewing kit the shower was also enjoyable with a lot of hot water and great water pressure the hotel did not stop there to impress there is a pillow menu that offers three different options to your preference and comfort level after returning to your room in the evening your bedding is turned down for you with a chocolate on your pillow and hotel bedroom slippers on the side of each bed the hotel also offers a free shuttle service,1
1221,i stayed at this hotel for two nights there were no complaints however the room was incredibly small there was a lovely rooftop restaurant with outstanding views and good service except for one dinner where it was extremely crowded and we ended up staying an hour longer because of the service a pretty good hotel overall,1
1223,a lovely and convenient hotel close to all the must visit destinations in the pool the common areas in the hotel are lovely and the in house restaurant a special rooms were small as were the bathrooms but very was super,1
1224,big hotel i know but you ca beat the location cleanliness or the swimming pool when it degrees plus bonus is the roof top bar and restaurant views amazing good value for money and made our athens stay a treat,1
1225,we stayed in this hotel for a scientific meeting in athens the rooms are spacious and well decorated and the breakfast is served in the roofgarden with view to acropolis it is situated in the center so a lot of interesting places could be visited on foot it is not expensive so it is one of the best value hotel in athens,1
1226,the location of the hotel is an excellent one it is walking distance from everything you want to see in athens a very luxurious hotel and rooms the staff are very friendly and always smiling we booked the panoramic room with an amazing view to the temple of zeus the food is delicious and the rooms are clean and spacious i would recommend this hotel to any couple specially if traveling for the honeymoon great experience,1
1227,this is a great hotel all the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly they go out of there way to ensure a good stay the hotel itself is very pretty and spotlessly clean a very substantial and delicious breakfast is served at the rooftop restaurant which overlooks the temple of zeus and has a terrific view of the acropolis terrific value,1
1228,we stayed here as part of our air transat honeymoon trip to greece and its islands nights upon arrival and before departure to canada upon arrival at the athens airport we were greeted by the air transat rep along with other couples we were eventually taken to our hotel stopping along the way for the other couple s in a large bus no bathroom i would strongly suggest having transfers to your hotel but it s not necessary as there are many taxis which will cost you around euros to get this hotel is appointed nicely with a clean appearance and decor the lobby is open cooled and pleasant despite the weather outside our upon arrival was handled swiftly and efficiently with the staff having a good grasp of english our room was on the second floor right near the stairs there are different sets of elevators but each one is not very large since there are different sections of the hotel this makes sense wifi is offered free and the username and password are given upon but if you re early as we were when going back to canada you can get that and use while you room was a standard double room that contained one bed a bathroom and a unfortunately i did not get any photos of the room which is unusual for me but rest assured the room was sufficient and we found the king sized bed very comfortable giving us a good sleep make sure,1
1229,we come to athens every summer on our way home from the islands we have always stayed at the divani and have loved it but this year decided to try the royal olympic due to its proximity to reception on arrival was offhand and snooty we were told we had an internal room and to our horror it had no windows and seemed to be over a light shaft we decided not to complain bc we were only staying over night but nonetheless were very shocked as had booked in when i mentioned this the gentleman made a very disparaging comment about having booked through the bathroom was frayed soap and shampoo basket with toothpaste spittle splattered on it taps with soap stains basin with toothpaste from last guests surfaces dirty the sign please service my room was still hanging on the outer door handle when we arrived at towels although good sizes were yellowed and tried to have a drink in the hotel bar before dinner at but were told that the bar closed at in an inner city star hotel we found this rather stayed in for a meal and it was amazing service with a very professional and pleasant waitress food was in general good but far from exceptional it was very expensive the view is magnificent to say the least and we were five a fantastic table on the cherry on the cake was ringing reception at to ask for extra pillows from housekeeping as we,0
1230,the room was pleasant bright and spacious the pool was lovely the staff were excellent the decor was elegant and the rooftop space was spectacular pleasantly surprised by the value location is perfect for tourism,1
1231,the royal olympic is a lovely comfortable hotel that is located in easy walking distance to the many of the major sites in athens its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant which i shall review separately with breathtaking panoramic views that include the acropolis and the lycabettus hill the rooms were comfortable and well maintained although not we stayed at the hotel and both the beginning and the end of our trip both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool although our second room had only a stall shower but no bathtub as had been in the first the swimming pool was another welcome feature though not very large it was clean temperate and enough for swimming short laps there were sunbeds which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel as well at patio chairs and tables the staff was uniformly courteous and helpful and finally the price which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was quite reasonable though perhaps not the institution that it purports to be the royal olympic is certainly a comfortable place to stay when visiting athens,1
1232,when i booked the hotel it was not what the pictures for the room showed the room was like stepping back into the small boxed tv in the corner with probably the most uncomfortable beds i have ever slept in the walls looked like they needed painted and the bathroom was very small the people were kind and the services they offered were very good the location is close to the acropolis and within walking distance to the museum overall would not stay there again deceptive pictures online concerning the rooms we purchased,0
1233,we booked nights at this hotel as my birthday treat we booked an executive room and i emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion i received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this on arrival the hotel was full this was the least of our problems the hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel taxi at euros on our return to the airport we were quoted euros by hotel staff which we booked decided to take the metro as we thought euros rather expensive the metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband passport were stolen from my handbag this resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the british embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement day ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within executive room was nothing like executive the bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath i reported this but the engineer could make no were replaced each day although the quality was not is unusual not to have facilities in a,1
1234,for our second family stay at the royal olympic the impressions were the same and have even worsened this hotel is a bit deceiving for a but with a perfect location in the city center of rooms are comfortable clean quiet and spacious the wifi is working correctly only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand despite the easy control system this was much of a problem for one night but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel beginning with the reception hall arriving at the royal olympic does feel like arriving at a we arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time similarly the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our snacks to come a bit later on i also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected this was corrected only after we noticed is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the acropolis and the city center there is plenty,1
1235,my family stayed at the royal olympic hotel for nights during our vacation the hotel is beautiful and walking distance to many sights attractions and restaurants we had a suite which was nice at the end of the day to have space for the family to hang out after sight seeing in the morning we loved returning to the hotel and enjoying the pool in the afternoon the pool serves food and drinks and was very relaxing the food we had pool side was very good we ate several evening dinners at the roof garden restaurant which has an amazing view of the parthenon and athens the food was delicious the morning breakfast was also delicious staff was very professional nice and helpful,1
1237,let s start with the positive parts the location is great the pool area is wonderful the view from the rooftop is breathtaking and the reception is professional and service minded beside this it s hard to say much more positive our rooms were smelly a bit runned down and not properly cleaned the sides of the bathtub were dirty and there were hair in the corners of the bathroom the elevators are small and slow the staff at the breakfast were rude and the client computers were old and outdated could be that the hotel has been renovated in but nothing seems to have been improved changed since then,0
1238,our stay here was underwhelming we booked a weekend break here days nights due to the reputation and found the hotel fell short on arrival the baggage handler was very friendly but the desk staff could process us quickly enough to get us out the way due to a queue of people waiting to check in they were not very welcoming the view from the room is exquisite but let down by the fact the bed is two individual beds separately made and pushed together with a blanket over the top to give the illusion it is one bed we requested an iron due to creased clothing as they have been in suitcases to be advised that there is not one available but you can pay for someone to come up and take the item away to be pressed not ideal the pool is far too small for a hotel of its size there are perhaps for a hotel with final day the roof garden was also unavailable due to a wedding ceremony with no alternative advertised and the downstairs bar does not have an adequate capacity we checked out at in the afternoon we had to go to a neighbouring hotel to await pick up from outside the royal olympic overall we were not all that impressed with our stay or the service we received from the staff,0
1239,we stayed here overnight the end of july on our way to mykonos was very pleased on arrival lovely lobby area i was disappointed with the pool area while it was clean there was a complete lack of sun beds it was disappointing after a long journey to have to lie on the ground on a towel particularly as there was lots of room to have more sunbeds dinner that night was delicious and we ate it in the rooftop restaurant over looking the staff were good and friendly however there was a particular waitress who was very rude at breakfast the morning which was disappointing after the experiences we had previously the rooms very clean they had mini bars but not a star room very dated overall this is a nice clean hotel in a good location but i would rate as a star not star,1
1240,the hotel was very nice and posh with lavish buffet breakfast on the rooftop with amazing view of the acropois and the temple of zeus very well located minutes walk to many places like syntangma square plaka acropolis stadium staff was very helpful only drawback no electric kettle available which is the basic of any hotel,1
1241,this hotel has not only has a great location with view of zeus house and the parthenon it has great customer service you will pay more than other hotels but you will be paying for an experience the dining on the roof was relaxing and the food was solid i would come back,1
1243,this is a great hotel for many reasons its five minutes from the acropolis and museum its right beside the best street dining in athens the pool is very special if you get the right room you will face ancient greece from your window and except for one totally rude head wine waiter the roof top bar and restaurant is extraordinary,1
1244,we stayed here with a tour after a cruise so we did not pick the hotel the location was good short walk to plaka acropolis and transport it overlooks the park and the temple of zeus ruins which is striking the view from the on the roof partially covered is quite stunning especially at night the buffet breakfast is served there and is very good as is the service the pool area is posh and the rooms are lovely as well we had a small balcony overlooking the pool i think most do the lobby sitting areas are large and including a very inviting cozy library area a few steps up overlooking the park and front entrance if there were so much to see and do in athens i would have enjoyed sitting there reading a book or guidebook for a few hours there or at the pool the front desk staff was also pleasant and courteous although they did not let us know of a transit strike the day we left if you want to be close to the plaka and acropolis but want a more upscale hotel then this is a good choice,1
1245,the start of a fantastic vacation began at the royal olympic we stayed in the same room we were in two years ago but stayed longer this time we had a view and balcony overlooking the temple of zeus just across the street and a view of the acropolis up the hill the old town of athens was just a minute walk from the hotel and close to everything traveled with friends who all stayed here and everyone was happy we found the prices cheap compared to most places we stay but the quality and service equal i do think we would stay anywhere else while in athens,1
1246,my wife and i stayed here as part of a group tour with gate travel this property is located near the plaka district and very convenient to the parliament building and other areas of downtown the rooms were very nice and somewhat large there is a roof top restaurant where your included breakfast is served with views of the acropolis and the temple of zeus which were amazing the breakfast was extensive and very good they also serve dinner and drinks in the is a very nice pool area and bar where you can get lunch or snacks the staff were very personable and accommodating i would recommend staying at this hotel to family and friends,1
1249,we stayed just a night but were impressed with service and availability of the roof top restaurant was excellent for food and the view on the was large and pleasant but bathroom was a bit old and would need to be morning we were going to piraeus to take a ferry and the hotel told us that we need minutes by took us minutes to get to our boat and almost missed it our taxi drivers did careful when you plan your taxi drive to port,1
1250,the hotel lobby is very nicely decorated and the staff is very serviceminded and rooms are oki nothing super fancy but nicely decorated the wardrobes could have been better though and the tv was a joke star hotel and no flatscreen is kind of breakfast was amazingly good and the staff was extremly helpfull and nice the view if you sit outside when having breakfast was very pool area is kind of cousy aswell but the service is not star at the pool area was hard getting hotels placing in aten is great you can easely walk to everything from we loved this hotel anyway and was very pleased with our stay strongly recomended,1
1251,the hotel is located next to the plaka minutes to the acropolis and museums and shopping and cafes the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful spacious rooms and gorgeous swimming pool breakfast is served at the restaurant on the top floor terrace restaurant overlooking the acropolis and parthenon it would take too long to describe the breakfast so i will just say marvelous i highly recommend the restaurant for a memorable dinner while not iunexpensive it is reasonable for a star gourmet experience try to reserve while the sun is setting over the acropolis,1
1252,my boyfriend and i had a comfortable and enjoyable stay here certain aspects were really impressive and felt namely the huge and beautiful lobby and the breakfast both the view and the food say it was let down by small touches such as the fact that they do provide free bottled water in the rooms and that the hallways were very run down such a contrast to other public areas the pool area was also far too small for the amount of guests but i suppose there is much they can do about that now i would definitely stay here again though they area was good and it was good value for money plus the rooms were pretty large and always clean,1
1254,our second time back at the royal and enjoyed it once again staff are helpful view of the acropolis over breakfast is sensational and the breakfast itself is great only a short walk to the plaka district and in a great spot,1
1255,ok we were a little concerned with this hotel given some of the recent online reviews but what the heck this hotel was just fantastic super service super breakfast with a wow view the room that has all you need really comfy bed and great air conditioning the pool is great deep and well serviced with staff very central location to all of the big city sites seriously cant fault the royal olympic hotel,1
1256,this hotel charges star prices and does have star location is great for the tourists right near all attractions you to tick staff are friendly and helpful full marks there the lobby and surrounding areas are impeccably clean and kept again full marks the pool was nice although was too deep the rooftop had fantastic views and the food on offer in the breakfast buffet was only reason this hotel lost a point with me was due to the inconsistency in the rooms the deluxe room which we stayed in was nice and reasonably spacious but it just too much of a down grade from the more expensive rooms the bed was just joined together and not made together two beds made separately but joined together with a king cover over the top the bathroom was in need of an update also this can be seen from other customers overall it was a great stay would i stay here again probably not but i probably would stay in the same neighborhood of athens either again so is not really the hotels fault that i would stay there again,1
1257,very nice hotel great location unbelievable view from the rooftop to the achropolis and zeus ruis pretty good quality the restaurant the rooftop is worth every second of the stay do not miss it,1
1259,the hotel interior is very luxurious however the rooms did not meet the standards one would expect for such a hotel our first room had problems with air conditioning fine if you like sleeping in a sauna when mentioning this to the staff they did not seem surprised which makes me think they new it was faulty the second room was smarter but not exceptional our reservation included breakfast the restaurant was so small there was not enough room to accommodate the guests which meant long queues they then informed many people in the line that breakfast was not included by this time we decided to leave and have breakfast in the city centre would not stay there again,0
1260,this hotel exceeded my expectations after having read some not so great reviews before my trip i really ca understand them now that i have stayed here this hotel is beautiful and the decor is true athenian style if you looking for an ultra modern hotel then it is not for you but it is not without its modern amenities we stayed in an internal room and although we had no window the room did not feel claustrophobic because of the beautiful stained glass window that you were able to light up in an evening the air con is really cold which is great after walking miles in the hot athens summer staff are extremely helpful and polite and make sure the hotel runs smoothly nothing is too much to ask here the breakfast is lovely but gets busy around as it would in a hotel of this size the pool is great and beds are comfortable often it can be hard to get a sunbed in the afternoon but this is to be expected we had one evening meal here and although it was pricey it was one of the nicest meals i have ever had and really you pay for the view of the acropolis we loved this hotel and would definitely return during out next trip to athens,1
1262,as the title says the entrance to the hotel is very nice and worthy of a five star rating the room however left much to be desired travelling as a couple we were provided with a room that featured two single beds pushed together the decor was incredibly dated the bathroom cramped and the space not cleaned to the standards that would be expected the location is good and most of the main sights are within walking distance from the hotel we would not stay at this hotel again unless the room provided was of the expected standard we would recommend dining at the rooftop restaurant the food was exceptional as was the view which provided a panorama over the temple of zeus and the acropolis,0
1263,i selected this hotel as it had a pool and thought it would offer some relief after sightseeing i was expecting much from the reviews however we were so pleasently surprised by our lovely comfortable room friendly helpful staff sensational breakfast and amazing view day and night of the acropolis and temple of zeus location was fantastic also a little away from the crowds but in less then mins you are in plaka and the acropolis,1
1264,well comunicate hotel clean rooms good breakfast friendly staff i would recomended this hotel to other people the staff speaks spanish this is difficult in athems wonderful roof sights romantic place to have a dinner,1
1265,three generations on holiday together for the first time but memories made in a wonderful city and the hotel and staff made the stay relaxing extremely helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived until our very last minute nothing was too much trouble,1
1266,day break for my birthday and we could have picked a better hotel within walking distance of everything we needed to do in athens and we booked a room with an outside patio area with an amazing view of the acropolis this hotel is well decorated clean with fantastic staff who could do enough for us would definitely recommend and would return in a heartbeat,1
1267,i stayed in this hotel during may hotel is nicely located it is possible to reach the hotel from athens airport by metro and a great saving on taxi charges there is a metro station close to the hotel megaro mussikis and it will take only minutes to reach hotel that too the way to the hotel is rather very quiet and not crowded hence it is possible walk with luggage without any difficulty the hotel staff were extremely cordial and was available in seconds after making a tel call i felt so homely at this hotel the room was also very good with fine view to the road and the greenery closeby to the hotel there are lot of small restaurants shops and eateries the breakfast in this hotel was also upto my expectation i had spent nights in this hotel and and it was a nice experience,1
1268,we went to athens for a wedding and decided to stay somewhere that was quiet but with good access to the metro to get to the center of town golden age is only a minute walk from the train station and it is in a safe residential neighbourhood the service is excellent we had a problem with our room and they immediately took care of it the breakfast is fine would stay here again,1
1269,i was very impressed to take my family to such a nice hotel we ordered a bedroom apartment which was very clean and modern beds were very comfortable and facilities in great condition we ordered room service as we had just left a full day tour and were very tired the meals were very reasonably priced and very tasty hotel was also in a quiet location and we all had a good nights rest breakfast buffet was included and offered a wealth of options thank you for your hospitality,1
1270,we stayed here for nights before going to naxos we were given a warm welcome by the receptionist room was nice and clean bed comfterable staff very helpful serviceminded and polite room cleaned every day and new provided good breakfast close to the metro so easy coming from the airport would go again,1
1271,top place and close to all touristy sightseeing spots staff were well versed with both english and greek and were happy to show us plenty of spots to go and visit and were able to help on getting some bargains,1
1272,staff is top professional and helpful the room is very clean nice bathroom we the beds comfortable most of all great breakfast we manage to walk around the acropolis in a sense that our hotel is very close to points of interest our stay was comfortable,1
1273,after weeks of intense we decided to splurge a little on some comfort and we were not disappointed golden age hotel had all the necessary amenities they had great food available through room service the greek salad and chicken fillets were oily but tasty the hotel was above and beyond but it was very well equipped and staffed and what was needed for rest and comfort there were some instances that we had issues with the wifi but the front desk was quick to assist however possible successfully the hotel is about a minute walk from all the major attractions such as the acropolis museum etc or a minute uber ride away during the time we were there we found uber to be much more affordable than the local taxis using an uber to travel to the airport or just outside uber should be driving directly into the airport will save you some addition the hotel staff member olympia who came to clean our room was incredibly friendly she had the most vibrant personality and was always happy to help teach us greek and make us feel welcomed kostas at the front desk was also incredibly kind overall a very positive experience,1
1274,this small boutique style hotel was very clean and conveniently located the breakfast buffet was very good the staff at the hotel was friendly the rooftop bar gave you views if the acropolis at night,1
1275,this is a real gem of a hotel small in size and large in service comfort breakfast buffet was very nice fresh with all the amenities staff was very friendly helpful accommodating the location was fantastic as it was far enough away from the hustle and bustle but only a few short blocks from the acropolis museum and plaka,1
1277,the hotel offers delicious food breakfast was great huge variety and the staff was also very helpful too the floor there is also a restaurant with a great view of the acropolis my wife also agrees with me our experience in your hotel was great for sure we be back,1
1278,very nice decoration but expensive and location is not perfect as it is not very close to the shopping centers we went for shopping by taxi which took min to the center the weather was bad and we benefit from the swimming pool in the nice thing is that there is a view in the roof floor which allow to see a very beautiful view of athens,1
1279,we have just spent a few nights at radisson blu park hotel and it was an amazing helpful staff informative and through our stay everyone made us feel very special and room was well designed spacious with comfortable beds and excellent bathroom was great internet covering all over the enjoyed very much the breakfast buffet which was generous with all kinds of options from light to heavy and everything in best part of the hotel was the pool area with great drinks and stunning views of the city where we also had a delicious dinner the food and the service were both at the highest levels overall everything was fantastic and we could not have been more pleased with our entire stay thank you radisson blu athens till next time,1
1280,if you are looking into a good option for hotel while staying in athens the radisson blue is worth considering very good rooms friendly staff and a very good system in the summer time very important in my opinion good return from your money the only issue is that there are not that many restaurants within minutes overall very good experience,1
1281,i can literally see the pantheon from my room the rooftop is perfection the view is definitely worth a cheeky wine upstairs at night hotel is walking distance to so many attractions restaurants shopping staff are very helpful friendly spacious room comfortable bed,1
1282,the view of parthenon was nice though no one informs the guest that when the cafe at the ground floor is closed there is no way in or out of the hotel during the night i needed to go out of the hotel and i realized that i was locked honestly that was a nice experiences,0
1283,the best of many good things about this hotel was the terrace on the top floor plenty of chairs and tables from which to survey the spectacular view the acropolis to the north and the city and the mountains beyond it to the east and south we took our breakfast up there on a tray no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift every morning and our coffee or wine every evening it was a spectacular way to start and end each was also well placed not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the acropolis so instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years and joined them a little further up only a little but it was more magical the hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times whether we needed to know about museums restaurants bus routes etc they telephoned hertz for us when our lack of greek and the hertz office busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting,1
1284,great location the reception staff are awesome always smiling and ready to help i stayed for nights and on way back from santorini for another night on the second leg there was a mix up in their reservations and they acknowledged it were very hospitable and adjusted me in a presidential suite i forgot the gentleman name who marshalled it all but it was great their breakfast is good by european standards and the fact we eat only very near everything shops food outlets indian food etc great view of acropolis from top and right next to parliament house however they seriously need to improve their the ac control does not work from the room so no change can be brought about by the guest and it very hot in mattresses are lumpy and uncomfortable and no water bottles provided by house keeping all are charged difficult to fathom that it an old establishment and needs to work on their shortcomings would love to stay again if rooms are cool and beds provide a good sleep by the way i loved visiting athens,1
1287,a very comfortable stay we had there nice specious room look for their suite rooms good location warm staff they packed our entire groups breakfast since we were leaving early morning that i thought was a sweet gesture,1
1288,i decided to spend my last week in athens in luxury and style probably the most affordable to someone like me of what i consider the holy trinity of luxury hotels in syntagma square i was so excited on my arrival i tipped the bellboy when he brought my luggage to my room what a room location location location and view view view wow a deluxe room on the floor i could see the changing of the guards in front of the greek parliament and the parthenon from my balcony big spacious and clean room with air conditioning that was a blessing every time i returned from the scorching athens heat comfortable bed crisp clean and fresh linen big bathroom with quality toiletries nice touch my room did not come with breakfast but i had the option to take breakfast for but i opted to walk across the road and for had a freshly squeezed orange juice and a spanakopita instead perfect yes this place expensive but as a treat to myself was well worth it it easily accessible with the metro and airport bus on walk i loved my stay,1
1289,fantastic experience in a very large room with acropolis view at the best location in athens can not beat that the amenities are great the service excellent the breakfast rich in a beautiful hotel is next to king george and grande bretagne on syntagma square it has been built as a luxury hotel to compete with its neighbors with large rooms big marble bathrooms and it does that but at more affordable am staying here every time i come to athens on business and feel pampered,1
1290,we stayed at this very central hotel for a friend birthday bash it a very athens kinda hotel which suggests its elegance of the good days the hotel itself needs very little sprucing up minor details yet would make a great change other than that it perfectly clean quiet comfortable and extremely convenient for everything one needs to do in athens situated minutes away from suntagma sq metro station means you wo have to walk a lot in the heat the staff are nice and they gave me the quiet room i asked for my experience was demanding but i still felt very welcome word of advice for hoteliers and housekeeping renew and replenish toiletries even if your guest is there for the weekend it makes them feel thought of thank you njv plaza,1
1291,my wife and i stayed here the first three nights of our honeymoon and the location ca be beat when visiting athens we were able to walk to lunch dinner and the shops around town in breakfast was included with our booking and i would highly recommend it there is a great selection and a lot to pick from including mimosas the staff was very friendly and helpful our only reason to not give it a perfect was because of the misleading photos of the views they show pictures on their website of a view of acropolis from the hotel but we were unable to find out exactly where that view came from do think it was this hotel again though the location is perfect high recommend this hotel,1
1292,the hotel has an excellent location it within walking distance to all tourist sites and there is high end shopping area just behind the hotel the hotel does feel dated but the room is comfortable it a business hotel and i could feel anything luxury about this hotel the wifi was really bad we could only receive internet at certain spots of the room and it was slow,1
1293,stayed one night all very lovely perfect location and a really nice room a bit disappointing we booked months in advance and ended up with two single beds instead of the double bed we requested,1
1294,njv athens combines luxury with history in addition to great location in the middle of down town with walking distance to shopping and dining places rooms are clean and comfortable staff are helpful and friendly breakfast was yummy with variety to satisfy all tastes all in all it was a nice stay,1
1295,great hotel ideally located at syntagma square in walking distance from the historic center of athens clean spacious room big bathroom all the amenities available friendly staff we were here on business but i would highly recommend it for leisure as well,1
1296,i stay in this hotel again because of the great location there was nothing really great nor nothing really bad it was just meh the room was adequate fairy clean and spacious we had problems with keeping the room cool enough but to be fair it was over degrees when we visited we had a breakfast included type of reservation and the breakfast food and presentation was very nice however the service during the breakfast which was minimally needed since it was a buffet was lacking the servers seemed overwhelmed and stressed and did not go out of their way to greet us or ask if we needed anything on one occasion i asked if they had a take away cup for my coffee what is it with europe it so weird that they do not have take away coffee and got a huffy eye roll stomp off attitude i mean a simple no i sorry we do would have been much better but that little incident aside our over all experience was pleasant sufficient to meet all our needs and we would consider staying here again just because of the convenient location,1
1297,stayed july hotel is located right in the heart of constitution square rooms are very clean and the staff is exceptional the breakfast buffet is very good this hotel is within walking distance from a lot of restaurants coffee shops and shopping there is also high end shopping within walking distance with the road closed off so you can walk in the streets,1
1298,this hotel was very nice the rooms were spacious the staff were friendly the only drawback was the room stunk of cigarettes even though it was supposed to be a nonsmoking floor the breakfast was great it right on syntagma so the location was perfect there are many nearby shops and restaurants and the area is well lit and safe,1
1299,hotel is dated but well maintained in the center of tourism just across from greek parliament good nightly rates this said clerk talks of breakfast at checkin as though it included likely it not so ask prior to taking your breakfast otherwise you might get a surprise at the end a good star hotel with character and close to it all,1
1300,sure there may be newer hotelrooms in athens but i may not use a calory to find it out best location in the city excellent service spacious comfortable rooms very good breakfast buffet and helpful staff i come back here each time in athens,1
1302,positives are the hotel is very close to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum a minute walk will also take you to the temple of zeus and the stadium the plaka is a min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of athens at the end if the plaka you will find the ancient agora the acropolis metro is only a min walk that will take you to other parts of athens the beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to deg we had this for three days there is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee you have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so breakfast is rather tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm now fermenting the fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice coffee was via a nescafé vending machine tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from at least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you wo get a good night rest the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in athens you might want to,0
1303,we stayed for the second time in six years in this lovley cozy and comfortable hotel located close to the the acropolis museum and some lovely was clean and beautifuly was great will definitely be back,1
1304,stayed here for one night after our island hopping tour rooms were spacious and were all we could ask for staff were very friendly and helpful especially donna wonderful close to the plaka area and the acropolis,1
1305,we immediately felt welcomed most staff speak at least some english but make it a point to learn some greek before you go they seemed pleasantly surprised when i said something in greek room was clean and comfortable rooftop dining amazing breakfast was always delicious with many healthy options,1
1306,the staff were wonderfully understanding and accommodating the breakfast was truly incredible and everything was delicious we had a spectacular view of the acropolis from our room our room was clean and comfortable too,1
1307,the hotel is centrally located which makes it easier to the tourist sights the beds are nice and comfortable the highlight of this hotel is the typical greek breakfast i just loved it very polite and helpful staff house keeping people were just amazing reception people were just so helpful on my first day in athens,1
1308,loved our suite with view of acropolis room was big spacious clean comfortable as was the rest of the hotel food was good at the roof top restaurant and we enjoyed breakfast although nothing out of the ordinary,1
1309,we have stayed at the grand polis twice the first visit was nights we were in a tiny room with a tiny shower it was a little difficult to even get through the front door we enjoyed our stay as the bed was comfortable and the room was well ventilated but it did not really seem like a star experience the breakfast was great we enjoyed the buffet and would highly recommend our second stay we were some how given a much larger room on the top floor we were much more comfortable the staff was friendly on both visits and we enjoyed the views from the rooftop bar and even had lunch at the cafe downstairs we visited during the heat wave which made the location seem much further from local attractions than it actually is,1
1310,nice hotel very good situation professional and kind staff specially vangelis and vasilios very good breakfast included greek coffee spectacular views to the parthenon from the restaurant maybe only a very small issues small elevators in busy times internet sometimes does not work good views be nice from room floor anyway nothing relevant very good hotel,1
1311,the staff at the polis grand was extremely friendly knowledgeable and professional the hotel was centrally located so we were able to walk and explore the city the room though small was clean and comfortable it made our trip very enjoyable,1
1312,loved our trip to greece and staying at the grand polis hotel we did get to eat at the rooftop restaurant but wish we had the rooms were tidy and clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful when we needed tips on how to get around the hotel is centrally located to so many things and not to far from the acropolis i hope you enjoy it as we did,1
1313,i only stayed for two nights the hotel is not in a nice neighborhood with a few deserted surrounding buildings but inside it is nice and clean with great roof terrace the rooms are clean only remark is that like unfortunately in most hotels when you leave the room the air cooling device switches off and when you come back the room is hot the breakfast is excellent walking distance possible to the center and acropolis,1
1314,very small elevator average rooms no coffee maker bad and small washrooms rude unfriendly staff called for room service the response for coffee maker was very rude with sprain on foot the receptionist and the lady at the cafe do let me sit with my leg raised when it was hurting very bad as we had checked out and our flight was in few hours,0
1315,we stayed here for days last week centrally located in the heart of rome nice rooms with soft beds and great the breakfast buffet is top notch with a great variety of fruit cereal fresh bread and a host of other items the desk was very friendly and helpful with our stay and getting cabs thanks for making our stay enjoyable,1
1316,conveniently located but watch your wallets at omonia station pickpockets are in full force and many including us were robbed beds were very comfortable ac worked great and bathroom was very spacious yes the included breakfast is as good as everyone says salads eggs meats tomatoes mushrooms bread of every variety veggies types of cakes coffee yogurt station fresh fruit make your own greek coffee in sand amazing fresh flavored waters greek pies and more laundry service is sent out and was euros for a large bag staff was helpful and efficient great view of acropolis from rooftop bar,1
1317,pros the staff was extremely polite friendly and helpful the breakfast had the best display of all the hotels we stayed at during our trip rooms were clean but a bit small we just chalked it up to being european first stay had the small shower but at the end of the trip we scored a room with a normal size location is a bit shady hotel itself is nice area surrounding hotel not so much area seemed a bit shady we did walk around the city but only during the day and took cabs back after dark definitely watch purses and wallets etc as you do get approached for handouts we really did have any major problems and found most people helpful elevators although adorable are very small people with a suitcase small but quaint,1
1319,clean hotel with good central acres to all areas friendly staff excellent breakfast buffet the roof top bar is one of highlights with view over the city the room is small but sufficient for persons,1
1320,my fiancée and i stayed three nights at the polis grand in may the room was fantastic the staff at the were helpful and the hotel itself is within a reasonable distance from the major attractions surrounding the plaka district best of all the outstanding array of cuisine to wake up to in the morning,1
1321,the hotel is a decent size building very clean and well presented the staff are unbelievably helpful nothing was any trouble all the staff went above and beyond but vassilis was a standout for us there were of us in total my family from america were unlucky enough to have a suitcase go missing from the airport but the hotel staff were non stop in trying to locate it for hotel is very well placed for the acropolis and syntagma square etc and most attractions were within walking distance the rooftop has a real wow factor when you first walk in there at night but the service seemed a bit slow for drinks as has been mentioned in previous reviews the breakfast is really good lots of variety to cater for all tastes from fruit various breads drinks etc it was a very nice experience the bedrooms were a little small but about right for a city hotel why only stars the lifts were very small hot and slow and there were only two in operation the kids were happy to use the stairs but it was a little frustrating sometimes waiting for the lifts all in all a very easy going and positive experience which i would recommend to anyone next time we are in athens i will certainly you for looking after us,1
1322,room is clean and pretty the restaurant on the rooftop is absolutely delicious and the view is just amazing staff of the hotel is all smile helpful and polite location is just perfect we can walk to the acropole amazing we recommend that hotel to everybody,1
1323,the hotel is very good located in a central point where you can easy access every part of the city the breakfast menu is so wide and it is very good the hotel staf are friendly and provide help one comment though the cleaning of the room should occur more often in my days stay it was cleaned only once,1
1324,the staff on reception were very friendly and helpful especially when my husband had his phone stolen on the metro the breakfast was very good value for money and differed each day we loved the view of the acropolis from restaurant balcony would recommend we travelled to athens for a family baptism and the hotel was very well sited for using public transport,1
1325,the hotel is beautiful and very close to great restaurants and not a very far walk from the acropolis minutes the thing that sets this hotel aside from others is the staff they are very accommodating and have great advice on restaurants you know th advice is good when you run into staff members at the restaurants they refer you to not to mention the breakfast was delicious i would stay here again in a heartbeat,1
1326,i can not rate the polis grand high enough from the moment we walked in to the moment we left the people there could not have been more arrived in the early evening and the night receptionist gave us a warm welcome and helped us with some basic but very useful local information the hotel is located minutes walk from omonia square where there is a metro station and tour bus pick up there is a bakery and supermarket located nearby the main tourist section with access to the acropolis and other attractions such as numerous bars and cafes is minutes straight line walk from the room was typical of a star european hotel included was a safe tv fridge and balcony the aircon actually worked and was adjustable remotely which is unusual from my experience the bed was amazingly comfortable and the room although located next to a busy road was very quiet the hotel said they had spent a lot of money on was typical european fare the usual array of pastries cold cuts bacon sausages fruit cereals etc all being refreshed constantly vasilis the catering manager showed me how to make greek coffee in hot sand i enjoyed it surprisingly linda thought it was had dinner on the rooftop one night with our son and his fiance there was a nice view of the acropolis and the meal was very enjoyable total bill was which was not too bad for have no problem in encouraging you to,1
1327,june we arrived at our hotel polis grand in athens and were completely exhausted from the flight plus a hour time zone difference the hotel is a in my opinion the hotel itself is clean but like many european hotels the room is very small as is the bathroom however the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it they put out a lot of hot and cold dishes plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast too many things to list including the drinks overall this hotel is nice and the service is friendly and is good for a quick day stopover on your way to see other part of greece greek isles while i am here i will take this opportunity to mention our day stay in we got to our hotel at from the airport they told us that check in time was and after so we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of athens and eventually wound up at the monastiraki square we had a gyros and went back to our hotel to take a nap we woke up a little later and went back to eat dinner at monastiraki in the evening this is a very lively place full of lights music shops street vendors and live bands it was entertaining as far as the food goes it was good but unfortunately being from toronto i can not in all,1
1328,my friend and i stayed there for nights the staff members were very friendly and helpful the rooms were clean the breakfast had a wide variety the location was good in walking distance to most touristic places and about minutes to the acropolis by foot however the hotel location is the safest if you returning late alone,1
1329,there is a good convenient transport with metro downstairs there is a hours open bread shop factory and the hotel pool can have a great view of the arcopolis and the breakfast is buffet style and provides alot of choices,1
1330,we stayed at wyndham grand athens in our lasts days of our honeymoon trip through took a taxi from the airport straight to the hotel and we were a little bit shocked when we arrived since the area in which this hotel is has this heavy atmosphere you can feel that this is not the right place for a tourist to thing is that there is a subway station really close and is easy to get a taxi from the hotel entrance so you do really need to walk too much around this not so good areaother than that the hotel was really nice specially the rooftop from which you can see the parthenon all lighten up at are really nice so is the bathroom we never understood the shower there is this really nice rain shower but there is no shower plate so the water floods the whole bathroom after you might sound exotic but when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is rather a slippery cold and wet staff were mixed either they were really helpful or did ignored us or talked to us even without looking us at the face so i guess it depends on your luck when you visit the counter,1
1331,i want to point out and say unequivocally that this is the best massage i have ever had in my life perfect pampering for the body a once in a lifetime experience and i want to mention aspa and faye the two girls who do are just perfect,1
1332,i ca compare the wyndham with any other athens hotels because this is the only one we stayed at but this is a great hotel modern clean great breakfast buffet and very nice although quite small for the size of hotel swimming area on the roof great view of the acropolis from the rooftop bar our room was spacious and location is great as far as restaurants tavernas and bars are concerned there is one right outside called alexander the great which we did get round to trying but there is a metro station metaxourghio right across the street from which you can easily and cheaply reach anywhere in the city including the airport if and when in athens again i would probably stay here now we familiar with it tip i traveled back to the airport separately from my wife and son they were told by reception that a there would be plenty of taxis available in the street and b the flat fare back to the airport is compared with the fare in of she could find a cab and was charged the i made the same journey the next day found a row of cabs in front of the nearby metro station and only paid the fare is clearly stated on the cab dashboard as for airport to center and reverse journey do be reticent to point that out to the driver if he tries to overcharge,1
1333,we booked this hotel as we were looking for a place to stay in athens with a swimming pool to beat the summer heat we were not disappointed it was really great the view is breathtaking on the city and the acropolis particularly for hotel is really perfect the rooftop pool is very small but refreshing all the staff is really nice although really slow on the rooftop bar the only downside is the scary neighborhood you ca really walk at night even at day always take a taxi to get there or leave but price quality is a really good value,1
1334,i stayed in this hotel during my business trip the hotel is centrally located with good access to public transport the premises are renovated clean and spacious the room was comfortable the restaurant had an excellent view to the acropolis housekeeping was up to a good standard breakfast had adequate variety the pool is small for the size of the hotel reception was friendly especially stefania was very professional and helpful i will stay there again,1
1335,convenient location comfortable rooms clean and excellent service i love the rooftop bar it has beautiful view of the city the room is nice new and big but they only offer complimentary water on your day breakfast buffet is nice with great choices but the hot food comes out a little too late i think it starts at or which was too late if you have an a full day tour where you have to leave the hotel early,1
1336,we booked this hotel as we were looking for a place to stay in athens with a swimming pool for a week we were not disappointed it was really great the view is breathtaking on the city and the acropolis particularly for hotel is really perfect the rooftop pool is very small but refreshing pool bar a little bit er it had a good variety just no station have stayed less nicer hotels than this one with better breakfast options was only downside is the neighborhood you ca really walk at night im usually okay with the rough neighborhood but yeah be safe this area had predominantly asian middle eastern people i was actually surprised to find alot of halal food for choice behind the hotel within walking can walk to the main sq in station is right out side the hotel so is the bakery on the corner choices of food and pasty to choose from,1
1337,i went home yesterday from lovely days in athens and i stayed at wyndham hotel for this day and right now i am very happy that i choosed this hotel a new hotel in the town i think they open in the last days in in that moment i order this hotel its was long down on the ranking list on trip advisor but before i travel then running up hundreds of places i like to know what other people means about the hotel and everything around it like neighbourhood and whats include and what you can do also on the hotel i choosed this after short thinking because of they could give me what i wanted i am only in a small contact with hotel before i choose where to stay and maria was answering my mails very fast i am not a very difficult person for the hotels i only have a few wishes and they promise me them hotel is located in metaxourghio not the most central place but for me i dont have problem for jumping on the metro who was minutes away the hotel have a lot taxi outside and they bring you to central places for around euro i took metro blue line from airport to syntagma station and then changed line to red line for next step i guess i used around hour i didnt look at clock the metro price i euro since its the airport line taxi cost around euro and,1
1340,used to be the imperial hotel is beautifuland serves a wonderful buffet breakfast included with the rumors are very clean and modern with plenty of roof top bar restaurant swim pool are excellent some say the the acropolis from here is bar and restauraunt are expensive but very nice the neighborhood is improving but not close to major attractions,1
1341,first time staying in a wyndham have a generally good stay as expected from its reputation and was particularly impressed by the breakfast choices however had trouble with the front desk almost every time i tried to just get a quick information never got greeted nor the staff initiated or asked just kept doing their own thing although i did get the info when asked after waiting for what seemed to be a long while the location is good some very good or restaurants in the walking distance and subway station right across the roundabout on the other side,1
1342,a great hotel convenient location comfortable rooms clean and excellent service friendly staff and very rich breakfast a special thanks to stephania who made our stay as comfortable as possible will defiantly stay there again and i highly recommend it,1
1343,hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating we had several issues with our first room including an ugly view of the apartments next door where we could see the tenants sitting outside their balcony and inside their apartment we asked to change our room they ended up changing our room from atrium view to an executive city view this room was much more spacious including the bathroom and had a beautiful city view plus we ended up on the floor instead of the floor the higher up the better the view also i recommend a visit to the rooftop for a wonderful view of the acropolis either day or night on our check out day we had to leave at to catch our flight which meant no breakfast for us since it opens until anyway my husband asked demetrios bell boy if there was anyway we could get some breakfast to go he was so helpful and managed to get us two bags with various breakfast items like a continental breakfast that helped start our day thank you to everyone at wyndham grand athens special thanks to sofia rigopoulou reservations constantinos front desk demetrios bell boy and everyone else at wyndham next time we visit athen we will definitely stay at the wyndham,1
1344,so far i booked times in this hotel and i will continue to book there because of good location very clean rooms and the most important very nice friendly staff everyone is smiling and so helpful the spa is really small but so cosy and worm by the wonderful team they have the manager fay and the therapists aspa maria joana and marina they are all so nice and wonderful a special thanks for panos front office manager for his care everytime i come there,1
1345,we arrived in athens and stayed here for nights the rooms were very spacious and ideal for of us staying together the location of the hotel is excellent well placed for all the main attractions and nightlife a short taxi ride away the tour bus highly recommended stops just outside the hotel would definitely recommend staying here and would go back the next time we in athens,1
1347,we stayed at this hotel for nights in july we booked an acropolis view junior suite due to the extra space it would provide for our son basically an extra room the room was great very spacious with an amazing view of the acropolis loved the free toiletries more expensive greek brand than korres which i had seen before the downside was a lack of drawer capacity to put clothes in really lacking here despite a good size wardrobe space and the rather strange huge showerhead which was so large it felt as if you were drowning whilst showering very odd indeed we also had a bit of an issue with the daily maid service as although very good if you were out of your room by around a note was put through the door saying our room would be cleaned today we had to ask at reception for it to be serviced on occasions this has never happened before to us in a was fine but quite chaotic which often seems to be the case at large hotels in pool area is nice the pool itself was larger than i expected given what some people have said in their reviews but the area itself is the hotel could have made this larger and forsaken restaurant space we were lucky enough to be able to get a sun lounger for an hour or so at the end of the day after sight seeing but had to wait couple of gripes,1
1348,we stayed here for a week during our visit to athens we had a car and valet service was good just drop the car off at the entrance of the carpark and the valet guy will park it for you the location of the hotel is okay there a train station across the road but you would have to be fit for steps down into the station and up when you return to the hotel there is a bread shop opposite the hotel hours in case you need some there is a swimming pool in the rooftop area but it always crowded we can see acropolis from the rooftop bar facilities in the rooms were good you get a coffee maker free capsules only and the usual fridge ironing board etc the usual beds were big and comfortable as well,1
1349,we spent nights this july at wyndham and my likes it so much that he thinks the hotel is the nightlight of his first ever trip to greece the staff are very friendly and attentative the buffet breakfast is very good with plenty of choices the crown jewell of this hotel is the rooftop which offers a million dollar view of acropolis both day and night we enjoyed lovely ice cream with the fab view every night there and it only costs euro each and the staff could be nicer we did eat meals there as it is quite pricey however just opposite the hotel entrance there is this lovely family run restaurant called alexander the great which offers delicious grilled dishes fried zucchni greek salad and mousaka for very reasonable price we ended up eating dinner twice hotel is located in the middle of the metro lines between the airport and the port which suits us very well as we were taking a med cruise from athens the metro stop is only minutes walk be aware that not much air conditioning at metro stops and in peak summers it gets really hot in athens a degree and so it can be uncomfortable a metro day ticket for unlimited rides only costs euro and so it a cheap way to get around,1
1350,i booked this wyndham grand for the quality of hotel facilities i was not disappointed the rooms and hotel at star we booked a junior suite with city view for my husband myself and year old daughter for was very spacious enough privacy for sharing with a self conscious teenager bathroom was very spacious also and plenty towels were super helpful with info on athens hotel and booking taxis etc for onwards journey and ordered driver for pick up at airport breakfast excellent lots to choose from and views of the acropolis from bar and the bar is itself a great place to hang out later in afternoon or in evening however i given a star rating as service is very poor on rooftop there were times we waited mins from ordering at bar when supposed to be table a couple of occasions we had to wait a while on pool towels being delivered to bar area this is the only place the hotel is let down location it not the nicest however the tourist buses stop across the road the underground station is across the road and taxis sit outside are very cheap would definitely return to this hotel if visiting athens again i highly recommend,1
1351,most of the other star reviews state the exact reason i gave it a instead of a so i wo rehash all of them in short the good nice spacious view of the acropolisclean common tasting breakfast with bad the breakfast area is absolutely chaotic and do nothing to make it pool area is tiny long waits to get a place to prices at the bar are absolutely crazy that why almost no one is in generally unhelpful staff not would stay again,1
1352,we stayed at the wyndham during our stay in athens and found it to be a very comfortable hotel it has the feel of a large chain hotel and all the services and facilities that you would expect to find in a star hotel the lobby is a generous size with a big seating area where you can wait the rooms are modern and very spacious with excellent bathroom amenities the bed was a great size and very comfortable we found the room to be mostly clean and the facilities in the room were sufficient coffee machine and strong wifi rooftop is great and you can sit up there with amazing views of the city of problem with this hotel is the location it is close to the main square and is only about a ten minute walk at best however to get there you do need to walk through some ghetto like areas which can be frightening however you can get a taxi from the hotel for a very cheap rate which will help avoid the surrounding,1
1353,renovated floor building situated in a area without interest the staff is friendly in a professional way but nothing more most people stay two or three days and move on many groups rooms are modern clean bathroom is convenient breakfast is quite standard with everything precooked scrambled eggs fried eggs lots of cakes and cookies fruits without much taste the absolute top is the rooftops terrace because of its great view on the acropolis staff over there is cocktails are expensive and quite average one mint leaf in mojito swimming pool is mall and always busy,1
1354,a highly recommended comfortable rooms with a very good service staff very friendly and professional a very big thank you to stefania who made us feel very welcomed and made us feel like we were at home sure we will you also to fay and you again aristotelous,1
1355,this modern hotel has large rooms a small gym and spa and the highlight its rooftop bar restaurant and pool there are uninterrupted views of the city and its landmarks this a high end wyndham we also dined on the rooftop here we had an amazing cod with miso and a goats cheese is no doubt the hotel is busy but manager panagiotis intzidis and his team were very attentive,1
1356,definitely accommodating for americans traveling i felt very comfortable and my room had great ac and lots of space the real gem is the rooftop pool bar and restaurant which has spectacular views and a very relaxing vibe the bartenders are very nice and i felt overall the hotel was very service oriented i used uber the whole time and they were definitely better than taxis who only take cash and may take you for a ride i will stay here again when i go back to athens,1
1357,the rooms were decent size compared to city centre hotels we have seen in other cosmopolitan cities upon entry there was some smell of damp locked in but it was readily auctioned upon as a cleaner was sent there was a strong smell from bathroom drain which we also told the staff about the location is very central for acropolis and most of the sites lots of places to eat nearby room service is very reasonable priced all the receptionists and porters were very very friendly a ramp would have been really helpful as we had to lift the buggy over the steps only though every time can book again if available at sensible price whenever we go again,1
1359,it was our second time staying at the hotel parthenon and it may have been even better than the first the staff was extremely helpful from my planning months ago to when we arrived on site they helped us with drivers to and from the airport and piraeus port rooms were fresh and clean good wifi nice bathrooms abundant free breakfast every morning excellent location just steps from plaka would highly recommend,1
1361,minute walk from the acropolis and the parthenon which every one needs to see in athens minutes walk from la plaka which is very worth it alot of very good rooms are okay and the staff is very friendly the breakfast was excellent the hotel does have a pool or a would still recommend it,1
1362,a surprising find in the attractive area of plaka the room was plain and a bit disappointing on entry however everything else more than compensated super friendly greeting on arrival plenty of helpful information terrific breakfast and the very enjoyable four hour happy hour buy one get one free at reasonable prices easy walking distance to ancient attractions a handy super market at the end of the street there are plenty of places to eat in the plaka and we particularly enjoyed the gyros at the takeaway directly opposite our street this hotel could make itself even better by paying attention to a few easy to fix details in the room for example having two coffee mugs when two people are staying instructions on using the safe ensuring the tv is tuned and working and extra pillows in the room these were quickly fixed when raised but i feel i should not have had to ask,1
1363,stayed just one night in airotel parthenon hotel room was simple but was clean and had the essentials however what stood out was the phenomenal service by the hotel staff from the moment we alighted from the cab velisarios and giota were the most friendly and welcoming hotel staff i ever met they did not hesitate to assist us in any queries regarding the hotel amenities the places of interest to visit whilst in athens and even recommended food options nearby as our flight was at midnight they willingly offered us to place our luggage in the concierge once we checked out so that we could tour the city and come back later in the evening to collect our luggage they are such an asset to the hotel and i would not have felt more welcomed and enjoyed our stay in this hotel if not for them the free breakfast provided was great and had a good variety would definitely come back to stay at this hotel because of the impeccable service from the hotel staff and the convenient location,1
1364,wow the location could be better right near the acropolis about from the entrance lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel itself is suit old and dated and could do with a refurbish bieber it is clean and adequate the staff are what make it they are so friendly and helpful and nothing is s problem we also were able to store our luggage there whilst visiting the islands the breakfast was amazing,1
1365,this hotel is a perfect location for seeing athens on the edge of the start of plaka and everything it and athens has to offer it is very touristy right next to the acropolis museum and minutes from the acropolis itself five minutes the other way and you are at the temple of zeus once you pass hadrian of restaurants and music and drinking in the area directly i was on the top floor and my view was the parthenon it was amazing marble balcony a couple of chairs and a small table and i was so happy the elevator is a tiny thing and you wont fit more than you and a piece of luggage in there but they make it work it great the bathrooms are clean and modern the bed was very comfy and the breakfast was not bad i always had hot water the staff speak english very well and i was always greeted with a smile the tv was great for watching news but no one comes to greece to watch tv and the internet was fast,1
1366,this is a really great hotel in an awesome location it is walking distance to several shops restaurants and the museum worth way more than the price the rooms are on the small side as all other european rooms are but super clean and the beds are really comfy the staff is super helpful as well when needing to book taxis or when looking for places to,1
1367,excellent location very comfortable beds and room the staff were very helpful and friendly the view of the acropolis and city were stunning from the roof terrace very close to plaka so plenty of nightlife nearby lots of restaurants and short walk away i would highly recommend this hotel and will let stay here again,1
1368,first it located in rough neighborhood i had my jaw drop moment but it clean budget hotel with free working aircon and bonus of great view of acropolis from area at floor and friendly walk away from all athens high light but we do taxi mostly due to the neighborhood and are ok,1
1369,we loved evripides for many reasons especially for the family and lovely friendly and helpful and full of room itself was huge with the very wide opening french doors to a big balcony with beach comfortable bed and lovely linen bathroom roomy and well recommend evripides very highly,1
1370,stayed there a couple of times when i am in town polite and helpful staff clean rooms and excellent breakfast it in a really central location for those that enjoy walking around the city but also really close to metro stations that can take anywhere,1
1371,this hotel have really big rooms most of them are very big the restaurant on the top floor it is perfect and you should try it the breakfast also is very good rooms are clean and the room service is good,1
1372,stayed for nights at this cosy and warm hotel well located in the city centre close to shopping areas and the historical part of the city very nice and spacious rooms overlooking the green park pedio areos across the avenue the breakfast rich and tasty the staff always attentive to our needs and always with a big smile fantastic roof top with great view over the city of athens you think you can touch the acropolis dinner we had around the swimming pool was simply magical and service impeccable really an excellent value for money,1
1374,good location within walking distance to acropolis rooms are spacious tea coffee available as well as good bathroom amenities and quality of pillows and mattresses is not the best but breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and attentive personnel worse to go to the roof top where swimming pool with stunning view over athens is you can get free water from the bar there overall decent quality hotel,1
1375,i had a wonderful pleasant stay at radisson blu early in june arriving to the hotel by taxi arranged from the hotel since they do have any shuttle service i met a nice lobby area with discreet lighting leading to the front desk at the front desk the very polite and professional staff proceeded to the check in and i was in a clean spacious room in no time high speed internet connection let me work without any problems i also had the chance to experience the fast and polite service of the roof top restaurant staff not to mention the jaw dropping acropolis view at night an overall great radisson standard stay and a highly recommended hotel,1
1376,considering i paid additional for a business class room upgrade i disappointed by the overall quality of the room the room is desperately in need of wallpaper is coming off and shows signs of water damage the bathtub is the tile floor in the bathroom is stained the is the bed headboard is dinged up the safe box is not bolted to anything and the room door does have a inside safety lock the room is generally in poor desk agent said this is their best room which is pretty sad i would not recommend staying at this property,0
1377,an excellent hotel from all roof top pool and bar are fantastic and the panoramic view of the city can not be beat we had a good time with very helpful reception definitely will stay there next time,1
1378,great stay at the radisson as usual the hotel is located in a fantastic location about minutes walk from the acropolis as a reference point this means that taxis will be very cheap tip use uber a lot soon as we arrived at the hotel late at night exhausted we were greeted with a room upgrade which had a beautiful view of the acropolis right in front the hotel is very clean neat and breakfast was delicious and the staff was generally would absolutely recommend this hotel great value for money,1
1379,the location is as close to the city center as some would like but we are walkers and did mind we were given an accessible room for some reason so the bathroom ended up soaking wet after each shower beds were comfortable breakfast was fantastic wifi was excellent the fitness room looked although we did have time to use it the rooftop restaurant has wonderful views of the city and was a relaxing spot to enjoy a drink,1
1380,everything was fantastic a staff always with a big smile and everyone was there to help you congratulations to the manager the restaurant was stunning good quality of food was served in combination with the amazing view of acropolis highly recommended,1
1381,nice hotel close to the city center about min by taxi euro only to syntagma polite helpfull profesionall and smilling very cozy nice decorated also breakfast room very nice decorated breakfast is fantastic with a big variety of hot and cold choices and with a superfood room facing the green park pedio tou areos need renovation immediately was the only top pool very nice i loved it especially the kids with amazing views of acropolis and really enjoyed our stay at radisson blu park,1
1382,stay two nights in this central athens hotel the staff are friendly and very helpful the hotel is kept clean our stay included the breakfast buffet great food with good selection i am told if not included this is a head not it is worth that amount,1
1383,the motel is unique in many ways service was top notch little pricey including the roof top bar pool was refreshing on a hot day rooms could use a little work but beds were comfortable with extra pillows i would look around before staying here again but we were happy with our stay the breakfast was excellent and many fresh choices,1
1384,very nice hotel at the city center with a unique environment at the lobby and great rooms with park view there is a pool restaurant with great food and acropolis view and very friendly staff i would definitely return there,1
1385,arrived after midnight with my family and they welcomed us with a big hotel rooms are clean and tidy with a lot of breakfast with a huge variety and tasteful dinner on the floor with great acropolis view the personnel were very helpful professional and congrats to the managers are coming back next year,1
1386,want to spend some time seeing the sites in athens check this place out we like to stay at the higher end hotels this really fits the bill we stayed here before checked out a few other spots this time and decided this was the best hotel for us it a min walk to the metro which takes you to the key sites in min the gym is a serious gym for those that exercise get breakfast included it wonderful good selection the room and washroom are getting a little tired but generally very highly recommend this hotel,1
1387,good location great breakfast nice pool very competent staff decor a bit dated and tired but the rooms were very clean good bathroom quiet and peaceful sleeping nice pool and restaurant the only criticism was the very ordinary food from room service,1
1388,we stayed at this hotel nights the room was very clean and has a beautiful design the staff was helpful and friendly they always ask if u need anything the view from the rooftop was would definitely stay here again,1
1389,we stayed here for a night our room was massive with great views out the huge windows bed was so comfy and shower was brilliant we stayed in a such a great location though we went out for a wonder round and found ourselves surrounded by armed riot police and masked men protesting about an anti government protest we was so scared unfortunatly it rained when we was there so didnt get to go in the pool but we went to look at it and the view from up there was breathtaking breakfast was included it was very nice lots of quality food and a great variety loved the freshly squeezed orange juice,1
1390,we had a great short stay in athens we really enjoyed our stay at radisson blu park hotel athens great location very close to city center walking distance from the archeological museum and victoria metro stationwe had a room with balcony with amazing view to acropolis fantastic roof top with panorama view to athens we had very nice snacks and cocktails at the deck the morning we enjoyed the swimming staff is very friedly and helpful i strongly suggest for a short sray in athens,1
1391,i have visited radisson blu park several times and i have always had an excellent experience clean hotel in the centre of the city close to public means of transport polite professionals very nice decoration also well organized events i recommend it,1
1392,we really loved the view excellent breakfast the personnel was super helpful and polite the hotel has an excellent location and you can walk the distance to reach public transportation we had an overall fantastic stay,1
1393,excellent hotel was very clean all staff very polite and smiling direct service we will visit again the food and the pool bar is incredibly sure worth visiting even without having to located in the center of athens with easy access to subway train station so you can easily move,1
1396,my daughter and i spent days in athens the hotel is wonderfully situated in the makrigianni district behind the acropolis the room was spacious with a balcony and air conditioning which was a must due to the heatwave of up to degrees it stayed at the whole visit the breakfast was delicious with many choices and lots of fresh fruit the staff was incredibly helpful checking on church times and suggesting a nearby taverno for dinner the most remarkable experience of all was the staff member who contacted our taxi driver after we had left for the airport i had lost my camera and i felt it had dropped in the taxi the driver returned the camera to my hotel and they mailed it overnight to my next location on the island of corfu incredible in a city of million people kudos to the taxi driver and the hotel staff,1
1397,the hotel offers really good value for money clean and modern with an amazing rooftop with acropolis view our dinner was i felt the breakfast room felt like a cafeteria at a hospital the breakfast was ok but not great the location is ok its in a bit of a dodgy area but walking distance to major sights,1
1398,i stayed here years ago and was impressed then by the style and atmosphere of this hotel located in the market district means you are away from the tourist hoardes but still close to restaurants and everything nice stylish rooms and the pool deck is wonderful for a hot afternoon or sunset drinks,1
1399,this hotel is supposed to be a star hotel but i would give it more than stars it owned by spg but it worse than any spg hotel i have ever stayed at the location is close to the acropolis and its centrally located but the area is filled with homeless drunk people and you would feel safe walking at night couple of the staff were nice and friendly but some were not the rooms were really small and there was no space for suitcases we made a mistake of booking this hotel before going to the islands and after coming back i would go back to athens again but if i were to go back i would stay at this hotel again,0
1400,we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel the room was clean and comfortable the breakfast had a good variety the staff were extremely helpful and friendly they recommended us the best places to visit in athens some amazing restaurants they ensured we are all comfortable and nothing is missing very nice,1
1401,my husband and i loved this hotel it modern and attractive with a bar and swimming pool on the roof our room was a good size and the service was excellent we had to leave early in the morning to catch a ferry and at checkout without our having requested it we were handed a breakfast to go nothing fancy just a sandwich and an apple but a thoughtful touch as for the neighborhood it certainly is a fancy one but we always felt safe at night and during the day there are some really great discount stores i bought a pair of italian leather sandals for e it just a fifteen or twenty minute walk in one direction to the plaka and the acropolis and the same in the other direction to the national archeology museum i highly recommend it,1
1402,location is good about a min walk to plaka which would been fine had it not been degrees the checkin was easy and helpful my room was big clean and simple but nice due to the weather we were almost bound to the hotel proved to be fine we sat by the pool with views to the acropolis and the meals at the rooftop bar were devine my fav was the meatballs has a gym which was a good size my only let down was the kids on my floor making a racket every morning afternoon and hotel at a good price,1
1403,amazing experience excellent service very clean modern decoration so romantic the breakfast had many options the terrace offered the most amazing view i would definitely recommend it the only problem is that its a little far from the city centre but you can take the metro or a taxi and you get there in mins,1
1405,loved everything about this hotel modern clean room nice breakfast buffet friendly staff the main attraction for me though was the rooftop area where i spent most of my time in athens it has a view of the acropolis a small pool with some sunloungers bar and restaurant perfect for just spending the day in the sun or to refresh before or after sightseeing in town everything we had to eat or drink there was nice and not too pricey as for the area around the hotel yes it looks a little dodgy however the only area i think one should really avoid at night is the omonia square a few blocks to the north other than a few offers to buy certain substances i did experience anything out of the ordinary in the immediate area around the hotel,1
1406,stayed due to conference business very nice staff nice bar and perfect reception the place is cozy clean and in a good location for sightseeing would go back although there are as well many nice places around,1
1407,i stayed at fresh hotel for five nights in fresh and clean everything looked new including the bathrooms rooms were made every day breakfast perfect good quality food i could hardly have asked for more but why do they boil the bacon nice nice and helpful top i loved it it was almost degrees during our stay in athens so we spent daytime by the pool on the roof top usually no problem finding a sunbed if you go up before a bit expensive but if you want to save money you could easily find cheap gyros m from the hotel for less than immediate area around the hotel looks a bit run down but hotel and location is great with just minute walk to monastiraki metro station my friends were also very happy we chose this will stay at this hotel next time i visit athens,1
1408,my family and i stayed at this hotel for a few days while visiting the archeological sites this hotel is close to proximity to many sites and has a great view of the acropolis from the roof top the area of the city is so so but we felt perfectly safe i would not get the rooms with the balcony our view was of worn out buildings and there were no seats to even sit out there save your money and get the basic room the hotel serves a wonderful breakfast and they are very accommodating to your needs beware though at checkout the clerk told us we save money if we used our card to convert to us dollar instead there was a fee over all it is a very nice hotel and the price is very reasonable,1
1409,we stayed here nights and definitely enjoyed our stay small cozy hotel with very friendly and helpful staff our room was modern comfortable and efficient breakfast buffet was awesome we walked to all the historic sites shopping and plenty of great dining within minutes walk will stay there again,1
1410,walking distance to the agora hadrian library ermou street monastikari and the clean subway bringing you in less than minutes to the entrance of the acropolis some of the streets immediately around the hotel are less attractive but as it goes with all large cities athens appearance can change in a metres walk very friendly reception well throughout the building rather expensive and when we visited busy rooftop bar with a small but refreshing pool and a nice view of the acropolis breakfast was top very good beds all very clean recommended,1
1411,the fresh hotel was a good hotel to stay very clean and friendly the only thing we found very expensive was the restaurant on the roof top these prices were way more expensive than your local restaurants in the area and at the plaka bit of a shame really with such a good spot on the area is a bit run down but safe and easy walking distance to the square for min walk to plaka easy walking,1
1412,rooms are modern clean and have balconies excellent value for athens staff is very helpful and friendly they have a outstanding roof top pool restaurant and bar area that you can escape the afternoon heat of athens while sipping on a nice glass of wine ice cold draft of mythos or cocktail of choice breakfast included on our room rate was top notch and a full buffet fresh hotel is located about block off of athena main drag to the plaka district making many sites accessible by foot the central market is about blocks away plaka is about a block walk lots of restaurants and shops in the area and more as you approach the plaka for the rate quality and freshness of this hotel makes it a great place to stay while taking in the sites and flavors of athens,1
1413,room was clean breakfast was good but were design would need an update i think if they want to be design hotel they need to to changes to the rooms really liked the rooftop with the view to the city and acropolis,1
1414,we enjoyed our stay at the hotel the rooms were well air conditioned it was over degrees outside and the hotel staff was friendly the room itself was clean and adequate though not large the hotel is a walking distance to most sites and attraction to minute walk everywhere although during the very hot summer months it can be a tough walk the bus is very close by though the only disappointment i had was that the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was quite ugly where many walls and stores were covered with ugly graffiti,1
1415,design excellence perfect stop over on the way to the greek islands traveling with friends requested a room change which was granted immediately due to the room being twin singles instead of king bed front desk really helpfull stunning roof top pool lounge lovely room comfortable bed excellent breakfast if you are into design hotels with great customer service quiet rooms look no further excellent value will definitely return,1
1416,this hotel is great he is perfectly located the bed is extra comfortable the room is quiet the bathroom is renovated everything is very clean the was very fast the staff is very concerned about our montreal canada,1
1417,very nice hotel large rooms great terrace at the top friendly staff i would recommend large variety for breakfast ideal to take a drink at the roof bar with view of akropolis ideally located for sightseeing everything can be done by walking,1
1418,this hotel is a great base from where all the main tourist attractions are within walking distance and located down a quite side street next to the city main food market a must visit the rooms are comfortable but those facing the front of the hotel are nicer brighter and seemed to be larger than those facing the inner courtyard which were quite dark and smaller we had an inner room but to be honest one does not plan to spend much time in a hotel room when visiting athens the public areas are lovely and the roof terrace has wonderful views over the city and is very chilled and relaxed the staff were always friendly and helpful the breakfast was exactly what to expect of a hotel of this standard fresh juice good coffee and a good food selection i would stay at this hotel again,1
1419,this is a very modern hotel with a lot of accommodation and services best features location walking distance from many major attractions acropole for instance and shopping service people over there just want to make your stay memorable they are proactively looking to help you in any manner finally the restaurant offers a breathtaking view of the acropole gorgious when illuminated during evening time with a glass of local fresh white wine nothing can beats that,1
1420,i highly recommend the fresh hotel the location is excellent the breakfast is outstanding the rooms were clean and comfortable the staff are very helpful be sure to check out the rooftop restaurant and bar excellent food and the view we stayed for three nights,1
1421,since my arrival at the hotel until my departure i had problems in this terrible place the receptionist who did my chek in was extremely cold rude and unfriendly he said that there was duplicity of reservation and that it was for me to choose which one i would use surprised i said that i had not made two reservations and that i would only use the one i had made from i asked him to cancel the other reservation which was in duplicity without thinking he said it would not be possible i found it absurd because i had made no other reservation i asked to speak to the manager and he did not want to talk to me the manager asked the receptionist to tell me that he could not do anything and that i would be charged for two rooms even using only one what i found this attitude of a hotel manager extremely reckless he definitely has no profile to be a manager what arrogance and lack of common sense due to my fatigue of the trip i decided to go to my room and then i would solve this when i got to my room it was another disappointment the room was super small hard bed unventilated bathroom broken light fixture and the worst i had paid for a room overlooking acropolis and the only thing i saw was the work of the neighboring front building i ended up i decided to staying just one,0
1422,we stayed four nights at fresh hotel and loved the location which was close enough to everything but out of the heart of the tourist zone which we loved we felt totally safe on the streets even late at night because everything happens after in athens the breakfast was excellent with a huge selection including fresh squeezed orange juice we enjoyed the rooftop deck and ate at the restaurant for sunset one night and had cocktails and snacks several times in the lounge area where the food and drinks were fine but not memorable service was slow our room was very simple leaning towards basic rather than starck minimalist thank you to the reception staff who contacted me several days after we had left to let me know that we may have left something in the room i was able to claim it and pick it up before we left greece and had even realized that i had lost it we would definitely stay here again,1
1423,wife and i stayed here on the back end of our athens trip and we loved it the staff was friendly and helpful and the room was nice and clean killer views from the roof pool and bar and the bar is a nice place to sip a few the bartender made a new drink for me called a sweet summer and it was boozey watermelon delicious kid and family friendly place so just keep that in mind also had some bar snacks and they were tasty would definitely stay again,1
1424,after much thought my daughter and i decided to meet in athens greece for our first european vacation my daughter lives in south korea and i live in new jersey we thought it would be the perfect vacation we planned it for months and decided after much investigation to stay in the melia in athens greece our flight transfers and all of our plans went perfectly except for our choice of hotel there were many issues with this hotel the internet did not work well the room was not very clean the shower was moldy the blow dryer did work and when it was replaced we could use it in the bathroom we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it but that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced an electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet that what the management at the hotel said this worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open he said he had to check something n the basement this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by for more than five minutes i happened to return to the room to find that situation when i went to the management at the hotel they tried to tell me that the room was unattended when clearly it was the man who left,0
1425,the hotel is well linked with metro the service level is comply with the stars while the menu of the sky loung restaurant could be improved the panorama on the acropoli is amazing even if the area is not so attractive i will come back for sure,1
1426,the pros it is inexpensive and connected to the metro the rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are nice the service was great at the pool and upon check in and check out the desk clerks were helpful we had a hour flight and the room was ready when we arrived so we could rest for a little while the cons the neighborhood is not great the is horrible so plan for that the air conditioning was not great and it was very hot the pool is fantastic but there are not enough lounge chairs and they close at pm which was disappointing this hotel is good enough for a day or two at the most,1
1429,the only downside to this wonderful hotel was location the surrounding buildings were full of spray paint graffiti but once you step inside that was easily forgotten and at no time did we feel unsafe despite the appearance of the area no vagrants parking is also at a minimum but a nearby parking garage is available with a discount public transportation was near view of the parthenon from the was beautiful,1
1430,bad location the pool close at the area is dead about that time the check in tooks us too long our boys were adked to sign the check in document the receipients were unfriendly the rooms are good,0
1431,the highlight of the melia is the rooftop swimming pool restaurant we ate dinner there overlooking the acropolis and went swimming the next morning as room was very well appointed and comfortable the air conditioning unit made some very loud noises in the middle of the night but we were given a fan to keep cool,1
1432,a few times earlier we have stayed at the melia hotel in barcelona and wanted to try melia in athens i think athens gives better value than melia in barca i must praise the welcome from alexandros what a wonderful man he made us feel special wonderfully welcome the rest of the reception staff are great thanks at the same time the service is lousy from the cool guys in the sky bar unfortunately the rating needs to be a little bit down sorry alexandros you were amazing the hotel is a bit tired but the rooms work well with all the amenities i have a feeling you get decent value for money with breakfast included but the internet is so bad that it surprise me in but the food in sky bar you have to steer away sad quality but the drinks are incredibly good even though they cost euros same price as in norway so for us this is natural but the view of the acropolis from the sky bar is worth the entire stay if you get a good price i would recommend this hotel although bad internet lousy food in the sky bar poor service from the bar because the vibe is quite ok and the location is perfect i wonder of how little it is for this hotel to be really good thanks anyway,1
1433,stayed here with our family of for nights we needed rooms and the melia was able to provide connecting rooms for us which was a comfort as we did want our children on their own the staff was very friendly service at the café was slow but the food was good the pool area is small but lovely and very welcome after a hot day of touring pool is only open from so you have to time it properly rooms were a good size for europe and very clean not quite north american standards but definitely a solid i would absolutely stay at this hotel again recommendation if you are touring athens such as the acropolis there is a red tour bus stop by the melia if you buy tickets for the day you can take the bus directly to the tourist attractions and save yourself the cab fare if you want to go back out in the evening you could take the bus again and get off near the plaka for dinner room connects to or and you must book supreme room category or higher to be given an adjoining connecting room ask at that the porter unlock the adjoining doors to save time later,1
1434,stayed for one night and enjoyed hotel lovely staff and room great rooftop pool and bar with view across athens towards acropolis close to metro stop although we strolled to centre in late afternoon immediate area looks gritty but typical of busy working area of metropolis we felt safe walking nearby not unlike union square delaney in nyc took taxi to hotel after evening out inexpensive about euro from outdoor cinema nearacropolis,1
1435,good hotel close to acropolis miles with gym roof top pool that closes at pm which is a shame as in the summer months you would like the pool to be open until pm felt like we just came in to the pool and were kindly hurried out to be set up for roof top spread in breakfast charges you up for sightseeing rooms come with jacuzzi which is a bonus after a long hard hot day a slight niggle was that the pillows were too big and can cause neck pain i found two smaller pillows in the wardrobe there were no kettle provided for hope they look into sorting out these two issues towels were changed everyday and good quality of toiletries overall good experience and stay,1
1436,beautiful hotel very pleasant staff which were very helpful when asked for anything they have a cafe adjoining the hotel which is very convenient but also quite expensive roof top bar where swimming pool located is set overlooking picturesque athens a must for at least one of your evening not the cheapest place to stay or the nearest to athens city centre but you wont be disappointed if you do stay there,1
1437,first time to athens and chose melia athens omonia as my base and shuttle to santorini mykonos zakynthos and choice as even though the area is old part of athens omonia was first public square in athens but accessible was key with metro only blocks down from there everywhere was just so convenient with all the sights and things to was super friendly and professional in check in to luggage directions and arranging transport,1
1438,we stayed here for nights prior to flying onto crete for a further week our room was nicely proportioned for a city hotel and the bathroom was really good walk in shower spa bath for and plenty of had breakfast only once as a discount was offered when we checked in and it was fine although the service was not great and i had to go and look for someone to request crowning glory is their roof top bar and restaurant although we did not eat here we did have a couple of drinks whilst admiring the view of the lit up had read reviews prior to arriving that the hotel was not very central however we did not find this to be true it is a couple of minutes walk from hop on hop off bus stops minutes from the archaeological museum and about minutes from the monastiraki square and flea market hercules library and the ancient agora,1
1439,we stayed at other melias and were quite happy so we booked this hotel this turned out to be a mistake to start off with we found the people at the reception to be quite rude and unhelpful this became a rather common theme in athens a bit surprising for a country that depends on tourism this is not a casual observation as one of our children got quite sick and yet the staff was not particularly helpful this was also the case with trying to arrange tours that said i should point out the concierge called yannis who was the only person on the staff the location is in a seedy neighborhood though convenient to get to both the acropolis as well as the national archaeological museum the rooms themselves were fine too still if you have other alternatives take them,0
1441,we stayed at melia athens for night before flying out the next morning right from check in we were made to feel comfortable and welcomed the hotel was immaculate and very luxurious we were upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi the beds were extremely comfortable the curtains were completely its the small things the shower head had great water pressure and the shower base did leak even in the slightest the rooftop pool and bar were very cool and to top it all off breakfast was amazing,1
1443,great hotel in the heart of athens we could see the parliament building from our balcony hotel was very clean there is a bar on the ground floor that serves food and drink breakfast is served on the first floor there is no formal restaurant all the staff were lovely we were allowed to use facilities at the sister hotel round the corner,1
1444,very nice star hotel along shopping street ermoj my single room was small but had a good bed i was so glad when i discovered that i am allowed to use swimming pools of sister hotels great advantage in terrible hot weather degrees also breakfast was really good lots of variety,1
1445,it was our third time in athens and we needed two nights hotel our flight arrived late night and we had a ferry in the next day becasue we wanted to spend the only day in athens in shopping we searched for hotel near ermou street this hotel is right at the beginning of the street near syntagma square so for our purpose the location was great the hotel is good nothing bad to right about it although we order a room with a baby cot and when we arrived the room was without baby cot maybe a mistake that not connected to the hotel we ordered from the staff arrange the missing bad very quickly i think it good value for money stayed in diffrent vactions at two other hotels new hotel and electra palace hotel and if your budget can allow you consider them insteded,1
1446,the hotel is aged and lacking funds as is athens and greece however the staff and location make it a wonderful base to see and shop walk towards the acropolis and you find an intoxicating mix of rooftop food wine and views to build upon the days adventures,1
1447,i have stayed at this hotel for nights i booked a room for single the room was unexpected you can not imagine how small it is with no view the breakfast was under the average limited swimming pool gym located in different hotel so if you wish to use them you to poor wifithe best thing hotel at the centre exactly is the shopping district so everything is walkable no need to take transportationalso metro close to the hotel about mins to reach,1
1448,i stayed at the hotel earlier this month as it was in a great location for visiting athens it is very close to the train station at syntagma square i realised on train back to the airport that i had left my ring somewhere in the room i rang the hotel and the receptionist christina said she would have house keeping check she called me back within minutes to say they had found it under the bed they obviously had to have a good look since i was sure where in the room it could have been the hotel arranged to have the ring shipped to me providing me with a couple of options on how i wanted it sent i chose tracked postal option the ring arrived safely in dublin yesterday thank you electra hotel,1
1449,the electra hotel was a well priced and comfortable stay in athens the food was very good as well breakfast was included with the room close to many of the sights in athens the service was really great with the staff taking care of every request we had to top it off the use of any of the services offered at the other electra hotels was available to us,1
1450,we stayed one night here mainly for proximity to syntagma square and the metro to the airport the location is indeed excellent we were pleasantly surprised by the room quality everything is very good but was let down a little by noise from buskers and even passers by on the busy and even more disconcertingly from neighbouring rooms if they could deal with that this place would get a particularly for value for money,1
1451,i a picky sydney sider on a budget and was very impressed by the service view and location of this hotel beautiful and friendly staff beautiful view from our room and rooftop pool delicious and wide variety buffet breakfast,1
1452,we visited for days perfect location across from beach roof top pool and restaurant stunning view friendly staff and delicious breakfast air conditioned rooms made it so comfortable must stay,1
1455,we stayed at the hotel for nights two weeks ago the hotel is very nice the public areas are well maintained and the staff is very helpful breakfast was very good the room was nice and clean but the bathroom was not very clean and needs some improvements i have to say that we did complain i guess that if we did talk to someonethey would have done something about hotel is not really in the city center if you are a tourist to get to the main attractions you need a taxi or a train,1
1457,can highly recommend this hotel for the business person or tourist well appointed with stunning rooftop pool and bar location staff super friendly and helpful excellent taxis always available outside would definitely stay here again,1
1459,we are currently staying at this it is a very nice property and we are on the club internet is pretty stable but the staff here at the hotel are friendly and helpful with good skills which helps with global travelers we are staying on the club level which includes snacks and drinks throughout the day in addition to private lounge computers etc definitely the way to go if staying well worth the extra money they have a good morning breakfast buffet on the floor rooftop restaurant by the pool the only major drawback to this hotel is its a bit distant from the typical tourist locations that we wanted to visit while in athens we made good use of the local transit system though leveraging trains taxis and buses with the locals,1
1461,what a great hotel central for everything and great views from the roof top bar very friendly and helpful staff its easy if you going to the airport come out of monastiraki square metro station and turn left up athinas street and the hotel is mins walk on the left breakfast was good then it was easy getting the metro for the airport home,1
1462,spent nights in athens after our mediterranean cruise at this centrally located hotel two blocks from monastiraki square a metro station the plaka district and within walking distance to many sites even though the area was depressed with almost every building front covered in graffiti and many homeless or those seeking money for trinkets the view of the acropolis from the hotel the convenient location and the friendly and hospitable staff made the stay worth while while i was concerned about pick pockets i never felt unsafe our room was basic but clean and had great ac which was needed after a long day in the heat sitting out on the balcony at night looking at the lit up acropolis was magical there are plenty of shops and eateries around the area so we did not utilized the breakfast option i would recommend this hotel,1
1463,great location min walk from metro that goes straight to the airport close to just about everything and in a perfect spot for cheeky wee bars and eateries room facing street was still quiet spacious for a city room with nice bathroom good quiet aircon it was outside staff were delightful and full of helpful bar with acropolis view was awesome didnt do breakfast but heard it was recommended,1
1464,did a nighter here before heading out to the islands arrived really late aound so basically headed off to sleep the hotel is super central and you can walk to plaka and the all sights if you need clean and had a really good nights sleep good price very polite reception,1
1465,if you are looking for a clean safe modern charming and hotel in athens this is it i come for business and vacation and have stayed here over times the breakfast is excellent the staff of amazing and the location is highly recommend it,1
1466,we booked a room and try to cancel due to medical situation they asked us to provide medical papers which we had and still they wont cancel the charge expedia could get to reply why wrong attitude bad experience i do not recommend to book a room at the new hotel,0
1467,we booked a room and try to cancel due to medical situation they asked us to provide with medical papers which we had and still they wo cancel the charge expedia could get the managers to reply why wrong attitude bad experience i do not recommend to book here,0
1468,very nice small boutique hotel in athens close to everything very good service from the staff who made us feel very welcome some good tavernas just around the corner great location for shopping and sightseeing,1
1469,we got to this hotel very late and were exhausted we were greeted at this hotel by a very friendly reception water and snacks the hotel is very clean and had the best shower of the entire trip it is also located in a great location close to all tourist sites,1
1470,we stayed at the o b athens boutique hotel for nights while seeing the main sights of the city everything is walkable from the hotel and the furthest sight panathalenic stadium was maybe miles the front desk is fantastic and helped us set up taxis to pick us up from the airport and also drop us off for an early morning flight they even packed us a breakfast on the morning we left as we were up before the breakfast buffet opened the was incredible and we slept great we highly recommend this hotel and stay here again if in athens,1
1471,lovely hotel clean and nice rooms the staff was really helpful went the extra mile to check us in early also helped arrange airport pickup and drop off the street is a little run down and the rooms do have much of a view but that generally how downtown athens looks like these days it was safe and writhing walking distance to everything interesting that we wanted to see i recommend this place highly,1
1472,a very cosy nice hotel breakfast nice and satisfying you can sort get to may of the key sites in athens from this hotel the staff were helpful especially helping with how to get around around town and excellent recommendation on local restaurants,1
1473,stayed there for night and it was is well located service is friendly and smooth we parked a car nearly right in views from the suite are wonderful kifissia is a busy and lively place to get recommended,1
1474,thrilled to find this gem in an athens tree lined neighborhood it was located near great shopping lounges and cafes it cost only euros to catch a cab to the town center to see the acropolis most importantly the rooms were very comfortable and clean customer service was wonderful and the staff even prepared breakfast for my family for a am departure they went above and beyond,1
1475,great location close to the major sights and on the edge of the plaka district with its vibrant studio balcony room was very pleasing as regards the interior design high quality standard of fixtures and fittings super rainshower and a very comfortable bed being in the heart of athens you can expect some street noise as we experienced with garbage trucks at night however it was short rooftop bar is pleasant for a drink or two whilst viewing the skyline and breakfast has a good variety of choices as regards constructive feedback i would ask that reception are trained to be more welcoming and friendly the nicest and most helpful staff members seemed to be those at the door and the junior staff working at the rooftop otherwise the overwhelming impression was rather standoffish and arrogant not what one expects or should accept as a guest,1
1477,beautiful and modern rooms within walking distance of the acropolis monasteraki and plaka katerina the gm she speaks perfect english was sweet knowledgeable and extremely accommodating in everything we needed if you are accustomed to luxury convenience this is a terrific little hotel,1
1478,it was just a one very hot day and we were lucky to have a room from this excellent hotel in this case it was paradise for us the staff was very friendly the apartment just perfect and luxurious we were in suite and it was spacious and cool the breakfast was good and the location perfect highly recommend,1
1479,situated in the heart of athens you close to all that you need the parthenon is a convenient minute walk and the parliamentary building is a short minute walk parks and other points of interest are also close by the room was well appointed and had a nice kitchenette area we stayed in this room with four people and found it to be comfortable but would be perfect for two looks as though the hotel is new there are many great dining and bar options all within the immediate vicinity no need to travel if you want to stay local lots of shopping can be done close by as well would stay here again if we come back to athens,1
1480,we are very picky travelers and prior to our arrival to athens we were very worry about staying at this hotel since it is not the peninsula or mandarin oriental or four seasons but we really wanted to go to athens and we booked the hotel late and did not have many choices we are so impressed by the outstanding service cleanness and comfort of this hotel great location i definitely will come back to athens and to this hotel,1
1481,as a family of we stayed in a bedroom bathroom apartment at this small hotel and we were thrilled with our stay what a great little hotel perfect location excellent helpful staff beautifully appointed rooms faultlessly clean great bathrooms well equipped modern cool and comfortable can not rave about this hotel enough you can walk everywhere from this location yet it is quiet small balcony breakfast hamper with local products served in our room each morning and a welcome drink on our arrival it really is fabulous and i would recommend it to anyone thank you for a wonderful stay,1
1482,best location attentive and warm service we ad to leave very early to the airport so our kids got very nice breakfast boxes for the way small and personal atmosphere beautiful stylish very large equipped rooms excellent and very recommended hotel if you are in athens,1
1483,we stayed at for nights at the beginning of june we were two adults two teenagers and an infant we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the hotel is very modern with all the amenities that you need we were in a bedroom unit and had more than enough room for our family it is also well located about minutes walk from syntagma square it is easy to get to from the airport by metro but most important is that we were able to walk to all the major sites in athens we were also close to the shops of plaka and were surrounded by restaurants and places to spelling at the front desk was very helpful he helped us arrange restaurant reservations transportation and gave great advice on touring and visiting athens we were served a wonderful breakfast every morning in our room we would definitely stay there again when we return to athens,1
1484,we had a wonderful stay at this modern and clean hotel after disembarking after a two week med cruise this was a very nice quiet modern place staff were very accommodating and welcomed us from the start i would definitely recommend this hotel and will visit again front staff learned of our very early departure to the airport and went out of their way to prepare us both a breakfast box for the trip to the airport,1
1485,had a cancelled flight and wanted to find a hotel in athens to see the acropolis great find at innathens they were so accommodating and helpful also there a wine bar right next door wonderful way to end to a hectic travel day they even packed us a nice breakfast for our early flight out the next morning great service,1
1486,we were persons and stayed for nights we had rather small but very nice and quite luxury rooms all rooms with balcony nice and clean all over the staff were very helpful and supported in taxi and restaurant bookings etc very nice breakfast with a number of small delicious courses all included the location in perfect if you want to stay in the center of athens in walking distance to all the famous attractions we can highly recommend this hotel the well qualified and polite staff,1
1487,great location right off syntagma square within walking distance to bus and metro and many attractions the staff was friendly and personable especially appreciated leonidis and vasiliki at the front desk very helpful with bus and public transportation information always a friendly and personable greeting very adequate buffet breakfast every morning rooms are clean beds comfortable always clean towels the first impression of the room is that it is sparse looking like a college dorm room after getting over that first impression room was very adequate for our needs as visitors in athens enjoyed the hotel courtyard for food beverage and relaxation not a super luxury hotel but for the price a good value and very comfortable location we would stay here again when visiting athens the staff here is great,1
1488,the staff where really friendly and helpful felt like personalised service really comfortable bed and great bathroom they where good enough to help me with a late check out also great location i recommend it,1
1489,we loved this hotel for our stopover in athens excellent service room very modern with a wonderful bed to come in to each nite very nice wine bar for a nightcap would definitely stay again wry convenient to many things that you can walk to,1
1490,we travelled as a family of teenage daughters and booked a family suite for one night as we were in transit we were greeted by name at the front desk without presenting ourselves and this level of service continued throughout our stay the family room was very modern and spacious note that the wall and door separating the bathroom from the bedroom was a smoked glass this made our teenage daughters uncomfortable when using the bathroom the breakfast was great and the location was adequately close to the plaka,1
1491,the hotel is an oasis in busy athens with it beautiful courtyard the front desk are so helpful and truly try to accommodate your stay that what i call good service the rooms are simple yet spacious and the beds are very comfortable breakfast was quaint and delicious the hotel is in a perfect location to explore by foot syntagma square plaka monastiraki and the acropolis the only thing i found strange yet modern was the translucent dark brown doors for the bathroom and shower,1
1492,innathens was a great little centrally located hotel in athens the rooms were large well appointed and contained everything for a comfortable stay most importantly air conditioning for those hot days in athens a traditional european breakfast was also available and could be eaten in a wonderful little courtyard what made our stay however were the staff at the hotel we were greeted warmly upon arrival despite the fact that we were several hours early they were able to have a room made up so we could check in and start exploring the city the staff went out of their way to be helpful and to ensure that you were comfortable they provided directions to a wonderful traditional greek restaurant arranged for a taxi for our early morning departure and even provided a takeaway breakfast,1
1494,this is a sweet small hotel just out of the chaos of the plaka and in a convenient location near syntagma square you can walk virtually anywhere you want to go as a visitor or take a quick taxi or metro ride the hotel is off the street through an open air restaurant and around a lovely courtyard it is elegantly designed and just the right size to feel homey without feeling stuffy the staff are very helpful leonidis helped me with many different arrangements and questions breakfast is quite good and you can order additional items off a small menu the rooms are well designed modern and spotless i stayed here twice and definitely preferred my room on an upper floor with a balcony to the larger room that was somewhat subterranean i stayed in the family room subterranean room first and might not have returned if i did already have a booking however after my second stay i would happily return what it might lack in big ticket amenities a pool for instance it makes up for with attention to detail charm and quality,1
1495,this hotel is ideally situated for the metro restaurants and sights our room was slightly cell like as we were only there for night it did not matter and we did feel this was an hotel where style won over substance at times the shower was a very good example of that however the location and the cost mean that all of that can be excused breakfast was also very good and we would certainly consider it again when we return to athens,1
1496,i stayed here with my family for nights and i have nothing but good things to say the staff is wonderful and they do anything they can to meet your requests leonidas started helping even before my trip when he answered all my emails he arranged to have our luggage stored while we took a short trip to the islands thank you leonidas the rooms are very clean and modern the hotel is closed to all the main sites mins to placa mins to monasterati mis to the acropolis the olympic stadium and much more worth every penny,1
1497,this is an amazing boutique hotel located within a min walk to the acropolis min to plaka and to the syntagma metro station we were pleasantly surprised to have received complimentary breakfasts on our arrival leonidas was extremely friendly and helpful to us we booked a family room which was extremely spacious there was sufficient room for suitcases and the two adults and a and of us the bathroom was very clean with a big shower the breakfast was very good with a wide selection of cereals pastries cold meats cheese etc the complimentary nespresso in the room was a welcome treat although our room was close to the breakfast area we did not hear any noise will certainly go back to this hotel,1
1498,we were very lucky to find a place in this hotel it just perfect excellent location extremely comfortable rooms very kind team and a remarkable breakfast my family and me had a great time here and we would stay longer if we could,1
1499,we had the usual issues of arriving early and not being able to get into room the young women welcoming and professional called housekeeping and relayed to me that room was vacant but had to be cleaned should be ready in an hour only concern is that they kept telling me to come back hour after hour for hours the front desk lady was apologetic and i told her it is her fault she was relaying the message that her housekeeping gave her but may be someone should tell housekeeping to do a better job of assessing how quickly their teams can clean a room rooms have high ceilings good size but probably need a refresh i would stay her again for reasons first the location is awesome easy to walk to everything in athens and if you want to go exploring other parts of the city the metro is across the street and second the gb restaurant on the floor we had dinner twice during our stay and the food the service warm and attentive but not hovering and the view were all spectacular,1
1500,superb spot in the centre of athens the spa and rooftop pool were great features that we used heavily during our stay imo very good value for money with everything you look for in an old world luxury hotel in a city,1
1501,this is not a star hotel the food is ok but overpriced compared to what i was getting at the local restaurants for those prices i expect more it is a nice looking hotel but just because you call it luxury collection does not mean star and then charge high rates i would not stay again at those prices,1
1502,this was our and visits to gb it a special beautiful hotel we stayed twice this trip both before and after santorini the hotel was sold out and our initial room was on the floor we asked for another room and they accommodated us with a slightly larger room on the floor windows work well keeping the noise out and it was fine in the past we have always been on higher floors and normally receive an upgrade neither of these happened during our visits i was sightly surprised but realize these benefits are based on availability the only other note was at the wonderful gb garden restaurant we are aware of the dress code our first dinner there it was degrees that day my husband went in shorts collared shirt and shoes hoping they make an exception nope he had to go back to the room and change perfectly understandable until the restaurant let in other diners in shorts i do think they were at the hotel and therefore could change but that almost makes it worse we ate there again during our visit and still saw gentlemen in shorts for the restaurant area the bar is more casual i highly recommend this hotel and restaurant but it would be great if everyone had to adhere to the dress code,1
1503,a fantastic hotel with amazing views star and well deserved a real treat and very comfortable rooms men need to have closed shoes at night gym and pools close at great position near parliament houses,1
1504,our family of stayed at this hotel for nights in two rooms in early july right at the tail end of a heat wave the front desk personnel were friendly and courteous the hotel in error had on record that i was a gold member instead of platinum upon showing my spg card status as lifetime gold with platinum status it was fixed and then we were entitled to the daily breakfast on the roof top i not sure whether it impacted my upgrade or not as the hotel was full but it was still a bit disappointing the breakfast service is amazing and the staff are very attentive and friendly the rooms are well appointed and the beds are very comfortable as platinum we had access to the spa and usage of steam rooms the location is just perfect and you have a beautiful view of the acropolis we definitely will come back,1
1505,we stayed at this hotel twice in july on our way to and back from the islands for us it a perfect combination of elegance the service was extremely friendly as we found throughout greece and attentive without being disruptive the view from the rooftop restaurant is breathtaking and i use that word carefully we did stop in our tracks when we rounded the corner and came in view of the parthenon the beds are extremely comfortable so much so that we joked about getting back to them after finishing with the islands this hotel lives up to its reputation ca wait to return,1
1506,an exceptionally elegant hotel with every imaginable amenity breakfast buffet is outstanding with something for all including traditional greek foods wonderful service ideal location for seeing all of the relevant historical sites,1
1507,easily a star grande luxe very best hotel in athensit is always an experience to stay in a truly grand hotel in any european city as we have a great tradition in europe when it comes to such elaborate full service days sometimes it is still a good experience and sometimes it is a disappointing experience but rarely is it a great experience so many grand hotel properties are in need of serious investment and so many operators are only interested in squeezing profits out and putting as little investment as possible back the financial problems suffered by greece all so well publicised i a tired grand hotel instead i have experienced a hotel that could put some of the grand hotels in london to shame this is a truly grand hotel with service to match and everything is immaculate the public areas the accomodation and the staff what a lovely part of this hotel has been fitted out with taste and in an exquisite manner with total attention to detail arrival is excellent reception is excellent the french guest relations lady could not have tried harder and the introduction from the butler was as good as it better than the butler service at the plaza central park nyc where they simply say hello and let you know they exist here they meet you at reception on arrival are very proper but not stuffy none of the team here are stuffy show you to your accomodation ensure everything is perfect,1
1508,this is my fourth stay and i think the hotel is great beautiful venue great staff etc however i am a little unhappy over how i was treated or not treated at checkin i booked thru virtuoso a jr suite i am also spg gold no upgrade this did surprise me as the hotel was full however it is my birthday so you would think they would at least acknowlege the lack of an upgrade but i would have expected to have gotten one of the best jr suites but instead got one on a low floor with zero view as gold i was offered pts or free drinks or so i thought that is what i heard but apparently just a drink for me my wife gets nothing at least they were kind enough to let me use my lunch amenity for my birthday dinner but still love the hotel,1
1509,even if you do want to stay have a drink at the rooftop bar the acropolis is in direct view oh and the greek parliament is just across the square which means you can watch the changing of the guards without having to deal with the crowds or giving up your drink,1
1510,we had a wonderful lunch on the roof of the hotel i was nervous about the dress code and made my son and husband wear long pants despite the degree temperatures i was frustrated to find upon arrival that there were all sorts of guests wearing shorts tank tops sandals etc i am fine with people dressing how ever they like for lunch but was irritated that we called and were told my husband had to wear long food and service and view were outstanding we had hoped to sit outside but the extreme heat prevented that we were able to go out on the balcony for a wonderful view i am sure dinner is even better highly recommend,1
1511,we stayed here backfire nights in may and after reading all the reviews we knew what to expect and the hotel did deliver the combination of hotel staff and location make this luxury hotel the best choice dining here was also great ca wait to go back in october,1
1512,my family and i have just spent a few days in athens staying at the grande bretagne it is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location from our room we had a view of the parthenon there is a fantastic rooftop pool with bar which was great to escape to in the afternoons after wandering the city all day i had one of the best manicures ever at the day spa i wish we could have stayed longer i would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1513,one can not choose a better or grander hotel than bretagne located in the heart of athens the hospitality and service is the epitome of class and perfection the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms grand the rooftop dining with its panoramic view of the city and the acropolis adds romance and splendor to the experience the buffet breakfast is a feast for the palate and the senses offering choices high price one pays is worth the expense,1
1514,my wife and i managed a birthday weekend without the kids which is a rare event so a lot was expected of this hotel making it a special time it did not disappoint the hotel had the grand touches to its decor that we wanted as a break from the ultra modern norm that we normally opt for the room was immaculate and finished to a nice standard the staff were incredibly polite and attentive the highlight for us was the location with views of parliament and the parthenon when dining on the balcony during day and by night with the parthenon illuminated as our backdrop it was quite something the food and wine was first rate also just one drawback i was surprised at was that wifi was charged for and not included in this day in age and given the price of the room that just criminal our stay was march,1
1515,very comfortable staff very friendly and helpful pool bar roof top pool rooftop bar and restaurant all very good winter garden good for a light lunch or the steam rooms sauna and pool in the basement very day free wifi then you pay a bit,1
1516,the hotel grande bretagne went all out in making us feel incredibly welcome to the property as the room needed an extra half hour to get ready my wife and i were entertained in the beautiful members lounge on the sixth floor our fifth floor suite eventually proved to be a veritable slice of heaven it was large and luxurious and represented the epitome of class and comfort the swimming pool on the rooftop was just as divine as last year while the health club and indoor pool on the floor also sparkled all the staff who served us and helped us were so generous helpful and refined that we simply must return someday,1
1517,make sure you also dine on gb rooftop garden restaurant with awarded chef s en magnificent view all staff in hotel exceptionally good service and especially tzina at breakfast rooms comfortable and grand will definitely return when in athens,1
1518,staying at this hotel was an amazing experience the decors are beautiful and the rooms lovely it has rooftop with a fantastic view of the acropolis we only stayed one night so we did get a chance to check out the facilities buffet breakfast was fantastic probably one of the best range and food freshness we have is also great right across the road is the parliament and the hotel rooms have great vista of athens if you are looking for a luxurious stay with the feel of exclusivity and professional service this is the hotel to choose,1
1519,perfect perfect location decor and hospitality we enjoyed a delicious lunch in the main restaurant great bread salad salmon and dessert and we were in a hurry and the staff helped to speed our lunch gold star service definitely enjoy drinks at the rooftop bar after dinner and have dinner at aleria about a minute cab ride some of the best food we have ever had,1
1520,we had such a great visit over there all the staff qas so accommodating and nice and nothing was to much trouble for them the view is breathtaking and the food there is absolutely recommend enough,1
1521,grand old style hotel very atmospheric and great service rooms are a little outdated in terms of equipment but the atmosphere makes up for it the staff are excellent the top floor restaurant has spectacular views the breakfast is excellent though pricey great location the best place to stay in athens,1
1522,we stayed here in late june it was a family trip we had two interlocking rooms it is a beautiful hotel quite pleasing to the eye the service was great and the location is great there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance or within a short taxi ride the gb roof garden restaurant with a view of the acropolis was wonderful a great dinner at that restaurant was a highlight of our trip to athens if you are looking for a five star hotel in athens i very much recommend this hotel on the less positive side the rooms were a bit tight i could have used more room and it is not a cheap hotel one pays for the high quality so make sure that it is within your price range,1
1523,a wonderful grand dame of a hotel centrally locate perfect for a quick overnight in athens so you will see everything even if you only look out your window the rooftop bar and restaurant is fantastic the downstairs bar and lounge is comfortable and reminiscent of new york plaza hotel everything is pricey for greek standards but on par or cheaper than other major capitals definitely worth a stay at least once,1
1524,beautiful hotel with superb location make time to eat a meal on the rooftop and enjoy the amazing views of athens most historic sites service was excellent and they treated us to champagne for our honeymoon,1
1525,food service cleanliness is all top shelf centrally located it is on the outskirts of plaka the parthenon and just across the street from parliament also near by the national archaeological museum which is a must see as well as the metro which is across the street,1
1526,we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel the hotel is beautiful and elegant and immaculate had it not been for our mediocre experience we would have given hgb stars after a very long flight we arrived at the hotel about hours before the official time we acknowledged that we were early but requested an early if possible we understood when they informed us that they could accommodate our request so we asked if they could notify us when our room was ready we were unapologetically told that they could not and that we would need to periodically check with the front desk to learn if the room was ready they would even give us a time estimate frustrated we decided to go sightsee instead of staying in the hotel a hotel of this caliber we feel our request was not unreasonable all we asked for was the courtesy of a phone call or text but we were denied that gesture great hotel facilities are important but even more important is great customer service in all the hotels we visited in many parts of the world this was the first time we were treated so indifferently at it colored our entire location is great and all the other hotel staff were wonderful everything else about our stay was very positive and i would still recommend this hotel highly,1
1527,one gets the feeling this hotel has existed on the same basis for quite some time the service is very good and the place generally traditional with traditional facilities for a five star hotel rooms and in particular the bathrooms are in need of a face lift and for the price paid one would expect better the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring central athens which can be done on foot the roof top restaurant has spectacular views of the acropolis and it was a pleasure to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant every morning breakfast was the only meal we had at the hotel and it was good albeit extremely crowded and therefore not remotely peaceful there is also a small rooftop pool which is lovely to visit after a day sightseeing if you are lucky enough to secure a sun lounger everyone has the same idea about a dip sundowners at this location are good and service exceptional the only additional factor to consider about this hotel is that it seems to have an arrangement with cruise ships for us tourists and we had a huge influx from one of these ships,1
1528,the grand bretagne has a beautiful feel the service was first rate from check in we arrived in the morning from the airport and our room was ready in an hour to room service and everything in between we had a lovely room on the floor the beds are comfortable and the rooms clean there is a area and concierge on the floor which is a butler floor that makes it easy to get keys make reservations etc the room had a courtyard view but was well appointed and quiet the ac was quiet as well which is nice breakfast is included and the buffet is vast and really good with lots of pastries spinach pie custards delicious breads cheeses eggs sausage and bacon the cappuccino are good and they come quickly the floor restaurant and bar has a spectacular sprawling view of the acropolis parthenon and the whole city for dinner the food is pricy and good not spectacular but very good more in a separate review overall we would definitely come back the hotel is quite large and in a convenient central location,1
1529,this place is gorgeous and has everything you would expect from a star hotel we checked in and our rooms were not yet ready they had some free refreshments in the lobby cookies and tea while waiting for our rooms we headed up to the pool bar for lunch which was amazing gyros souvlaki great greek food for our first day in greece we had connecting rooms for our family we had the kids in one and we stayed in the other our room was upgraded to a grand suite and we were greeted in the room with a fruit basket aperitif lots of free water and pastries this may have been due to my husbands platinum status the staff was falling all over themselves to be of service making sure we had everything we needed the hotel had all the amenities you would expect hair dryer toiletries etc there is also an unbelievable spa area with a gym indoor pool sauna types of steam rooms foot massage baths hair salon the rooftop pool is great with a nice view of the city bar service is available at the pool the chairs are limited but i had no problem getting one at the location can not be beat steps from the metro station and walking distance from all the athens attractions and shopping areas the breakfast is in the floor rooftop restaurant with an amazing view of the acropolis it was included for us due to status but its pricey,1
1530,yes rooftop for breakfast or a cocktail is nice yes location is great for tourist attractions pool staff was unfriendly and not helpful room maids were not so thorough in cleaning the room the room itself was small and the bathroom tiny there isnt enough counter space in there curtains did block out light room was pretty quiet worked well and bed was good front desk staff was nice concierge responsive and good nice big lobby overall good hotel a few misses away from grand,1
1531,this is an excellent luxury hotel service is wonderful beautiful accommodations great location however what makes it truly outstanding is its terrace which has the best view i seen in athens not to be missed,1
1532,this was our third stay at the grande bretagne over the years it is as good as it has ever been ther hotel is nperfectly situated on syntama square the heart of athens the parliament is just across the street with its colorful changing of the guards ceremony the acropolis the plaka the agora and other notable historic sites are within reasonable walking distance despite greece financial issues the city is and clean the hotel has two pools a gym and of course a restaurant visit the rooftop in the evening with its wonderful view of the acropolis a nice touch is their afternoon iced peach tea and cookies for the asking the rooms are not large by us standards but well sized and nicely appointed with tasteful traditional furnishings we prefer the rooms facing the courtyard away from the noise and bustle of athens,1
1533,the property is amazing the rooms are very spacious the people very friendly the view from the rooftop breathtaking the location could not have been better i suggest making reservations ahead of time for dinner with a view no question i would stay here again,1
1534,this property met all expectations for quality and service the staff was very friendly and helpful the location of this hotel was outstanding and close to everything the view of the parthenon was perfect it was easy to walk to outstanding restaurants and the quality of food at this property was great the grand bretagne hotel is worth staying at,1
1535,the grand bretagne is far and away the swankiest hotel in athens it has class and excellent service rooms are very nice and many have an unbelievable view of the acropolis is bar is super old school and classyrooftop pool is very fun with a bar and grill up top alsoand they have a second very classy nighttime bar and restaurant on the roof alsoand a cigar loungeit everything you could ask for if you want the best,1
1536,my wife and i enjoyed a short day stay in athens on our way to mykonos and santorini and were very happy with having chosen the hotel grande bretagne as our place to stay it is a wonderful luxury hotel with a classic older european vibe it is located in the heart of athens and a short distance to the acropolis and other major places to visit the room was spacious the food was very good and the service outstanding,1
1537,real luxury hotel with views of the acropolis and situated in the center the rooms are nicely furnished comfortable bed and pillows separate bath and shower no bidet in standard room plush robe and slippers decent toiletries very generous supply of towels adequate closet space modest sized desk for work could use a few more outlets for electronic gear as well as a brighter light over the desk for those who need to work tv is internet based rather slow fitness room is hours and well equipped for cardio spa closes at floor bar is good for meeting people and informal conversations buffet for breakfast is plentiful and high quality get there early for a seat on the terrace facing the acropolis for a memorable view service is excellent especially in the restaurant though to be fussy it took almost minutes for my cappuccino to arrive and out were flawless friendly and efficient,1
1538,absolutely perfect location for couple days stay prior to heading out to the islands can easily walk to sites esp landmarks plaka and acropolis acropolis tip get there before it euro uber to top of it and get tickets you can spend all day walking around and down to agora and then back to hotel fun rooftop pool and bar cigar bar was well appointed but we do not like smoke so did not have a drink the spa pool was also quieter if the rooftop was too crowded rsvp well in advance to dine at gb rooftop we were rewarded with the best table in the house room was spacious we were spg upgraded to butler level and romantic,1
1539,we stayed for two nights and found this hotel to be lovely we had drinks in the roof and in the lobby bar both were beautiful we had dinner on the roof with an amazing view of the acropolis and an amazing dinner the concierge staff were very helpful,1
1540,we only stayed one night but i wish we had stayed more this hotel is gorgeous in every way the roof top pool was busy and a bit hard to get a sun chair but that is all the complaints i have about this hotel the roof top bar and restaurant is stunning with great ambiance and views if you are looking for something special and a bit up market this is the place we had drinks downstairs in the bar area which was very old worldly with lots of charm i would recommend this place to anyone,1
1541,it is the very conveniently located to everything you are well within walking distance to the old town plaka acropolis museum which is another must visit when you are in athens arch of hadrian temple of olympian zeus etc the property is pretty big and tastefully updated it does give you a very grand feel to it the gift shops are like museum gift shop everything there please your eyes and taste buds if not your wallet the hotel has both an indoor and outdoor pool restaurants spa separate for suite with butler service the junior suite with butler service is very spacious with lots of room to move around with a king bed bed for our six year old closet and a bathroom with separate shower and bath tub double sinks and well accessorized with molten brown toiletry the suite also has a good size desk and ample room for a sitting area with a arm chair and sofa with a coffee table the only thing that i can see improving would be placing some clear pad between the glass and the coffee table and bedside tables to prevent the glass keep sliding away from the its own roof garden restaurant on the floor overlooking the acropolis parliament building amphitheater and the city hotel grande bretagne brother hotel king george hotel which is just located next door also has a roof top restaurant called tudor hall sharing the same view tudor hall has been awarded michelin star butler and,1
1542,loved this hotel for our first three nights in greece had a lovely room on the eighth floor of this classic hotel enjoyed the rooftop bar and restaurant several times and especially liked having breakfast there each morning with the amazing view of the acropolis also enjoyed the pool several times as a way to escape the heat of the afternoons would definitely recommend this hotel,1
1543,we spent our last night at the grande bretagne and despite the price it was more than worth it the hotel is on par with the best of the best the plaza in new york the ritz in paris and so on the public rooms are plush and luxurious the rooms while small meet every travelers need the staff is solicitous and polished they reached out to us several times before we even arrived to see if they could do anything for us but the absolute reason to choose this hotel is the rooftop restaurant with its mesmerizing views of the acropolis in the morning afternoon and most of all at night the hotel has a sumptuous breakfast on the grand scale of hotels of its caliber superb food terrific cocktails but oh please that view is the best ever if you can afford it hands down stay here,1
1544,location is excellent getting a premium room however is not worth it front desk and security staff are very helpful concierge unpredictable some better than others breakfast buffet so so for the price but great view of acropolis day and night restaurant staff very good housekeeping staff leaves much to be desired good hotel not exceptional,1
1545,i read many reviews and searched a lot of hotels before booking to spend nights after our visit to santorini and made sure to stay in this hotel nothing else i felt this is the best option for first timers it did not disappoint us perfect location i like the fragrance smell in the lobby they sell it in gift shop and i bought room spray and candle liked the lobby design and decor long corridors and many rights and lefts to reach our room comfy bed liked the black olives that they bring it to our room in the second housekeeping shift at night liked the rooftop restaurant good food has a dress code no shorts magnificent view to acropolis i highly recommend it for couples or first timers to athens,1
1546,the rooms were clean spacious and beautifully done with lovely toiletries and lots of towels the location could not have been better right in the middle of the city with lots of shopping and restaurants to choose from the amenities including the exercise room pool outdoor pool and bar several different scented saunas and the foot baths oh my bliss the photo above is exactly as shown this is your view at breakfast and what a feast it was something for everyone staff were friendly and approachable when you shop do just stick to the main shops there is a whole new world of shopping if you venture out of that area,1
1547,it got a great location and the view from the room is great the service was first rate the breakfasts on the roof were magical with an excellent buffet plus ordering from the menu plus that view this is a first class hotel and desires and strives to maintain its reputation would definitely recommend,1
1548,a lot has been said about this hotel so i will keep it short the definite pros are location walking distance to acropolis and all museums roof terrace with spectacular views on the city and acropolis best for a sundown reasonably large rooms with very comfortable beds and a nice classic decoration now the not so good service is just okay especially the front desk the doorman was the most helpful the rooftop restaurant is overpriced and over busy with good but far from great the comfort is slightly outdated quite noisy air con high speed wifi is not free although the basic free wifi was actually enough for our needs overall i was expecting more from this legendary hotel,1
1549,after a very long trip from the us and a brief layover at heathrow arriving in athens to the grande bretagne was a real treat the hotel lobby is lovely and the staff upon my arrival was professional and room was beautifully decorated and well appointed in every way the bathroom was large and gorgeous and included all basic amenities this hotel has the feel of world travel glamour that one might envision from a classical european hollywood movie but with the perfect mixture of modern necessities one expects in this age of travel it was a pleasure and i applaud this hotel and staff for creating such a lovely experience for their guests lastly the breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the acropolis was the most amazing breakfast i have ever had the view speaks for itself but the breakfast was beautifully done and honestly i have travelled all over the world and have not seen a more plentiful or thorough buffet of breakfast foods,1
1550,very well located hotel in athens the hotel is quite old and it shows rooms would definitely need a renovation the restaurant is great with wondeful acropolis views breakfast is great staff is very good the outdoor pool is very small so if you want to swim a bit you need to use the indoor pool overall good experience,1
1551,our room was at the back of the hotel so we could see the arch or the acropolis but you could from the front of the hotel this is an old hotel tastefully renovated with a single room that includes a small dining table and chairs and a mini kitchen with a small cook top if needed no need to eat in your hotel as the plaka ha so many places to choose from to eat late into the night just be careful of the gypsy as they will take every opportunity to steal your items the staff where friendly and very helpful especially the young lady who took our bags up and does most of the running around and always with a smile,1
1552,the property is situated in an ideal location in the center of all the action of the plaka district we walked to all of athens main attractions including the acropolis ancient agora and acropolis museum the hotel is a solidly constructed building with lots of marble throughout and high ceilings our room was very large for european standards clean and equipped with a small kitchenette and modern bath fixtures facing off street our room was very quiet to traffic noise being a classic building some brief hallway noise from occasional passing guests in hallway can be expected they serve a freshly prepared plentiful breakfast meticulously setup and attended to by the pleasant pantry staff we appreciated the efficient and helpful front desk personnel whom offered many suggestions and recommendations it s a great choice of accommodations for downtown athens,1
1553,standing on our balcony we could see adrian arch one way and the acropolis the other way fantastic location very comfortable and nice suite wonderful breakfast and helpful staff we would love to visit greece again and would choose this property efcharistó,1
1554,outstanding hotel best location in athens i definitely stay here again in the future very large rooms with great views of the acropolis and the zeus temple it is from main shopping district and all kinds of restaurants the hotel was very friendly and helped set up travel to and from the airport for me and my family,1
1555,small unassuming hotel a stone throw from hadrian arch makes the location perfect it is an easy walk to the restaurants outdoor shopping and night life the acropolis museum is around the corner the hotel is quiet rooms are spacious clean and attractive there is a small but quiet balcony and friendly staff the breakfast was more than we expected it is a quality hotel in a great location for couples and families i would stay here again,1
1556,we had separate bedroom and lounge and kids slept on sofas in lounge it was spacious had great small kitchen and good sized bathroom aircon worked well and very clean staff were lovely would recommend for any family,1
1557,location location location my room was large and had a comfy bed it had a couch and sitting area as well as a kitchenette i walked out the door and could see the acropolis so amazing you do need a car and the restaurants are plentiful and tasty,1
1558,completed a vacation by staying at the ava hotel for two nights things could have been better wonderful staff beautiful suite and an excellent location it was a very spacious two room suite with a balcony to look up to the parthenon walking distance to the parliament shopping and many fine choose any other hotel than ava when in athens,1
1559,stayed nights in july and had a very comfortable stay the staff were very helpful rooms were large with a well equipped kitchenette and a nice far as i know all room have a small balcony with the ones on the front enjoying a view of the acropolis well located a very short stroll from all the restaurants of definitely stay here again,1
1560,this was our second stay and we certainly return again great location pleasant staff clean and comfortable hotel that is close to the acropolis reviews are spot on special recognition to maria,1
1561,we only had one in athens wanted to be in walking distance from the historical spots this hotel was the perfect location right next to the temple of zeus and a short walk from the acropolis the hotel staff recommended a great restaurant for lunch were very sweet when we checked in bringing us a bottle of champagne room was clean spacious although we did even use the living room or tv as we spent our time sight seeing having an elevator was great to easily transport our luggage up to our room if we went back to athens we would definitely stay at the ava hotel again,1
1562,i stayed in ava hotel with a friend and it was a perfect stay the location obviously is great laying beside the akropolis and plaka old centre and the rooms are very spacious clean and comfortable however what is way beyond average and stands out most is the extremely friendly staff of ava always ready to help us a smile and nice gestures we felt like a king and queen even when i was sick they cared for me like a family providing me with anything i needed to get well soon thanks a lot for all of your kindness it was lovely staying again with you all the best mel,1
1563,this was a repeat visit for us i ca remember whether it was the fifth or sixth or seventh time that we stayed there and had a perfect visit the hotel has an excellent central location in the plaka minutes away from the acropolis and other touristic sites the staff goes above and beyond to help with recommendations and help when you need it rooms are some of the best we had at any hotel in athens and that includes the fabled grande bretagne i honestly ca think of anything negative to say the only problem now is that the hotel is so popular it becoming harder to get reservations so plan way ahead for one of the and i think best hotels in athens,1
1564,whatever o b hotel staff and management has been doing they must keep doing it everyone was great and very helpful daily breakfast was very good the hotel location was close to everything it is true that there are a lot of graffiti in athens however we come from la and did not really bother us downside of our stay the tv was not working however we were too busy for the most part doing a lot of outdoor activities that we did not bother to have the hotel fix the problem we def will come back,1
1565,o b was a great hotel we loved the ambiance and attention to detail they greeted us with water and drinks the staff was friendly and the rooms clean and modern the location was great as well walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants it felt like home away from home,1
1566,my year old daughter and i stayed for nights in room with an amazing view of the acropolis from the room and the balcony the hotel is well appointed with comfortable beds and a refreshing shower the staff really made our stay special with their friendliness and kindness breakfast was delicious and they packed one to go for us the morning we left early location was awesome short walk to the pedestrian only paths leading to the acropolis and museum we will definitely stay here again on our next visit,1
1567,this was our last hotel in greece after weeks of traveling and it was a perfect stay steps away from the metro on a main street ermou literally behind the acropolis grounds we were able to enter with our tickets through the gates literally minutes away from the hotel the hotel is located a min walk to monastiraki metro station to go to the airport instead of the kiosk machine which sells ticket at euros i bought a ticket to the airport for euros the hotel itself is subtle on the street we walked by twice without noticing it as on the weekend all the shops on the street are closed it is a gorgeous hotel great amenities and restaurant after a long journey upon arrival we were greeted with ice cold water and a few welcome appetizers the breakfast buffet was fantastic at night you are literally staying next to psiri the latest it place for restaurants and shops is convenient so you do have to walk around dodgy hoods at night or get pestered by taxi drivers on sunday there a flea market on the hotel street and neighbouring blocks i found some great records i highly recommend this hotel over all the others in the city centre,1
1568,o b was perfect for our less than hour stay in athens at the end of a fabulous greece trip the front desk staff was incredible from assisting with transportation to booking a stellar private tour guide peggy was so so so so wonderful to packing us breakfast to go when our taxi came to get us for the airport thank you for being so wonderful the hotel is cute in a really fun gritty neighborhood walking distance to plenty of hip restaurants bars and of course the acropolis the only reason i do have stars for o b is i think the rooms themselves could use a little love the bedding and towels felt a bit old the mini bar was lackluster no wine and the cd player in the room is more or less a good example of the last time they were upgraded very comfortable bed and spacious for a big euro city though overall a lovely stay,1
1569,our family of four stayed here last after two weeks in greece this hotel is just beautiful location is great near the acropolis near a metro station near plaka service is we were received with a welcome cocktail juice for the girls and appetizers room was spacious i recommend to pay extra and get the acropolis suite the view is just fabulous the breakfast buffet was also great with nice coffees and fresh orange juice the ladies from the front desk were also very helpful and super nice,1
1570,so i sitting in the restaurant as i write this just could not hold back i totally stuffed with food and i felt guilty but it been so healthy and delicious no plates swimming in oil and fat it clean delicious and cleaver food i had shrimps chicken salad and a chocolate dessert which i did care to mention other than it was sublime the team here are absolutely world class and year on year they never let me down in fact they keep surprising me stunning hotel fabulous service and an absolutely delicious location literally mins max walk to acropolis and other ancient monuments please keep it quiet i do want this place crowded next year when i return make sure u eat in the restaurant ur really missing out if u do,1
1571,this was our second stay this time we traveled with our children and had connecting rooms which were perfect very clean quiet and luxurious i never have allergy problems here since they have wood floors and not carpet the location is really convenient to all of the walking areas and historical sights the staff is always very helpful with any questions and the bellman have both stays come right to our taxi driver to make sure we were getting charged the appropriate rate which is fixed to and from the airport,1
1572,my wife and i had an enchanting time here despite her hip injury with regards to the latter the staff could not have been more kind and helpful the security manager christos even escorting us to the euro clinic and arranging taxis for us the clinic service was good and my wife was restored to health following an intramuscular injection and the prescription of painkillers never have i experienced such service from a hotel and the king george really relieved the tension and pain of hip strain while on vacation furthermore we loved our suite room with its bijou sitting room and ornate victorian depth bathtub our room was the epitome of comfort and a great base from which to explore athens the below ground floor gymnasium was also a good facility at which i whiled away many the final analysis it was not just christos who impressed all staff gave us superb attention,1
1573,this lovely and well placed hotel has a staff that is second to none greeted warmly at am check in into a beautiful and comfortable suite upgrade overlooking the square from the porters to the concierge to the gm they all treated us very well the breakfast is also a special treat good food wonderful staff and a magnificent view of the acropolis,1
1574,what a beautiful hotel we stayed nights and everything was excellent the rooms are beautiful they accommodated our request to have adjoining rooms with our children and the service is impeccable the breakfast is one of the best we ve ever had while traveling abroad beautiful buffet of hot and cold foods plus a full menu all served with a view of the acropolis the hotel was conveniently located in the syntagma district on the same square as the parliament building where the changing of guard takes place plenty of shopping and restaurants mostly touristy around though we were able to walk to several great restaurants recommended by the concierge the kg doesn t have its own pool and the fitness room is very small but guests may use the pool spa and fitness facilities at the adjacent sister hotel,1
1575,king george is a wonderful property in the heart of athens all tourist locations are close by the acropolis is a walk there are also lovely cafes and restaurants located nearby besides boutiques and shopping we were upgraded to a suite which was a bonus the swimming pool is located in the sister hotel grand bretange next door and is a lovely place the pedicurist at the hotel was excellent and good value for money,1
1576,the minute you walk into the king george you know it going to be a pleasant experience doormen are very friendly and helpful as are the front desk staff coming from the us we needed a room in the morning and kleopatra did everything she could to get us into our room as soon as one came available the rooms are small so if you can try to upgrade to a larger room or suite we did that on our way back through athens the breakfast is a feast the staff so nice and attentive you could ask for better service and they should all be commended for that location stay here when visiting athens,1
1577,the exact hotel we expected to be staying in the king george was a beautiful old hotel it had stunning views of the acropolis from the dining room we were up graded up to a suite and it was amazing the suite was almost three rooms we could have wanted anymore space when we were there the weather was a bit on the hot side so all the windows were closed and taking pictures was somewhat inhibited also the air conditioning was not working all that well as we would have liked because of the heat they gave us a fan and everything was fine it was a fabulous hotel i would recommend it,1
1578,this property is wonderful and the service is outstanding i love how they mix the greek old school interior design with modern touches we booked through amex so we got an upgrade the room was spacious and the bathroom perfect the restaurant on the roof top has great views we just had a drink there but the food that came out looked great we sat at the bar and the mixologist was awesome i do not remember his name i wish i did but he told me he had been a mixologist for a while already and all his drinks were made to perfections,1
1579,we stayed here a few nights at the beginning and the end of our trip to greece overall very beautiful hotel right across from the parliament building we had drinks a few times at the rooftop lounge and we had amazing views of acropolis the doorman was the highlight of our stay helped us get a text in the middle of a huge protest and helped bring our bags several blocks due to the closed roads amazing fantastic service would totally stay again if i return to athens,1
1580,we ordered sofrito and something else which it was made from pork meat the sofrito is a very special dish from the good time of the venetian era in corfu what they brought you could call medallion caprice du chef it was well cooked but was not at all sofrito well you can say what you want to an unsuspected tourist we are not the case the other dish which that was suggested as something like pancetta was tasteless indifferent poorly presented and vegetable contradicting the unsalted main elementand without imagination my critique is based on what one expects from a restaurant desert with chocolat the same poor taste no odor fortunately the calvados was very good,1
1581,this is an older hotel but beautifully renovated the rooms are very nice about average size the staff is very friendly and helpful our luggage did not arrive on time and they were very helpful the rooftop terrace is the key attraction here wonderful breakfast with a great view of the acropolis you can use many of the amenities of the sister property next door i recommend the cigar lounge for a good relaxing time will definitely stay here again,1
1582,this is a star luxury hotel in the centre of athens and very close to the metro station at syntagma square it is also close to parliament building where you can change of guard from the hotel you can also walk to the national garden and panathenaic stadium the first olympic stadium and mount rooms are clean and the floors are done in white marbles the bed is soft and the beddings are in and check out is very efficient and the front office staff spelak multiple languages including there i would strongly recommend that you book dinner at tudor hall restaurant located on floor where you will not only enjoy sumptuous greek cuisine but you will also have a vintage view of acropolis the hotel also has a small gym and spa that is accessible to residents at no quality of food is very good staff are friendly and service is execellent,1
1584,the king george in athens was our last stop of a day trip through austria and greece we had a lovely stay at the king george the hotel is beautiful and perfectly located in the center of athens close to the plaka parliament syntagma square and an efficient metro system that takes you wherever you wish to visit in athens our rooms were on the small side but service was very good staff is very attentive to needs and respond very quickly our daughter was ill during our stay and a doctor was dispatched within minutes dinner at tudor hall with an suberb view of the acropolis unforgettable,1
1585,for my first visit to athens i was very pleased having selected king george it was an easy minutes metro ride via the blue line to syntagma square and when you emerge from the train station the hotel is right before your doorman were extremely friendly offering me suggestions on where to wander my first day and recognizing me back when i gone to an island for a few days and at the king hotel is pricey but the location was fantastic near the plaka right by the national gardens beautiful for my walks or to sit and read and a fantastic view of the acropolis from the breakfast room and some of the guest rooms the room i booked included breakfast not sure if all rooms do and it was ample with lots of great general and greek choices plus the young woman who seemed to be the head hostess i ca remember her name but she is lovely could have been encouraging me to try some of the local options and bringing me a delicious glass of watermelon juice everything was so fresh and delicious i slept well and comfortably i would definitely stay here again,1
1587,is it perfect when you can return to a hotel which you have rated with points out of the concierge send me a mail days before my arrival asking if the hotel can do things in advance to make my stay more every guest would believe that this hotel is really interested in you and that they are caring about guest satisfaction or is the sense to make more profit with guests so i answered the mail and informed the hotel that i am a frequent guest and in addition i stayed several times in the neighbor sister hotel grande bretagne which is located in the next house less than meter in upon arrival there was no warm welcome we received the keycard to room facing the busy road in front of the hotel with view to the square and government room has a has guided us to this room when entering the room there was not a card with a warm welcome there was no decoration like a flower cookies or sweets and not even a bottle of mineral i went down to the lady and asked if there is not an advantage for frequent question was what do you mean then i have told her our experience and have told her that i have answered the mail from the concierge and mentioned that i am a frequent we left the reception to have a drink at the bar in the belongs to the tudor my separate review under,0
1588,i can not write enough good things about our stay at king george hotel it was flawless the location is unbeatable the front desk and concierge were extremely helpful and courteous our rooms were available for early check in as requested the rooms were quiet impeccably clean and the beds very comfortable highly recommended,1
1589,this hotel was perfectly located and very comfortable do yourself a favor and use indoor pool and spa next door at the britagne it is amazing and do be disappointed that you ca use the outdoor pool there the indoor pool and spa is wonderful my daughter was upset that she could not use the outdoor pool until we visited the spa it was one of the highlights of the stay the service over all was great the beds are great pillows are great we were very happy,1
1590,taking a step off busy dusty and hot syntagma square and entering the cool and elegant lobby of the king george feels like travel in time outstanding staff with the right mix of restraint and charming support rooms are historic but practical and with lots of charm which does include the small wear and tear which gives a classic place its patina breakfast on the floor with the panorama of the acropolis is a memory that you should seek out and cherish we loved every minute of ithighly recommended,1
1591,we stayed nights in july we got upgraded to a suite since we were platinum members i give it rooms were very nice but the tile shower enclosures were a little dirty here and there the finishes are older but that was ok very charming older luxury hotel it was very clean and the staff was star the food was verygood at the restaurant,1
1592,prior to my stay i knew i would love this hotel due to the attention and detail the concierge team provided me they arranged from airport pick up to acropolis private city tour as i arrived to the hotel the location was amazing across from parliament house and walking distance to most of the key sites you would want to see in the lobby is a grand decor marble lobby yet with a cool modern twist the david bowie portrait as you walk in put a smile to my face the staff is top notch from the doorman housekeeping and front desk i booked the grande suite category facing with a view of the acropolis the decor is traditional and had all the amenities you need when staying in a luxury hotel i loved the deep soaking marble tub a must after walking all day in the heat of athens the sister property next door is wonderful and we had signing privilege i used the barber shop and ate dinner at the roof top of the gb hotel king george hotel you will always be my home away from home when in athens the general manager name is tim ananiadis and i must commend him for a fantastic team,1
1593,we were only here for one night so not too much to say here we decided to enjoy one last night in athens before heading to the states and booked here because of the beautiful view of the acropolis which did not disappoint especially at night room was with brand new features a beautiful bathroom and a comfortable bed the amenities particularly the rooftop pool and bar were exceptional finally the staff was very friendly and accommodating especially in helping us get back to the airport for a flight the next day they even offered to prepare us a private breakfast before we left in the morning but we opted for extra sleep instead,1
1594,the great and were outstanding excellent and accomodating and helpful in regards to children they had shown understanding that children will behave like treatment was children loved the stay over many other bad have something but not for this place,1
1595,a wonderful hotel with skybar where you go up and can see athens with all its atractive buildings and folkmills to sit there with a nice drink in the hand and watch the sunrise over athens beat everything,1
1596,excellent hotel with superb rooms close proximity to everything athenian with most attentive and helpful staff stunning views of acropolis vast range on breakfast menu the rooftop pool with magnificent views of athens is so relaxing we will be back,1
1597,excellent everything was very good excellent location smooth check in comfy and neat room as a hotel city it is very difficult to have a nice view unless you pay extra so our window room had another building right next to but it didn t bother us since we were going to stay one night and we would be out the whole day the view from the roof top is beautiful you can see the parthenon we had super while admiring the view and it was a very nice gourmet experience food was delicious we ordered the greek salad tuna tartar and the chocolate desert which was a symphony of flavors,1
1598,we stayed at the magnificent electra palace metropolis hotel while in athens greece for four days july we started each morning with a healthy delicious breakfast in electra rooftop restaurant with a spectacular view of the athens acropolis and parthenon the hotel staff is outstanding great hospitality and service the guest room was beautiful the hotel is ideally situated one block from syntagma constitution square a block from the athens cathedral and a couple of blocks from the famous plaka shopping taverna district not to mention walking distance to the acropolis parthenon as well as the national gardens and parliament building where you can view the changing of the evzonne guards the electra palace metropolis was a great experience and we will stay there on our next trip to athens,1
1599,from now on this would be the only hotel that i would stay in while i am in athens from its rooftop surrounds you see all of athens including the acropolis it the newest hotel in athens as well also it has the best staff and the cleanest rooms and a beautiful rooftop pool,1
1600,the location was great it was right in the heart of the city it was in walking distance of many food and shopping places as well as attractions the outside breakfast view was amazing and i really liked the food options in the morning the only things i was disappointed about was our view and service we asked for a view facing the acropolis which i know is guaranteed but we got a view of construction and buildings it took away from the romance they also did acknowledge that it was our anniversary the staff were helpful if you asked questions but most did seem to go out of their way to see how we were except the awesome staff member yiannis who not only helped us with our luggage to our room but also spoke enough english to ask us how our trip was and what we had planned for the day we tipped him because of this and he was so grateful not even expecting a tip he is a staff member that deserves recognition the outdoor pool was nice and i liked the seats in the water the seats definitely filled up though so get out there early afternoon to get a seat the shower was also nice and spacious i would go back to this hotel but i would just make sure to get a view of the acropolis,1
1601,electra was an amazing location for us located very close to plaka and syntagma square we took the metro from the airport and walked minutes over to our hotel the best part of the hotel is the pool amenity whenever we were not exploring athens we were relaxing by the pool and suntanning while having amazing views of the acropolis and lycabettus hill from far away the buffet was good enough what more can you ask for in the morning overall i would most definitely stay at this hotel again,1
1602,we selected the electra metroplis based on the view on the website a stunning picture of the acropolis and wondered whether the reality would match the online pic so we were delighted when it did this hotel was spectacular from beginning to end a warm actually crisply welcome a spacious modern room and friendly service the rooftop bar and restaurant offered warm service and the spectacular view we did have reservations for dinner but were able to get a railside table on short notice the food at dinner was good but was light on vegetarian options the breakfast which was included in our rate was also erved on the rooftop we worried that it would be crowded but it never was the buffet offered something for everyone and omelettes were available on request the hotel is in the middle of the action close to the agora and other attractions we walked from the hotel to the parthenon easily and there are lots of cafes nearby word to wise the outside area is fertile territory for young thieves we had an iphone and wallet liberated as we dined but that has nothing to do with this beautiful hotel i loved it,1
1603,first time in athens and the electra delivered on its promise of excellence fabulous location magic views clean comfortable spacious rooms and attentive staff walking distance to everything and a great haven from the afternoon heat i would not hesitate to stay here again,1
1604,i ca imagine it any better you have staff with a nice sense of humor great service fantastic breakfast and views of athens to make you want to stay forever and never look back we had a truly fabulous time and i love to come back one day keep up the great work,1
1605,never having been to athens before i relied on other recommendations on where to stay and i was told by many that either the st george or the grande bretagne were the places to stay so initially i was disappointed that neither hotel had availability and i settled for booking the electra metropolis because it was in the vicinity of the others now if you ask me where to stay i would tell you without question the electra metropolis the electra is located more in the heart of where you want to be in athens turn right out of the hotel and walk a few blocks and you are at syntagma square turn left and you are right on the edge of plaka streets keep walking down the street mitopoleos and it will end at monastiraki square where train station and flea market are located everything was walkable the rooftop view of the acropolis is just for those who make reservations or spend money at the restaurant the free breakfast is served on the rooftop every day while the pool is also located on the rooftop we were there during a heat wave so it was always crowded but that did keep us from enjoying a pool electra also has a heated indoor pool and we had it all to ourselves the hotel is somewhat new so everything is clean and pristine the room and especially the bed were extremely comfortable the staff were very friendly and eager to serve,1
1607,arrived around mid afternoon and hot the hotel was a sheer delight fresh orange juice and bottles of water available all day and a smooth check in the room was big and an abundance of toiletries laid out in the bathroom and the shower was heaven breakfast was a huge choice with amazing views of the acropolis on the roof top in the evenings we went for drinks and watched the lights illuminate the acropolis when the sun went down the drinks were pricey but you pay for the views if in athens definitely stay at the electra metropolis hotel as the staff were amazing kind and helpful,1
1608,we had stayed at the sister hotel to this one but went here for dinner i ca say enough about how wonderful the food here was they had a wide selection go dinners which included vegetarian as well as fish and meats this will not be a cheap dinner but again the food was great the views of the acropolis exceeded even the food make sure to call for reservations,1
1609,modern chic and centrally located friendly staff our rooms did not have any windows but the rooftop pool bar more than made up for it with nice views of acropolis and athens they also serve an excellent complimentary breakfast up there they let us eat and play in pool area after check out with access to spa changerooms and showers an all around pleasant experience,1
1610,electra metropolis is an elegant and beautifully decorated hotel in the centre of athens the rooftop view of athens is spectacular and the glass pool is impressive the high point of our stay was our delicious dinner that was served at the restaurant overlooking the acropolis truly breathtaking we will definitely return,1
1611,stayed for nights in july at the start of our trip and could have asked for a better hotel to start off with the hotel is in the perfect location right in the centre of athens the rooms are very modern and spacious staff are incredibly helpful and attentive not to mention amazing views from the rooftop restaurant where breakfast is recommend staying at this hotel while in athens and i will certainly be back,1
1612,we would recommend this hotel for the following location walking distance from the acropolis and the plaka the breakfast both rich and tasty plus the magnificent views of the the friendly the amenities of the room and its the we think it is reasonable priced as well,1
1613,this spanking new hotel was perfect for our one night stay in athens located in a central spot it in very close proximity to the plaka acropolis and tons of museums our classic room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom as went up to the rooftop our first night to lay by the loungers and were really impressed with the gorgeous view of the acropolis all lit up when we returned the next morning for breakfast it was an equally stunning seemed a bit understaffed but that was a problem since it is a buffet for the most part the selection is quite lovely with yogurt fruits meats eggs waffles pancakes and so much more we only needed a server for coffee and someone eventually came i was satisfied with our stay and would definitely recommend it as a base in athens,1
1614,band new hotel in the best location in athens the rooms are very clean and newthe staff are amazing and the view from the roof top garden was great only issue where small lifts this is one of the best hotels in athens,1
1615,our room was excellent and quite the rooftop bar affords you with an excellent view of the parthenon especially as the sun goes down walking out the front door takes you past many tourist shops and ancient ruins there are many restaurants to grab a bite as well we had dinner one night in the hotel and found the food above average but the view is,1
1616,i have been to athens many times through the years recently stayed at the electra metropolis and could not have been more pleased excellent hotel great walkable location right near shopping and sights staff was friendly and helpful room was modern and good roomy size the best part was the rooftop pool restaurant and bar what a view will be staying at this hotel the next time in athens,1
1617,the location is really good everything by walk good to visit plaka and acropolis nice hotel modern and the view of acropolis is really nice the room is comfortable modern but small for persons it was ok because we spend only nights i will recommend this hotel they have pools and is warm heated i love it yep it was hard to found in grèce,1
1618,we arrived to hotel early than time of check in but on the receiption we got very good service the room which we received was very good the hotel places very close to central aprt of athens and on the side of shopping stors the breakfast was good with a great view on acropolis,1
1619,i had nights here in the views are mesmerising no matter how many times you experience them the breakfast was good but poorly displayed my room was an adequate size for one person but a couple might find it challenging suitcase space was inadequate the pool was great in may but by the end of june it felt like warm soup and was full of children bless as well as which it is small access times for the pool is limited due to its proximity to the dining not a boutique hotel but good none the less i would definitely return,1
1620,central location is an added plus views from the roof top breakfast are spectacular you can easily walk to the plaka flea market metro station and upscale shopping is just a block away very accommodating staff regardless of your arrival time,1
1621,this hotel is amazing the facilities and location are second to none the staff go out of their way to make your stay here wonderful a special mention must go to the lovely young man who greets you at the door stavros who has gone above and beyond to assist us we have stayed here on occasions and have enjoyed our times here very much breakfast drinks on the floor have spectacular views of the acropolis interiors of the hotel are just gorgeous,1
1622,the location is virtually at bang in the city centre and accessible to the plaka area and parliament building i loved the decor of the entire building a mixture of art deco with grecian style the rooms were comfy and had everything you expect of a hotel the staff were great very accommodating and the business rooms catered to all of our needs i would hands down recommend this to any prospective traveller coming to athens very affordable for a central hotel the breakfast and lunch were amazing as was the service i stayed in the hilton before in athens and you ca even compare the two this is better in every aspect a major plus as well are the panoramic views of athens and the acropolis loved it,1
1623,stay one night in this hotel with the family very good location and definitely a four star hotel easy checkin reception had cooled ice water on a hot day for all hotel guest rooms were cleaned and large breakfast served on the tenth floor had excellent views and wide range of choices services exceptional,1
1624,this hotel was excellent very clean room and the hotel itself is beautiful the breakfast is very very good and probably has the best view of acropolis overall i would definitely stay here again or recommend it to,1
1625,we spend nights in this wonderful hotel the location is the best you can expect and breakfast on the roof is breathtaking we had a problem with the reservation and after talking to the manager on duty this issue was resolved immediately this is what we expect from a stars hotel thanks again to the stuff,1
1626,it was my third hotel in athens in under months and by far my favourite the staff are friendly and courteous i arrived early and they were able to check me in earlier the room was spotless and the house keeping staff were bending over to ensure that i was satisfied the floor words fail me about the beauty and ambience that surrounds it having breakfast this morning and looking at the acropolis was beyond all expectations location is brilliant minutes away from quality shops and a short and easy stroll to the fashionable kolonaki the spa centre also does not fail indulgent and luxurious ca rate this hotel highly enough,1
1627,very bad staff management and attitude for a star hotel we checked into this hotel with adults and child but apparently we booked a room for adults and child by accident we showed up with passports and the man at the reception simply said you ca stay here with an attitude he was very impatient and did seem like he wanted to try to help us after talking to him for a bit he said there a room at another floor and checked us in our luggage took forever to be delivered to our room like a good hour or so later this woman walks into our room without knocking on the door and says she needs to check the mini fridge did not say anything like i sorry to disturb you or i come back later but simply came in and said she needs to check the fridge after checking she says there are stuff missing in the fridge when we literally just checked in a few hours ago should this be done before we are brought to our rooms then later at night we get a strange call from the desk asking if we want the other room because we never got the key but we did they also said someone came in but since we did have the key they found it strange and asked us a bunch of random questions when we kept telling them we got the key and we were the ones who entered,0
1628,there is not a single thing we did not like the hotel is a perfect spot for a weekend getaway but also for longer stay great location with walking distance to both shopping and historical sights staff is great service amazing buffet breakfast with wide choices to please anyone and eating with the view of acropolis is hard to beat we had also cocktails late at night again the view was amazing and the terrace with the pool is a perfect spot to both start and conclude a day room was of a good size bathroom too highly comfortable with all the amenities one could needwarmly recommend,1
1629,from the moment i stepped out of my taxi to leaving the service here was exceptional just outside the entry there is an old chapel still standing so quaint the hotel is gorgeous and such a short walk into the plaka region the room was stunning however had a strong smell when i walked that was pleasant and did go away the bathroom had been cleaned properly as there were drips in front of the toilet if you get my drift and on the seat stocked with korres which is always a plus the gym pools all stunning the breakfast was delicious,1
1630,loved this hotel service is outstanding and decor in lobby and the room is top quality what worthy of mention too is the superb location minutes walk from most of the top sites in athens will definitely return to this hotel,1
1631,of all the hotels we stayed in greece so far corfu santorini mykonos and athens this is by far the cleanest and most comfortable hotel we stayed in with this trip we stayed at pricier hotels in corfu and santorini but this hotel is by far the best great service as well if you have children and require rooms the hotel has connecting rooms,1
1632,we only stayed one night on our way home the hotel is very nice with all the right facilities the bar and pool on the floor have a fabulous view of the acropolis we were rather disappointed with the breakfast service we arrived at probably the busiest time but the staff did seem to be able to cope and the food was not replenished quickly enough many of the dishes were empty we had to ask for water milk and to have our table cleared to make room it let our stay at the hotel down however if time allows do have a spa treatment i had an ancient greek massage and it was one of the best massages i had in a long time well worth finding the time for and it redeemed the hotel,1
1633,what a wonderful experience my travels take me to many countries and can say that this hotel is up there staff and service is of a high standard sundeck view is amazing with a great pool area drinks on a summers afternoon overlooking the acropolis is sensational will be back,1
1634,close to syntagma station and right by lots of shops and restaurants got a prepaid sim card with local minutes and of data from the cosmote store just next door for on a summer on floor was modern and clean quite a bit of water would leak from shower onto bathroom floor through the shower door minor issue no other pool area on the rooftop but not a lot of seating view of acropolis is obstructed from pool area but view is excellent throughout most of the restaurant,1
1635,great night at electra metropolis for sure we come back had an amazing time the spa was good the restaurant was good and the service as well worth the price great location and great view to the acropolis,1
1636,we had a wonderful romantic stay at this hotel in the last night we made a reservation at the hotel restaurant that we had to cancel because our baby had fever so they brought the dinner to our room wonderfully arranged we enjoyed it with magic ancient view,1
1637,so after a fab stay last week where the hotel ended my stay with a shot of mastica i said that i would love the same again next week so i upon arriving in athens i call to request a shot of mastica job my arrival for a swift as i am in a rush to leave for business meeting what do i get no staff are not prepared for staff take an eternity to get my luggage to my my room is a twin despite the fact that i booked rooms with adult in each i mentioned this last time too upon complaint i was finally provided with a double though it took forever for staff to get the key to me so i had to leave my suitcase outside my room and leave for work my colleague was not provided with a double now am now on the rooftop bar and there are no spaces i say that i am happy to chill by the pool what say fine though now i can not have a drink pathetic eventually the staff redeemed themselves by providing me with an awesome seat gazing at the acropolis service from the short chap with short blonde hair was exceptional if the rest of the hotel could replicate this service it would be good,0
1638,centrally located within walking distance to the shopping street main square if you want to get a hop off bus we stayed in a classic double twin room it was spacious very clean the bed was comfortable and the room dark quiet the bathroom was very large featured both an overhead shower or side hand shower if you do want to wash your hair the hotel features many drinks dining options the rooftop pool bar restaurant area is particularly wonderful features stunning views of the acropolis athens city all staff were welcoming friendly,1
1639,the electra hotel is located within walking distance of the national palace national gardens and even the first stop for the hop on hop off bus there is also a subway nearby there are many great restaurants and cafes just steps away but even better at least once would be to just head up to the the floor and have dinner at sunset in their restaurant the view of the acropolis and surrounding area of greece is phenomenal as for the room itself it is contemporary the bed comfortable on the firm side the view from our room was just that of the building across the street but i believe there are probably a couple floors that might have a similar view of the acropolis as that of the restaurant we were on the floor there was a tiny balcony outside basically a person could take one step out to look right or left down the street the flat screen tv gave access to connect ones digital phone or pad up to screen their photos an ap was needed though to do it the tv had an alarm set up such that when programmed it the tv would turn on at the designated time pay attention to the volume when using there were other options available on the television as well the shower was very roomy and had one of those big rain head type fixtures the air conditioning worked well and was quiet the staff were all friendly the,1
1640,best good is not on the roof with great the breakfast an outdoor swimming spa with fair prices for money realy recommended,1
1641,the hotel itself is great we had a junior suite which was quite spacious for european standards nice updated bathroom comfy bed huge balcony with a wonderful view of the acropolis the location is fantastic as well very central and within close proximity to most main areas of the city the only downfall was the service it was terrible but not what i used to front desk is just there to give you a room key or take your payment waitress at the hotel restaurant upstairs was the friendliest nor very quick to take our order calling room service was good but when we just needed some extra coffee pods or towels etc it was forever and we still could get what we needed all of the time only one gentleman downstairs bellman was extremely helpful throughout the whole trip it a shame because such a good hotel could be great with just some tweaks to their customer service,1
1642,our cruise started in athens so we decided to come days before to explore this hotel is exactly what we were looking for great location beautiful design esthetic clean and nice rooms do miss the roof top restaurant with views of the acropolis the food was delicious service was way too slow but it vacation so no real rush we had a suite and it was the perfect size with a sitting room so if you want a little space i would recommend this type of room,1
1643,thanks to the very friendly and accommodating staff our first night as a married couple was beautiful and very special they offered a complimentary bottle of wine and upgraded our room leaving us with an pleasant surprise upon our arrival the reason we opted for this hotel in the first place was because we wanted to sleep on a bed that felt like being on cloud nine and so it was we woke up feeling refreshed and had our delicious breakfast enjoying the great view from the loft highly recommended kostis hara,1
1644,we slept on very fine beds and decided to buy them for our self at home the food is optima forma healthy tastfull and ofcourse the metroline that brings you directly to the centre of athens and pyreas,1
1645,well even the taxi driver did not immediately find the hotel entrance they run kind organic luxury cotton shop and you access the hotel via the shop original rooms are zen basic products of good quality everything is rather basic but not cheap stuff and forget a room with a view you are in the middle of kifisias however they have a nice roof top terrace and there you have a nice view on the friendly staff basic but good breakfast and outside the hotel really nice bars and coffee places,1
1646,excellent bed mattresses was very very staff at the reception was very friendly and the check in was really facilities clean and it is located in a very quiet neighborhood,1
1647,amazing stay at this hotel that felt like it could be out of a movie about a yoga retreat upon arriving we were given a very comfy pair of slippers and shown to our room the amenities were amazing as well nice washroom espresso machine in the room an impressive spread of snacks in the lobby and a honesty bar after taking the subway all the way from pireus to kat and seeing rough neighbourhoods and graffiti everywhere this was a very welcome change of pace,1
1648,great hotel in a very calm and green area in athens really friendly staff relaxing atmosphere in the entire hotel very good beds excellent breakfast no problem to park your car in the street the entire hotel including the rooms are completely furnished with nice cocomat products the metrostation to the centre of athens is on minutes walking distance and it takes around minutes to get there this is a quaint hotel in a very positive way,1
1649,beautiful pleasent very well designed hotel great whete on our way to the north side of greece and it was a good starter to great vacation fairly close to the with clean design friendly feel,1
1650,perfect for couples great location with many cafes and great restaurants around the staff was extremely nice and helpful the roof has beautiful wall art and it a great place to visit at night you can have a drink and see from the roof the surrounding scenery including the acropolis,1
1651,the is a beautiful hotel in kolonaki a great neighborhood in athens away from the congestion of the tourist areas the rooms are nice sized and have a modern fun design in addition to being incredibly rooftop is a great escape for a drink before heading out with views of the acropolis and the sea in the terms of location lots of accessible restaurants bars and shopping getting an uber to the acropolis and other historical sites is easy and recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a simple comfortable hotel to explore athens,1
1652,this hotel was a great find in athens it located in a great area in close proximity to lots of nice bars and restaurants away from many tourist traps the room itself is nice modern and has everything you need in it plus the amazing bed and pillow menu it easy to walk to all the main sights from there and then in the evening enjoy the views from there cosy roof terrace which provides a great vantage point to enjoy a few glasses of their own wine if in athens again we stay here without a doubt,1
1653,can not rate this hotel enough rooms are immaculate beds are amazing location is central with trendy restaurants and cafes on your doorstep service is excellent and breakfast quality and variety is exceptional rooftop view whilst enjoying a glass of local wine is spectacular have travelled extensively through europe and this is clearly a top rated hotel you will not be disappointed,1
1654,this lovely hotel is well worth it price they offered amazing breakfast in the morning and even packed us a breakfast box on our last morning as we were too early for the breakfast hours it is well located near syntagma square and about a minute walk from the acropolis it is located close to a train station about a uphill walk and has loads of restaurants and stores in the area,1
1655,if only i could take the decor home with me this hotel is lovely rooms were exceptionally clean the decor very modern the breakfast has a great spread and despite the location being in what seemed like a area i did hear a thing from my room location was great in my opinion though i like walking around and exploring the service was good as well nothing over and above but good would recommend,1
1656,we really enjoyed our stay at hotel attalos it in a great central location near monastiraki square and the athens flea market very walkable our room had a nice balcony with a view of the acropolis the rooftop terrace and bar were terrific i ca say enough about how nice and helpful maria kostas and sakis were at the front desk,1
1657,great safe location close to food and shopping in montistraki square the rooftop bar was a highlight with a view of the acropolis and excellent drinks from a great bartender very clean and good reliable wifi,1
1658,we stayed in a balcony room for nights and we loved the view of the acropolis from our private terrace the hotel is located adjacent to the metro station and a very short walk to the plaka area and within easy walking distance to the major tourist sites including the acropolis and the museum while the hotel is not flash it is clean and functional and excellent value for money there is certainly no need to stay in a pricier hotel in the plaka area the terrace provides wonderful sunset views of the acropolis while the bathroom was compact and the shower was a bit tight it was manageable the staff were accommodating and helpful our room included daily breakfast and we loved the selection available especially the greek yoghurt and coffee machine all of which was provided with love and care on our last day we needed to catch an early ferry so they opened the breakfast room early especially for us which we really appreciated we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants a safe clean place to stay without paying an exorbitant rate,1
1659,easy train ride to the acropolis and walk your way back through the ancient roman agora and the charming and historic plaka district to the hotel where you go up to the rooftop bar and watch as dusk settles over the acropolis life does give you too many better afternoons and the room was comfortable with good service thrown in when i get back to athens hotel atttalos is where i be staying for sure,1
1660,this hotel is great from airport metro stop walk to the acropolis or gaze at it from the rooftop bar monastiraki psyra plaka and ermou street you get fab service from reception our room was spacious the bed linen was unexpectedly good we will definitely come back,1
1661,we arrived at the brazil suites after days of sailing and this beautifully presented one bed contemporary apartment haseverything you need supplied in the welcome desk were very quick to supply us with key and zap our passport then straight to the sitting room seems much larger than any photo had given it justice and our three children are more than comfortable on the sofa star,1
1662,the rooms are large for european rooms with an efficient ac system the bathrooms are clean and functional the breakfast is fantastic the views of the from the rooftop are just stunning the neighborhood is great with fantastic shops both high end and quaint souvenir shops the streets are fun to walk around the acropolis is a quick walk away as is the agora we stayed here twice we liked the location so much drinks on the rooftop at sunset where a highlight,1
1663,wonderful reasonably priced hotel friendly staff and perfect location to explore plaka district shops restaurants transport amazing rooftop bar with incredible views of the parthenon the acropolis hill highly recommended,1
1664,i extremely critical in my reviews as tripadvisor has served me abounds for the past decade and i try to pay it forward i enjoyed this hotel and athens even though i only spent great location to all the action in athens small supermarket next door amazing rooftop ac works great really liked the complimentary wine greek treats and water soft pillows and a comfortable bed as it should be appeared to be one large mattress not beds together which is a bonus in europe breakfast was nice decent choice of food including eggs and bacon plenty of seating and food area was constantly being cleaned i requested a taxi for the next morning it was outside on time early in refurbished older building but definitely some obvious short cuts in construction elevator lift extremely small and slow not adequate for luggage and people i wouldnt mind all the steps but they were sketchy uneven width due to winding circular design i watched an elderly gentlemen try and navigate them carefully i went to bed around midnight and had to be up at for a flight if this was the case the dragging of chairs around on the rooftop at midnight and would have been an issue as i stayed on the floor overall i will definitely return i took off star for solid reasons i respect rejuvenation of old infrastructure and the revamping of an existing space however the elevator lift is extremely small and extremely slow during busy,1
1665,we stayed in plaka hotel for three nights the staff was helpful and answered our questions efficiently the hotel itself and the rooms were small but is cozy and safe it did nit provide slippers shower caps toothbrush etc but we brought our own so that fine the free breakfast was delicious and we had our breakfast in the hotel every day the wifi is we stayed on the second floor there was a bit street noise and we could hear peoplr going in and out but we still managed to sleep well the bathroom was too small but everything is clean if you want a good hotel with affordable price in athens just for a few nights i would recommend plaka hotel,1
1666,the plaka is in a perfect location minute walk to the acropolis and its museum minutes to the plaka pedestrian area and shopping the shower in the room is a little small but the room was very comfortable the complimentary breakfast is wonderful with many greek items to choose from skip the eggs the view from the roof top is worth the cost of admission we hung out there in the evening with drinks,1
1667,as billed the hotel is practically at the bottom of the hill below acropolis and very close to the metro station and the shopping area around it with numerous restaurants in one direction and the cathedral and parliament in the other with ten minutes or so of walk the hotel breakfast area is open all day long with free lemon and cucumber water in the jar for guests,1
1668,we are staying in the sister hotel hermes but roof top of the plaka hotel has great view of the acropolis and serves a basic array of drinks this review is primarily about the roof top and that is great having a quiet drink is a bonus i will that both hotels are very nice as well i will review that aspect later,1
1669,we stayed at plaka hotel just for night as we were passing through athens and getting a flight to santorini the next hotel is about a minute drive from the airport its in such a great location and everything is at your doorstep so if you are in athens for a short amount of time or a couple of nights this hotel is perfect lots of restaurants close by and little shops the reception staff were so nice and funny we also got an upgrade to a bigger room which was great ladies if you are after some amazing cheap leather sandals head out of the hotel and turn to your left across the road you see a giant sandal shop i was in shoe heaven also head up to the roof top bar to get a view of the acropolis very nice,1
1670,the hotel was clean and had everything we needed the staff were friendly and helpful the rooftop bar had an excellent view of the acropolis and the location of the hotel is excellent good breakfast spread too,1
1671,we stayed for nights in march the roof top view is breathtaking though the food beverage offer was very poor the view is totally worth it our room was spacious very confortable king size bed big breakfast buffet with the amazing greek yougurt in case you are taking the early morning ferry do worry they have your breakfast ready,1
1672,we previously stayed here many years ago and the prime location within walking distance of everything you want to see in athens was the key reason we chose this hotel again they have clearly had a revamp since last we visited and we were very pleasantly surprised by the updated decor the staff are still super friendly and helpful and of course the rooftop bar has the best views of the acropolis will definitely be returning,1
1673,pleasantly surprised by the comfort of this hotel had read some negative report re size of room and hotel furnishings but we were extremely happy with everything including the extra small elevator room was spacious and quite and the included breakfast offered a lot of choice and was enjoyable the rooftop bar with a wonderful view of the acropolis was an added bonus the staff were friendly and helpful and during breakfast we were often approached by hotel staff to advise on sightseeing and inquire if they could help organise our daily activities location was perfect and would stay here again on further trips to athens,1
1674,we stayed here on two occasions during our trip to greece both at the start and end of our trip the hotel was nothing too fancy and served the purposes we needed the hotel had which was essential during the temperatures the room had a small fridge that we could fit our water in which was also great the rooftop bar is nice and gives a view of the acropolis which is quite serene the breakfast is pretty standard for greece i did enjoy that they had a section with some greek breakfast foods such as the cheese pies and spinach pies we also took advantage of their laundry service which cost euro and allowed you to fill up a big garbage bag of clothes that were washed and returned the same day we did put anything delicate or special just essential items that we wanted the staff were friendly and helped us as much as they could the location was good nearby to all the main areas and sights my principal criticism would be the elevator it was ridiculously small and could fit all of us in it we stayed on the top floor so walking was an option in all we would probably stay here again if we came back to athens,1
1675,this hotel is amazingly cheap for what you get the rooms are not fancy at all but they are clean enough and there is air conditioning even if it turns off when you leave room however the location right in the plaka district and close to the acropolis were phenomenal the rooftop of this place was so amazing that we did not even feel the need to go out at night we simply drank wine and beer on the roof and watched as the acropolis lit up at night,1
1676,we always stay at the plaka hotel as it has the ideal location for discovering athens everything within walking distance the breakfast was great and the staff very friendly and helpful would have liked to see some drinks in the minibar but that neither here nor there the view from the rooftop bar was spectacular,1
1677,the people at this hotel are amazing for example my husband camera broke and staff helped him find a repair shop at breakfast staff walk around answering any questions all of their advice was spot on we stayed there in an economy room for one night then went to crete returned and stayed in a more expensive room both rooms were clean and comfortable the hotel is close to the metro and has a wonderful roof terrace with a view of the acropolis we definitely would return,1
1678,what a wonderful location in athens the room was fine the breakfast was outstanding and the hotel staff is top notch our room was with no view the bathroom was very nice the air conditioner cooled our room down quickly athens was really hot and we need the cool room the top deck view can not be out done,1
1679,when in athens we always stay in pkaka district it what athens is to me the plaka hotel is in the middle of it lovely room nice breakfast lovely help full and professional staff roof top bar and seating area with magnificent views of acropolis the hills covered with white colored homes we love it for early check out they offer continental break fast,1
1680,the plaka is simply wonderfull a lovely spacious room and bathroom with akropolis view very friendly and accomodating staff delicious breakfast and excellent coffee a fabulous rooftop with bar lounge chairs and best of all the view of the unbelievably central everything is nearby and despite this central location there almost no noise in the room,1
1681,in the heart of the plaka neighborhood this hotel is within walking distance to most major ancient sights in athens the rooftop terrace presents dramatic views of the acropolis and the city our room was clean and spacious the breakfast was complete and included in the room price and the staff were friendly and helpful this is a good choice for your first visit to athens,1
1682,this hotel is in walking distance of all the archealogical sights and museums in athens as well as the airport bus the staff were extremely helpful with information for the side trips we took also the breakfast hostess was a mine of information about all things greek the breakfast is wonderful and includes greek specialities also free and biscuits are available during the day the view from the roof is wonderful especially at night when the acropolis is illunminated the room was clean and spacious and the price in mar was very reasonable that time of year was perfect for weather and less tourists we also made use of the supermarket next door we would definitely stay there again,1
1683,not luxury but a good hotel good breakfast good beds and bathroom and news on tv in english extra star or the great location right in the middle of pedestrian walkways squares and shopping extra star for the fabulous terrace with view of the acropolis at night,1
1684,since i used tripadvisor alot when booking my recent trip i thought it is only fair to review aseell having been to athens before i knew of the idea location to stay and this hotel location is amazing for those tourists with just a few days in athens close to absolutely everything plaka area is probably the best area to sights shopping only thing the area is not close to is beaches however that is anywhere in the centre of athens the hotel itself is very clean new towels etc daily breakfast was quite good and had a decent variety views depend on your room some have acropolis views like we did but that is just luck i think as other rooms view is just the building right next door the staff were actually verrry helpful had to leave at to check out and they had a taxi booked upon request which was there waiting for us definitely would recommend this hotel hard to find any faults for a decent price,1
1685,great location located right in the heart of the city we took the bus from the airport which was approximately an hour and minutes while a cab would have been minutes we got off at the last stop and it was approx an min walk to the hotel check in was easy and the front desk concierge was friendly the room was basic just what we needed and was clean great rooftop bar with a stunning view of the acropolis the acropolis was also only a minute walk away we went at in the evening and it was too hot which was nice breakfast was included and was pretty good you must try their homemade spinach and cheese pie spanakopita it was delicious,1
1686,great staff good clean room excellent breakfast located if you want to explore plaka and monastiraki areas easy walking to restaurants with a mini mart next door and a large supermarket around the is approximately a minute walk from the hotel suggest wearing good walking shoes with rubber soles to avoid slipping on granite steps and pathways qheading up to and in the rooftop terrace gives you great views of the acropolis especially at definitely return to this hotel,1
1687,very welcoming team good breakfast selection of granola cold cuts fresh pastries and choice of eggs with like local sausage etc and great location near syntagma square views from rooftop bar are stunning highly recommended,1
1688,new hotel is perfectly located in the heart of athens externally friendly and knowledgeable staff newly designed hotel unique decorations water fruit and chocolate in your room daily they do have their own parking lot but two lots a less then a block away if you need one taxi service is available with in minutes,1
1689,my instinct was to rate this hotel at a but i give it a because of the excellent front desk and restaurant service the room was extremely small which i expected because i viewed the rooms on their website it was an odd bright color there was absolutely zero privacy in the bathroom if you are traveling with someone and are modest or you need a private bathroom moment this can get uncomfortable the lighting was not suitable for doing your makeup the bathroom vanity was tiny and there was not enough room for both of us to have our things on the counter top the view was of other balconies across the city street it felt more like nyc than athens all of that being said the included breakfast was very good the employees here went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable the hotel is in a pretty convenient location and we were able to walk to most places i give the property itself a but the staff a so i rounding it to a,1
1690,we stayed at the new hotel in athens and were very pleased with our choice from the time you enter the hotel the staff was very friendly and accommodating the location was fantastic it within walking distance to the national gardens the plaka and parliament to name a few the hotel was very clean the price was reasonable the room size was larger than i expected and the view of the acropolis from the rooftop is fabulous i highly recommend this hotel,1
1691,we ended up staying at the new hotel for one night unexpectedly some other plans had fallen through and we actually been to the hotel the night before for a drink on their fabulous rooftop bar it was one of the best decisions we made on our trip we loved the funky vibe of the place the staff were so attentive and the room was very well appointed we have stayed at many large and small luxury hotels over the years and we really enjoyed the slightly hipster feel of this one very much it made up feel young and trendy but in a nice up market setting which is central to all the key attractions in athens if you are looking for a somewhat different experience to your traditional big chain hotel setting then we would have no hesitation recommending this to you finally you simply have to have a cocktail on the rooftop bar views of the on one side and lycabatus hill on the others breathtaking stuff,1
1692,trendy good food good team and amazing decoration in the room you feel good in that place and it s very well located the brunch is very good and a rrof terrace is nice for the view in loved with the bathroom full of day light,1
1693,i had another excellent two days here in may service is impeccable lovely ambience throughout the hotel and the breakfast is first class i can not imagine being in athens and not staying at this boutique hotel,1
1694,we stayed at new hotel for just a night in athens on the tail end of our greece trip the rooms are awesome each one has its own charm and is unique the art decor layout and style of each room is different which is what makes this hotel so great it contemporary but still feels comfortable and very upscale the rooms are spacious and you can get a great view if you ask for a room overlooking the city,1
1695,the new hotel is a good choice when you wish to skip the large chain rooms are quite small with trendy furnishings you can not find a better location for shopping restaurants and historical sites roof top restaurant was lovely and the staff was very friendly,1
1696,loved this hotel it is a little quirky and really service was top flight the rooms a bit on the the small side but every inch is used creatively the shower was gynormous two rain showers we had a peek a boo view of the acropolis they used the old items from the old hotel to make interesting art in the hotel from scrap wood walls to saved light fixtures the location of this hotel is perfect for seeing the sights and close to excellent restaurants we walked to all the major sights well most of them a little thing but so nice the air smells sooooo good they even sell a spray and a candle with the scent of the hallways free wifi and breakfast included with room appreciated the amount of electrical plugs around the room air con kept us nice and give this hotel five stars in all areas,1
1697,wonderful experience the registration was effortless the front desk was friendly and efficient the rooms was delightful our room had one wall of eyes all rooms are different and well thought out optimum use was made of space we had breakfast at the hotel and it was well prepared and presented there was also a large buffet style breakfast to satisfy all the hotel is very close to the old town plaka and very close to the system that goes to the airport as well i can recommend this hotel to all that is interested,1
1698,i had avoided staying at new hotel due to price for a few athens visits but after a rather dismal experience at another hotel in athens i decided to return to the new hotel for my most recent rooms were as good as always but slightly enlivened by a new art collection of young art basically a collection of enhanced stick figures in various forms of undress cavorting around your room on the mirror on the wall quite a staff were as efficient as ever even when the hotel was inundated by a slightly obnoxious american tourist group the food was good and the bar a brilliant end to a busy day well worth a few more euros,1
1699,best star hotel in the center of athens excellent service restaurant very recommended i used this hotel for different occasions organizing events staying there very convenient and flexible,1
1700,the new hotel was a perfect spot for our family of for our three days in athens it was perfectly situated for us to walk to the plaka and acropolis as well as the shopping had one superior room and two connecting rooms with enough beds for my adult children to spread out and have their own space the bathrooms were nicely appointed and the rooms were very comfortable each room had a terrace which we did not use because it as during our stay but black out shades were great for keeping the room cool and dark desk staff and all hotel staff were very helpful and kind during our visit helping us with reservations as well as making sure all our needs were had drinks on the roof the bar and restaurant are pretty limited up there but we enjoyed the view we also enjoyed the lovely breakfast buffet each would highly recommend this hotel we had a great stay there,1
1702,i arrived in athens on a whim and did not have a reservation when i landed i boarded the train to downtown and booked this hotel online on the way into town i was drawn to it because of a wonderful experience i had a similarly themed hotel in florence see my review what drew me was the description that the hotel had been conceived with an architectural theme of the old hotel had been gutted and this new hotel was put together with all of the elements from the hotel including the furnishings the hotel was easy to get to i took a taxi from the central station but it was so close i walked to the station upon my departure there is really a when you enter the hotel i think the staff were influenced and inspired by the concept they were very knowledgeable about the hotel the was quick and i was asked then if i wanted to extend my stay at that time i said i wait for a day or two to make up my mind she told me the hotel fills quickly and sure enough when it came time to check out they were already fully booked i was upset not at them but at me because i really enjoyed the hotel it is immaculate it is safe it is and it is a smart hotel there is a lot of technology managing the lights the locks the internet and the energy conservation bonus,1
