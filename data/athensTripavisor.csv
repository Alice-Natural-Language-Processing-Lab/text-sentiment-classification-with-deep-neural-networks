Everything went well and the staff were very warm, welcoming and helpful. The hotel is located on a main street and there were many coffee shops and bakeries in the area. Across the road there is even a cinema. The hotel is located about a 15-20 minute walk to the Acropolis.

We thought it would be close to town and we could walk to the main attractions as we only had a short stay in Athens. This was not the case and it was very complicated to get anywhere without a taxi, and most of the drivers do not understand English. The hotel is situated near a ´red-light´ district so that should be taken into consideration. Very difficult to cross the road as it is a four lane highway out the front with a fence in the midway. The hotel is very new but very badly designed and finished off. Very small lifts to take you to the rooms, so it takes two trips if you have a lot of luggage. We ordered some food from the restaurant and bought it up to the room. Unfortunately my food had an eye lash in it. Generally the staff was very friendly, though check in did take some time which I do not really appreciate. The hotel finishes and location, lets it down. I would not recommend or stay here again.",2,New but disappointing...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d12525942-r502233293-Athenaeum_Grand_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Sonja W

After 10 days of island hopping my girlfriend and I were looking for a comfortable room with all the amenities.Our first impression at the front desk was a good one as we were greeted by a friendly receptionist. The lobby mirrored the pictures we had seen online. We made our way to our room and were happy with the size and layout, albeit without a double bed (there were two single beds pushed together.) Okay, no biggie. Breakfast is served until 1030 and on our first morning we were somewhat late and filtered through to a banquet room where there was ample spread. The next morning we were in the main breakfast area where there was a noticeable difference of selection and quantity of food and drinks.We later made our way up to the pool bar where again we were impressed with the facilities and bar. Such as all Greek restaurants, service was slow and we embraced the holiday mentality. It was only the following morning at the pool where we were met with sun-craving guests jostling for a sun bed. Fortunately we were able to secure one while others were left disappointed and frustrated having to sit on the floor.Although comfortable in the rooms, it is not quite 4 star quality.

We arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there. I was not happy. However, the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage. He was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our stay.We got up to our rooms (needed to book 2 because of our big family) to find 2 twins bed pushed together in each room. Not the best, but it worked. The furniture is dated, the TVs are ancient, smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain. It is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere. To top it off, they charge 12 euro a day for internet access in the room, and that is only for 2 devices. Probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area. They have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar. However, it is a very small pool area. It is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground, so you can hardly walk around the pool. We arrived at the first day at 18:30, knowing it closes at 19:00. With 3 kids in tow, the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have 30 mins to swim, so we should come back tomorrow. Well my kids were in their swimsuits at the pool, so there was no way I was not going to let them swim. We swam, had a nice time and my husband brought up our own towels. The next day we came up earlier in the day, found a spot on the ground and went swimming. After about 20 minutes the same lifeguard from the previous day came over and told me my 8 year old is a bad swimmer. I told her he is still learning, and she said she knows these things and he is bad. She came over another 10 minutes later and threw a flotation device at him and said he must wear it. He threw a fit because he did not want to wear it and he could stand fine in the shallow end (Plus my husband and I were right next to him in the pool). The lifeguard then proceeded to speak Greek to another guest and talk about my son and how we should not be letting him swim. Little did she know that my husband can speak Greek and heard every word. We immediately left and my husband went to talk to the manager about her behavior. The manager seemed to take our concerns seriously and encouraged us to go back to the pool, but I did not feel comfortable going back there with her there. Besides with the mob of people lining the pool sunbathing, we felt like the kids needed to be quiet and not be splashing around. It is a very odd setup.Overall, do not stay here, especially with kids!",2,Wished we chose another hotel...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d250590-r508717615-President_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,P-townmomm

The neighborhood nearby probably isn't great. It's not far from Ommonia, and that place has greatly deteriorated. However, do understand that you probably will avoid trouble if you use common sense. For instance, the later you stay out in most cities, the more likely you will run into trouble. Yes, I have driven in New York City and Philadelphia with my family at 10 PM in 1989, and it was frightening to say the least. Athens isn't even anywhere as bad as that,so just stay in. Also, common reminder, don't leave your valuables in the car. I have had friends had their shoes stolen in the Rutgers University Parking lot along with their valuables because it was in plain sight of the thieves. The bad things that could happen to you in this neighborhood are avoidable if you just use common sense. I am sure most readers DO HAVE IT. Just remember, not to let your guard down while on vacation. You are in a city where pick pocketing can happen and is currently experiencing an economic recession. Now for the actual hotel. Take your valuables with you because there is no safe in the room. The room itself does the job. You have a clean bed, check. You have sizable bathroom that is clean, check. You have wireless internet, check. You have a television set, check. It's a hotel that does the job it's meant to do. It shields you from the elements. It has air conditioning for a hot summer's day and it's reasonably clean. In addition, it's also convenient. It's not far from a Metro Station and you can access the airport line very easily as well. You are just a few stops away from the Acropolis and Plaka. The location of this hotel is just spot on perfect. This hotel isn't really a place you want to stay for too long though. There are a lot of moral fiber who live around the area and in the hotel. They're not going to hassle you, but BOY are they LOUD at night. I heard an argument next door to my room, and I tell you I could hear it vividly through the walls too. They're not thin walls either. I was able to sleep through it because this was the hotel I stayed on my last night in Greece. Before I stayed here, this was my trip schedule: Athens for 8 hours, 3 AM wake up to go to Zakynthos, Back to Athens then drove to Delphi and Meteora, Drove back to Athens 3 AM flight to Santorini, Ferry to Rhodes, Flight Back to Athens. By the time I rolled into this hotel, I was exhausted and NOTHING was going to wake me up. I needed three Alarm Clock intervals to wake up the next day. However, in a normal state, I know fact the people arguing would have kept me up all night., and I would have woken up irate. So this Hotel is just perfect for your first night here, or your last night. Pretty much it's a hotel to on the first day and your last day of the trip, and it's a good launch pad area for your vacation or your departure.",3,Come here if you're seriously dead tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d651445-r502345960-Hotel_Cosmos-Athens_Attica.html,David L

Rooms are a good size and have all the necessary amenities you would look for in a hotel like this, however the a/c temp can not be regulated which is frustrating in high heat and wifi in rooms is poor.We checked into the hotel late in the night following a trip to the islands. We had previously dropped some bags at the hotel before we left for our trip to the islands and found the reception staff to be rude.Check in was fairly straightforward however it took a few attempts for them to understand we had bags left in the storage room.We went up to our room (4th floor) and were instantly hit by the smell of stale smoke. We had requested a non smoking room and there was a sign stating non smoking but on the other hand there was a ash try on the table? The smell was really bad and when I called down to reception to complain and I was told the room was non smoking and that the hotel was fully booked and nothing else was available. I was not happy and asked for someone to come up to the room. The male receptionist was not the most helpful but I understood he had nothing else available and accepted that we were stuck with the room. I thanked him for his help and asked him to leave a message for the hotel manager to contact me in the morning as I was not happy with then room and wanted him to see me to discuss further.I then proceeded to unpack, 10 minutes passed and the receptionist appeared with a new room key saying he had another room for us which smelled much better. I was surprised but grateful for his help and proceeded to move rooms.In our new room we got ready for bed and switched on the a/c, this is when we started to smell cigarette smoke. The smell was coming from the vent. We ended up just going to bed with no a/c.The next morning we reported this to reception and yet again was dealt with in a rude manor. She said we had already been moved once but she will ask maintenance to take a look. We later discovered the 5th floor is smoking and so I believe this is why we could smell smoke coming through the air vents.So my tip if you decide to stay in this hotel is to avoid 4th floor rooms and be prepared for rude staff.Breakfast was average with limited choice and the wifi throughout the hotel was poor.I won't be staying here again and wish I had taken more note from previous reviews before booking.",2,Good Value!

The lady with the glasses is the nicest one of them all. The bedroom had stains all over the floor and curtains. Smelt really bad and the bathroom had pubic hair on the floor, which was so gross. We decided to eat at the rooftop bar because we just flew in and didn't feel like walking to get food, only to wait and how and no one shows up. We ended up walking into the city and eating at one of our favourite restaurants. We can back and though we would just watch the sun set with the acropolis. We were there for two hours then a lady turns up and asks if we want to order. We say no because we went out to eat and she said if we didn't order anything we would have to leave as it's only for paying customers... umm what! We paid to stay at the hotel!! My boyfriend decided to just get a beer and she looked at me and when I said I still didn't want anything she gave me a death stare and snobed me off.

Even when they weren't making noise the air conditioning was so loud you couldn't hold a conversation. We had people banging on our door at early hours of the morning and even one morning someone tried to get in at 6am. That same day house keeping came in at 7:30am when we were still sleeping. We told the front desk but they said it couldn't of been house keeping as they start at 8am. So if not them, then who had a keycard???Okay now for the most important part, THEY'RE NOT 4 STAR!

Also, the reception desk personnel would call a taxi for us Ms. Marianna put in touch with a local travel agency to arrange for our road trips to various archeological sites in the Peloponnese.

(The hotel's roof-top also offers a similar view, only better! We made two late night sojurns there to enjoy the absorbing beauty of the famed Acropolis-Parthenon skyline all lit up and looking beautiful.) As for the amenities, the room had two twin beds, a perfectly working air-conditioning system, a clean bathroom, and wi-fi. The bed linens were fresh and spotlessly clean--every night we returned to the hotel to sleep. The hotel has an elevator---and it works, always!Situated in the heart of the Plaka and a stone's throw from the Arch of Hadrian, we could not have asked for a better location--the Acropolis (and the museum) was less than a five-minute walk; the Plaka Flea Market took us about ten minutes to get to, and the Syntagma Square with the Parliament Building, the National Botanical Gardens, and the eatreries and shopping centers was no more than a leisurely ten to twelve-minutes stroll. Cafes and restuarants, and shops line the immediate vicinity of the hotel and yet the premise itself is remarkably quiet.

My husband and I only stayed for two nights – before and after our trip to Syros – but we’ll definitely choose Titania for a longer stay next time we visit Athens.The rooms are spacious, functional and beautifully decorated. Cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city. We were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the Parthenon. As we had to catch the ferry to Syros very early in the morning, we greatly appreciated the early morning breakfast buffet consisting of a wide variety of jams, bread, rolls, croissants, cheeses, delicatessen, fruit, cereals and sweets. Normal breakfast includes hot dishes as well, such as eggs, omelette, bacon, baked beans.You should not leave Titania Hotel without having a drink or dinner at Olive Graden situated on the 11th floor and offering a superb view to the Pathenon by night. Although the restaurant is a bit pricey, it’s well worth the experience. The food is excellent and the service is impeccable. All the staff are very polite and helpful.

The streets around the hotel are not very nice but exploring the area further many streets in the Athens area seem run down. But once you are in the hotel you feel far away from it all. The hotel is located right near the metro station so you don't have far at all to go if you want to catch the train.I stayed in a room on floor 6 - the room was a nice size and very clean. The only let down was the balcony view, it was overlooking other hotels and a dirty street. But this didn't really bother me too much as I didn't spend much time in the room as I was out exploring Athens. The bed was very loud and creaky, any movement in the bed made a loud sound - sounded like it was going to collapse. In the mornings from half 6 to half 10 is the breakfast buffet. There is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up. One night at the hotel I decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the 9th floor (top of the hotel) it had a great view of the Acropolis - you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat. The menu didn't have much food choice. I went for the burger, it looked great but came out cold so I had to ask them to warm it up. The waiters were polite and apologetic. The afters were lovely. Next to the restaurant is a little bar area that you can sit at and watch the telly. After having a dinner here which was a let down I decided to try the room service as it looked cheap and had a lot more choice then the hotel restaurant. The food from room service was tasty - so would recommend using this rather than going to the hotel restaurant. The pool is also on the ninth floor, it has a few sunbeds and seats around it. The pool isn't huge but it is long enough to have a little swim. On the 4th floor is they gym- but I never visited this.Overall I would recommend this hotel as it's good value for money.

The pool and rooftop bar are also highly exaggerated based on the photos and even with a 50% discount card for your first drinks everyone gets as a guest, you are paying more for beers than at any of the surrounding restaurants.

No negatives that I can think of other than it could be a little closer to the tourist attractions but don't think its fair to ding Hilton too much for that and anyone should be able to walk 2 miles as a tourist.I did not try the hotel restaurants as I wanted to try the local cuisine.

Regularly stay in Hilton hotels and various other 5 stars around the world . Booked the Hilton as one of higher rated hotels in Athens and thought it was a good bet, that it would be a good hotel with excellent Hilton service . Unfortunately it is VERY disappointing. The building doesn't look great from the outside and the lobby area is average at best. It was my wife's birthday and emailed ahead to see if they could do anything to make our stay more special and asked if it would be possible to get a nice room with a view . Unfortunately the room is on 3rd floor right outside the noisy ice machine dispenser. Asked to be moved but rooms offered had no view and were very dark. They said they had arranged a cake for her birthday when I flagged that I was hoping for something in the room - but I wasn't sure if they were just saying they had arranged something when I asked about it. I asked for it to be in The room at 7 as we had to go for a mealAt 730. Nothing turned up. When we returned from our meal the cakes were in the room, but after a 5 course meal we couldn't eat them . We asked for the cakes to be taken away the next day as they had been there over night and it took over an hour to come and collect. The room is ok apart from the noisy ice machine , but not up to usual Hilton standards . There is no complimentary water offered which is probably the first hotel we have stayed in where we have not been offered this. There is also no room in the fridge to store anything i.e. The cakes that were sent to the room. Also the bathroom and Shower are average with no wow factor. Also no turn down service - which was abit of a disappointment. Service overall I would say is below average - ladies in entrance to the fitness centre /spa had bad attitude and looked like I was annoying them when wanted access to the gym. Also when I asked for a towel for the pool for me and my wife they were reluctant to give me one as is only one towel per person - I must look like I was going to steal the towels ! In terms of prices for food and drinks I expect to pay more in hotels but 20 euros for 2 beers and 30 euros for 2 cocktails is slightly ridiculous. Also 21 euros for a sandwich is abit of a joke. Service by the pool also poor , on the first day we had to keep going to the bar to get drink as not enough waiting staff. Today I asked a waiter to get me a drink but he said it wasn't his job, despite being in a blue shirt carrying glasses of water . After some negotiation he agreed to get my drink though it took 20 mins to arrive. If you are thirsty be prepared to wait! Our flight leaves early evening tomorrow I'm hoping they will allow us to leave luggage somewhere so we can sit by the pool for the afternoon and hopefully they will provide somewhere to shower, but i don't hold much hope and I'm sure if there is a way they can charge me they will! Oh on a positive the reception staff are pleasant.

We were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the Acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room. You quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual; smoked salmon, freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals. If you want a traditional English breakfast, the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the warmest.Secondly, where to eat at night. If you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again, you will see a sign for Vassilios Taverna. It is worth a visit. Don't be put off by the area. The food there was very good and very reasonable. Rest on your first night if you are not sure where to go.Finally, exploring from the hotel. We had a taxi to the Acropolis at 8am and it cost €5. If you hold a student discount card (NUS Extra) - use it! Most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about €60, which was some saving.

Truly, the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional. We booked an eight day Greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through Italy for 4 weeks through an Aegean travel agency. We had two nights in Athens before heading to Sifnos and Serifos islands and then one night in Athens again, before ending our trip. We were picked up at the airport and transferred to Hotel Economy by a great taxi driver. I guess, we should have known by the Hotel name what kind of place it would be. First of all. It's basically in the ""Red Light District"" as I would call it. There are Therese's shops/theaters two minutes in any direction. The hotel is very dated. The beds are hard, and the pillows are harder. The bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind. They could use plastic shower curtains, you flood the bathroom when you shower. Thank goodness for drains in the floor. You have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs, actually...sort of handy. The refrigerator doesn't work when you leave the room (it's connected to the key) so there's no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour. It's very noisy outside as well as above you. The continental breakfast starts ta 8:30, that's late if you're from the US. It's a pretty typical Greek/Italian spread. We had to leave early two of the three mornings we were there and one morning they opened early, that was really nice. The other morning we had to leave at 5:00am so they packed us a breakfast for the road, that was much appreciated. Again, the guys at the front were great, the hotel is just lacking.

Excellent value. Pool is just right and bar food and drinks are good standard. Staff are all very good and professional and friendly too. Beach is literally two mins away, 30 seconds if you run. 10 min walk to the town with some really nice places to eat. Tram is about 5 min away which is great although the buses seem quicker (Greek driving I think!). Breakfast is really very good value. Good selection of hot and cold and all sorts. Cleanest hotel I've been to for a while and I've been to a few with work. There's a bus stop outside the front of the hotel - worth looking into for the airport run otherwise expect to pay over €45 for a taxi. We did. Felt robbed. Although on a main road the hotel is accessed via a quiet side road and the beach is out the back over another not too busy road. Really it's fine.

A gorgeous American breakfast awaited us every morning and once again so clean with lovely staff to greet us.

The pool bar restaurant was gorgeous opened daily serving lovely delicious food and drinks amazing coctails. The life guard George was one of the loveliest people we met on the holiday just a pure gentlemen. He had fresh pool towels for us and anything we wanted he hit amazing service from all of them. I would recommend Panorama resturant (I will do a seperate review later) about 15 minutes away in taxi the most amazing seafood resturant on our trip) Also Athens Sailing tours amazing!!!

This is not a resort hotel but a friendly local establishment that we would stay at again. We stayed at the hotel because of a recommendation of one of our sailing coaches who lives in the area. It's walking distance to all the marinas in Paleo Faliro and there are a lot of restaurants both inland of the hotel and on the beach. The rooms are a little small, we had the family suite as we traveled with a friend of ours. It comprised of two double rooms with bathrooms and a living room. Both rooms had balconies and the noise from the busy street in front was almost completely negated by the two layers of patio doors. The only down point was one of the rooms had an older AC unit and it barely kept up with the heat in July. Maid service was good and overall the rooms were comfortable. Views were very good but only enjoyable after 7pm due to the heat. The highlight of the Hotel are their restaurants. The breakfast room is on the 7th floor and does a very nice job with full service. Its extra for the latte's but go ahead and order one, they were inexpensive and good. Breakfast is usually included but ask anyway when you reserve. The Breakfast Manager was very helpful, unfortunately we didn't get his name but he ran a tight ship and no need to go to Starbucks 3 blocks down the street. The main restaurant was excellent. The food was simple Greek and Italian cuisine and the Manager, Vasilis, was very friendly and introduced us to a wide selection of Greek Wines. If you're a wine person you can trust him with the selection. The other staff were great too but we didn't get their names. The beer is cold.Other comments on the hotel:Ask the front desk for local restaurants as they gave us some great recommendationsATM is around the corner Walk along the seawall north and visit the big marina for a dock walk at night. We felt safe and there are some nice restaurants in the marina too.Grocery is also around the corner. no need to go to the bigger one about 15 blocks away. Go down to the Poseidon for a beach dinner one night. very charming.Taxi to the attractions in Athens about 12 EUR. Pool is nice but too hot during the day. Go for a swim across the road at the beach.",4,12 days @ the Coral Hotel for the 420 Europeans (sailing).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3695532-d227383-r507809075-Coral_Hotel_Athens-Paleo_Faliro_Athens_Attica.html,John L

Going to the city centre is very easy, only two metro stops to Syntagma and three to Monisteraki. The best way to get to the hotel from the airport is also by metro. Go off at Megarou Mousikis, take the escalator to the left when leaving the station. Then you walk around the corner by the cafeteria, go down the street two blocks, then you see a blue sign saying ""Holiday Suites 30 m."". Prices are 10 euros for a single ticket, but there are discounts for return tickets and for groups starting already at two persons.

Room on 5th floor (502?) was fairly quiet and clean and had a partial view of Acropolis which was a special surprise us as we did not pay for a room with view. Breakfast buffet was above average but breakfast room was a little hot once the sun was up. At night, the rooftop terrace had breathtaking views of the Parthenon. Staff members were pleasant and smiled at lot. Bathroom kind of had an odor at first coming from the drain. It went away after opening the window and airing it out. Air conditioning worked well. Wi fi was not great but OK.Just a couple of notes: The elevator was the size of a phonebooth but did work well. The hotel is located up a steep hill. We did not mind, but I would think it would be inconvenient if you were not used it. Our 5th floor room you could hear footsteps of the workers in the breakfast area (6th floor) very early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to get a room below the 5th floor.It was a 7 or 8 minute walk to the Plaka district (lots of shops and restaurants) and Acropoiis Museum... a little farther to get to Acropolis itself. The metro was nearby and it was how we got to/from the airport as I heard taxi cabs were expensive.Overall, very pleased with this hotel and it was a good value to boot!",5,Great Value for our Modest Budget and Close to Attractions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d1197866-r502258668-Acropolis_Ami_Boutique_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,sunchaser22

When asked about restaurant recommendation, she would answer ""anything is good"". When asked about airport shuttle pickup point, she actually gave the wrong information out of carelessness.

I was very pleased with both stays, although my rooms were very different. This is a bright, well-decorated hotel with a lot of unexpected touches: my favorite was the lobby chairs with outlets for convenient charging of cell phones, laptops, etc., while you wait for friends or taxis. Breakfast was included in my price, and you can get made to order omelets and fresh-squeezed orange juice! The staff is the real star of this hotel: they are friendly, professional and superbly attentive. During my first stay, I stayed in a junior suite which was nice and roomy with a super clean bathroom and included great amenities such as a room safe, flat screen tv, hot water pot and a mini bar that leaves room for your personal food items. Free Wi-Fi is included. They also have an in-house restaurant where you can get anything from a burger and fries to Greek salad. On my second stay, I was given one of the newly renovated rooms on the 5th floor, and while they were ultra-modern and absolutely stunning, it just wasn't my style, and so I asked for, and received, a no-hassle room change. They were even kind enough to have one of the bellmen take me around and show me other available rooms so I could choose what I wanted. Now, that is service! The room I have now is one of the older rooms, but that is by my choice; it is very comfortable, and still has the flat screen, water pot, mini bar and room safe, along with a super clean, separate bathroom. The hotel is within walking distance of eateries, restaurants, cafes, bars, and even a small supermarket. It is also just a few easy blocks from the Megaro Mousikis metro stop that will take you to downtown Athens to see the sights and do shopping. The hotel also offers very reasonably priced laundry service. I highly recommend, and plan to stay again on future trips to Athens!",5,Terrific service and great unexpected touches!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d228918-r498479250-Airotel_Alexandros-Athens_Attica.html,jacqueline h

The hotel is quite old but then so does the whole street of Athens I think. The room is pretty good in the sense that it is fairly spacious, bed is comfortable & the shower area is bigger than our 2 previous hotels in Santorini/Naxos (ie. 5 x 3 big tiles vs 3 x 3 square tiles).The location is the best imo. It is less than 5 minute walk from Syntagma metro or the X95 bus stop. There are a lot of choices of restaurants around & you can walk to nearly attractions easily. We came in the summer so the weather is too hot for us to walk too far even though we are used to humid weather in Singapore. It might not be a good idea to return late to the hotel because Athens can be dangerous with so many beggars, thieves & robberies. Breakfast is served from 6:30am onwards & it was fairly decent ie. typical bread/sausage/salad/coffee etc. The lifts are really cramp…only 2 lifts are available, it is very slow with a max of 4 person capacity & everytime you must pull/push the door to open.

We booked an executive room and I emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion. I received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this. On arrival the hotel was ""full"". This was the least of our problems!The hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel:Taxi at 60 euros (On our return to the airport we were quoted 40 euros by hotel staff which we booked).MetroBusWe decided to take the Metro as we thought 60 euros rather expensive. The Metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband's passport were stolen from my handbag. This resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the British Embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement. Day 1 ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city. Apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within hours.Our executive room was nothing like executive. The bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well. Therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath. I reported this but the engineer could make no difference.Toiletries were replaced each day although the quality was not great.It is unusual not to have tea/coffee facilities in a 5* hotel room these days. I was also surprised that irons and ironing boards are not supplied.The restaurant was lovely but the evening meal prices extremely high so we ate out. We had breakfast at the hotel as part of our package. It was adequate but the same every day. I only had the cooked option once and the eggs were swimming in fat and cold. The swimming pool was small with no room for enough chairs and loungers round it. The main issue for me as a 5 ft non swimmer was the depth. 1.5m to 3.5m in a very short distance. Therefore I could not go further into the pool than the first 3 steps. I realise there is nothing to be done about this but some floatation aids would help. The hotel is immaculately kept in the public areas and the staff were very pleasant and friendly. Athens is sadly showing its economic situation and graffiti is absolutely everywhere. It is a very different city to the one we last visited in 1971.The hotel is extremely well situated within easy walking distance of the Plaka area with Restaurants and tourist shops and the Archeological sites.

Its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant, which I shall review separately, with breathtaking panoramic views that include the Acropolis and the Lycabettus Hill.

Both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool, although our second room had only a stall shower, but no bathtub as had been in the first. The swimming pool was another welcome feature. Though not very large, it was clean, temperate and enough for swimming short laps. There were sunbeds (which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel) as well at patio chairs and tables. The staff was uniformly courteous and helpful. And finally, the price which included a sumptuous breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was quite reasonable.

This hotel is a bit deceiving for a 5-stars, but with a perfect location in the city center of Athens.The rooms are comfortable, clean, quiet and spacious. The wifi is working correctly. Only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand, despite the easy in-wall control system. This wasn't much of a problem for one night, but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed longer.My main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel, beginning with the reception hall. Arriving at the Royal Olympic doesn't feel like arriving at a 5-stars. We arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready. Nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time. Similarly, the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our in-room snacks to come a bit later on. I also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected. This was corrected only after we noticed it.It is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool, but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying in.What saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the Acropolis and the city center. There is plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, you just have to walk 5 minutes to reach the athenian-style summer atmosphere, a beautiful experience especially at night.I would suggest staying at the Royal Olympic for one night before heading to the beautiful paradise of the greek islands.",4,One night for the location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d206779-r507778570-Royal_Olympic_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Michel S

From there it was a 15 minute walk to the hotel. I was there on a Sunday, so almost all of the businesses along the way we're closed. The area is a bit run down, a lot of graffiti for sure, but overall felt safe.I walked from the hotel to the Monastzraki area for dinner and it took 25 minutes or so, with very little to see along the way - not sure if this was just because it was a Sunday.The National Archaeology Museum was directly across the street, so that is very convenient.The stay was decent for the price.",3,"Decent Hotel, Not in Main Tourist Area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d227377-r507784803-Best_Western_Museum_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,2fromTX

Their most important assets are their employees. People who stood out for us were the Front Desk, especially Maria and Dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend 3 extra days in Athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship. The location is excellent and close to almost everything. The area seems a little dodgy at night however, it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world, perhaps safer than most. There are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel, with an excellent dessert shop right next door. The rooms are spacious, the public areas well laid out, the food really good (especially the breakfast and room service) and the decor is modern yet functional. This is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment. I especially like the interactive smart TV's in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device. The wifi is free and fast. The beds and pillows (they have pillow menus) are extremely comfortable and all areas, including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after. They have plugs next to the beds and also a USB charging cable for telephones or iPads. The AC worked well, especially during the 38 Celsius heat whilst we were there. The rooms have fully stocked minibars and a highly quality brand of soap, body lotion and shampoo is provided in large pump action bottles. We were very happy with our stay here and are already planning our next visit to Athens in December. We shall certainly again stay at Athens Tiare Hotel. The only feedback I would give the management is to provide drinking glasses in the bathrooms, even if they are plastic disposable ones.

You can easily walk to all of the major tourist destinations. We had a room on the top floor with a view of the Acropolis from our balcony. Overall, the hotel and the rooms could use a major update. It's clean enough, but very dated. I certainly would not consider it a five star hotel. Breakfast was fine; nothing special but nothing to complain about. We also dined at the rooftop restaurant; the view is fantastic, the food is decent and, as expected, a bit expensive.

The good: I was very impressed by the entrance/lobby of the hotel which is absolutely stunning. I was also very pleased with the hotel staff who helped us with our luggage and allowed us a slightly later checkout because our flight was a bit later. I was also very impressed with their breakfast. They had various options ranging from eggs and bacon to yogurt and dessert and everything in between! I know what authentic Greek food tastes like and am often am disappointed by these Greece hotels food quality, however this hotel had an overall great breakfast and their Bougatsa was one of the best I've ever had! The gift shop, which is located near the breakfast area, was also very large and offered great discounts. The location of this hotel was also perfect!The room itself had its pros and cons. The good: The view, the bathroom and the cleanliness. The view was great! We had a balcony with a side view of the Acropolis which was very nice. The bathroom was also very nice and large with a large tub/shower and a large, bright mirror. This was perfect given we were 3 women who needed the space to put on makeup! The room was also very clean.Now for the bad: Our room smelled very bad 70% of the time. At first it was more so like a sewer smell but we woke up in the morning very early to a horrible fish smell. We had to keep the balcony door open to get some of the smell out which made the room very hot so the whole time we had to choose between hot and fresh smelling room or cold and smelly room. We were at the end of a hallway and when you approached that part of the hallway, you would smell it. With that said, I'm not sure whether it's just our room or the whole place but regardless I would like to see the hotel do something about this. This smell is not a lack of cleaning or anything on the part of the staff, but regardless occurs and should be addressed. Our room also had a problem with the door knob to the bathroom. Every time one of us went in there it would not lock; we knew when someone was in there not to enter but it was still slightly annoying. However even worse: when we were leaving the door randomly locked and one person in our group got stuck in the bathroom. One of the hotel employees came with the key and he still couldn't open it and had to call the technician who finally got it open. They handled this manner in a very attentive and fast way however it is also something that the hotel needs to look into ASAP.",3,"Not what I expected, but not horrible either",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d230391-r508635671-Divani_Palace_Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,Alexis M

We could see the Acropolis from our room, esp. impressive when it is lit at night. It is close to walk to the Acropolis and the Museum. We walked the few blocks from the Metro Station after taking the metro from the airport and had no difficulty finding the hotel. The bed was a king size and comfortable. The bathroom had a large tub with a shower. Our hallway and room was freshly painted--didn't feel ""tired"" to us. The air conditioner kept the room at a comfortable temp and we didn't hear outside noise. There was an outdoor pool, which we used every afternoon as it was over 100 degrees the week we were in Athens. It is easy to use the metro to get to the other areas of the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the lobby is large and impressive. We saw many different restaurants nearby as we were walking around.

The hotel is in a good location, common areas are well maintained, the rooms are well sized, modern and soundproof. Some of the stuff was very attentive, breakfast was great. I would like to point out the things that in my opinion really distinguish a good hotel from a great one. As soon as I arrived for my check in around 12pm on a Sunday afternoon, there was only one employee at the reception and was busy with an airlines crew that was checking in before me. I was standing there, waiting for my turn and for approx. 15’ the receptionist didn’t raise her eyes from the computer screen and the documents in front of her. A simple nod of the head or an eye check would have been enough but she didn’t even notice me. The same day I also noticed that some food trays remained outside the rooms in the hotel aisles for quite a few hours. Maybe the hotel was understaffed that day.The thing that really put me off though and made me write this review is the following. A few hours after I checked out, I realized I had forgotten in the mini bar fridge an envelope with my name on it, which contained some medical treatment I was using at the moment. I called the reception and they connected me with the lost and found department. I informed them about this incident and they told me they’d look into it and I should call them back in a while. When I dialed again, I was told that unfortunately the maid had thrown the envelope away. The lady on the phone was very kind and apologetic and she advised me to call the hotel manager to report it, mentioning his name. I called again at the reception, asking to talk to the manager but because he was unavailable at the moment I was transferred to another manager or something (don’t remember names or roles). I was quite upset at the moment but I calmly described to him the incident, which he was already aware of. The purpose of the call was just to report what had happened, so they can try and improve in that area. However, the person on the other side of the phone in an arrogant way replied “what do you want now, we can’t compensate you for this, people leave things back all the time and we throw away a lot of stuff everyday”. I replied that I’m not seeking any compensation, I just deemed necessary to report this to the hotel management so they can train their stuff or do whatever they think is necessary to improve (I work in the customer service industry and feedback is always welcome to me). Quickly he realized that he shouldn’t have responded like that and he apologized for the incident. However, damage had been made. This is something that you don’t expect from a 5 star hotel. Should he had responded with something like “sorry for that, next time you stay with us you will receive a complimentary drink/dinner/night/anything” they would have won me. With this attitude though, I don’t think I’d stay there again.",3,Not up to the expectations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d229415-r508105277-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Athens_City_Centre-Athens_Attica.html,George V

In part the staff (Eva & Oana) push my rating over the limit of 5 stars. This will be my first choice for my next trip to Athens. The location is perfect. It is just outside the crazy Plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets. It takes minutes to walk to the acropolis, ancient agora, or the fabulous National Archeological museum. The rooms are solid and silent. I never heard any noise from other rooms or the street. The finishing is beautiful, if you like polished marble bathrooms (floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet). Breakfast food selection is great. Everything from the basic toasts (4 different breads) with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats. There are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections. The finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time. For example, Eva knew after the first day that we had 2 daughters. She readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and I look for a table. In none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four. Lastly, someone on TripAdvisor said the walk to the National museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea. Oana told us to try the walk and gave us a map of the route. The walk was great. Aolou street was beautiful and full of great restaurants and stores. I am so glad we listened to Oana and I am glad she bothered to ask about our plans for the day.

This is a very well located hotel. It's about 3 minutes walk from the metro (Victoria station) - a lovely square with nice restaurants on it and even more places to eat within a 5-15 minute walk - and all incredibly good and cheap. It takes only a few minutes on the metro - about 15 - to reach the main sights (Acropolis for example) but you will save 50% at least on your accommodation if you stay at Centrotel rather than near Syntagma or in Plaka. I stayed here on my own, and as a woman, I never felt uncomfortable walking back to the hotel at night. There is nothing dodgy about this area - it just isn't touristy.

We were able to get from the airport to the hotel no problems via the metro at the cost of €10. You can also purchase a metro ticket for the city for 5 days at €9 each which was also perfect for us. Due to our early flight home we preferred to book a taxi back to the airport which the hotel was more than happy to arrange for us (taxi was €42 fixed price).

Request DeniedI was told that I could just cancel the room via the third party agent. Spoke to IHG guest relations explained the situation. The agent was helpful and understanding. At no point did I ever seek a refund knowing that the terms were prepayment and non-refundable. The agent contacted the property directly on my behalf to try and negotiate some sort of upgrade given the cost of the room. Unfortunately the guest relations agent was advised no, I would have to pay for that.I have a young family (two children under 10) they can not utilise the other room. To be honest I am not upset that I booked two rooms I take responsibility for that, however I was hoping the property could see it was a mistake and perhaps compensate us a little.

The rooftop bar/restaurant has a real wow factor when you first walk in there at night, but the service seemed a bit slow for drinks, As has been mentioned in previous reviews, the breakfast is really good. Lots of variety to cater for all tastes, from fruit, various breads, drinks etc, it was a very nice experience. The bedrooms were a little small, but about right for a city hotel. Why only 4 stars? The lifts were very small, hot and slow, and there were only two in operation. The kids were happy to use the stairs, but it was a little frustrating sometimes waiting for the lifts.

We stayed here for four nights from July 20th till the 24th. Andreas and his team are super friendly, professional and bend over backwards to make sure nothing is too much trouble. We are a family of four and did not feel uncomfortable (to the contrary felt very comfortable as some rooms can accommodate four people) as I would say this hotel is more suited for couples - very cool vibe with beautiful bedrooms !The hotel is beautiful with very tasteful decor, quality furnishings, huge bedrooms, gorgeous bathroom with a cast iron tub in the room in addition to a walk-in shower in the bathroom, luxury toiletries, Nescafe coffee machine, plush towels and bathrobes. Andronis is extremely well located in the heart of Athens in a very cool and trendy area of Athens called Psirri - full of restaurants and quirky stores and located near all the major attractions of Athens but did not feel touristy at all. We would definitely stay in this area again.The hidden secret of Andronis has to be the restaurant. It is highly underrated and not much advertised but hands down I have to say, as a massive foodie and a hospitality professional, the food is EXCEPTIONAL ! Although we only had the pleasure of the breakfast, I can safely assume the rest of the menu (which looked very scrumptious indeed) has to be amazing. Overall, I must say with all the years of global travelling and staying in some amazing places, I have to admit Andronis is definitely among the top of the list of places to stay and what makes it even more special is the outstanding team led by Andreas - highly professional, friendly, knowledgeable and extremely service oriented !Well done Andreas and your team and see you again.

We felt welcomed as we stepped on the restaurant floor (there is no hotel reception). Very friendly, but yet very professional.The room - we had the room on the 4th floor, so we had this huge deck with a nice little place to sit outside with a nice overall view. You can`t ask for a nicer room, the bed was really comfortable, nice bath, little kitchenette....and the room was extra clean.The location - we didn`t stay long enough to experience the city but it is really centrally located. It is located in a little street with some bars and restaurants so it can get a bit noisy but we didn`t mind it and being on the 4th floor kind of cut down the noise.The restaurant - we ate at the restaurant for a late dinner and it was great. We went with recommendations from the waiter and were not disappointed. A lot of items on the menu did look good.The only sad thing is that we were there for only one short night as we needed to leave at 6AM to take the ferry. But they were nice enough to bring us a full cabaret of things (yogourt, fruits, croissants, etc.) for breakfast the night before so we could eat even if the restaurant was not opened! They also arranged a taxi for us.We had a great experience and we certainly hope to be able to come back to Athens one day and come back to stay at this really nice little hotel (only 4 rooms).",5,Simply perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10477063-r506521347-Andronis_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,titotherio
"August 2, 2017","19 Patission, Athens 10432, Greece"," Polis Grand Hotel ",4.0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d570105-Reviews-Polis_Grand_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"###June 25-26:We arrived at our hotel Polis Grand in Athens, and were completely exhausted from the flight, plus a 7 hour time zone difference. The Hotel is a 3.5/5 in my opinion. The hotel itself is clean, but like many European Hotels – the room is very small, as is the bathroom. However; the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it. They put out a lot of hot and cold dishes, plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast (too many things to list, including the drinks). Overall, this hotel is nice and the service is friendly, and is good for a quick 2 day stopover, on your way to see other part of Greece (ie…The Greek Isles). While I am here, I will take this opportunity to mention our 2 day stay in Athens…When we got to our hotel at 10:30am from the Airport, they told us that check in time was 3:00pm and after. So we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of Athens and eventually wound up at the Monastiraki square. We had a Gyros, and went back to our hotel to take a nap. We woke up a little later, and went back to eat dinner at Monastiraki in the evening. This is a very lively place, full of lights, music, shops, street vendors, and live bands. It was entertaining. As far as the food goes, it was good, but unfortunately being from Toronto, I cannot in all honesty state the food in some of the Athens places we had; was better than some of the Greek restaurants we have in Toronto. We are truly spoiled in Toronto with the authenticity of the various ethnic foods which are available. That’s not to say the food in Athens is bad; however it is more to commend the authenticity of the food in Toronto. From the Tzatziki to the Souvlaki to the Gyros to the Greek Salad. They all taste just as good in Toronto, if not better. Btw - the feta cheese in these Greek salads are a 3""x4"" block of feta they put right on top of the salad (Personally I prefer a lot of Sprinkled Feta in my Greek Salad – but to each his own). The salad is huge, and the tomatoes taste very different from a North American tomato from the grocery store, which tells me the tomatoes in Greece were very fresh organic tomatoes they were using.  ###June 27:This was our second full day in Athens, and we walked around on some of the Athens streets to some highend boutique stores, and found the purses to be better priced in Athens, even with the Conversion Rate: TRAVEL TIP: If you are looking for a high end purse, you should buy it while you are travelling in Europe, because you are refunded the tax (VAT), which ultimately decreases the overall price of the purchase. The only caveat is that you have to mail the proof of purchase to have your CC eventually credited. We also did a sightseeing tour to the Museum, and of course the Acropolis. Since we went at the end of June, it was extremely hot, and furthermore, we were experiencing a Heat wave at that time also. It was Very Very Hot. And since you have to climb up the Hill to get to the Acropolis, it got very hot and very tiring.  TRAVEL TIP: Make sure you have a big Thermos or 2 in your knapsack to keep your water cold, else the water will get warm very quickly. And believe me; you will need the cold water, during the Hot Season. TRAVEL TIP: The Travel company tour for 65 EURO pp from the hotel was way overpriced. Not required. Alternative is to get a taxi and go to the acropolis yourself. This bus tour took you on a sightseeing tour of some of the things to see in Athens, but you remained on the bus until you got to the Acropolis (with one stop in between at a small Soccer stadium). After which, we went to the old Greek Plaka area in the evening, which is a nice long strip of Patios and Restaurants, and had some delicious Eggplant appetizer (sort of like Baba Ghanoush) and some Greek beer on one of the Patios.After 2 days in Athens; we went to the Athens port to board the Jet ferry to Mykonos.....Which is a different post you should read. :-)",4,"2 Stay Stopover @ Polis Grand in Athens, prior to Mykonos....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d570105-r508236954-Polis_Grand_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,KP12014

It consists of only 4 rooms, which I wasn't completely aware of at the time of booking. We booked an Acropolis view room, which I'm not sure was the best room for us. The Acropolis view suite is on the top floor (4th) and consists of 2 levels with the bedroom being on the top level accessible by a very steep spiral staircase. Even though my husband and I are both very fit and work out all the time, the stairs were a pain, not to mention pretty dangerous if needing to get up in the middle of the night or if one had had one too many cocktails. The top floor location also made cooling it very difficult. Granted the temperatures in Athens were in the 90's, but we had to close the curtains and keep the air on all day to ensure it was cool enough at the end of the day. The staff was wonderful, and the lack of lobby was fine given there was a charming cafe on the ground floor that was open all the time.

Easy walking distance to ancient attractions. A handy Super Market at the end of the street. There are plenty of places to eat in the Plaka and we particularly enjoyed the Gyros at the takeaway directly opposite our street. This hotel could make itself even better by paying attention to a few easy to fix details in the room. For example having two coffee mugs when two people are staying, instructions on using the safe, ensuring the TV is tuned and working and extra pillows in the room.

Breakfast was nothing special and the breakfast area was arranged in away that it was quite tricky to try to collect different things especially if there were other people around the ""buffet"".The roof top terrace was so nice and it was really relaxing to sit there. There were two things which put us quite off. One evening we came from the city and the lady in front desk handed the key to us. When we were in the elevator, we noticed that we got a key to a WRONG ROOM. I completely understand that everyone makes mistakes but this was a pretty scary one. Especially when there is a safety box key attached to the room key. The other was that when we were checking out, there was a 4 euro extra labeled as ""BAR"", even though we always payed with cash. As we left so early there was not change to solve this at front desk but I contacted the hotel afterwards and it was an error and they solved it smoothly.

I read a review prior to arriving commenting on the reasonable drinks prices, you must be kidding ! The cocktails were double the price of those in the Plaka , literally exactly double.

We could unwind within the suite with ease; it contained 2 flat screen televisions, a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom. The property is beautifully maintained, spotless throughout- and reception is grand- it's a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry. Kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us, whilst we stayed with you. Everybody from check in, through to house keeping, food and beverage services were brilliant, and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service. You all made us feel right at home. Our experience was indeed sublime. The roof top pool is very memorable for our family- and the food, cocktails, and stunning uninterrupted view of Athens and the Parthenon unforgettable, breath taking. Breakfast was delicious, and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all, including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay. Perfectly located in Athens, lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the property- but do yourself favor and savor the Divani Caravel's Club Sandwich by the pool- absolutely delicious! Furthermore, the hotel is only minutes walk away to Evangelismos Subway Station- that takes you to the famous Athens Flea Markets (Monastiraki) and Ermou Shopping etc.- only 2 stops away. Excellent link to get you there.

Because the people in our party had been in Europe from 1-2 weeks already, we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry. Ultimately this is more of an Expedia issue than a Divani one, but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service, not the self-service laundry facility we were expecting. However, the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy with.Our first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant.

We were nervous at first because there is no outside signage. We were so surprised to find this completely renovated, unique, upscale boutique hotel. The rooms we stayed in last year had high ceilings, modern decor, and great A/C. There is no room service/food which is fine and almost preferred as there are restaurants, bakeries, so many options all around the hotel. It is super convenient to the plaka area and the acropolis. We loved it so much we went back this year with another family! This year we stayed in room 202 and 204. 202 had a loft-like look/feel and my kids thought it was the coolest! The other family stayed on the top floor in this super cool family suite. They were so happy and I was happy since I suggested the hotel!

The check-in process for our group of ten people was friendly and efficient. The elevator is quite small, holding only four people without luggage or fewer with luggage. As a result, it took a while for our group of ten to get to their rooms after checking in. Our room for four people was reserved as 2-bedroom, but the configuration was a bit of a surprise. There were two twin beds in one bedroom, one twin bed in the other bedroom, and one twin bed in the entrance area near the bathroom. The larger bedroom with two beds had a plug strip with multiple outlets, a stocked mini bar, plenty of storage space, and a small balcony with two chairs. The room areas were clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a tub/shower, small basin, and toilet. When leaving the bathroom there is a small step down just outside the door, and all of us kept tripping when we left the bathroom. We just weren’t expecting a step there. There is no computer available for guest use, but the desk clerk helped print the boarding passes for our group using the staff computer in the lobby. Free WiFi is provided, but the service is spotty—sometimes quite good, sometimes less so.One nice surprise: We were told upon checking that the breakfast buffet starts at 7:00. Our group had reserved airport transportation that was to pick us up at the hotel at 7:00, so I told the check-in clerk that we wouldn’t be able to use the buffet. They said that they would try to set things up by 6:00 because of our early departure, and they did. Very nice. The buffet had cold cuts and cheese, bread and rolls, a toaster, pastries including delicious spinach pie, an egg maker for boiled eggs, and more.

We planned it for months, and decided after much investigation to stay in the Melia in Athens, Greece. Our flight, transfers and all of our plans went perfectly. Except for our choice of hotel. There were many issues with this Hotel . The internet did not work well , the room was not very clean, the shower was moldy, the blow dryer didn't work and when it was replaced we couldn't use it in the bathroom, we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it. But that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced. An electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet (that what the management at the hotel said). This worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open, he said he had to check something n the basement, this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by, for more than five minutes. I happened to return to the room to find that situation. When I went to the management at the hotel, they tried to tell me that the room wasn't unattended when clearly it was. The man who left it open came down and apologized for leaving the room open and unattended for that period of time.I was left feeling violated and untrusting of this Hotel. The managements response was to offer us a free drink or a dinner for the troubles! REALLY!

We didn't really want to stay in the hustle and bustle part of Athens and this hotel worked out perfect for us. We booked a couple tours from the front desk, the staff upfront was so professional and helpful. We spent one day going to the city to see all the historical things, just enough. No need to go back to the city. The beach in front is very nice, umbrellas and lounge chairs available, nice sandy beach, not to many waves. Also very nice to have a roof top pool available. Again, great staff, drinks were made professionally, inexpensive and tasty. We took advantage of the room service quiet a bit. Food was always fresh, very inexpensive. Balcony off our room facing the sea was a nice retreat for us. Like everyone says it is on a busy road, but it didn't really bother us. Part of having a centerally located hotel, with good transportation options. We took the bus from the airport, pretty easy to figure out 6 euros each. We also spent a few days traveling from island to island. Piraeus port is a short 10-15min taxi and from there you can take speed ferries/ferries to various islands for very little money. We went to poros, Egina, hydra and Mykonos all from this port. Great way to see the Greek islands on your own time. Overall an amazing stay.

We took our breakfast up there on a tray - no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift - every morning, and our coffee or wine every evening: it was a spectacular way to start and end each day.It was also well placed: not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes, but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the Acropolis. So instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching, crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left, we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs, on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years, and joined them a little further up (only a little, but it was more magical!). The hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times, whether we needed to know about museums, restaurants, bus routes, etc. They telephoned Hertz for us when our lack of Greek and the Hertz office's busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car - and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting it into a small space outside the hotel proved rather stressful for guests operating a left-hand drive for the very first time!I had wanted to see Greece for over 40 years - especially Athens, Epidaurus and Mycenae - since I fell in love with the ancient Romans and Greeks at school. Sometimes when you go somewhere after all that time it's a disappointment; this was not. That first view from the terrace (we could even see part of the Acropolis from our balcony as well, by the way) was better than I'd dared even dream, and it didn't pall with repeated visits. My husband and I have a game called ""Fantasy Squillions"", i.e. what would you do if money were no object? On this holiday we chose our fantasy holiday home: mine was a rooftop apartment opposite the Acropolis. But I've just thought: I could stay in the Acropolis View hotel whenever I wanted instead! (And I'm not saying you need squillions to stay there - for a major city with that viewing terrace and an excellent breakfast, the hotel was not expensive - I'm just playing the game!)",5,Worth the 40-year wait!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d235704-r504074747-Acropolis_View_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Pam M

The restaurant on the 7th floor serves a wonderful breakfast and the restaurant itself is impeccably run. I was upgraded to a suite (I have platinum status), and the room was large and very comfortable. Probably one of the most comfortable beds that you'll find. Now to the negative: the hotel itself is portly run. I arrived in Athens close to midnight and had an early morning tour scheduled for the next day. I as staying for 3 nights, but under 2 reservations (part of the nights was being paid for by points). Upon checking in, I was told that I would probably need to switch rooms the next day but they wouldn't know until the morning. I expressed my unhappiness with this potential as I was going to be gone all day and that the very reason why I paid for the first night (instead of using points...the hotel was ""sold out"" for points that night) was so that I didn't have to worry about changing hotels or rooms. When I came down the next morning to see what decision had been made, I was told that I'd have to wait until after 0900 when the manager got it and that i should pack everything up because I might need to move. As you all are familiar, repacking when you're trying to relax and make a tour departure time is not fun and puts a damper on your day. But I did this. When I arrived back after a long day of touring Delphi, the manager was unapologetic and didn't see why I was annoyed. It took the very nice front desk lady to see my annoyance and offer me an apology (which is really all that I was looking for).

We arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there. I was not happy. However, the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage. He was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our stay.We got up to our rooms (needed to book 2 because of our big family) to find 2 twins bed pushed together in each room. Not the best, but it worked. The furniture is dated, the TVs are ancient, smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain. It is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere. To top it off, they charge 12 euro a day for internet access in the room, and that is only for 2 devices. Probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area. They have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar. However, it is a very small pool area. It is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground, so you can hardly walk around the pool. We arrived at the first day at 18:30, knowing it closes at 19:00. With 3 kids in tow, the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have 30 mins to swim, so we should come back tomorrow. Well my kids were in their swimsuits at the pool, so there was no way I was not going to let them swim. We swam, had a nice time and my husband brought up our own towels. The next day we came up earlier in the day, found a spot on the ground and went swimming. After about 20 minutes the same lifeguard from the previous day came over and told me my 8 year old is a bad swimmer. I told her he is still learning, and she said she knows these things and he is bad. She came over another 10 minutes later and threw a flotation device at him and said he must wear it. He threw a fit because he did not want to wear it and he could stand fine in the shallow end (Plus my husband and I were right next to him in the pool). The lifeguard then proceeded to speak Greek to another guest and talk about my son and how we should not be letting him swim. Little did she know that my husband can speak Greek and heard every word. We immediately left and my husband went to talk to the manager about her behavior. The manager seemed to take our concerns seriously and encouraged us to go back to the pool, but I did not feel comfortable going back there with her there. Besides with the mob of people lining the pool sunbathing, we felt like the kids needed to be quiet and not be splashing around. It is a very odd setup.Overall, do not stay here, especially with kids!",2,Wished we chose another hotel...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d250590-r508717615-President_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,P-townmomm

The lobby mirrored the pictures we had seen online. We made our way to our room and were happy with the size and layout, albeit without a double bed (there were two single beds pushed together.) Okay, no biggie. Breakfast is served until 1030 and on our first morning we were somewhat late and filtered through to a banquet room where there was ample spread. The next morning we were in the main breakfast area where there was a noticeable difference of selection and quantity of food and drinks.We later made our way up to the pool bar where again we were impressed with the facilities and bar. Such as all Greek restaurants, service was slow and we embraced the holiday mentality. It was only the following morning at the pool where we were met with sun-craving guests jostling for a sun bed. Fortunately we were able to secure one while others were left disappointed and frustrated having to sit on the floor.Although comfortable in the rooms, it is not quite 4 star quality.

Getting to Athens city Center was simple enough by tram but took about 30min each way. Breakfast buffet was included in room rate and buffet was fairly complete by North American standards. Bacon and eggs, lots of pastries and fruit and fresh squeezed OJ that you make yourself with the help of a machine that literally eats the oranges!A couple of youth tour groups were I the hotel at same time as our group and hallway and breakfast got a little noisy with some their excitement but it wasn't a big deal.

The room had crappy AC but eventually it did the trick. Weirdly the room only had one outlet. In the morning there were tiny little bugs in the sink. The elevators took forever to come. The breakfast was actually really good and it was included in our stay, but that's probably the only redeeming quality. Also, the hotel staff was nice.

I was embarrassed to bring my family and international guest to this hotel and neighborhood.Upon arrival, we were informed our Family room was on the 3rd floor. Once entered, it was clear it was a double room in which they tried to squeeze in a single bed and a rollaway. Chairs from the desk were moved to the foot of our double bed and crammed against the rollaway.Per my discussion with the check-in staff, we were moved to a family room on the 9th floor facing the back streets of Athens. We were informed that the room on the 3rd floor was indeed a family room (which I know it was not). Here's the description copied from their official website. ""Dorian Inn Hotel offers a great variety of Standard Single, Double and Triple rooms and from the 9th to the 10th floor we offer Superior Double and Family rooms for an unforgetable* stay in Athens!""*original spelling from hotel websiteUpon departure at 1:00 p.m., we saw a man sitting on a doorstep, sniffing white substance and a woman sitting on the sidewalk with 1 adult dog and 2 puppies who appeared to be malnourished... so very sad. For all these reasons, I will not stay at Dorian Inn Hotel in the future.Pros: The breakfast was very good and the support staff was professional and accommodating. The rooftop pool and bar were very nice and offered fantastic views of the Acropolis and Athens. The pool was medium size and well maintained, but more sunbathing chairs should be provided.The family room was spacious and had central AC, minibar, small dining area, and a separating privacy screen.

Set back on a dingy street, the hotel offers randomly poor customer service and staff with sticky fingers. We booked our stay at the Astor with a group of 12 people, so good business for them - but after our poor overall experience they won't be seeing business from us again. Here's why: Some of our group are 70 years+ and naturally, occasionally forgetful. While enjoying our breakfast out on the balcony (which it has to be said, offers a great view of the Acropolis), one guest (my sweet Nanna, just about the kindest woman you'll ever meet) accidentally left the door on the balcony open. which separates the rooftop viewing area from the eating area, as she walked through it. Instead of simply closing the door and forgiving the obvious mistake, a particularly angry witch of a waitress who was on staff at the time decided to make an example of her - slamming it shut and pointing and gesturing as if she couldn't believe the incompetency of her guest. I can only assume she got out of the wrong side of an empty bed that morning, or perhaps was up all night in a full one and forgot her basic customer service training in all the excitement. Leaving the Astor was an all-round bizarre experience. We had left our luggage at the hotel while exploring Athens for the day, and went back later to collect it + order taxi's so we could move on. When the bags were rolled out from the back room on a trolley, some of us tried to get our luggage...and for some reason the bell-hop spazzed out like a dog on heat. ""No no no, don't touch! I'll do it!! I WILL DO IT!"". This wasn't a friendly suggestion or an insistence to help while we put our feet up and relax; it was really oddly aggressive. I don't take that kind of crap, so simply grabbed mine and smiled. They are our bags, if we want to touch them, we'll touch the hell out of them. How strange to get so defensive over other people's possessions. Good job we didn't ask him to babysit. The final and worst insult though, is that after leaving we immediately realised various members of our party had left some items in 3 of the rooms (we realised this about 10 mins away while still in the taxi). Like I said, naturally forgetful. We made multiple attempts to contact the hotel to ask if we can return to pick them up before setting sail on our week-long cruise. No answers. So we sent in some emails. But for the entire week we were away on the cruise...still no answers. Docking back in Athens one week later, we called Astor and finally got hold of reception to explain the situation, who asked us to call back later. We were then informed that apparently nothing was found in any of the rooms. We stayed one night and the only other people who would have entered the rooms between us leaving and trying to immediately contact them were staff. The items left behind were: one man's shoe, a woman's dress, a man's orange top + yellow trousers, a man's shirt and a Samsung charger. So..somewhere in Athens, there is a one-legged, cross-dressing thief from Astor who looks like a piece of fruit carrying a Samsung phone charger with a UK plug. Be sure to avoid him/her/it, and do yourself a favour by avoiding Hotel Astor as well.",1,"Come for the sights, leave with less items and a bad taste",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d250578-r505832316-Astor_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,Daniel A

Once inside the room you don't hear the road as there is really effective double glazing. There is no furniture on the balcony but we brought the chairs and little table from inside out on an evening. There was also a minibar with some complimentary drinks. Bottled water was replaced daily. The room itself was very clean and comfortable with a TV, safe, tea and coffee making facilities, plenty of wardrobe space and good air conditioning. The bathroom was clean and toiletries are provided. We were impressed with the friendly staff. My husband had mentioned that we were there celebrating my 30th birthday and someone came up to the room after we checked in with a bottle of complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries - what a wonderful surprise!The only negatives I can point out are the lifts - these are very small and you can sometimes be waiting a very long time for them, one of them kept breaking down while we were there and the other one was malfunctioning and only stopped at certain floors!

But this didn't really bother me too much as I didn't spend much time in the room as I was out exploring Athens. The bed was very loud and creaky, any movement in the bed made a loud sound - sounded like it was going to collapse. In the mornings from half 6 to half 10 is the breakfast buffet. There is lots to choose from whether you want cereal to a fry up. One night at the hotel I decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant which is located on the 9th floor (top of the hotel) it had a great view of the Acropolis - you can choose to sit inside or outside to eat. The menu didn't have much food choice. I went for the burger, it looked great but came out cold so I had to ask them to warm it up. The waiters were polite and apologetic. The afters were lovely. Next to the restaurant is a little bar area that you can sit at and watch the telly. After having a dinner here which was a let down I decided to try the room service as it looked cheap and had a lot more choice then the hotel restaurant. The food from room service was tasty - so would recommend using this rather than going to the hotel restaurant. The pool is also on the ninth floor, it has a few sunbeds and seats around it. The pool isn't huge but it is long enough to have a little swim. On the 4th floor is they gym- but I never visited this.Overall I would recommend this hotel as it's good value for money.

We told the hotel that this was not us and that we didn't even visit the pool and until now, one week later the money had not been refunded.

The overall room and bathroom state was very disappointing. Once we saw the room we thought perhaps an upgrade to the suite may help - once again it was marginally better.

I was traveling with two teenagers who were very quickly made to feel welcome during a summer heat wave. We were fortunate to be allocated a triple room with a breathtaking view of the Acropolis. The breakfast were very well prepared and extensive. Lunch however was very slow and I am guessing most people do not have lunch here as the bar man who took our order seemed bored and made us feel as if we had disturbed him. The front office staff were initially very helpful however I guess it depended which individual served you.

This is an ideally located hotel if you are a tourist visiting Athens. You can literally see the Acropolis from your balcony (assuming an upper floor on the street side and you lean out a little!). Be aware, it's an old style hotel, with a very 1980/90s feel, sort of place where the shower is over the bathtub, and at least our room was a bit tired, mattress a bit worn, etc - and we were upgraded on our second stay to what they call an executive room which is a step up from the standard room. So on the star rating system it's a more like 3.5 to 4 star than 5 star. But having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would stay here again, the charming staff and great location more than compensate. Finally the breakfast included in our booking was excellent- a great range of Greek and western style food.

They got us to a local doctor that spoke English, had all transportation arranged for us, and then found a pharmacy open on a Sunday and arranged a car to take me to and from the pharmacy. The driver even came in to help as google translate and myself were doing a poor job. The driver translated for me, got the medicine for my child, and took me back to the hotel. The rest of the week the doormen asked my daughter how she was and watched after us. What an amazing group of people and what an unmatched level of service.

The good: I was very impressed by the entrance/lobby of the hotel which is absolutely stunning. I was also very pleased with the hotel staff who helped us with our luggage and allowed us a slightly later checkout because our flight was a bit later. I was also very impressed with their breakfast. They had various options ranging from eggs and bacon to yogurt and dessert and everything in between! I know what authentic Greek food tastes like and am often am disappointed by these Greece hotels food quality, however this hotel had an overall great breakfast and their Bougatsa was one of the best I've ever had! The gift shop, which is located near the breakfast area, was also very large and offered great discounts. The location of this hotel was also perfect!The room itself had its pros and cons. The good: The view, the bathroom and the cleanliness. The view was great! We had a balcony with a side view of the Acropolis which was very nice. The bathroom was also very nice and large with a large tub/shower and a large, bright mirror. This was perfect given we were 3 women who needed the space to put on makeup! The room was also very clean.Now for the bad: Our room smelled very bad 70% of the time. At first it was more so like a sewer smell but we woke up in the morning very early to a horrible fish smell. We had to keep the balcony door open to get some of the smell out which made the room very hot so the whole time we had to choose between hot and fresh smelling room or cold and smelly room. We were at the end of a hallway and when you approached that part of the hallway, you would smell it. With that said, I'm not sure whether it's just our room or the whole place but regardless I would like to see the hotel do something about this. This smell is not a lack of cleaning or anything on the part of the staff, but regardless occurs and should be addressed. Our room also had a problem with the door knob to the bathroom. Every time one of us went in there it would not lock; we knew when someone was in there not to enter but it was still slightly annoying. However even worse: when we were leaving the door randomly locked and one person in our group got stuck in the bathroom. One of the hotel employees came with the key and he still couldn't open it and had to call the technician who finally got it open. They handled this manner in a very attentive and fast way however it is also something that the hotel needs to look into ASAP.",3,"Not what I expected, but not horrible either",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d230391-r508635671-Divani_Palace_Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,Alexis M

Bedroom definitely needs upgrading and bed linen is disgusting. There is a newer wing, which according to reviews is much better. However, I am angry that I am charged same price, but got second rate. I also think that 60 euros for one adult and two children to have a continental breakfast, is outrageous in a hotel of this standard. I actually thought it was a candid camera moment when the receptionist stated the price, however, it wasn't. Needless to say, we didn't take the offer up.

This is not true - we were able to compare because we reserved two de lux and one executive and actually the cheaper rooms had better view. This so called 'better view' costs about 35 € per night. The hotel stands perpendicular to the Acropolis so all the rooms on the side with the view have similar, not the best perspective. It is beautiful but not direct look at Acropolis ;-) This can be found at the roof restaurant.The breakfast is good, very nice people working there (as opposed to the front desk where a little more genuine friendliness would be nice). There is a lovely pool area but the sun comes there only for a few hours during the day (otherwise covered by the shadow of the buildings).

We didn't eat in-house as there is a superb Asian/Peruvian restaurant right next door but we did have drinks in the 6th Floor Bar. The views are astounding - surely the best in the city.

To begin with they had mixed up the rooms and ours was a lot smaller than expected. Secondly the way children were allowed to run wild around the hotel made the experience far from relaxing. The pool is smaller than it seems and was packed with 20 small children swimming in it all day, despite the pool rules saying that children must be accompanied in the pool, however parents seemed to let their kids mess around in the pool making no adults want to swim and the staff did not do anything about it. Due to the lack of sun beds it felt like a race to get somewhere to sit on the rooftop! The worst experience I had here was with the food on the rooftop. Not only were the prices generally extortionately high (€4 for a can of coke) but the hotel prices were unbelievable. We thought we would eat there due to the area surrounding the hotel having no shops or restaurants. Although the prices were very high we thought the food would be worth it and we couldn't of been more wrong. I ordered the lamb shank which came from frozen and I'm sure they had been using the microwave they had in the kitchen. My boyfriends food was awful, he ordered a chicken burger but what arrived was a plate of chips with two minuscule patties oddly flavoured.

People who stood out for us were the Front Desk, especially Maria and Dieu who went above and beyond the call of duty whilst we had to spend 3 extra days in Athens as we became ill after having consumed tainted food on a cruise ship. The location is excellent and close to almost everything. The area seems a little dodgy at night however, it never felt unsafe and it is like any other city in the world, perhaps safer than most. There are many restaurants and coffee shops surrounding the hotel, with an excellent dessert shop right next door. The rooms are spacious, the public areas well laid out, the food really good (especially the breakfast and room service) and the decor is modern yet functional. This is a design hotel and a lot of thought went into the refurbishment. I especially like the interactive smart TV's in the rooms which are able to be mirrored to a personal mobile device. The wifi is free and fast. The beds and pillows (they have pillow menus) are extremely comfortable and all areas, including the rooms are immaculately clean and well looked after. They have plugs next to the beds and also a USB charging cable for telephones or iPads. The AC worked well, especially during the 38 Celsius heat whilst we were there.

It's a bit more luxurious than we're used to, but we chose it mainly for the location and with the idea of treating ourselves before going home.The building is very nice and quite understated, with a lovely garden area for breakfast (complete with marauding turtle doves - an interesting change from the usual pigeons). Our 4th floor room was fine, with a great view from the balcony and west-facing for the sunset. Breakfast was very good, with something for everyone, Service was universally excellent and the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.When we arrived our fridge wasn't working, but was replaced first thing the next day. I was surprised that the bed wasn't more comfortable - far too soft for my liking and probably could do with replacing.

It was a nice place but not within walking distance of anything (a rare miss for the cruise ship line).Based on that experience we did our research for this trip and selected the Herodion . It was perfect. Within a block of the Acropolis museum and the restaurant row near by, it was easily within walking of the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch, the plaka, even Monastriaki (if you push it a little). Walking the other way there were wonderful shops, some featuring hand-crafted art objects.So the location us perfect.The hotel, is very clean with a very relaxed feel and a courteous staff to help with everything. We relied on them for directions, suggestions and just general things. The rooms are nicely decorated and well maintained. The hotel also features breakfast, including European style. My wife's day cannot start without breakfast and coffee. She was completely satisfied with the Herodian's offerings. Especially the coffee!!The hotel also has a rooftop bar and restaurant. We visited for the view of the Acropolis but we did not dine there as we had other plans. The restaurant was packed though.I regret I did not take pictures (my mental lapse).

Excellent location for the Acropolis, museum, shopping and the old town. All are convenient walking. First to note was the hotel was tastefully decorated and the staff went out of their way for us. I have back issues and tried touring the Acropolis the next day in quite a bit of pain. Mark at the hotel desk found a cane for me to use and was very helpful in suggestions on where to visit and did a double ck on the taxi we were to have on departure to the airport. The lower bar was perfect quiet getaway after a hot day of sightseeing for a drink and or read quietly with a nice view of a garden area in the back. The rooms were SPOTLESS! Very important to a retired flight attendant. Loved the deep tub. Our beds were turned down at night and we were nicely surprised they brought up extra luggage racks for our oversized luggage. I read on a review that someone didn't like the dark hallways. In some of the better hotels they use that as a signal to keep the noise down for people that may be resting. Very effective. The Biltmore uses that technique for the staff. The rooftop restaurant was atmospheric and lovely, the food delicious. My husband at times can be hard to please since he travels for his job, but he was a happy man with every single meal. You must try their take on a Greek salad. I had to have that salad every night! The ladies, Fotini and Antzela were so attentive. There were others to but unfortunately the names escaped my foggy brain. For this I apologize because they were all great. The view of the Parthenon was breathtaking especially since the staff ordered a full moon for our visit :-) If you want to visit the rooftop restaurant on a full moon night, I must encourage you to make reservations since those are high demand evenings. Breakfast foods was many choices and varied. Only one hiccup and even that was made right by the staff impeccably. We were overlooked on our last night of dining and they more than made it right. Most places would apologized and then let it go. No,no,no. They apologized alright but went out of their way to make it EVEN BETTER if that is possible. Thanks for a memorable stay.

It was very hot while we were in Athens so we were very grateful for the air conditioning. The bed was comfortable but the road outside was very busy with the main noise from horns and motorbikes.

Breakfast was a wide choice of hot and cold buffet food which was delicious. On the last evening we had dinner in the restaurant with an excellent view of the sun setting over the Acropolis.

Chose the hotel based on location. As everyone says it's within walking distance to just about everything on the must-do list. Staff very nice and room very clean, though pretty small. We booked a room on the executive (7th) floor knowing we would be on a busy street. The latter is the biggest negative. The main artery through downtown Athens goes right by the hotel and it can be pretty noisy if you face the road and Temple of Zeus, but the view is terrific. 7th floor also has large balconies but we hardly used as the noise is not very relaxing on this side (the glass railing also freaked me out a bit). Room quite small even on this floor with very basic chairs. Bed was ok if a little too hard.The hotel was baking hot when we arrived as it was during a hot stretch and there is no AC in the halls. Zeus side of the hotel also gets summer sun most of the day. They turn off the AC if no one is in the room. Took hours to cool down as the AC was not powerful. After asking about this at the desk we were given a key to keep in the inside room slot to keep the AC running while we weren't there. Afterwards it stayed cool but we were also blessed with a mid summer cool down which also helped. Bath ok, but no plug in it which was annoying. Rooftop bar and restaurant ok as well. Breakfast was acceptable with a variety of usual items. Bar area on the roof nice place to chill with terrific views of Acropolis, Zeus, and rest of Athens. Didn't eat at the restaurant at night as it is somewhat expensive with a very limited menu but you can go up and take in the sights anytime.We paid more for the 7th floor room mainly because I wanted to ensure we were as far away from the street noise as possible. You can request a room on the Acropolis side of the hotel but be forewarned there is an abandoned building on that side which is not very attractive. We thought our price was a bit high for the size of the room and general amenities, but the location made it worth it. If I ever go to Athens again I will probably try to stay in the Plaka for the experience.",3,"Nice but noisy hotel, great location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d227384-r503195615-The_Athens_Gate_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,K O

The hotel itself is really big and so you have a wide range of possibilities to pamper yourself. Indoor- and Outdoorpool, Fitnessroom (unfortunately just one bicycle, that should be fixable), Executive Lounge with a amazing view and as well an amazing service and hospitality. I had the King Olive Suite and have not regretted it at all. The whole suite has a really good atmosphere, a private I would say. (Hilton Budapest could learn right here, how to arrange a suite you feel perfectly welcome). Also my question after one more lamp was fulfilled within one hour without any problem. The guide who was recommended from the Executive Lounge Guest Service was 55,- Euro a hour and it fitted perfect for three hours for the Akropolis and the museum. I would recommend to not meet in the hotel, you should meet with the guide at the container, where the group and guide tickets are sold, so you will have more time with the guide. Also the breakfast is really HILTON like, there is everything you are expecting. The whole crew is friendly and is very helpful. The only disappointing thing was with the outdoorpool, as you only get one big towel, which you lay on the sunbed. Asking for one mor (even a smaller one, which is handed out for fitness) was denied, which is not 5 star hotel class at all. But I strongly recommend the hotel, if you want to be sure, that your stay in Athens should be perfect.

There is chaos and incompetence in the organization of services. We arrived at the hotel before 11.00 and asked at the reception whether we could be accommodated earlier, although we knew that the check-in at this hotel, unlike most of the other ones, is at 4 p.m. (sic!) which - considering the demanded higher price for accommodation - we find totally inappropriate. The receptionists promised us access to our room hour after hour, thanks to which we spent almost 6 hours waiting for the Olive Suite. which we had pre-paid several months ahead. First, we were sent to the swimming pool bar, where we spent 3 hours hearing repeated promises of access to our room. After our third inquiry whether the room was free, as an answer we were given a card to the lounge and were told that the formalities would be settled there. The previous guest had left the room later and therefore the room could not yet be prepared. We waited another 3 hours during which we were offered the possibility of paying an extra 250 EUR for a De-Luxe Suite, supposedly the only one ready, which we refused. Our room wasn’t even ready at 4pm but as late as 5.30 pm.Instead of a possible tour of the town or a business meeting we pointlessly wasted 6 hours waiting.As a businessman and owner of a firm I cannot comprehend how a hotel of this category which 2 days before our arrival had takings of roughly 2 million EUR is incapable of securing more staff for cleaning rooms. We were evidently the only ones who arrived ahead of time so, instead of the repeated promises of accommodation, it would have sufficed to tell the room service about the priority cleaning of the vacated room or to let us know that the room would be at our disposal only at check-in time (which it wasn’t anyway).The capacity of the executive lounge, considering the number of accesses and the hotel’s business policy is absolutely insufficient. We had to carry our evening snack to the suite because the lounge was totally full for a long time. We were not the only ones who couldn’t spend time there and deal calmly in the evening. We were not offered any compensation for the late vacation of our room, not to mention the impossibility of using the lounge for business meetings. I will not stress such details as that the suite contained accessories and complements only for 1 person, although it was ordered for 2. At our request to see the responsible manager, Mrs. Kalliopi Paroussis, one of the receptionists who had promised us accommodation every hour and had sent us to the bar, arrived. The result were repeated apologies. No suggestion of compensation for the belated accommodation. From the given business card, we found out that Mrs. Paroussis is only the assistant of the front desk manager, evidently with no authorization, which we consider as incorrect, unreliable dealing and misguidance. In comparison with several visited hotels of the Hilton chain, Double Tree, Waldorf Astoria in various cities I must state that the price level at this hotel does not nearly correspond with the equipment of the hotel, nor with its service. Chaos prevails in there (we were not the only ones waiting for accommodation long after check-in time).I cannot recommend the Athens Hilton to anyone and am warning my business partners of staying there.",1,"Horrible, truly incompetent staff, you pay for services, you never get",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d198932-r504479526-Hilton_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,MICHAL V

Being a five star hotel one expects excellent service and good value .On arrival we where greeted outside by the car concierge ?? Well received and a polite really nice guy. Apologize for not having asked his name. A queue on check in however I was promptly checked in. My first complaint here is that a hotel of this class should have a dedicated concierge as is the case of other establishments on this level and not have to rely on on checking in staff to do both.My room allocated was away from lifts which was great, however it looked tired and slightly worn. Only one tiny shampoo and conditioner. No tooth paste or brush/razor blade??Looking in the cupboard no dressing robes. This was all disappointing. I had to phone twice to house keeping to bring them along with toiletries. When I received them thanked the staff with a smile how ever they were sullen and I got the impression they were doing me a favor . I had a cup of tea and asked house keeping to replace it with a fresh cup and as I went shopping that day asked if they would remove all the empty boxes and packaging. AlasNone of the above was done and I just left it.On a positive note, got an invitation for a welcome cocktail. Thank you very much.

But I found the neighbourhood around the hotel to be quite pleasant; as there is other tourists & locals about, & full of places to eat & a grocery nearby - of course still be cautious like in any country, yet still enjoy the surrounds as it is brilliantly located within walking distance of stores, the Acropolis Mueseum, & the Acropolis.I've read reviews that the service at Hermes is excellent, & that hasn't changed at all; courteous & very helpful. We were even given a small gift of wine & local sweets as a gesture from Hermes to greet us on our honeymoon. This was a wonderful surprise that we appreciated.The room we were given was humbly small yet cosy enough for a couple, & was modernly decorated... we didn't expect the Hotel to look as good as a 4 star when we spotted & entered, so we were impressed.Extra free offerings were water, tea & coffee available for till 8pm at their lounge area beside reception. There are seats & a selection of reading material in this lounge to compliment a cup of what you fancy... also we were encouraged to visit their sister hotel: Hotel Plaka's rooftop for a drink & a nice view of the Parthenon, so that was great to know.All in all we had a great time for exactly what we wanted :)",5,A God worthy of Olympus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d258819-r501989209-Hermes_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Alvin_Levi_Dayan

In part the staff (Eva & Oana) push my rating over the limit of 5 stars. This will be my first choice for my next trip to Athens. The location is perfect. It is just outside the crazy Plaka and a block away from the main shopping streets. It takes minutes to walk to the acropolis, ancient agora, or the fabulous National Archeological museum. The rooms are solid and silent. I never heard any noise from other rooms or the street. The finishing is beautiful, if you like polished marble bathrooms (floors have roughed marble so they are not slippery when wet). Breakfast food selection is great. Everything from the basic toasts (4 different breads) with jam to eggs and bacon or spinach pie and cheeses with cold meats. There are amazingly good pastry sweets and fresh fruit selections. The finishing touch is the staff who take a real interest in you and what you plan to do with your time. For example, Eva knew after the first day that we had 2 daughters. She readied a large table for us for breakfast as soon as she saw my wife and I look for a table. In none of the other hotels on visit did any staff notice or care that we were a group of four. Lastly, someone on TripAdvisor said the walk to the National museum was best avoided and taxi was the best idea. Oana told us to try the walk and gave us a map of the route. The walk was great. Aolou street was beautiful and full of great restaurants and stores. I am so glad we listened to Oana and I am glad she bothered to ask about our plans for the day.

We're just looking for a place we can stay in Athens for a short staying while doing some sightseeing. For that purpose, I think this hotel was perfect. Its location is really convenient. It's about 15-20 minutes of walking distance to Acropolis (although it felt a lot longer under the blazing sunlight with 95 degree). It's right across the street from the National Gardens and just a few blocks away from the Parliament building(if you want to see the 'Change of the Guards'). And, literally a few blocks away from a thousands of restaurants, cafes, shopping places, etc. And, it you want to ride one of those double decker tour buses, the stop is right across the street from the hotel, too. There is a train and bus stop right there, too. We thought that as far as location is concern, it's just as good as it gets.As for the hotel itself, it's very clean. Nothing really bad to complain about. However, there were no bell boy services when we got there. We had to lug all our bags to our room via a smallest elevator I've ever seen in my life. Not a big deal. But the sheer size of that elevator always brought a little smile to our family on each ride. Felt like that elevator belonged in Disney Land in some Kids' theme park. Room is an ample size and bed is just bed. We all slept well. Didn't have much views from our room probably because we didn't pay more for the room with a view. All good though. Their complimentary breakfast is quite good, we thought. Lots of selections and good quality. I have included some photos from the breakfast. They have a small lobby bar with a friendly bartender. Drinks are reasonably priced. It was a nice quick stop before you go up to your room after a long day of doing tourist stuff.I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay a several days for some sightseeing.

It is in the Plaka district, which is a safe area in Athens, close to restaurants and shops and within a 15 minute walk to many of the historical sites. The rooms were very clean and the service has been impeccable (the front desk is always at the ready to pull out a map and trace your directions to your in-city destination). Their breakfast buffet was stacked with all types of goodies--for those who are watching their waistline to the fellow gourmand, there is a pretty good, and tasty spread for all (with some Greek goodies that can add to the cultural experience). Lastly, something that stood out to me was that the hotel provides breakfast boxes for travelers who have to depart the hotel prior to the breakfast buffet opening up. I really appreciated this type of hospitality, as it made our transition to our next destination that much easier.

The hotel is very modern and has a complimentary shuttle bus service into the centre of Athens. Our bedroom was adequately equipped and the king size bed was very comfortable. We were disappointed at breakfast in Cafe Zoe on both mornings because the hot food was actually either cold or just luke warm. Fortunately, there was plenty on offer in the cold buffet section but we would have liked to have eaten a hot breakfast. The staff in the restaurant were a little on the slow side to ask us what we wanted to drink. My husband prefers coffee and I prefer tea. However, tea was provided as a jug of hot water and a tea bag with a small jug of milk. The waitress asked my husband twice if he wanted a refill of coffee but declined to ask me if I wanted any more tea - it seemed to be too much trouble for them to provide the tea.We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant the first night which had panoramic views of the Parthenon lit up at night, which was very nice.

The main drawback with the hotel is that it is too far away from the main sites of Athens. There is a free shuttle bus that runs to Syntagma Square every hour but it was a bit of a hassle to go out in the morning, back to the hotel for a rest or to escape the heat in the middle of the day, and then out again for dinner and back again at night.

I found that very thoughtful of them. The hotel room was very spacious and well-appointed. I liked the decoration, the spacious bathroom and the toiletries provided had an excellent verbena scent which I loved. While it is quite a distance away from the city centre, the hotel does provide free shuttle to the parliament house area which is close to where the main shopping area is; Athens flea market. Definitely take advantage of this free shuttle and shop to your heart's content at the Athens flea market. It was a 20-minute walk from the hotel to the Acropolis, which I did. You cannot visit Athens and not hike up to the Acropolis! Buffet breakfast at this hotel is lovely....excellent selection of food, and I especially loved the rich chocolate log cake. The hotel concierge also helped arrange a day-cruise to 3 islands (Hydra, Poros, Aegina) for me on my last day of stay. The only drawback was, I was not issued a receipt after paying the hotel concierge for the trip, and when I reached the cruise ship, I was asked to pay again. After disputing and the cruise operator calling the hotel, I was finally allowed onboard.....I was the last person to board. So if you use this cruise booking service provided by the hotel concierge, do insist on a receipt. Apart from this one hiccup, the hotel service was excellent.

Immediate surrounding area seems to be quite rundown.Only really frustrating thing was the Wi-Fi. I paid for 1 Mbps (which isn't much but all I needed to work). During the day it was fine, usually hitting around 2 Mbps. But between 7-11 PM, it was so slow it was completely unusable.

We were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the Acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room. You quickly negotiate the hotel and breakfast provided a very good choice of food and not just the usual; smoked salmon, freshly cooked eggs or omelettes and very well stocked fruit and cereals. If you want a traditional English breakfast, the options are there but we found the continental options much better as the bacon etc was not the warmest.Secondly, where to eat at night. If you turn right out of the hotel and then immediately right again, you will see a sign for Vassilios Taverna. It is worth a visit. Don't be put off by the area. The food there was very good and very reasonable. Rest on your first night if you are not sure where to go.Finally, exploring from the hotel. We had a taxi to the Acropolis at 8am and it cost €5. If you hold a student discount card (NUS Extra) - use it! Most of the tourist attractions are free for students and we worked out that we saved about €60, which was some saving.

We also had to ask for the room to be re-cleaned as there were coffee splashes on the bathroom door - it looked like it had been turned-around quickly, but we did arrive earlier than planned so maybe that was why.My only criticism is of the pricing of food and drink. Coffees are 7.50 euros which is expensive for any hotel anywhere in the world (coffee was nothing special in terms of size or quality either) and a GnT from the minibar came in at 22 euros which in my opinion is just too much given the same is 6-7 euros in any bar in Athens.I have read this comment before from others and the hotel has responded that pricing is in line with other hotels in Athens. Just because others have crazy prices does not make it okay in my opinion. I believe It should be seen as an opportunity to offer better value than the competition rather than justification to over-charge.

We were to spend 3 nights in Athens prior to flying back home. My parents and sister were accompanying us. Therefore, I have booked 2 rooms about 5 months in advance. Informed the hotel that this was a special occasion. From my profile they knew that I was top tier Spire Elite Royal Ambassador within their chain of hotels. Here are my comments:- Although they claim that there is special check-in for elite members on the club floor, we had to wait exhausted at the reception in the line-up before they could speak with us. Not the right level of treatment.- They told me that my personal room got upgraded to the club floor, which is a given benefit of this tier anyway. However, my parents' room got a 2 level upgrade, but no club floor and no club lounge. I have called the guest relations and the duty manager and have asked nicely whether they can at least give club lounge access for my parents, seeing that this was a special trip. Lots of talking from them, but bottom line was a ""No"" and even the GM the best he has done was to offer a 20% discount for the club lounge. This was a first for me in many years with IHG. Thumbs down to you guys.- Yes, the view from the balcony at the Club Lounge was amazing. We could see Acropolis, however, we couldn't all enjoy it as a family. ""Thanks"" to the hotel.- The swimming pool is way too small in terms of its size and the sunbeds, considering that they claim to be the largest hotel in Athens with over 700 rooms. Thumbs down on planning.- Concierge: We ask about the hop-on hop-off bus tours and he sends us on the hotel shuttle to the main square to take that bus, whereas later we found out that there is stop right in front of the hotel. ""Forgot"" to mention it? - What you don't see in the pictures on the hotel's website is that it is located in the area surrounded by shady businesses and by ""night"" clubs. Graffitti everywhere.- The hotel exterior as well as the rooms look to be in need of renovation. After getting used to the extremely nice hotels belonging to this chain, I was quite disappointed and definitely wouldn't call it a 5-star property.- Overall, I found the service to be a fake pleasant without real recognition of loyal customers. They certainly didn't go above and beyond for us.- I do not recommend it and I wouldn't give it a second chance either.",2,Hotel in need of renovation and with poor recognition of loyal customers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d233052-r503095048-InterContinental_Athenaeum-Athens_Attica.html,Pontii

We ordered few delivers and the hotel they don't allow them to entry the hotel be ready to collect your food outside .They have only one menu between the room service , cafe in the lobby and pool bar.

We said ""Yes please!"" Silly me expected them to arrange the room switch for us and help with our bags. Instead the bell man walked away and we stood there with no direction. We called back down to the front desk and they said If we wanted to switch we would have to come down to the front desk to do so!

To make matter worse they down graded us to a very old room that looked as if it hadnt been updated since 2000. Also dont plan to get any spa services done, there is only one person who runs the entire thing.

Last week my family and I had the pleasure to call the property home whilst visiting the beautiful capital city of Greece. Upon our arrival we were professionally and promptly greeted by concierge and reception staff. Our suite was that of above and beyond expectation and quality, that was comfortable, and spacious. We could unwind within the suite with ease; it contained 2 flat screen televisions, a dining and lounge area including a very spacious bathroom. The property is beautifully maintained, spotless throughout- and reception is grand- it's a breathtaking enormous grandeur space with high ceilings and a stunning chandelier that captures your attention upon entry. Kudos to the management and staff in entirety for your hospitality and services offered to us, whilst we stayed with you. Everybody from check in, through to house keeping, food and beverage services were brilliant, and executed excellent and above and beyond customer service. You all made us feel right at home. Our experience was indeed sublime. The roof top pool is very memorable for our family- and the food, cocktails, and stunning uninterrupted view of Athens and the Parthenon unforgettable, breath taking. Breakfast was delicious, and the complimentary bedside slippers for us all, including the chocolates and turning down service every evening was a wonderful addition to our stay. Perfectly located in Athens, lots of cafes and restaurants located right next to the property- but do yourself favor and savor the Divani Caravel's Club Sandwich by the pool- absolutely delicious! Furthermore, the hotel is only minutes walk away to Evangelismos Subway Station- that takes you to the famous Athens Flea Markets (Monastiraki) and Ermou Shopping etc.- only 2 stops away. Excellent link to get you there. Based on our experience and based of the above mentioned qualities, it gives me much pleasure in highly recommending the Divani Caravel Hotel Athens to anybody wishing to appreciate quality accommodation whist visiting Athens.

Because the people in our party had been in Europe from 1-2 weeks already, we had specifically looked for someplace with laundry. Ultimately this is more of an Expedia issue than a Divani one, but arrival we learned that they have a rather expensive external laundry service, not the self-service laundry facility we were expecting. However, the front desk was very helpful in finding a small local laundry shop that we ended up using and being very happy with.Our first night there we were quite tired and ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. Overall I would say it was good.

The food was amazing the vegetables soup is everything. Simply burgers was also a nice place to eat for under 10 erous. All in all my stay at the hotel was okay I made the best of it. They can extend your check out time if you ask in advance. In Athens.. plenty of walking, drink coffee and eat spinach pie.Ps.. the swimming pool comes in handy after a long day of touring Athens.

This is by far the best hotel in Euope that we stayed at (comparable prices to 3 or 4 star hotels) so far. It is located in a quiet area outside the hustle and bustle of the city. There are not too many eating options at the hotel and is it quiet pricey (breakfast buffet is 25 euros per person). However there are a lot of great restaurants and cafes near by. There are also kiosks directly across the street that sell snacks and beverages at reasonable prices. The level of service from the front desk to room service staff was top notch. The room we were given was bright, clean, and a lot bigger than any other hotel we had in other cities in Europe. The bathroom was bright, roomy and had a variety of quality towels and two bath robes. The toiletries were really nice and also included a shaving kit, dental kit, vanity set, shower and sewing kit. The shower was also enjoyable with a lot of hot water and great water pressure. The hotel did not stop there to impress. There is a pillow menu that offers three different options to your preference and comfort level. After returning to your room in the evening, your bedding is turned down for you with a chocolate on your pillow and hotel bedroom slippers on the side of each bed. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service into the city centre which we used on both days. Our driver John was both very professional and efficient. The most memorable part of our stay has to be the roof top pool and lounge area. The 360 view of the city is amazing especially at sunset. What a great way to wind down after the end of a busy day.

Upon arrival at the Athens airport, we were greeted by the Air Transat rep. Along with 2 other couples, we were eventually taken to our hotel stopping along the way for the other couple’s drop-offs in a large coach-style bus (no bathroom on-board). I would strongly suggest having transfers to your hotel pre-booked, but it’s not necessary as there are many taxis which will cost you around 35-50 euros to get downtown.Disregarding star-rating, this hotel is appointed nicely with a clean appearance and decor. The lobby is open, cooled and pleasant despite the 40C weather outside. Our check-in upon arrival was handled swiftly and efficiently with the staff having a good grasp of English. Our room was on the second floor, right near the stairs. There are 3 different sets of 2 elevators, but each one is not very large. Since there are 3 different sections of the hotel, this makes sense. Wifi is offered free and the username and password are given upon check-in but if you’re early (as we were when going back to Canada), you can get that and use while you wait.Our room was a standard double room that contained one king-size bed, a bathroom and a mini-bar. Unfortunately, I did not get any photos of the room, which is unusual for me but rest assured, the room was sufficient and we found the king sized bed very comfortable giving us a good sleep. Make sure to leave one of your security cards in the holder (near the door) if you go out as all power is shut off if you take it out (this is the same all over Greece)….including the air conditioning (controlled by a thermostat).The hotel contains a gym (which is unusually placed - I have a video, but can't upload. You enter the gym from the back of the hotel, kinda weird), an outdoor pool in the middle of the hotel with a window for food, towels and general service, a restaurant (opens at 7pm for dinner) that also hosts the excellent buffet breakfast and an indoor bar which sits next to the pool. Prices in this hotel for drinks are somewhat costly, so maybe get your own….as others have said, the restaurant terrace on the 7th floor gives an awesome view of the Acropolis….along with this, the breakfast buffet is also extremely good providing a wide variety of meats, dairy, breads, and fruits – definitely worth getting up for!This hotel is close to the Acropolis and Plaka which are major tourist attractions. Walking there takes 5 minutes. Among these attractions are many restaurants and shops which can provide hours of time wasting! Overall, we had an excellent experience in Athens and in particular, this hotel. Just make sure to use common sense when roaming around….keep your money, cards and phones close and concealed and you will not have anything to worry about.",4,Great view of Acropolis and close to Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d206779-r506257385-Royal_Olympic_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Danoj10

We have always stayed at the Divani and have loved it but this year decided to try the Royal Olympic due to its proximity to Plaka.The reception on arrival was offhand and snooty - we were told we had an "" internal room"" and to our horror it had no windows and seemed to be over a light shaft. We decided not to complain bc we were only staying over night but nonetheless were very shocked as had booked in January- when I mentioned this the gentleman made a very disparaging comment about having booked through Booking.com!!The bathroom was filthy- frayed soap and shampoo basket with toothpaste spittle splattered on it, taps with soap stains, basin with toothpaste from last guests, surfaces dirty. The sign "" please service my room"" was still hanging on the outer door handle when we arrived at 8pm!!Towels, although good sizes, were yellowed and worn.We tried to have a drink in the hotel bar before dinner at 8:50pm but were told that the bar closed at 9pm...in an inner city 5 star hotel we found this rather odd.We stayed in for a meal and it was amazing service with a very professional and pleasant waitress. Food was in general good but far from exceptional. It was very expensive. The view is magnificent to say the least and we were five a fantastic table on the balcony.The cherry on the cake was ringing reception at 11:30 to ask for 2 extra pillows from housekeeping as we only had one each. I was told by reception that there were no maids ( really???!!!!) and that he would look himself and bring them up. No pillows came to us, no one phoned us back- for a 5 star hotel this is appalling. We hardly slept as were very uncomfortable as a result.All in all a very disappointing experience. We were not even asked on check out if we had a nice stay.... I guess they knew the answer!

Both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool, although our second room had only a stall shower, but no bathtub as had been in the first. The swimming pool was another welcome feature. Though not very large, it was clean, temperate and enough for swimming short laps. There were sunbeds (which were apparently not there when another recent reviewer stayed at the hotel) as well at patio chairs and tables. The staff was uniformly courteous and helpful.

We booked an executive room and I emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion. I received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this. On arrival the hotel was ""full"". This was the least of our problems!The hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel:Taxi at 60 euros (On our return to the airport we were quoted 40 euros by hotel staff which we booked).MetroBusWe decided to take the Metro as we thought 60 euros rather expensive. The Metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband's passport were stolen from my handbag. This resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the British Embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement. Day 1 ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city. Apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within hours.Our executive room was nothing like executive. The bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well. Therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath. I reported this but the engineer could make no difference.Toiletries were replaced each day although the quality was not great.It is unusual not to have tea/coffee facilities in a 5* hotel room these days. I was also surprised that irons and ironing boards are not supplied.The restaurant was lovely but the evening meal prices extremely high so we ate out. We had breakfast at the hotel as part of our package. It was adequate but the same every day. I only had the cooked option once and the eggs were swimming in fat and cold. The swimming pool was small with no room for enough chairs and loungers round it. The main issue for me as a 5 ft non swimmer was the depth. 1.5m to 3.5m in a very short distance. Therefore I could not go further into the pool than the first 3 steps. I realise there is nothing to be done about this but some floatation aids would help. The hotel is immaculately kept in the public areas and the staff were very pleasant and friendly. Athens is sadly showing its economic situation and graffiti is absolutely everywhere. It is a very different city to the one we last visited in 1971.The hotel is extremely well situated within easy walking distance of the Plaka area with Restaurants and tourist shops and the Archeological sites.

This hotel is a bit deceiving for a 5-stars, but with a perfect location in the city center of Athens.The rooms are comfortable, clean, quiet and spacious. The wifi is working correctly. Only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand, despite the easy in-wall control system. This wasn't much of a problem for one night, but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed longer.My main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel, beginning with the reception hall. Arriving at the Royal Olympic doesn't feel like arriving at a 5-stars. We arrived an hour early so we were asked to wait for our room to be ready. Nobody offered us any welcome drinks nor suggested any waiting options such as the lounge of the hotel or the pool during the waiting time. Similarly, the staff at the bar was not cheerful neither and we waited one hour for our in-room snacks to come a bit later on. I also want to mention that one of the two rooms we were assigned to was not the booked suite we expected. This was corrected only after we noticed it.It is a very good thing indeed that the hotel has a pool, but it is too small for summer holiday when there is a lot of clients staying in.What saves this hotel is definitely its perfect location near the Acropolis and the city center. There is plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, you just have to walk 5 minutes to reach the athenian-style summer atmosphere, a beautiful experience especially at night.I would suggest staying at the Royal Olympic for one night before heading to the beautiful paradise of the greek islands.",4,One night for the location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d206779-r507778570-Royal_Olympic_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Michel S

On arrival the baggage handler was very friendly but the desk staff couldn't process us quickly enough to get us out the way due to a queue of people waiting to check in, they were not very welcoming. The view from the room is exquisite but let down by the fact the bed is two individual beds, separately made, and pushed together with a blanket over the top to give the illusion it is one bed. We requested an iron due to creased clothing, as they have been in suitcases, to be advised that there is not one available but you can pay for someone to come up and take the item away to be pressed. Not ideal. The pool is far too small for a hotel of its size. There are perhaps 30-40 sun-loungers for a hotel with 500+ rooms.Our final day, the roof garden was also unavailable due to a wedding ceremony with no alternative advertised and the downstairs bar does not have an adequate capacity.

But apart from that everybody was pretty disappointed with the rest in the restaurant. The service was extremely slow. We sat in our table at 8;30 and only after an hour they came to take our order. Then the waiting for the food it took so long and we got served finally around 23:00!!! After 2 and half hours!! In the group were young children that had fallen asleep because of the very long waiting. in addition after the food arrived it was nothing special and worth the hight price of the dishes. For example i ordered risotto with some sea food. And it was just rice with only a single shrimp.

We took our breakfast up there on a tray - no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift - every morning, and our coffee or wine every evening: it was a spectacular way to start and end each day.It was also well placed: not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes, but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the Acropolis. So instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching, crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left, we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs, on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years, and joined them a little further up (only a little, but it was more magical!). The hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times, whether we needed to know about museums, restaurants, bus routes, etc. They telephoned Hertz for us when our lack of Greek and the Hertz office's busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car - and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting it into a small space outside the hotel proved rather stressful for guests operating a left-hand drive for the very first time!I had wanted to see Greece for over 40 years - especially Athens, Epidaurus and Mycenae - since I fell in love with the ancient Romans and Greeks at school. Sometimes when you go somewhere after all that time it's a disappointment; this was not. That first view from the terrace (we could even see part of the Acropolis from our balcony as well, by the way) was better than I'd dared even dream, and it didn't pall with repeated visits. My husband and I have a game called ""Fantasy Squillions"", i.e. what would you do if money were no object? On this holiday we chose our fantasy holiday home: mine was a rooftop apartment opposite the Acropolis. But I've just thought: I could stay in the Acropolis View hotel whenever I wanted instead! (And I'm not saying you need squillions to stay there - for a major city with that viewing terrace and an excellent breakfast, the hotel was not expensive - I'm just playing the game!)",5,Worth the 40-year wait!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d235704-r504074747-Acropolis_View_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Pam M

The Plaka is a 7-10 min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of Athens. At the end if the Plaka you will find the Ancient Agora. The Acropolis metro is only a 5 min walk that will take you to other parts of Athens. The beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to 45 deg - we had this for three days!! There is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe, but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee. You have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so. Breakfast is rather disappointing- tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm environment- now fermenting! The fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice. Coffee was via a Nescafé vending machine - tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from. At least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer. Ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you won't get a good night's rest - the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in Athens. You might want to take a sleeping mask as the curtains don't fully block out the light from the street lights and early morning sunrise.

From the moment we walked in to the moment we left the people there could not have been more helpful.We arrived in the early evening and the night receptionist gave us a warm welcome and helped us with some basic but very useful local information. The hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Omonia Square where there is a metro station and tour bus pick up. There is a bakery and supermarket located nearby. The main tourist section with access to the Acropolis and other attractions, such as numerous bars and cafes is 20 minutes straight line walk from the hotel.Our room was typical of a 4 star European hotel. Included was a safe, TV, fridge and balcony. The aircon actually worked and was adjustable remotely, which is unusual from my experience! The bed was amazingly comfortable and the room, although located next to a busy road was very quiet. The hotel said they had spent a lot of money on soundproofing.Breakfast was typical European fare. The usual array of pastries, cold cuts, bacon, sausages, fruit, cereals etc. All being refreshed constantly. Vasilis, the catering manager showed me how to make Greek coffee in hot sand. I enjoyed it, surprisingly. Linda thought it was disgusting.We had dinner on the rooftop one night with our son and his fiance. There was a nice view of the Acropolis and the meal was very enjoyable. Total bill was £86 which was not too bad for 4 people.I have no problem in encouraging you to stay at this hotel.

The Hotel is a 3.5/5 in my opinion. The hotel itself is clean, but like many European Hotels – the room is very small, as is the bathroom. However; the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it. They put out a lot of hot and cold dishes, plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast (too many things to list, including the drinks). Overall, this hotel is nice and the service is friendly, and is good for a quick 2 day stopover, on your way to see other part of Greece (ie…The Greek Isles). While I am here, I will take this opportunity to mention our 2 day stay in Athens…When we got to our hotel at 10:30am from the Airport, they told us that check in time was 3:00pm and after. So we sat around and went for a walk down the streets of Athens and eventually wound up at the Monastiraki square. We had a Gyros, and went back to our hotel to take a nap. We woke up a little later, and went back to eat dinner at Monastiraki in the evening. This is a very lively place, full of lights, music, shops, street vendors, and live bands. It was entertaining. As far as the food goes, it was good, but unfortunately being from Toronto, I cannot in all honesty state the food in some of the Athens places we had; was better than some of the Greek restaurants we have in Toronto. We are truly spoiled in Toronto with the authenticity of the various ethnic foods which are available. That’s not to say the food in Athens is bad; however it is more to commend the authenticity of the food in Toronto. From the Tzatziki to the Souvlaki to the Gyros to the Greek Salad. They all taste just as good in Toronto, if not better. Btw - the feta cheese in these Greek salads are a 3""x4"" block of feta they put right on top of the salad (Personally I prefer a lot of Sprinkled Feta in my Greek Salad – but to each his own). The salad is huge, and the tomatoes taste very different from a North American tomato from the grocery store, which tells me the tomatoes in Greece were very fresh organic tomatoes they were using.  ###June 27:This was our second full day in Athens, and we walked around on some of the Athens streets to some highend boutique stores, and found the purses to be better priced in Athens, even with the Conversion Rate: TRAVEL TIP: If you are looking for a high end purse, you should buy it while you are travelling in Europe, because you are refunded the tax (VAT), which ultimately decreases the overall price of the purchase. The only caveat is that you have to mail the proof of purchase to have your CC eventually credited. We also did a sightseeing tour to the Museum, and of course the Acropolis. Since we went at the end of June, it was extremely hot, and furthermore, we were experiencing a Heat wave at that time also. It was Very Very Hot. And since you have to climb up the Hill to get to the Acropolis, it got very hot and very tiring.  TRAVEL TIP: Make sure you have a big Thermos or 2 in your knapsack to keep your water cold, else the water will get warm very quickly. And believe me; you will need the cold water, during the Hot Season. TRAVEL TIP: The Travel company tour for 65 EURO pp from the hotel was way overpriced. Not required. Alternative is to get a taxi and go to the acropolis yourself. This bus tour took you on a sightseeing tour of some of the things to see in Athens, but you remained on the bus until you got to the Acropolis (with one stop in between at a small Soccer stadium). After which, we went to the old Greek Plaka area in the evening, which is a nice long strip of Patios and Restaurants, and had some delicious Eggplant appetizer (sort of like Baba Ghanoush) and some Greek beer on one of the Patios.After 2 days in Athens; we went to the Athens port to board the Jet ferry to Mykonos.....Which is a different post you should read. :-)",4,"2 Stay Stopover @ Polis Grand in Athens, prior to Mykonos....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d570105-r508236954-Polis_Grand_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,KP12014

We never understood the shower. There is this really nice rain shower but there is no shower plate, so the water floods the whole bathroom after you shower.This might sound exotic, but when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is rather a slippery, cold and wet experience.Hotel staff were mixed.

If and when in Athens again, I would probably stay here now we're familiar with it. Tip - I traveled back to the airport separately from my wife and son. They were told by reception that a) there would be plenty of taxis available in the street and b) the flat fare back to the airport is €44 (compared with the fare in of €38). She couldn't find a cab and was charged the €44. I made the same journey the next day, found a row of cabs in front of the nearby metro station and only paid €38.

A new hotel in the town I think they open in the last days in 2016. In that moment i order this hotel its was long down on the ranking list on trip advisor but before i travel then running up hundreds of places. I like to know what other people means about the hotel and everything around it like neighbourhood and whats include and what you can do also on the hotel. I choosed this after short thinking because of they could give me what I wanted I am only in a small contact with hotel before i choose where to stay and Maria was answering my mails very fast. I am not a very difficult person for the hotels I only have a few wishes and they promise me them. Hotel is located in Metaxourghio. Not the most central place but for me I dont have problem for jumping on the metro who was 5 minutes away. The hotel have a lot taxi outside and they bring You to central places for around 5 euro. I took metro blue line from airport to Syntagma station and then changed line to red line for next step. I guess I used around 1 hour i didnt look at clock the metro price i 8 euro since its the airport line. Taxi cost around 45-50 euro and taking 30-35 minutes. Before I went here I read that the neighbourhood was scaring in my head I didnt have the same feeling I was feeling very safe there. Not so much to see around hotel but there are nice cafe and small shops for buying drinks and a bakery thats like a heaven for people who like to enjoy the life. Ok lets speak about the hotel. In check was super quick and I could choose room for very good sleeping quality or having room with good view. In that situation after long travel and very tired I didnt know what i wanted but after a little talk the lady in reception upgrade my room for free and i choosed to stay in 8 etage a good choose since I only had 9 floor over me with swimming pool and bar/restaurant. In my etage was the spa area I didnt try it.Swimming pool is not big but I was there in the opening hour and catch a sun bed and i got sun a couple of days and cooling down my body in swimming pool I like that very much. The view from the top etage is fantastic at some area You see direct on target nr 1 Acropolis. I was taking some beer in the evening and sitting straight to Akropolis You a evening in the dark for the memory book.About restaurant for breakfast and dinner I cant say anything since I dont use it when I travel. Room was big I guess 30 m2. Bathroom fantastic with big big shower. Room was clean and fixed every day even I didnt hang out the fix room sign when i leaved the hotel. Sleeping quality super I slept like a kid. Big television i didnt use it. Some possibility to make coffee and tea free for some days then some small paying I dont drink this things. Minibar with a lot too choose in drinking or small eating product where the prices was very high. Example a box of coke 5 euro and 1 minute outside hotel its 1 euro. Safe. Good big cabinet for placing your clothes. Good body product on the bathroom with sandals. Bathrope. A lot of towels. In swimming pool You get towels in the bar for using there. 4 lift for taking You up and down so never waiting time. Reception very professional when I had question about typical tourist things to see and honestly in the heat 32-38 degrees around where to go everywhere and what could be a kind of hard. I like that at all. A very little minus they didnt have stamps for my postcard but maybe me who is old fashion and sending that in the year of 2017. The first day I was waked up early because of there was no not disturb sign there and i missed a little moment the miss of bath tub so I wrote that to Maria. She answer almost before i sent the mail. I am the mail man not a phone guy. And she wrote take contact with reception before You leaving hotel today the manager want to speak with You. Then i felt a little stupid but I took contact and he want to know if there was more they could do for me. Change room or all other wishes I choosed in a second to say everything is good I dont need bath tube and sign for not disturb I had fixed already with contact with housekeeping. There is now noise from the room closed to You, you cant hear nothing. I like the part with music in the ? Hallways 24 hours super nice relaxing music when You come to room or leaving it. There are all kind of service to get food to your room I think 24 hours of the day. They have sales of tickets for hop on hop of and one stop is 2 minutes walk from hotel. If I not stop now I will write 200 pages. So what shall i say is it a 5 stars hotel ? I havent stayed on one before with so many stars I am a easy guy and in my head right now the day after – YES it is. Everything was perfect and if I one day go back to Athens I will stay here. I got super law prices since I using some other pages for ordering and I got a kind of one day offer in half price. I recommend this hotel. Thank You for everything all at Wyndham Hotel Athens. Only comment is after goodbye is that the question under is a kind of difficult. Non smoking yes on the room but at top bar No. I dont like this question under here i dont have 100 control.

We booked an Acropolis View junior suite due to the extra space it would provide for our son (basically an extra room). The room was great, very spacious with an amazing view of the Acropolis. Loved the free toiletries! More expensive Greek brand than Korres which I hadn't seen before. The downside was a lack of drawer capacity to put clothes in (really lacking here despite a good size wardrobe space) and the rather strange huge showerhead which was so large it felt as if you were drowning whilst showering. Very odd indeed. We also had a bit of an issue with the daily maid service, as although very good, if you weren't out of your room by around 10am a note was put through the door saying our room wouldn't be cleaned today. We had to ask at reception for it to be serviced on 2 occasions. This has never happened before to us in a hotel.Breakfast was fine but quite chaotic which often seems to be the case at large hotels in Europe.The pool area is nice, the pool itself was larger than I expected given what some people have said in their reviews but the area itself is tiny- the hotel could have made this larger and forsaken bar/ restaurant space. We were lucky enough to be able to get a sun lounger for an hour or so at the end of the day after sight seeing but had to wait. Couple of gripes though- the music is terrible and very very loud- no idea why the staff feel this is a good thing. And the pool is FREEZING. Again no idea why given its size and the heat in Athens.The service/ staff were mixed. Wherever you seem to go in Europe when staying at large 4/5 star hotels staff are often snooty and at times not helpful (is this a requirement?) but this isn't the case in smaller family run hotels (see my review of our stay in Spetes- Nissia Residences). For example I asked for 3 towels by the pool, not only was I told to wait by the guy (not sure what he was doing as he was just stood there) but he questioned why 3 when there was my son and I (husband was on his way) and was reluctant to hand over a third.The location of the hotel was as expected as per other reviews. But you know this when booking so no point in complaining about it. The metro is a few minutes walk so getting around is quick and easy. The restaurant acoss from the hotel (Alexander the Great) was a godsend for us as we arrived late at night and needed somewhere closeby to eat. We weren't sure what it would be like but the food was lovely, good sizes and staff very nice. We ended up eating here twice during the 4 nights and then came back on our last night in Greece 2 weeks later.Overall despite a few issues we did like this hotel, one of the main reasons we chose to stay was for the pool area, as I have said this could have been better.",4,"Good hotel, fab views of Acropolis",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10961869-r504168161-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,claire2767

We had a car and valet service was good (just drop the car off at the entrance of the carpark and the valet guy will park it for you). The location of the hotel is okay, there's a train station across the road, but you would have to be fit for 51 steps down into the station and up when you return to the hotel. There is a bread shop opposite the hotel (24 hours) in case you need some breakfast/supper. There is a swimming pool in the rooftop area but it's always crowded. We can see acropolis from the rooftop bar. Facilities in the rooms were good - you get a coffee maker (2 free capsules only) and the usual - fridge, ironing board etc, the usual.

The staff are very friendly and attentative. The buffet breakfast is very good, with plenty of choices. The crown Jewell of this hotel is the rooftop bar/restaurant, which offers a million dollar view of Acropolis, both day and night. We've enjoyed lovely ice cream with the fab view every night there, and it only costs 3 Euro each, and the staff couldn't be nicer. We didn't eat meals there as it is quite pricey. However, just opposite the hotel entrance, there is this lovely family run restaurant called Alexander the Great, which offers delicious grilled dishes, fried zucchni, Greek salad and Mousaka for very reasonable price. We ended up eating dinner twice there.The hotel is located in the middle of the metro lines between the airport and the Port, which suits us very well, as we were taking a Med cruise from Athens. The metro stop is only 2 minutes walk away.Just be aware that not much air conditioning at metro stops, and in peak summers, it gets really hot in Athens 35 a 47 degree!) and so it can be uncomfortable. A Metro day ticket for unlimited rides only costs 4.50 Euro, and so it's a cheap way to get around.",5,Excellent hotel with a fabulous rooftop bar/restaurant offering amazing views of Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10961869-r504805506-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,Jane S

Bathroom was very spacious also and plenty towels & toiletries.Staff were super helpful with info on Athens, hotel and booking taxis etc for onwards journey and ordered driver for pick up at airport. Breakfast - excellent - lots to choose from and relaxed.Excellent views of the Acropolis from bar and the bar is itself a great place to hang out later in afternoon or in evening. However, I've given a 4 star rating as service is very poor on rooftop. There were times we waited 20 mins from ordering at bar when supposed to be table service.On a couple of occasions we had to wait a while on pool towels being delivered to bar area - this is the only place the hotel is let down.

You walk up the block and you're in a square and about a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis museum. You're walking distance from all the major ruins sites as well. The location is unbeatable. It was a quiet street too, we didn't have any problems with outside noises. One thing to note is, if you book a car through the hotel to the airport, they say its 38 euros flat. It's not.

We planned it for months, and decided after much investigation to stay in the Melia in Athens, Greece. Our flight, transfers and all of our plans went perfectly. Except for our choice of hotel. There were many issues with this Hotel . The internet did not work well , the room was not very clean, the shower was moldy, the blow dryer didn't work and when it was replaced we couldn't use it in the bathroom, we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it. But that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced. An electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet (that what the management at the hotel said). This worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open, he said he had to check something n the basement, this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by, for more than five minutes. I happened to return to the room to find that situation. When I went to the management at the hotel, they tried to tell me that the room wasn't unattended when clearly it was. The man who left it open came down and apologized for leaving the room open and unattended for that period of time.I was left feeling violated and untrusting of this Hotel.

Sorry Alexandros - you were amazing. The hotel is a bit tired, but the rooms work well with all the amenities. I have a feeling you get decent value for money with breakfast included. BUT 1: the internet is so bad that it surprise me in 2017. BUT 2: The food in Sky Bar you have to steer away, (sad quality) but the drinks are incredibly good even though they cost 10-15 euros. Same price as in Norway - so for us this is natural. But the view of the Acropolis from the Sky Bar is worth the entire stay.

If you buy tickets for the day you can take the bus directly to the tourist attractions and save yourself the cab fare. If you want to go back out in the evening you could take the bus again and get off near the Plaka for dinner.

The hotel is in a good location, common areas are well maintained, the rooms are well sized, modern and soundproof. Some of the stuff was very attentive, breakfast was great. I would like to point out the things that in my opinion really distinguish a good hotel from a great one. As soon as I arrived for my check in around 12pm on a Sunday afternoon, there was only one employee at the reception and was busy with an airlines crew that was checking in before me. I was standing there, waiting for my turn and for approx. 15’ the receptionist didn’t raise her eyes from the computer screen and the documents in front of her. A simple nod of the head or an eye check would have been enough but she didn’t even notice me. The same day I also noticed that some food trays remained outside the rooms in the hotel aisles for quite a few hours. Maybe the hotel was understaffed that day.The thing that really put me off though and made me write this review is the following. A few hours after I checked out, I realized I had forgotten in the mini bar fridge an envelope with my name on it, which contained some medical treatment I was using at the moment. I called the reception and they connected me with the lost and found department. I informed them about this incident and they told me they’d look into it and I should call them back in a while. When I dialed again, I was told that unfortunately the maid had thrown the envelope away. The lady on the phone was very kind and apologetic and she advised me to call the hotel manager to report it, mentioning his name. I called again at the reception, asking to talk to the manager but because he was unavailable at the moment I was transferred to another manager or something (don’t remember names or roles). I was quite upset at the moment but I calmly described to him the incident, which he was already aware of. The purpose of the call was just to report what had happened, so they can try and improve in that area. However, the person on the other side of the phone in an arrogant way replied “what do you want now, we can’t compensate you for this, people leave things back all the time and we throw away a lot of stuff everyday”. I replied that I’m not seeking any compensation, I just deemed necessary to report this to the hotel management so they can train their stuff or do whatever they think is necessary to improve (I work in the customer service industry and feedback is always welcome to me). Quickly he realized that he shouldn’t have responded like that and he apologized for the incident. However, damage had been made. This is something that you don’t expect from a 5 star hotel. Should he had responded with something like “sorry for that, next time you stay with us you will receive a complimentary drink/dinner/night/anything” they would have won me. With this attitude though, I don’t think I’d stay there again.",3,Not up to the expectations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d229415-r508105277-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Athens_City_Centre-Athens_Attica.html,George V

The restaurant has great food and the restaurant staff is wonderful.The wifi signal is strong and the beds are very comfortable. Cons: I was very surprised to see mold in the shower. This removal of bathroom mold should be a priority for a hotel. The carpets should be removed since they are stained (we stayed twice on separate occasions in two different rooms). In addition, we made a last minute decision to go to the beach because of the heat wave in Athens. We requested additional towels from the front desk for that reason and was told that they only have enough for the rooms. The front desk said they would still ask the housekeeping but they never even followed up with us. This response is VERY unprofessional. Firstly, chain hotels have 2-3 times the amount of towels necessary and towels are cleaned thoroughly so all stains can be dissolved. This was the only hotel during our three week stay that answered this way in all the islands and mainland properties we visited.

Our first dinner there, it was 108 degrees that day. My husband went in shorts, collared shirt and shoes, hoping they'd make an exception. Nope - he had to go back to the room and change. Perfectly understandable until the restaurant let in other diners in shorts! I don't think they were at the hotel and therefore couldn't change but that almost makes it worse.

So many “grand’ hotel properties are in need of serious investment and so many operators are only interested in squeezing profits out and putting as little investment as possible back in.Given the financial problems suffered by Greece, all so well publicised, I half-expected a tired ‘grand’ hotel. Instead, I have experienced a hotel that could put some of the Grand Hotels in London to shame. This is a truly GRAND hotel with service to match and everything is immaculate, the public areas, the accomodation and the staff. What a lovely surprise.Every part of this hotel has been fitted out with taste and in an exquisite manner with total attention to detail. Arrival is excellent, reception is excellent, the French guest relations lady could not have tried harder and the introduction from the butler was as good as it gets…way better than the butler service at The Plaza, central park NYC where they simply say hello and let you know they exist. Here they meet you at reception on arrival, are very proper but NOT stuffy (none of the team here are “stuffy”), show you to your accomodation, ensure everything is perfect, sort out luggage arrival…and anything else needed. All-in-all, a first class welcome from the point one pulls up outside from the airport.The accomodation is faultless, for example: shower pressure is first class; slippers are high quality and comfortable as are the dressing gowns; bed linens (and the beds) are high quality and extremely comfortable, easily Ritz Carlton standard and way better than a typical American Fairmont property; Wi-Fi superb; all room expectations are exceeded on every level, for example…of course the room safe has an internal mains charging socket and of course the safe is a decent size and easily takes a full size Apple laptop; the furniture is all of exceptional quality as is the décor.Of special note are the staff who are just so very helpful and in the superb rooftop restaurant where we dined last night and breakfast, the staff are absolutely lovely…a real delight. We had a waitress with shortish red-hair serve us breakfast this morning and I really don’t think I have ever been served in such a genuinely lovely manner anywhere before…she was an absolute delight to experience.There are two pools, one inside, one outside…I could go on and on but suffice to say, this is a truly great hotel. My family all love it. For a property to be as good as this can only mean one thing…the management have to be first rate. This is a brilliantly managed property and those responsible clearly seek excellence without compromise…and that is what we have experienced.We did experience one hiccup with a transfer but this could have been down to either the concierge or the car service they use, however just because one thing goes wrong is no reason not to give a truly 5 Star hotel the praise they deserve…and that is a Five Star review. Although I travel abroad twice a month at least, I have not been reviewing much this past year as I don’t have the time…but I had to review this hotel having read those few negative comments below.

The hotel is beautiful and elegant and immaculate. Had it not been for our mediocre check-in experience we would have given HGB 5 stars! After a very long flight we arrived at the hotel about 2 hours before the official check-in time. We acknowledged that we were early but requested an early check-in if possible. We understood when they informed us that they couldn't accommodate our request, so we asked if they could notify us when our room was ready. We were unapologetically told that they could not and that we would need to periodically check with the front desk to learn if the room was ready. They wouldn't even give us a time estimate. Frustrated, we decided to go sightsee instead of staying in the hotel lobby.For a hotel of this caliber we feel our request was not unreasonable. All we asked for was the courtesy of a phone call or text but we were denied that gesture. Great hotel facilities are important but even more important is great customer service. In all the hotels we visited in many parts of the world, this was the first time we were treated so indifferently at check-in.

The roof top restaurant has spectacular views of the Acropolis and it was a pleasure to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant every morning. Breakfast was the only meal we had at the hotel and it was good, albeit extremely crowded and therefore not remotely peaceful. There is also a small rooftop pool which is lovely to visit after a day's sightseeing - if you are lucky enough to secure a sun lounger (everyone has the same idea about a post-sightseeing dip).

You are well within walking distance to the Old Town - Plaka, Acropolis Museum ( which is another must visit when you are in Athens), Arch of Hadrian, Temple of Olympian Zeus, etc. The property is pretty big and tastefully updated. It does give you a very grand feel to it. The gift shops are like museum's gift shop. Everything there please your eyes and taste buds, if not your wallet. The hotel has both an indoor and outdoor pool, restaurants, spa, separate check-in for suite with butler service. The Junior Suite with Butler service is very spacious with lots of room to move around with a King bed, roll-away bed for our 6 six year old, walk-in closet and a bathroom with separate shower and bath tub, double sinks and well accessorized with Molten Brown toiletry. The suite also has a good size desk and ample room for a sitting area with a arm chair and sofa with a coffee table. The only thing that I can see improving would be placing some clear anti-slip pad between the glass and the coffee table and bedside tables to prevent the glass keep sliding away from the furniture.Besides its own Roof Garden Restaurant on the 8th floor overlooking the Acropolis, Parliament Building, amphitheater, and the city, Hotel Grande Bretagne's brother hotel, King George Hotel, which is just located next door, also has a roof top restaurant called Tudor Hall sharing the same view. Tudor Hall has been awarded Michelin Star 2017. Butler and Concierge at the hotel can assist you in making reservations for both restaurants. Don't miss these two restaurants when you are in town!!Staff are very friendly. The cleaning ladies we met on the hallway are all very friendly with great smile on their face. The suite are very clean and well maintained. If there is anything that I have to comment on the downside would be the check-in process which was rather slow. We didn't get into the our suite well beyond the promised time at 2pm. We weren't alone as while we were waiting on the 6th floor receptionist area for the guests who reserved suites we witnessed others who were like us waiting to access their rooms.

The hotel is located a 5 min walk to Monastiraki metro station to go to the airport (instead of the kiosk machine which sells one-way ticket at 11 euros, I bought a 2-adult ticket to the airport for 18 euros). The hotel itself is subtle on the street - we walked by twice without noticing it as on the weekend all the shops on the street are closed. It is a gorgeous hotel - great amenities and restaurant. After a long journey upon arrival we were greeted with ice cold water and a few welcome appetizers. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. At night you are literally staying next to Psiri, the latest ""it"" place for restaurants and shops....which is convenient so you don't have to walk around dodgy hoods at night or get pestered by taxi drivers.

The only reason I don't have 5 stars for O&B is I think the rooms themselves could use a little love.

The restaurant on the 7th floor serves a wonderful breakfast and the restaurant itself is impeccably run. I was upgraded to a suite (I have platinum status), and the room was large and very comfortable. Probably one of the most comfortable beds that you'll find. Now to the negative: the hotel itself is portly run. I arrived in Athens close to midnight and had an early morning tour scheduled for the next day. I as staying for 3 nights, but under 2 reservations (part of the nights was being paid for by points). Upon checking in, I was told that I would probably need to switch rooms the next day but they wouldn't know until the morning. I expressed my unhappiness with this potential as I was going to be gone all day and that the very reason why I paid for the first night (instead of using points...the hotel was ""sold out"" for points that night) was so that I didn't have to worry about changing hotels or rooms. When I came down the next morning to see what decision had been made, I was told that I'd have to wait until after 0900 when the manager got it and that i should pack everything up because I might need to move. As you all are familiar, repacking when you're trying to relax and make a tour departure time is not fun and puts a damper on your day. But I did this. When I arrived back after a long day of touring Delphi, the manager was unapologetic and didn't see why I was annoyed. It took the very nice front desk lady to see my annoyance and offer me an apology (which is really all that I was looking for). In addition to this, there were room attendant carts blocking the hallway at all times of day, a toilet that kept running, a shower drain that wouldn't drain, and a shower head that sprayed all over. For the price of this hotel, I think this is all really unacceptable.

Or is the sense to make more profit with guests? So I answered the mail and informed the hotel that I am a frequent guest and in addition I stayed several times in the neighbor sister hotel Grande Bretagne which is located in the next house less than 10 meter away.Check In:Upon arrival there was no warm welcome. We received the keycard to room 104 facing the busy road in front of the hotel with view to the square and government building.The room has a balcony.Nobody has guided us to this room! When entering the room there was not a card with a warm welcome!

But guess what: The door was locked and protected with a cable. Guests are unable to open the balcony doors!I needed to call the reception to ask that somebody should open the doors with a key!So we left the room.

But this new second chair was not the same type of chair. It was coming out of a conference room and not comfortable at all.Bathroom:In the evening after a hot day I wanted to have my bath in the bathtub.So I filled in the water. When I returned from the toilet there was a flooding in the bathroom! What was the reason?At the same time water was running out of the water taps and also out of the hand shower!I needed to clean and dry the bathroom.After then having had a bath I wanted to let out the waste water. But it was impossible!The complete technical sanitary equipment was faulty!Why was the staff unable to see, check and repair it?Breakfast: I took a slice of bread. The taste was awful!

So initially I was disappointed that neither hotel had availability and I ""settled"" for booking the Electra Metropolis because it was in the vicinity of the others. Now if you ask me where to stay, I would tell you without question the Electra Metropolis. The Electra is located more in the heart of where you want to be in Athens. Turn right out of the hotel and walk a few blocks and you are at Syntagma Square. Turn left and you are right on the edge of Plaka's pedestrian-only streets. Keep walking down the street (Mitopoleos) and it will end at Monastiraki Square where train station and flea market are located. Everything was walkable. The rooftop view of the Acropolis isn't just for those who make reservations or spend money at the restaurant - the free breakfast is served on the rooftop every day. While the pool is also located on the rooftop, we were there during a heat wave so it was always crowded. But that didn't keep us from enjoying a pool - Electra also has a heated indoor pool and we had it all to ourselves. The hotel is somewhat new so everything is clean and pristine. The room and especially the bed were extremely comfortable. The staff were very friendly and eager to serve. There was only one exception to that and it wasn't enough to change my rating - the breakfast (which has a nice selection of traditional and Greek items) is served buffet style but the waiters handle the coffee. Two mornings we had the same waiter and we had to ask several times for coffee refills.",5,Breakfast with a view - perfect location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10798588-r505986621-Electra_Metropolis_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,VS87

We came as part of our honeymoon, and when we arrived, we were very pleased. The hotel arranged transport for us from the airport to the hotel which went seamlessly. Upon arrival, we were glad to see the hotel is in the perfect location in Athens, it is gorgeous, our room was spacious and modern, and the front desk staff were very friendly. Our upgraded room even had a stunning view of the acropolis. Even better, we received a complimentary bottle of prosecco and beautifully decorated dessert welcoming us to the hotel for our honeymoon!  Now for the ""cons:"" several months prior to arrival I'd been in contact with the front desk specifically requesting a table at the restaurant for dinner our first night there, preferably on the balcony with optimal view of the acropolis at night. I was told this would not be a problem and they could assure me a special table. Upon arrival, the front desk manager called the restaurant to confirm our reservation, who it seemed had no record of it. Luckily, he was able to obtain a reservation for us anyway. Upon arrival, however, despite my questioning the location, we were seated inside. I originally figured this was just a ""blip,"" but then witnessed at least ten additional people who had the same issue and saw them telling the hostess that they had specifically requested an outside table with a view. Now, regarding the service... While the staff at dinner was friendly enough, the lack of attention was outrageous for a five star hotel (not to mention an expensive meal). We would go 20+ minutes without ever seeing our server, my water glass remained empty for almost half hour (multiple times), and after receiving our entrees, it took over an hour before anyone checked on us again and we could ask for our bill (or even ask for more wine)! At first I thought it was just our table, but quickly looked around the restaurant and saw exasperated faces on many of the patrons, so it seems a common problem. The next morning we went to breakfast in the same restaurant. Breakfast was very crowded. While the buffet food was decent, it seemed the staff could not keep up with the number of guests, as carafes of juice and water and the buffet were almost always empty, and my husband waited over 30 minutes at the table until he finally found a manager to ask for a cup of coffee. The table behind us had ordered omelets from a server and I heard them ask TWICE where they were (since it was over 45 minutes later); several tables down a server brought two espressos to the wrong table, and when the table it was intended for stopped her and said the espressos were for them, the server rolled her eyes and walked away to (begrudgingly) get them another. Unfortunately, both experiences at dinner and breakfast really affected our experience at the hotel. I've stayed in many luxury hotels before, and the service here was unacceptable. While the hotel is in fact beautiful and the location ideal, if they want to compete with other 5 star hotels in the area, the Electra Metropolis definitely needs to re-think and overhaul the restaurant experience for guests. I do not believe we will be returning, as there are several other 5 star options in the area.",3,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, restaurant needs MAJOR change",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10798588-r505520791-Electra_Metropolis_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,krismb2017

Our classic room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom as well.We went up to the rooftop our first night to lay by the loungers and were really impressed with the gorgeous view of the Acropolis all lit up. When we returned the next morning for breakfast it was an equally stunning sight.Breakfast seemed a bit understaffed but that wasn't a problem since it is a self-serve buffet for the most part. The selection is quite lovely, with yogurt, fruits, meats, eggs, waffles, pancakes and so much more. We only needed a server for coffee and someone eventually came around.Overall I was satisfied with our stay and would definitely recommend it as a base in Athens!",5,Gorgeous Rooftop & Amenities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d10798588-r508265787-Electra_Metropolis_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,amrisab

We showed up with 4 passports and the man at the reception simply said you can't stay here with an attitude. He was very impatient and didn't seem like he wanted to try to help us. After talking to him for a bit, he said there's a room at another floor and checked us in. Our luggage took forever to be delivered to our room, like a good hour or so. Later this woman walks into our room without knocking on the door and says she needs to check the mini fridge. Did not say anything like I'm sorry to disturb you or I'll come back later, but simply came in and said she needs to check the fridge. After checking she says there are stuff missing in the fridge when we literally just checked in a few hours ago... shouldn't this be done before we are brought to our rooms??? Then later at night we get a strange call from the desk asking if we want the other room because we never got the key but we did... they also said someone came in but since we didn't have the key they found it strange and asked us a bunch of random questions when we kept telling them we got the key and we were the ones who entered the room.

As for the room itself, it is contemporary, the bed comfortable...on the firm side. The view from our room was just that of the building across the street. But, I believe there are probably a couple floors that might have a similar view of the Acropolis as that of the restaurant. We were on the 3rd floor. There was a tiny balcony outside. Basically a person could take one step out to look right or left down the street. The flat screen tv gave access to connect ones digital phone or pad up to screen their photos...an AP was needed though to do it. The tv had an alarm set up such that when programmed, it (the tv) would turn on at the designated time. Pay attention to the volume when using.

I enjoyed this hotel and Athens even though I only spent 1 night.Pros: Great location to all the action in Athens. Small supermarket next door. Amazing rooftop. AC works great, really liked the complimentary wine, greek treats, and water. 4 soft pillows and a comfortable bed as it should be appeared to be one large mattress not 2 beds together which is a bonus in Europe. Breakfast was nice, decent choice of food including eggs and bacon plenty of seating and food area was constantly being cleaned. I requested a taxi for the next morning it was outside on time, early in fact.Cons: Refurbished older building but definitely some obvious short cuts in construction. Elevator (lift) extremely small and slow not adequate for luggage and people I wouldnt mind all the steps but they were sketchy (uneven width due to winding circular design, I watched an elderly gentlemen try and navigate them carefully). I went to bed around midnight and had to be up at 8am for a flight, if this wasn't the case the dragging of chairs around on the rooftop at midnight and 7:45am would have been an issue as I stayed on the 6th floor. Overall: I will definitely return. I took off 1 star for 2 solid reasons. I respect rejuvenation of old infrastructure and the revamping of an existing space, however; The elevator (lift) is extremely small and extremely slow during busy times of day can prove to be a real inconvenience to people checking in bringing luggage to their room. Second slightly cut rate construction, blazing hot hallways, small hotel room results in my opinion Plaka is slightly high regarding price point per night for the overall experience in July though frankly Greece 24% tax rate could be a big factor in this. Neither of these reasons would prevent my return, they identify as a 3 star property and I would say they are on point. I plan on returning and thank Plaka Hotel for being a great property with helpful staff.",4,Solid 4 Stars for a good property in a great location!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d197721-r503730774-Plaka_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,SunsetInStyle

The breakfast is pretty standard for Greece. I did enjoy that they had a section with some Greek breakfast foods, such as the cheese pies and spinach pies. We also took advantage of their laundry service which cost 9 euro and allowed you to fill up a big garbage bag of clothes that were washed and returned the same day. We didn't put anything delicate or special, just essential items that we wanted. The staff were friendly and helped us as much as they could. The location was good, nearby to all the main areas and sights. My principal criticism would be the elevator, it was ridiculously small and couldn't fit all of us in it.

The best asset of this hotel is its location. It is very close to the sites and plaka and a lot of restaurants around. The rooms are very modern and its either you like the decor or not....we did not.

The lobby is very small with 2 desks acting as check in desks -- to me that is not a sign of a luxury hotel. Take note the hotel only has one elevator. The room is modern but not very pratical - bathroom sink is outside the bathroom and not flush to the mirror - which means you can wet the floor easily and your stuff can fall over -- this reminds me of the holiday inn and trafvelodge hotel rooms. The location of the light switches is just confusing -- the bathroom light switch is located all the way near the door entrance. The bathrrom door serves as the shower door so if the shower door is in use, there is nothing covering the bathroom. The people at the front desk - Vasilis and Elena are not what you would describe as warm and fuzzy - its like they are waiting whether you are friendly to them before they will react. The reception we got was very dissapointing. The people at the door though, were excellent. They were very helpful and always on their toes! Front desk - that is a diferent story. If you are an SPG platinum member do not expect any free breakfast as this is just a partner hotel.",3,Average hotel at best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d206785-r506065255-New_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,Konea2178
"July 16, 2017","16 Filellinon, Athens 105 57, Greece"," New Hotel ",5.0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d206785-Reviews-New_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"I arrived in Athens on a whim and did not have a reservation when I landed. I boarded the train to downtown and booked this hotel online on the way into town. I was drawn to it because of a wonderful experience I had a similarly themed hotel in Florence (See my Forte16 review). What drew me was the description that the hotel had been conceived with an architectural theme of conservation/renovation. The old hotel had been gutted and this new hotel was put together with all of the elements from the hotel including the furnishings. The hotel was easy to get to. I took a taxi from the Central Station, but it was so close I walked to the station upon my departure. There is really a Cool-Vibe when you enter the hotel. I think the staff were influenced and inspired by the concept; they were very knowledgeable about the hotel. The check-in was quick and I was asked then if I wanted to extend my stay at that time. I said, ""I'll wait for a day or two to make up my mind"" She told me the hotel fills quickly and sure enough, when it came time to check out, they were already fully booked. I was upset (not at them, but at me) because I really enjoyed the hotel. It is immaculate, it is safe, it is well-located and it is a smart hotel. There is a lot of technology managing the lights, the locks, the internet and the energy conservation. Bonus: the Acropolis is relatively close by and can be seen from the hotel. The restaurant was very good. Best breakfasts of my trip. The hotel has a casual hip atmosphere. You are well attended to, but it is not a pampering kind of hotel, so if you a bit uptight, it might not be for you. Very frequent traveler's will love this hotel. I was mad when I left this hotel, but only because I couldn't stay longer!!",5,Very Frequent Traveler's Will Love This Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g189400-d206785-r502632531-New_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,GilmerSensei
