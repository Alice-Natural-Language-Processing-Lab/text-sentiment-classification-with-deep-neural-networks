Checked in late on the Friday evening, room was on the 3rd floor which was fine but no elevator, only a problem if you have mobility issues. Room was small but lovely décor and nice clean bathroom. We were overlooking the street and had to have the windows open as it was quite a warm weekend so got a lot of noise from the people using the nightclub. It didn't really bother me and I got a good night's sleep regardless. One small tip to management would be to get fitted sheets, I woke up a number of times with the sheet bundled in the middle of the bed - small matter, I know but hey-ho! Overall a lovely central hotel with helpful staff and lots of bars/restaurants in walking distance.

Do your research before booking!! The only redeeming feature of this hotel is the location close to the city. If I could grade this hotel with a ""0.5"" or even a ""0"" I would. This is a 2 star hotel with a popular nightclub on site. Warned about noise after check in. Even found the hotel provided ear plugs - which didn't work !! We were provided with twin beds in a claustrophobic hotbox! One small window which had to be closed at night to minimise the noise from the nightclub. The ensuite was small and had a broken toilet lid and seat. In the room there was outdated information regarding meals. In reality we found - Breakfast available everyday. Lunch only Mon - Friday. No evening meals for guests on weekends. Bar on a Saturday not open until 11.00pm for the nightclub. No room service. No obvious facilities for the disabled.The nightclub proved to be a nightmare for us with the amount of noise generated and also the noise generated by the staff cleaning up and disposing of glass bottles at around 5 am. Hotel does not provide parking and after being directed to a car park ( 5 - 10 minutes walk away from the hotel) that supposedly gave hotel guests a discounted rate we found that we were charged the normal rate. Wifi poor inconsistent unreliable.

Got to sleep at about 5:30am. Made complaint at about 3am to night manager (Mark, who was very nice it must be said) about the noise, as was told by the receptionist that it would continue until probably 4:30. I was aware of the nightclub when I made the booking, and was prepared to be awake till around 3, but 5:30 is ridiculous. Nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle down.Our room faced onto the street, and the windows are not double glazed. The noise from the street, coupled with the noise from the nightclub, was deafening. On checkout I refused to pay the full fee, and without even coming to meet me and apologise, the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount. Now, while I appreciated the gesture, the reduction only brought the charge down to the 'normal' nightly rate, which in my opinion is still overpriced. This is a perfect hotel for those who plan to be out all night, and only get a little bit of sleep. Not for anyone who is going to bed 'early'.",1,Do not stay here if you want to sleep!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212668-r508649298-Russell_Court_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,LKJ2012

Avoid here if you are a remotely light sleeper. The location is handy for central Dublin but have your wallet ready to be ripped off throughout Dublin. The shower was powerful but the bathroom was very outdated and tiles were loose on the floor and roof. The hotel recommended a parking block and with the hotel stamp we got a couple of euros off the parking bill.

In summary, in 17 years as a field engineer I have stayed in many hotels. This, without a doubt, was the worst experience I have ever had!I arrived on the Monday morning having caught an early flight across to Dublin. Our trusty Team Secretary had booked a room for me here (at the time of booking it was known as 'The Camden Hotel by Thekeycollection'. Arrived early but unable to book in, so dropped my luggage off and went to work. I arrived back at the hotel at 1340hrs hoping to check in and expecting a rest after my early start. The room wasn't available (apparently it needed a 'deep clean'....not a good sign), and I eventually managed to get in at around 1420hrs.No chance of a rest due to the building works going on, so I gave up on any prospect of relaxing until the evening. Some chance! My room directly overlooked the bar area, with a single glazed (obscured) window. The music went on until 2330hrs. Ah well, at least I could lie in in the morning. Nope! Workmen started at 0715hrs! Went off to work and then had a repeat of the previous night, music until 2330hrs.Wednesday night had the added drama that when the music finished at 2330hrs I was able to grab some sleep......until 0230hrs when some noisy guests moved in across the corridor. My polite request for them to keep the noise down was met with a threatening response, and after a few calls to the concierge they were removed from the room at 5am (and they had been smoking in the room too....I hope they got billed the advertised 200 Euros!).At one point I went into the bathroom to see silverfish darting across the bathtub! Not a good sign!The Thursday night saw the music playing until 3am, and when I opened the window and looked out into the club/bar....IT WAS EMPTY!!! What the hell! I even tried to sleep in the bathroom (with the silverfish) but the music was still too loud. The hotel provide complementary earplugs (not a good sign), but I can't, nor should I have to, sleep with these in. I spoke to the concierge several times on the Thursday night to express my dissatisfaction, but it did no use. The music would drop in volume a little, and then creep back up. And every morning, by 0730hrs, I was woken from my brief slumber by the power tools and hammering below.In all, a stressful, sleepless week. The result of which is that our company will not be booking staff in there in future.The furniture was laughably shabby, the bedding starchy, the rooms stuffy (no aircon, and I couldn't open the window due to the noise)...it reminded me of Elwood Blues' room!And those silverfish!!!",1,Fawlty Towers would have been a preferred option!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212801-r501613300-Camden_Deluxe_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,APR1971

The hotel in itself is clean and basic, its also prepared for noise as each bed comes with earplugs but I cant fault it there, it fit the requirements.But my goodness the booking was a nightmare, I had a deposit paid two months before our stay only to be hung up on, when attempting to pay the rest of the bill in advance. Finally on sorting this out by having to go into the hotel a week prior to check in (thankfully I work close by) . On check in when the other 8 lads arrived again they were asked for more money. I went to the reception and informed them that it had been paid in full using my credit card, this was accepted, but I was told they would have to look into it yet again, leaving everything in the balance until checkout. I have never stayed in such an unprofessional place that continually asks guests for money, I realize they said it was a mistake, fine but there was no recompense or real apology for this pretty large( approx. 1500eur) mistake but I doesn't help the fact that they had my credit card details, I couldn't relax here TBH.

Turns out the bar was closed some months ago. Another misleading statement is ""free wifi"" -the wifi here is so weak it is unusable even for checking emails, let alone anything more demanding.

This is absolutely the only positive point I can make for it (however, it is not a nice area) -in retrospect, we should have stayed somewhere nicer and used the bus! The prices seem cheap, but you still get bad value for money as this place is little more than a hostel.The room was tiny, with broken furnishings, burns all over the patched up carpet, horrible bed -really uncomfortable. The bathroom was shabby and cramped. Water in the shower constantly fluctuated in temperature making it hard work. Very noisy, no double glazing and, it would seem, paper thin walls. Constant creaking of floorboards, noise from TVs, talking etc.The hotel feels un-secure. They have a terrible system where they ask you to leave your key at reception whenever you leave the hotel, but when you pick up a key no-one checks who you are (and the reception staff were different every day). Seems too easy for someone to just walk in and just get any key! We took our valuables out with us at all times, despite the inconvenience.Another dubious thing is that there is no drinkable water from the taps (unsafe due to lead pipes we were told) so if you want to use the kettle in the room you have to go out and buy bottled water for it!I am a low-maintenance traveler and was expecting something cheap and basic from this hotel, and that would have been fine, but the place is just awful.",1,Terrible!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212808-r502211561-Maple_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Alan C

The fire alarm did sound once or twice during the early morning but stopped before we had a chance to react. The windows were only single glazed (expectant of a Georgian period building), so the odd bit of traffic could be heard.

But the hotel is old and so has the character you'd expect: slanting staircases, small bathrooms with floors that have been recovered many times, small windows under the eaves in the top floor rooms. You have to be buzzed in, which I liked, and the place seems secure. When I first found the building, it looked a bit sketchy from the outside, but I came to appreciate the convenience of the location. I agree with others about the music. I didn't enjoy the first-thing-in-the-morning loud music in Murray's bar where we get breakfast. And the music does go on all day into the wee hours. I wore earplugs to sleep.

We booked the family deal with Dublin zoo tickets, dinner on the first evening and breakfast both mornings. I was a little nervous about staying after reading some of the reviews and on arrival as we turned the corner I got even more nervous with the appearance of the hotel, however on entering the hotel I noted that it was definitely more modern and nicer looking. We were quickly checked in and given our tickets for Dublin zoo and I was pleasantly surprised when we entered our room. We could immediately smell fresh paint which was nice and our room was really clean and nicely made up. It wasn't a huge room but fitted us all in nicely, the bathroom had little flaws but was clean. I think we stayed in the refurbed part of the hotel as it looked a lot differently than the other part of the hotel where the kids movie night was held. The kids movie night was being hosted by two very young hotel workers but they were pleasant and very helpful. We had our evening meal which also surprised us as it was 3 courses for adults and 2 for children. The food was nice and ok. Not fancy in any way but totally edible, feeling and nice. We had a drink in the bar located in the hotel and it was nice and had tvs to watch. There was music on the second night but we didn't go in. We slept ok, very warm but the beds were comfortable. We didn't use the pool as we couldn't justify paying for the head caps required to use the pool. They were 3 euro each. Our kids were excited to go to the pool but we thought the price was unjustifiable for the length we would be in. The times weren't also suitable as kids weren't allowed in before 9am and after 7pm which meant if your planning to go to Dublin for the day as we did, we would have to cut short our day. Breakfast was a little limited, fry items, wheaten bread, toast and a small selection of cereal and yoghurt. some pastries would of been nice All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.",3,"Would stay again! 3 1/2 out of 5, not quite a 4.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d213287-r503583497-The_Regency_Hotel_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Nicola P

On the plus side, our room did have in-room controlled AC but it took a while to cool the room down. Carpets throughout the place could use replacement. On the negative side, our room was on floor 5. This didn't seem a problem until after checkin when we realized that the elevator goes only to floor 4 and then we had to carry our suitcases up the back stairwell. A very nice bellman helped on checkin but checkout was on our own. Not sure why we were given this room (5116 which could not have been further from the reception area) when it seemed that there were many rooms on 4 that we walked past that seemed vacant. We are not yet ""elderly"" but not exactly young either (60'ish) and the man at reception probably should have asked us or considered that we were carrying 5 pieces of luggage and two of them quite large, when he assigned us to the most difficult room in the hotel. We had to pay full payment on check-in. Not a problem for us but I saw one traveler who was upset about this.

While the Dawson had a fantastic location and looked great, its beauty was only skin deep. It has a long way to go to get near other boutique hotels we've paid similar prices for.Things started well. It would be hard to better the Dawson's location, on a gracious street full of upscale shops and restaurants that links Trinity College to St. Stephen's Green. Directly across the street is the gracious Georgian facade of the Lord Mayor's residence, Mansion House. After passing under a glass and wrought-iron canopy most likely added by the Victorians, you enter a classic Georgian entry hall and proceed up broad, elegant stairs to the lobby on the first floor. They certainly have the boutique look down, with oversized gold-gilt Georgian and Baroque furniture and luxe fabrics mixed with modern accessories and lighting, and all of the calming neutral wall colours currently in vogue.We'd upgraded to a junior suite, primarily because we'd booked at short notice and rooms in the city were limited. It was also clear that people in search of peace and quiet should avoid the cheaper rooms facing onto the main street; the Dawson described them as ""vibrant"", especially on weekends. (Translation: the hotel's bar is just one in a line of trendy establishments that pour loud groups of merry-makers onto the pavements at night. During the day, construction noise and a bus stop for several of the city's hop-on-hop-off tours keep things lively.) Thus the anticipation of almost £200 a night hitting our debit card raised expectations, as well.The Ares Suite was indeed beautiful, with an enormous bed under a canopy, a fanciful footstool and sofa, a capsule-style coffee maker and a bathroom the size of a double bedroom with a striking free-standing tub. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the linens of top quality, and the room was blessedly quiet. But little things niggled. There was no shaver point in the bathroom, leaving us without the ability to charge our toothbrush. There was an unprepared hole in the wall (perhaps power was on the way?) More frustrating, the bathroom only had dusky mood lighting. Great for a romantic soak, but frustrating for more prosaic business. Surely a luxury boutique could offer two-stage lighting? I appreciated the fridge in the room, but was puzzled to find it hadn't been plugged in (hope nobody arrives with stuff they need to keep cold) and surprised to find it completely empty. A true boutique usually stocks your rooms with a few goodies.Service was adequate, but lacked the personal interest and the sense of going above and beyond I associate with boutiques. This might have been, in part, because the lobby is off to the side of the main stair. Once you check in, you have no reason to pass through. This means there's little contact with staff. When we did interact, it was efficient but perfunctory. We didn't encounter anyone with a local accent; though it may be an unfair assumption, the whole staff seemed to be from somewhere else, adding to a more corporate, impersonal feel.Our biggest issue, however, was breakfast. I hadn't confirmed that it was included in the rate, making an assumption that at that price ... and in a country that makes a big deal of its breakfast ... the meal would be part of the experience. And I sense that, under normal circumstances, it is. But we arrived to a notice that the kitchen had been closed due to ""unavoidable circumstances"". Probably just unfortunate wording, but I immediately imagined a health inspection shut down. The offered a continental breakfast instead. This was a disaster.Breakfast took place in a bar to the side of the main entrance, primarily free of staff and curiously cluttered with boxes, as if throwing people into the room for breakfast was an afterthought. The breakfast spread ... inelegantly scattered on a side table ... comprised boxed cereal, some fruit, yogurt containers and a stack of sale scones. There was a vat of boiling water and tea bags, but NO COFFEE. And no staff to handle any requests. Climbing upstairs to the lobby, we discovered they would bring us cups from the Nespresso machine there.I understand kitchen issues. But if you're going to put yourself out there as a luxury boutique hotel, you can do a better job on the continental breakfast. Have a staff member in the room to take care of people. Decant your cereals into glass jars. Lay on some platters of sliced meats and cheeses. Offer a varieties of pastries. Fresh ones. And, for heavens' sake, coffee. Ideally cafetieres or pots for each table so people can linger over their breakfast without having to request the next cup. Lacking all of these things, we sought breakfast elsewhere two of our three mornings.I wouldn't completely dismiss the Dawson. Its location is extraordinary and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. But all those little issues frustrate when you're presented with a sizeable bill on checkout. It's a hotel that could be great but, right now, it's not fully earning its ""boutique"" appellation.",3,"Great location, but misses the fine points needed to earn the boutique badge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d309650-r503161325-The_Dawson_Hotel_Spa-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,BencardsBites

We did manage to get water coming out of the side of the shower head and trickling out of the base, but we gave up because the inside of the bath beneath the shower was peeling from the effects of being painted with vinyl paint, and had a large rusty stain where one of the taps was constantly dripping (See photos)!We decided that it was safer to resort to standing up washes over the badly neglected vanity wash basin, (See photos, again).

She left and got another receptionist to take over. Name was Emilio who was comparably less accommodating than the first lady. He was very rude and made us feel like we were school children being told off rather than enduring good customer service. We asked for adjacent rooms and he said IF its available and not that he'll try. He was very dismissive and had a very bad attitude. Inside the hotel, it was clean and the rooms were clean but the shower cream was empty but luckily there was a supermarket where we were able to buy some toiletries as the toilet provided none but tissue paper. Hence the price we paid for it. The room was too hot and the window only opened a few inches. There was no other ventilation or air conditioning so had no choice but to sleep in a very warm room. We had breakfast at the hotel and considering we had it at 8am and it was not very busy, it was a big let down that they had ran out of orange juice but we had no other drink but milk. The area was a bit rough and because it was a warm room, we had to have the windows open. We had to listen to 2 drunken men outside shouting at each other. Also witnessed one of them urinating at the bus stop. Not a pleasant sight.

I went back down for them to reactivate it and climbed back up the stairs. This happened three times before I could get in to the room!It looked pleasant enough upon entering, but there was a lot of noise from the busy road out front, so I went to shut the window. Only, it wasn't open. That's genuinely just the noise you have to put up with through the paper thin window! Hopefully you are not a light sleeper like I am.Unfortunately from there it all went down hill. My bedside lamp didn't work, the socket by the bed had something snapped inside, there was something under the radiator which I hoped was just an old malteser that had been missed when the room was supposedly cleaned. The bathroom was also very tired looking, the soap tray under the shower was only just hanging on to the wall.On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and linen and towels were clean.

There was a small lift near the reception desk or you can take the stairs. The groundfloor was homely and decorated in the Edwardian style of the era of the hotel itself and had rooms off the reception area where you could sit in peace and quiet (if you wished) and admire the decor and stylish furnishings.There was a doorway leading from reception into the bar area which could also be accessed from another door in the street. If you go in the bar off the street, you'll see a plaque on the wall as you enter telling you that George Bernard Shaw once lived in the building that is now the Harcourt Hotel. Our room was very clean and and well presented, big enough for two and with an ensuite that was well maintained and clean. We were very pleased with it. The bed looked very clean and comfortable and on closer inspection it was, a good nights sleep was on the cards and it certainly didn't disappoint. After a great day visiting the Guinness store and walking around Dublin, it was a nice bolt hole to return to as you had the bar next door which served a good choice of hot or cold food and plenty of beers and cocktails were on display. As you'd expect, The odd Guinness was taken along the way. The bar staff were superb and enjoyed a laugh, a joke and a chat with us which was good see.Breakfast was also served here in the mornings but it was a different set-up with the food being served by caterers as opposed to full time hotel staff. There was plenty of choice and the cooked breakfast was made up of whatever you chose from the hot plates, be it sausage, bacon or scrambled eggs. There was also plenty of fruit, cereal and fruit juices with the usual tea or coffee options. The toast you had to do for yourself as they had one of those toasters where you drop the bread on a conveyor belt and wait for it to pop out the other end all brown and hot. Not that that was a big problem but your breakfast is losing heat rapidly while you wait for your toast or visa versa if you do your toast first. Not a great dilema to overcome all being said.Just at the back of the hotel bar was an outside area which was like a small undercover grotto which is obviously used during the summer months for BBQ's and watching sporting events on the TV screens scattered about out there. This I imagine to be a main partying area during the hot evenings of June to August. Although it wasn't being used as such in March when we were there, I couldn't help thinking that it does have the potential to be a noisy place during that time of year when it's packed with revellers. Our time there however was very peaceful and quiet.We really did enjoy our stay at the Harcourt, and it helped to make our first time in Dublin a memorable one. I would definitely stay here again if we return.",4,Two good nights in Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212675-r507785127-Harcourt_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,villa_fan_57

However, the pictures are deceiving, our room was very small (which I expected) but it felt like our room was a converted utility room. I never thought I would have to ask specifically for a room with a window at eye level. It was ridiculous and certainly would not pass Canadian fire codes. The whole trip we had a running joke about how nice our other hotels were because we had a window. The window in this room was near the ceiling, and had a mickey mouse cord tied to a handle to open and shut it. Further more, 'open' was not much.

Firstly I would like to say that whoever gave this place a 3 star rating needs to go back and check again. On arrival the first thing that struck us was the overwhelming smell of stale cooking. The triple room we paid over £400 for was the size of a postage stamp with not enough room to move around in. One of the beds was so near the entrance door that we had to keep pushing it back so that we could close it.The double bed was pushed right up against the wardrobe with very little space between that bed and the single one . To give an indication of how small this room was the tea and coffee facilities were in the wardrobe because there was no space for them anywhere else!!!. The bathroom had no space to move around in and had a damp mouldy smell. We were told that toiletries would be supplied so bought none with us but all that was provided was a hand wash by the sink and an empty shower gel dispenser in the shower. We queried this and were told we could have some toiletries that other guests had left behind!!. Our room was next to the fire exit door but when we looked there were 2 stacks of chairs, a folded up table, broken mirrors with shards of glass all over the floor and a Henry hoover blocking the stair case, not the easiest or safest exit if you are trying to get out of a burning building.

The front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless. Could not offer alternative room when I complained at the rooms allocated. Small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture. Our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it's a little on the snug side. Our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours. ""Ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get"" was the sympathetic front desk reply. The all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day. The photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of Guinness would I be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online.

Not this one. The rooms are new and very well furnished and comfortable. But the service isnt that great. To start off there is no valet or parking. You have to park your car at the train stations parking 500 meters away. Then the luggage. When we were leaving we had to load our own suitcases into the car. The train runs at the room's window. Really right at the window. The view is beyond horrible at suite 331. Standard room 336 has no view but thats better. The suite is spacious with a good bathroom. The toiletries are definitely like a 2 or 3 star hotel. You get a shampoo/ shower gel in one and conditioner but they are the big containers that you pump out of rather than the small ones usually found in 4 or 5 star hotels. The reception staff are nice enough but one guy that answers the phone is rude. When i asked for a kettle i was told to use the coffee machine. When i insisted to get one because i have a baby i need to boil water for they got me a dirty one. The location is ok not great. The gym is part of the other old hotel belonging to north star hotels.

We had room-only and when we checked in at 5pm they asked us if we wanted to have breakfast included in our stay and we said yes. We paid for the room plus breakfast. When we went to the dining room the next morning we were told that we were not entitled to breakfast as we hadn't paid for it! They checked the paperwork which said we was room-only and then I asked them to call the reception - which was all rather embarrassing. It was confirmed that we had paid for breakfast but we had not been given our breakfast vouchers. So we had to go back to reception and get these before we were allowed to eat.

First impression, really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything. There was a really relaxed feel in the hotel. People were just sitting around, chilling in various locations (there are chairs and sofas around every corner...so nice). The people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to Beatrice. She went above and beyond. About 10 mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share, saving us both money. I thought it was a lovely touch. She was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before. Silly maybe but we both agreed that Beatrice's kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend.  The beer garden is really lovely. While we didn't get to eat at the hotel (other than late night pizza) but I think you could honestly go to the Sandymount and not leave the grounds. At one point I thought we would just forget Longitude and stay in the garden :) We were driving so with regards to public transport, I am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is co-located with the Aviva Stadium, I assume they are good.Last but not least, a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception who were there to greet us on our return from longitude in a perhaps 'little under the weather state' wanting food and more alcohol. I am sure you wanted to murder us but pizza and cokes were a far better option. :) I would highly recommend the location.

Of course the street gives some noise as can be expected, but since the room has double glass we didn't hear too much of it. However, the wall between the room and the reception/entrance hall is very thin, so it seems like people who are talking in the hall are standing right beside your bed. I sleep quite deep myself and the hotel provides earplugs, but when people start banging on the front door and ringing the bell for 10 minutes at 3AM because no one comes to open the door, this also wakes me up. Besides this, the doorframe of the hotel door is mounted directly to the wall of room 1, so any time people enter or exit the hotel and the door closes with a bang this gives a whole lot of noise. I've stayed in many hotels worldwide, good and bad, but they really shouldn't rent out this room as it's unsuitable to stay in.When we were woken up next morning around 6.30 due to a conversation in the entrance hall, they agreed to give us another room for the second night on the backside of the hotel.

Thanks for taking the time to flag this with us. We do have big issues with noise on Harcourt Street. We have some rooms that are quiet-er but nothing we'd consider silent by a long stretch. Harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in Dublin/Ireland for nightlife in general, we're completely surrounded by night clubs/late venues. Although there is little we can do to control this, we try to assign the quiet-est rooms to corporate guests, longer stays, pre-requests etc. to minimize the impact on our guests. I'm sorry if this wasn't communicated on arrival, I will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position.  As recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction work/acoustic insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours. We're working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort.  In relation to the lights, coffee machine and basin - we greatly appreciate feedback and I have personally followed up with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to ensure it does not happen for another guest.

The standard of luxury is brilliant and they really have gone above and beyond to make it worth the money. They have upgraded the rooms with smart technology, so we could operate all the lights and even open and close the curtains with a touch of a button. There was also complimentary Dairy Milk chocolate in the fridge, which is always guaranteed to win chocoholics like me over. We also had access to the rooftop lounge, which wasn't quite what I expected As well as that, the hotel was just a high standard, robes were provided and the cleaner did a brilliant job.

It is not. For a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises, it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet haven.When we arrived tired and hungry at 9:30pm, later than planned due to travel delays, we were told the restaurant was closing, even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until 10pm. The receptionist (who greeted us in a rather cold and fed-up manner) called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open, so we rushed through to the restaurant. The waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley, but he did start the conversation by saying ...”oh the chef is gonna be pissed off, grab a table and order quickly!”. The food was not good. We had booked a twin room that, according to the photos on Booking.com had two small double beds. On arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite. However, the “suite” was a room on the ground floor, at the front of the hotel, next to the busy car park. It was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed. It was noisy and depressing. My mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking. I went back to reception to query the room, and before I had even finished my sentence I was interrupted by another grumpy male receptionist to be told they were fully booked. This was not an answer to the question I was trying to ask, but it did make it a little clearer as to why we had been “upgraded”. I have worked in the hotel industry as an assistant manager and I know how these things work, so it was not a kind gesture but actually a shuffle of rooms to accommodate all the guests. In short, the two receptionists were very unhelpful, cold, and dismissive. We went to bed feeling really deflated.The next day we tried to look on the bright side, we had a nice day out in Dublin but had already decided that this was not the hotel we had thought we’d booked, and certainly not the quiet haven we expected. As a consequence, on Thursday morning (we arrived Tuesday night), we changed our flights to fly home 2 days early. The hotel gave us a receipt for all 4 nights even though we had only stayed two. They said that this was because we had paid up front through Booking.com. They tried to charge us for all 4 breakfasts (we had only had two), until we asked them to please refund us the £40. The staff in short were awful, and since returning home we have tried to get a little compensation for the 2 nights we were not there for, but no response. I highly advise steering clear of this so called Hotel.",1,Terrible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d277118-r507329696-Sheldon_Park_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,tessmabbitt

Really nice lobby, friendly reception staff. But no doorman. As a Hilton Gold member, I was upgraded to a room on the higher floors. The room was a reasonable size, immaculate and tastefully decorated with a modern/contemporary feel. The property next door is undergoing building works but didn't hear any noise during my two-night stay. The bar is also nicely decorated, and has a good selection of whisky/whiskey. Service was variable (initially attentive, but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it wasn't busy), and staff lacked knowledge on the menu. Having requested a Swedish whisky (which I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu) the staff member had to go and check with another; on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an Arran (a Scottish island whisky) off the back bar and suggested it. Hardly the same. The hotel has a couple of restaurants - Alfie's and Coberg. The first has pub food including a number of veggie options. The second (which is also where breakfast is served) has very limited veggie options (pasta and salad, with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish). I didn't dine in either given so many options nearby in town. Breakfast was a disappointment. No orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte (such as ""toast"") vs self service. On being seated (and it not being particularly busy) it took 10 minutes from ordering to get a cup of tea. Having stayed at many hotels in the Hilton Group, I was looking forward to their buffet breakfast. They had a selection of Continental and Full Irish, however lacking many of the usual spread of cooked items such as potato scones, baked beans, etc. The only eggs available on the buffet were poached, and very rubbery (I've had better from McDonalds). Service more resembled a cafe than a 5 star hotel in terms of quality and attentiveness, at one point with a staff member reaching over the table to take my plate. Whilst it's clear the hotel has recently undergone an extensive refurbishment they have bizarrely cut corners on some paint/varnish. A few examples:- Some doors and fixtures are worn / in need of painting. - The flooring in the main restaurant is in need of varnishing, with significant score marks at the smaller tables on wooden floor near the window. A few other issues with service, which whilst each relatively minor expect more from a premium hotel:- No orientation on hotel facilities (other than where breakfast was served) was provided. - On returning from a day's sightseeing at 5pm, the minibar hadn't been replenished. On requesting it to be, 7.5 month out of date potato chips were provided. On politely highlighting this at check out - having opened one and taken a bite before checking the date - the staff member didn't even acknowledge it, let alone apologise. - If you want to reach a department via phone - good luck! During the stay, the few times I tried the correct department it rang out continuously on multiple tries. You need to call reception to get an answer. - The room didn't contain a bottle opener so requested one. A barman arrived to open the bottle but not provide one, so highlighting I was intending on having a couple promised they'd return with one. Over half an hour later they had not, but on calling again one was quickly provided. - The room didn't have an information booklet on the hotel and it's facilities. - Check out was a slow and laborious affair... providing details of additional minibar consumption I was then presented with a bill without them, nor any credit applied for the booking via Amex. In all, lots of small issues that - considering the rack rate - is disappointing. I'll stay somewhere else next time I'm in Dublin.",2,At over €300 a night for a standard room it doesn't hit the mark.

Staff, maids, concierge all helpful and courteous.2. Bathroom features upgraded in this very old building.3. Nice duvet covers on the bed4. Fabulous breakfast! Kudos to the chef! Loved the croissants and warm blueberry muffins with of course, delicious Irish butter.5. Electric kettle in the room.6. Sparkling still in refillable water bottles in the room (tap water doesn't taste good).7. Great job cleaning the rooms.8. I paid 174 euros but for a bit more you can stay at the Intercontinental 5 star, which is light years ahead on every level. This is adequate if you are on a budget, just be aware of the following.Now the negatives:1. No air conditioning, just a portable fan. Also someone had turned on the steam heat behind the curtains and I didn't discover it until 3 days later. Uncomfortably warm!2. Insufficient staff. Check in time is 3pm but I waited for 2 hours in the lobby after traveling all night for my room to be ready. Many others had to do the same.3. No brewed decaf only yucky instant coffee.4. Although there is an elevator, there are multiple steps up and down from the elevator to your room. No problem unless you have heavy luggage.5. Very small closet space in this old building with attached hangers which drive me crazy.6. Very noisy room on the street and you have to leave the windows open for air. Had trouble sleeping.

It didn't; the stay was a good as the first. We like the kind of quirky old-world charm of the building and rooms. But this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel; it is a period place that is modernized but not modern. For people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room, because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms. A picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation; you can see that tBuswell's is made up of several old buildings joined together, and the rooms don't line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances. Do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay; not every room is accessible at Buswell's. The location really is ideal; the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along Kildare Street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at St. Stephen's Green. Everything in the city center is a few minute's walk away.Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at about 4 PM and the manager very graciously bought us a drink while our room was being made up. We didn't expect that and it was a thoughtful gesture. The hotel was entirely sold out and at peak occupancy. So, we passed some time enjoying the atmosphere in the bar. We had some snacks while waiting, too, and those were good and reasonably priced. The staff really is a pleasure.Our room was small (we were told this when we booked) but perfectly suited to our needs. It wasn't very warm so we didn't notice the lack of AC, which is something that is missing in most Irish accommodations, especially those that are older or in the country. There was some street noise but it was not intrusive during our stay. It's an old building right on the sidewalk, so there is no way to really buffer out the sounds of the city. For those with city noise or AC concerns, this might be an issue. We did not find it to be a problem. The room was very clean and the shower had wonderful water pressure, which is always a good thing at a hotel.We love the Georgian look of the dining room and had an excellent breakfast with a marvelous array of items. It's not over-the-top, but very complete and delicious. An attentive breakfast staff catered to every need.Buswell's has been a comfortable and incredibly convenient hotel and we plan to stay there again and again on future visits.",5,Another Great Stay at Buswell's; Superior Staff and Ideal Location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209076-r507163001-Buswells_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,withkidstravel

I had booked the hotel through hotelsireland.com with a voucher I had received. I had all the confirmation letters printed out and in order but when we went to check in the receptionist straight out refused to accept the confirmation booking and stated that they didn't accept the voucher, even though I had the paperwork. She stated that I didn't book through the voucher website and that they couldn't accept it as part of the payment. She then implied that the fault was on my part and that I had to sort it out with hotelsireland.com as she had other customers to deal with, which I found quite rude. To check into the room we had to give the full amount deposit on my Visa card - which took 7 days before I could access that money again. The whole ordeal took over 30 minutes. I rang hotelsireland and they were so helpful - I gave them my reference number and they checked it out saying everything was in order and that the booking was sent to the Hampton the day after I had booked. The lady then rang the Hampton herself and sorted the whole thing out in a matter of minutes. On checking out I paid the remaining balance - which I was expecting to do in the first place but was still €150 out of pocket for 7 days because of the deposit payment I had to pay unnecessarily. It immediately gave us a bad impression of the hotel and its service - when clearly the whole thing could have been sorted in a few minutes!

On arrival there was only one staff member on reception, at a weekend and as she was dealing with someone we were left waiting which wasn't a great first impression. The hotel seemed a bit tired to me interior wise, both the lobby and our room. The room was a nice size, the bed was comfy and I liked that they use eco friendly toiletries in the bathrooms. There was however a fingernail sitting on my bedside table which may seem fussy but it was one of the first things I saw on a dark wood surface so I don't know how the person cleaning the room missed it and it made me wonder what else has potentially been missed. I thought the bathroom had no toilet roll holder but then I realised it had, it was just broken and still there but not functioning. The bath panels were also mis matched. These may seem small details but they were not the standard I was expecting from the hotel and for the price. The check out was really speedy and they held bags for us until later that day.

The room was spacious and clean and the hotel bar was a good place for a final drink, so long as your day was ending but midnight (which was rare). There was also an excellent burger/fries food truck set up across the road after 10:00 each night for a late night meal.The only issue we had was, being there in July, we found the room very warm and the AC not very effective. Opening the windows did he trick but we were on the front of the hotel, with a busy street and team line below us.

If a makeover is not performed soon then I can see this hotel losing out on even more business, having said that the buffet breakfast was Ok, the items were crammed down to the one end of the restaurant, where there was not enough room to be able to cook your toast etc whist other people wanted to grab some butter, jam and other breakfast items. The cooked breakfast I had on my last day was oright but I have had a lot better, they seemed to want to present it in a fancy way rather than actually giving you a decent hearty breakfast.

We used to walk in during the day and catch the tram home from Grafton street at night for €1.60pp. 5 minutes later we were back at the hotel!!! Perfect and means it's just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre. Loved Dublin as a city. Don't expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful, welcoming people. Eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from. Transport options from the airport were superb. We chose the Airlink and it dropped us off about a 10 minute walk away. The Guinness factory is obviously on most people's list but the Jameson Experience is also well worth a visit. Even if you don't do the tour, the bar is superb and has a great atmosphere.

We found the hotel to be in a great location and was beautifully appointed. We had spent a lot of money on a double room since we needed two beds for the kids and one for me and my wife. We had dinner and drinks in the restaurant by the lobby and listened to some great music and saw an example of Irish dancing. All seemed to be going well except around 7 PM the Dublin city road crew started erecting barriers right outside the hotel and within half an hour had started jackhammering at the street. At 10 o'clock the racket continued and we thought it must be finishing by 11. I called the front office and was told by someone that the front desk would call me back. They never did. I called back again around 1045 only to be told that someone was going to look into contacting the city to find out when the road crew would stop doing the work directly outside of the hotel. Keep in mind that our room was on the third floor facing the street and even with the windows closed it was too loud to sleep. No one called our room - again. At 12:15 I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening. The gentleman behind the desk could not tell me what was going on. He said he could not give me another room because it was completely booked. He said he would leave a note for the manager, who had gone home for the night, to speak with me in the morning about the noise. The hammering continued till around 2 AM. We were booked to be at a morning Dublin bike tour at 9:30. At 8:30 I went down to the front desk to check out. Granted, the whole family was pretty tired from the lack of sleep. I asked if there was any note attached to my file about speaking to the manager. Again the new person behind the desk, a nice woman this time, knew nothing about my complaint regarding the noise at night and had nothing to say except the manager would be in at 10.  So for anyone staying at the Arlington, you're going to get a great hotel and a great Irish experience so long as nothing unusual happens. As I've said in my note, I tried three times to communicate with the front desk. They told me enough to send me on my way but never dealt with the problem. Granted, the construction wasn't their idea, but nor was it mine. And at the end of the day I had paid for a room to sleep. They got their money but we didn't get quite what we wanted.",3,"Great hotel, indifferent customer service",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212565-r506578650-Arlington_Hotel_O_Connell_Bridge-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,rowhalle

We chose this hotel because of the location and it ended up being a great choice. If you want to be close to the action in Dublin, this location can't be beat.

From the airport, the hotel is easily accessible from any of the city centre buses (both the 747 Dublin Bus and 700 Air Coach stop on O'Connell street, just around the corner from the hotel, although the 747 stop is closer).One huge perk that we didn't even consider when booking is that this hotel has fantastic amenities of its own. The hotel bar and restaurant are lively, with live music in the evenings. It is also the location of the Celtic Nights dinner and show, which hotel guests can take in at a reduced rate.

Like those others, we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by Bono and the Edge. Kinda nerdy, but there it is. I wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but I can't. This is not a Holiday Inn, you're paying more for a better experience and in some ways The Clarence fell short.The hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist. It's an easy walk to all of temple bar, the book of kells and the fun stuff on O'Connell Street. Its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the Guinness Factory. Most public buses run on either O'Connell Street or Dame Street. Either one is a five minute walk away. The Temple Bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did I feel uncomfortable walking around, regardless of the hour. The staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system, printing out maps etc. If my review ended there, it would have five stars.The best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds. The bed was probably one of the best I've ever encountered in Europe. The front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing. They made me want to stay longer. This hotel could be so much more, sadly. Several of us met in The Study to have a drink and chat. Our server seemed to go out of her way to avoid dealing with us, and other tables. Finally several of us and others simply went to the bar themselves to be served because the girl working the room as not available. To be clear, she was not busy, she just was not interested. She would stand at the serving station and read her cell phone, pretending not to see you if you tried to catch her attendance.The rooms are very nice, they are clean and quite lovely. Not fancy, but unique none the less. Our TV never did work in the room, which wasn't much of a loss given that it only had three channels.

When we got to the hotel they charged us more for the room than what we had booked. £72 more which seemed quite a lot. Spoke to the manager and he blamed booking.com and said there was nothing they could do about it. He said it happens all the time. If this is happening all the time they really should have sorted this by now, or at least expect customers to be annoyed when they charge you a lot more for your room when you've booked a budget hotel. Could have paid the same money and stayed in temple bar. Hotel was 15 or so minute walk from temple bar so good location. Rooms quite despite other reviews. Our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as I told them the rooms were nice. Their room was horrible. Only just enough room for a small double bed. Disgusting. Again when they complained they were told tough there's no more rooms. I rant up from the uk and spoke to reception about booking another room for the dates they were staying and was told there was lots available etc and what would I like to book. Told them the situation and the tone of the conversation immediately changed. Back to the hotel being really busy and no rooms available after they had just told me the hotel was dead.

The hotel is in a great location in the Temple Bar area. It ends there. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was underwhelmed at the cleanliness and effort to update the hotel. For £350 per night, it was rundown. The bellman took me to my room and it appeared that the carpet hadn't been cleaned in years. The room was dingy and in need of a good updating. After returning to my room for dinner and drinks, there was a raging party going on down the hall. No big deal I thought, it will die down eventually. At 1:00 AM it was still going. I informed the front desk and they told me ""there was nothing that they could do"". Apparently, a group had reserved that part of the hotel for a party. I asked to change rooms and was told that since I'd already been checked into this room for 9 hours, it wasn't possible. I was offered a tiny discount on the room instead. I don't want a discount, I want a quiet night of sleep!! To be clear, the issue was not the street noise which is a modest hum given the hotel's proximity to the bars in the area. That would have been tolerable. The next morning when I checked out, I made mention of the issues. They gave me the Managers card and told me to email him. So, I did, and after four days, I received a snarky response from the manager telling me that it was well documented on the website that it's a noisy hotel??? In addition, he mentioned that I'd likely never be back anyway since I was from out of the country so there was nothing that he was willing to do. He also mentioned that I was the only complaint of that night which is a bold faced lie as when I was at the desk complaining about the noise, so was another guest. To make matters worse, I asked for the hotel to arrange a car for me. When I checked out, I inquired whether or not the car would accept a credit card. I was assured that it would. When I arrived at the airport, I was told ""cash only"". What a disappointment. Stay away from this run down, overpriced hotel that is managed by arrogant employees.",1,Stay Away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d187625-r508882551-The_Clarence-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Justin B

Why did I return? Because i had a good experience in June, because of the hotel's location and because of its value for dollar/euro. Having said that, the experience in late July was not as good. Why is that? Because the Hotel is a victim of it's neighborhood. There is a sports bar right next door. When folks leave there, invariably drunk, they are extraordinarily noisy. They are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood. Then there's the homeless in a churchyard across the street. They have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter. The police come, remove them and they're back within an hour. Then the trucks come to make deliveries around 3 AM with back up beepers and running engines. The tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning. The staff work extremely hard and they are terrific. Frankly, they don't deserve this constant barrage on their efforts. My room was an adequate size. It was spotless. The bathroom and shower were very good. Daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere. So, should you stay here. Yes. Just get a room in the back of the hotel.

From the outside, it's a beautiful hotel, and when we checked in, it was a beautiful lobby. I was really excited! And then we walked into the room. When we walked, there was an issue with the electricity within the room. We called to the front desk, who called several electricians into the room to fix the problem. The electricians came in and out of the room for an hour, and were able to fix the issue, but we lost an hour of our time, with no apology or compensation. The room was comfortable but a bit dated and really needed to be remodeled (the bathtub had wood on the sides???). Additionally, there was spots of blood on the shower curtain, and the clocks were set at the wrong time which made us an hour late for a tour.

It is also located about a block east of Trinity College and several blocks south of the River Liffey. It is also located next to the house were Oscar Wilde grew up (it is now some type of small college). The hotel is located about 9 miles from Dublin International Airport or approximately 25 minutes by taxi (longer if you are in rush hour).I stayed here for 2 nights in late May with my wife and youngest daughter and thought the hotel was nice and also thought it was in a great location near many major tourist attractions. We paid $240 a night for a triple room (one king size bed and a twin bed) which I thought was pretty reasonable. Breakfast was not included and was 15 Euros per day per person. I thought the lobby and bar area were nice looking and I also liked my hotel room (the carpet and furniture were updated). In addition the room was above average in size. The front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given time.My only complaint was the poor breakfast service. The main breakfast room was full so we had to go to the bar area where the guy working there was lazy and would not help us (I thought he was a dishwasher or cleaning person). We had to walk back into the other area and ask for help. Finally one of the employees brought us some coffee and asked our server why he was not helping us (and then he blamed it on is for not asking for help).Overall I enjoyed staying at the O'Callaghan Davenport Hotel and thought the hotel was nice and I really liked its central location.

The house is quaint, my room had a nice view and breakfast was delicious, but my experience was tainted by electrical issues. In a nutshell: plugging my laptop adapter in a power outlet at this house KILLED THE ADAPTER. Here’s how it happened: When I first arrived in my room, I noticed one of the lamps would not turn on. I notified the clerk at the desk that the lightbulb was burnt, but she said that this outlet did not work, adding that the electrician could not figure out why. Fine, I thought, I’ll use other outlets and lamps… I should have been more suspicious of the state of the electrical wiring, because as soon as I plugged in my laptop to charge it – in another outlet of course – the power went out in the room and my charger had a burnt smell! I notified the clerk again, and while she was very nice, she did not seem particularly surprised, and suggested I talk to Evelyn (Corcoran), the owner. Evelyn nicely told me that this “hardly ever happens”… indeed, she said THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE, but to other devices (!). I understand this is an old house (that’s part of its charm), but a faulty electrical system is not what I expected. Being in Dublin for work, I needed to be able to charge my laptop, so I went to a computer store. The employee said the “frying” of my adapter was likely due to a power surge. I had to buy a new adapter there, then one back home: I am Canadian, and the computer store in Dublin (of course) did not have adapters with North American plugs. This cost me 53€ (about 80CDN$) for the adapter bought in Dublin, plus about 31€ (48CDN$) for the one bought at home, for a total of about 84€. Not a fortune, not as bad as if I had found bedbugs in my room of course, but still frustrating!Evelyn has not offered (or accepted) to cover these expenses, she says this is likely due to a faulty charger, despite the fact that my laptop is of a renowned brand, the charger is 100-240V and I used it many times in Europe (using appropriate outlet adapters of course), in the UK, France, Spain, Greece, Norway and elsewhere in Dublin, for instance at University College Dublin where was the academic conference I was attending. I travel a lot for work and pleasure and this had never happened to me. I must say, it somewhat ruined what could have been a very pleasant stay at the Waterloo House, and I feel that other travelers should be aware of this risk, and the potential danger that comes with staying in a house with electrical issues, before booking . Evelyn wrote me that she “could not run a business with an electrical fault as it would be very dangerous”… I agree about the danger part.

It still has its great location - step out the doors and your in the midst of everything on Fleet Street - but has lost quite a lot of its coolness. Apparently the owners are cashing in, and not re-investing in the hotel. The staff is nice, but at least two in the reception where claiming ""I am very new, so I don't know"", so checking in/out was a long and cumbersome and quite disorganized exercise. Our room was not ready until 4pm (our room was not ready yet, but then we got another room instead), which was also a let down. The room (we stayed in a junior suite facing Fleet St) was spacious, but worn down. Big cracks around ceiling lights, one light in the bathroom was broken and one bedside lamp did dot work (and couldn't be fixed by the staff). The bed was tired and super-soft (not to my liking), and the chair in the room was covered with a sheet to cover up the wear&tear. Only one TV, located close to the sofa, made it impossible to watch TV in bed (possible to live without of course) but good storage/wardrobe and good with a empty fridge (given that Tesco is just opposite the hotel). As mentioned, the location is VERY central for those who want to party. Impressive sound proofing though meant that if you closed the windows it got very quiet. However, then it gets very warm, and there was no AC - just a fan outside the sleeping area. The breakfast was non-impressive, with seating at large, shared 6-8pax tables. So, all-in-all, the location is great for partying, the hotel is from my perspective loosing its cool and is in a pretty worn-down state.",3,"Good for party weekend, but not a great hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209078-r507299532-The_Morgan-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Krister Z

The location of this hotel is excellent for those wishing the fun atmosphere of the Temple Bar nightlife/area with convenient walking distance and to bus routes to Dublin attractions.We were so tired from our daily excursions, that the nightlife noise did not bother us too much. And the hotel provided earplugs, which were included near the bathroom amenities. Our room was on the second floor, facing the street, so with windows opened it was a bit noisy. We shut the windows the next night and put on the AC - and that solved the noise problem. We booked this hotel through TripAdvisor which was easy and allowed us to get a better rate. We opted for breakfast to be included - which offered a great selection of fruit, pastries, eggs, sausage, bacon, and typical Irish breakfast fare. Breakfast wait staff were great and attentive. In fact, all staff members were helpful and friendly. Shout outs to Sonia, who directed us to a local vendor who helped with our computer issues and to David, our personable server at breakfast.

European and American power sockets were a nice touch. The room was also very quiet. Breakfast was fresh, much of it was home-made, and it was beautifully served in one of the castle's characterful rooms. Travelling to and from the city did take some time: around 10 min walk to bus/DART, and around 10 min. transport time to Connolly station, leaving every 10 minutes or so. This was not a problem for us, who did not mind walking and had bought LEAP transportation cards. As one tour guide said, ""there is no place in Dublin that's not noisy"", and Clontarf was our quiet oasis after intense city strolls.

A highlight was the delightful and delicious breakfast in the sunny breakfast room - traditional Eggs Benedict for me and with smoked salmon for my daughter plus a buffet of breads, muffins, fruit, juice, cereals, coffee and tea. We also enjoyed relaxing in the front parlor that was stocked with single serve coffee & tea with china cups & saucers and mini cake bites. There was ample free parking which was important to us as we had picked up our rental car upon arrival at Dublin's airport.

Cecelia immediately called 3 different medical providers and arranged an appointment and transportation to the facility. On that first evening we had an unfortunate accident involving the toilet in our room (our fault). The ever kind and cheerful Cecelia evaluated the situation and arranged an alternate room for the night.

Well, this amazing staff jumped right on it & had us in a room in no time. They were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way. It went uphill from there - they recognized us when we were in the lobby & asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable. We were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our 6 night stay. We booked the room through Virtuoso (we use them or AmEx's platinum program which lists a room upgrade, if available, upon check in). The hotel didn't have the upgrade the first night but called a day later & moved us into a junior suite. Really lovely!

The bed was so high up and on wheels so moved everywhere. The bathroom wasn't great, the shower felt like a pressure washer, it wasn't very nice at all, it felt like you were being pounded, not very relaxing. Looking at the bath it had obviously been painted and where the pressure of the shower blasted down on it the paint had fallen away. We had a full Irish breakfast and it was nice, no complaints. The staff were very friendly. The only complaint I would have is that every time we left the hotel we would be asked whether we were out for the day. We also had to leave our key at reception when we left the hotel and were told that if we came back to the hotel after 1am we would have to let them know before as there would be no one to let us in so we would need a separate key. We were in our room late afternoon and we heard a knock and a ruffle at the door. My partner opened the door and the owner was there saying he wanted to have a look at our bathroom. Very odd.

It is on a beautiful residential street and fits right in with its impressive brick exterior. But it's what inside that makes this a great place to stay when visiting Ireland's capital city.Our visit was just for two nights. Upon arrival, we parked our car in the parking area at the front of the lodge and didn't use it again until it was time to go to the airport (which, by the way, is only about 20 minutes away via an easy, direct route). We were greeted by a lovely young employee who took the time to show us maps that gave us an idea of where we were and how we could easily get into central Dublin by using public transportation. She was great - cogent and knowledgeable.Getting to our room (no. 28) required a hike up a few flights of stairs. It was large and quite comfortable. It featured a king-sized bed that was truly enormous. At night, we communicated by semaphore! Windows looked out on the backyard, and beyond that, you could hear bat striking ball and shouts coming from the Pembroke Cricket Club ground and the occasional rumble of a DART train heading to or from downtown. The bathroom was adequate with an average sized, old-style tub. The shower was great. Breakfasts at Aberdeen Lodge were truly terrific. Everything was fresh, including fresh-squeezed orange juice. A wide variety of fruits and cereals were offered, along with the option for variations on the traditional Irish breakfast. A great way to start the day.I mentioned DART above. It's about a 7 minute walk to the Sydney Parade Station. From there, you can take an elevated train into central Dublin. We used the large Pearse Station as our jumping off point, as it was convenient to Trinity College, the National Museum and National Gallery, and Grafton Street. I'd say the average ride time is about 8-10 minutes and passes some interesting sights including the massive Aviva Stadium, a site for football and rugby matches which looks like it just landed after its arrival from Mars.The welcoming atmosphere at Aberdeen Lodge is a large part of the attraction. Ann and Pat Keane showed courtesy and offered services throughout our stay. I asked to print up boarding passes for our flight home and they immediately gave me access to their computer and printer. Ann also made sure that our trip to the airport went smoothly, going over the best route with me. Their hospitality has rubbed off on all of their staff members, each of whom couldn't have been nicer.Aberdeen Lodge might be a bit dated, as some other reviewers have said.

The room was 303 euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had NO WINDOWS. It had a roof light and 2 very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box. The explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room. So the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people don't need a view. We were disturbed after 10pm by housekeeping offering a 'turn down service'. We did take this up with Mr Zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time 'if available'. If not we'll have to accept the windowless box again I guess.

The hotel provides the best pictures of room but in the reality room we lived 105 was not small, dark and on the ground floor with some access to the public back yard and parking, so it was not even possible to open a window because people form other rooms could access the room 105. All the halls and corridors are very tiny, if you travel with a large luggage it is very inconvenient to move around the hotel. Also no place for the luggage in the room, we had to use an extra bed for it. The hotel manager was rude to us, screaming and shouting, sold the best room and put the people who arrived late to the rooms on the ground floor, small and dark which did not correspond to the rooms on the pictures.. Also they do not want to solve the issue until we had to contact the booking.com website, so upon check-out the issue wasn't solved.

We had a couple of issues, and they were pleasant the whole time. Room was nice enough, and had air conditioning. We had a room with both a tub and a sauna, and I used both and they both were very relaxing. Also, I accidentally left a bunch of undergarmets in the drawer of the room. I emailed the day we left, and they held them for me for a week so I could pick them up before I left! Location was also lovely - just a short walk to town that made it so we could be away from the hubbub but still be able to access it. Breakfast was also lovely, but this is the only place I stayed during my week in Ireland that didn't have breakfast included in the room price. Cons: Couple of minor problems that added together lost it a star. I used the jetted tub on the first night, and it wouldn't drain. The front desk said it would sometimes get jammed, but they couldn't fix it until the morning. I also couldn't figure out how to get the coffee maker to work. Also, when I picked up my things I left, they had added a bunch of stuff to the bag (magazines, a magnet, etc.) that someone else had left behind - I thought the magazines came with the room, but apparently, it just wasn't cleaned well before we moved in. Finally, the outer walls were pretty thin and you could hear people outside, but as long as we had the AC run at night, it wasn't a problem.Overall, it was a nice place to stay, but they have a little room to make it just a bit better.

Really nice lobby, friendly reception staff. But no doorman. As a Hilton Gold member, I was upgraded to a room on the higher floors. The room was a reasonable size, immaculate and tastefully decorated with a modern/contemporary feel. The property next door is undergoing building works but didn't hear any noise during my two-night stay. The bar is also nicely decorated, and has a good selection of whisky/whiskey. Service was variable (initially attentive, but had to approach the bar to reorder on both occasions even though it wasn't busy), and staff lacked knowledge on the menu. Having requested a Swedish whisky (which I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu) the staff member had to go and check with another; on them not being able to locate it she then pulled an Arran (a Scottish island whisky) off the back bar and suggested it. Hardly the same. The hotel has a couple of restaurants - Alfie's and Coberg. The first has pub food including a number of veggie options. The second (which is also where breakfast is served) has very limited veggie options (pasta and salad, with the vast majority of menu being meat and fish). I didn't dine in either given so many options nearby in town. Breakfast was a disappointment. No orientation was provided with regards to what was a la carte (such as ""toast"") vs self service. On being seated (and it not being particularly busy) it took 10 minutes from ordering to get a cup of tea. Having stayed at many hotels in the Hilton Group, I was looking forward to their buffet breakfast. They had a selection of Continental and Full Irish, however lacking many of the usual spread of cooked items such as potato scones, baked beans, etc. The only eggs available on the buffet were poached, and very rubbery (I've had better from McDonalds). Service more resembled a cafe than a 5 star hotel in terms of quality and attentiveness, at one point with a staff member reaching over the table to take my plate. Whilst it's clear the hotel has recently undergone an extensive refurbishment they have bizarrely cut corners on some paint/varnish. A few examples:- Some doors and fixtures are worn / in need of painting. - The flooring in the main restaurant is in need of varnishing, with significant score marks at the smaller tables on wooden floor near the window. A few other issues with service, which whilst each relatively minor expect more from a premium hotel:- No orientation on hotel facilities (other than where breakfast was served) was provided. - On returning from a day's sightseeing at 5pm, the minibar hadn't been replenished. On requesting it to be, 7.5 month out of date potato chips were provided. On politely highlighting this at check out - having opened one and taken a bite before checking the date - the staff member didn't even acknowledge it, let alone apologise. - If you want to reach a department via phone - good luck! During the stay, the few times I tried the correct department it rang out continuously on multiple tries. You need to call reception to get an answer. - The room didn't contain a bottle opener so requested one. A barman arrived to open the bottle but not provide one, so highlighting I was intending on having a couple promised they'd return with one. Over half an hour later they had not, but on calling again one was quickly provided. - The room didn't have an information booklet on the hotel and it's facilities. - Check out was a slow and laborious affair... providing details of additional minibar consumption I was then presented with a bill without them, nor any credit applied for the booking via Amex. In all, lots of small issues that - considering the rack rate - is disappointing. I'll stay somewhere else next time I'm in Dublin.",2,At over €300 a night for a standard room it doesn't hit the mark.

Even though we booked one of the lowest category rooms (It think it was called a ""small queen"") because unfortunately that was all that was available, the room was a nice size, pristine in terms of cleanliness and maintenance and nicely updated, and it had all the little touches one might expect in a 5 star European hotel (twice daily service with turn down, slippers beside bed, bottled water, etc., etc.). We got back to the hotel late after seeing U2 at Croke Park and we were starving... they seated us and served us some great pub food in the same beautiful restaurant area they have high tea facing St Stephen's Green (great fish and chips, club sandwich, Guinness, etc.), and they were still seating people at 2 am! I got the impression that maybe they stayed open later due to the concert, but either way it was much appreciated as it was almost impossible to get food anywhere else at that hour! The hotel's location is wonderful. I was recognized as a Gold level Marriott Rewards member and they provided a complimentary full daily buffet breakfast and two free drinks from the bar in recognition, which is much better than I have experienced in other locations, especially given this is a historic landmark hotel.

Bags and car are taken care of with ease, allowing you to seamlessly check in. My wife and I arrived with a hire car, having driven around Ireland that week and it needed to be back with Avis a couple of hours after our arrival. Rather than parking the car for us and charging a parking fee, the doorman simply offered to leave the car out front for me to pick up later. No dramas and made my life easier. Check-in was easy and they recognised and arranged all of the appropriate Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts Group extras. We were upgraded to a larger room on a higher floor which was great. Beds are super comfortable and room amenities are excellent.Despite staying at the Shelbourne a number of times, I had never eaten in the Saddle Room restaurant. The experience was fantastic and I would highly recommend (separate review). The Number 27 Bar has become exceptionally busy all day long and so I would recommend getting in there early to avoid disappointment. However, my favourite has to be the Horseshoe Bar, which is a buzzing secluded bar serving up great beers and cocktails.The Lord Mayor's Lounge is always a highlight and my wife and I had a lovely afternoon tea before we had to head off to the airport. Booking for tea is absolutely essential and can be done online. Request one of the two tables with the wing back chairs, as they are more comfortable and offer a great view of the lounge.The level of luxury and service is top-notch and I can't think of anywhere else I would like to stay in Dublin.",5,Still The Best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d187627-r507733357-The_Shelbourne_Dublin_A_Renaissance_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Simon P

The public rooms are beautiful and elegant. The food and service were excellent at the restaurants. The hotel staff was always gracious and welcoming. My spacious 6th floor room had high windows that looked out over St. Stephen’s Green and beyond. The bed was extremely comfortable. The beautiful marble bathroom with separate tub, shower and commode, was large and conveniently fitted with lots of shelving. The room had plenty of lighting, a good work desk and plush, comfortable reading chairs. Soundproofing was excellent and I never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway. In-room WIFI was fast and reliable. There is nightly turn-down service. The hotel has a great location two blocks from the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery of Ireland and is surrounded by tons of restaurants and shops.I was disappointed when I had to leave the Shelbourne to join a tour group at another excellent, five-star Dublin hotel, the Westbury, a 20th century property that does not have the same level of elegance, warmth or beauty. The combination of history, comfort and grace makes the Shelbourne an extraordinary place. They clearly value their guests and make them feel special.

Unlike many of the reviews mentioned earlier this is specific to the hotel for staying guests and not its F&B business.The hotels generally frequented by wife and I are the Raffles, the Ritz, Langham, Oberoi, Peninsula, so this is relevant to customers who are accustomed to similar levels of quality and service which I also understand the peer group that the Shelbourne projects itself.I would also confirm this as an original review being posted post our stay and not crowd sourced.The Good: Location, without doubt and a grand history: the Irish constitution indeed drafted at the Shelbourne and there is small one room museum to its history next to the reception area. Cannot recommend enough the excellent afternoon tea (though with hourly seating and in high demand). Staff on the ground floor are quite polite and helpful. The Demerits (and there are a few):1. Room sizes are really small. The Queen Rooms are tiny. There is basically one to 2 feet of space to move around the bed which barely could fit my frame (at 6 feet). Bathrooms are the size of an aircraft toilet with a cubicle attached. Window on 5th floor looks into the adjoining’s room window (90 degree angle) and while lying down our bed we could see the bed in the other room. In effect, ensuring there is no privacy for us or frankly for the other chaps in the other room. We had made the booking through booking.com and without doubt the pictures of the queen room and bathroom are not at all representative. On a more detailed search on booking.com, the given size is 195 sq ft for the queen room and 250 sq ft for the deluxe rooms (which is why also we did not go for an upgrade) which are certainly on the other lower end for hotel rooms sizes especially for 5 stars. Indeed, the rooms were so small that we never even ended up calling for room service as we were not even sure where one would be able to comfortably enjoy a meal in the room. 2. Be prepared for a delayed check in (and hourly charges for a late check out). Arriving from India, on check in we were asked to wait for an hour as room were not ready and housekeeping was on the job. After the one hour (and I must say delightful lunch at the Saddle), we were told that the time estimate was wrong. Would have appreciated at least if we were told so earlier or informed directly so we could spend more time at the Saddle restaurant. Eventually, it was hours later that we received our room and after multiple follow ups as were told housekeeping was moving slowly that day. Conversely, would add that while checking out, since we had late night flight to India we asked for a late checkout. We were told that the hotel was fully booked but yet somehow correspondingly offered one hour complimentary stay with every additional hour charged at a particular rate including till when we were scheduled to leave the hotel. To say the least, especially I never recall a 5 star asking for an hourly charge, it did make me think.3. Internet (alert all business travelers and techies). The hotel has outsourced its internet service to a Virgin hotspot. Even beyond the security issues, the speed barely touched (speedtest) 120 kpbs. Coming from India this was a shock as there is national 4G service. Worse, the connections kept dropping. Eventually, could only do with the wifi dongle purchased at Vodafone, Graftston street a few minutes walk way even to get through work mails.4. Small, non functioning TV. There is a small TV around 21 inch in the room. Kept flickering throughout stay and was never fixed even till the end of our stay. In effect, we never used the TV during our stay.5. Housekeeping. There is definitely a lack of attention to detail. Turndown service was missed on same days. Had to give constant reminders for changing the bathrobes. Tea bags not replenished continuously. Even sheets were not changed on daily basis by default until specifically we had to insist. In this case, no option even given – generally hotels do offer an environment friendly option to leave a message if you do not wish to have the sheets changed, in this case this was not done and it was left to us discover the same.6. Concierge is too busy. Was unable to help us either with theater bookings (we went to the box office to purchase them directly). With restaurants: we made the bookings for fine dining ourselves eventually (e.g at Dax). And to give a specific experience of an outbound trip: despite multiple messages to “Delighted to Serve” (auto connected when no one lifted the phone at the concierge) to make a private tour (Mercedes) booking eventually had to go the concierge desk after two hours of waiting as apparently they were in meetings as told over the phone. As it happens, when I arrived at the desk, the concierge mentioned he hand no message as such. Regretfully, had to point out the large handwritten note to call my room no which was next to the keyboard. Enough said. The only good point was that at the time of check out they did get an extra hour of charge knocked off which was billed extra to us from the afore mentioned tour.7. Overbooked Spa. Despite boasting Dublin’s “largest spa”, there was no availability for a massage beyond 25 mins for the next 48 hours (and this on weekdays) and that too only in a particular afternoon timeslot. We checked on two different days in fact. The hotel aggressively markets its spa to non-guests with a special entrance and offerings. We had the feeling that in general as consequence availability is limited to guests. In fact it we were specifically asked if we had booked a massage in advance to our arrival in Dublin and if had an email to that effect: obviously not.8. Focus on Customer Delight. In fact, for example when we shared that turn down service was missed, the first response are you sure there was not a do not disturb sign (they are welcome to check CCTV logs as far as I am concerned). That’s tells you everything about how the service approach is geared (beyond the excellent but packed restaurants) to deal with customers. Indeed, I uploaded the same comments to Marriott as well. Till date only Marriott UK has (very politely) responded. No response from the hotel side as of date of this posting. In retrospect, I would recommend to consider a hotel in the near by area which there are quite a few and try the F&B service especially the afternoon tea as an outside guest.",2,A Shell of its Former Self (truly a 3 star experience),https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d187627-r509730067-The_Shelbourne_Dublin_A_Renaissance_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,nvb1001

A few weeks ago we had our chance to do it. We had a Queen size room for part of the stay and then we were in a Heritage room for the other part of the stay. I want to preface this review by saying that we were paying over $800 a night for a small room which is the most that we have ever paid for a hotel. It's extremely expensive so that is part of why we had very high expectations.What we liked about the hotel is that the location is wonderful and very convenient for sight seeing. The hotel has a wonderful history and a small museum that you can go in. We liked the fact that they have a nice fitness room with good options for working out. The onsite restaurant is very good. They have a fun bar area to have a pre-dinner cocktail.We checked in early coming from an overnight flight but they didn't have our room ready. The person who checked us in assured us that we might be able to check into the higher quality room with our status so that we would not have to re-pack during our stay and change rooms. We left for the day after taking a shower at the spa facilities and then came back later. When we came back they said that there was only the lower grade room available and it was a very busy weekend so the person should not have said that there ware really any possibility. It was frustrating. The queen rooms are very small. I believe that others have talked about them. They are small and there are no amenities. No nespresso machine, just a hot pot. No bath tub, just a shower, etc. They eventually were to move us to a deluxe but they upgraded us to a heritage room. I believe that it was a much nicer room and they had nice amenities. It had a beautiful large bathroom and nespresso machine, etc. However, they gave us the room over the bar. I believe that it is #152. First we had to listed to horrible techno music until later hours, they did turn it down when I called them but also, in the early hours of the morning they move all of the furniture probably to clean the floor. So we would get woken up with the scratching of furniture being dragged across the floor. It's also on the street so there is a lot of road noise. We have stayed at the Conrad and other hotels in Dublin. It's fun to stay at the Shelbourne but I think personally at those rates it's worth one night for the experience and then I would move to another hotel on St. Stephen's Green. We do highly recommend their restaurant for dinner. We had breakfast included which they never change so again, one night and breakfast the next morning would cover the experience. Who wants to pay $800 a night to hear trucks, techno music and some furniture being dragged around!?",3,Their motto should be one night wonder!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d187627-r510298397-The_Shelbourne_Dublin_A_Renaissance_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,ramaleew

It is the little things that make it luxurious like the bottled sparkling and still water, the very soft slippers and the incredibly soft bath robes and fine linens. The rooms was very spacious and well appointed. My only gripe is that accommodation services could pay a little more attention to things like wiping off fingerprints on the ceiling in the bathroom into the maintenance access, and ensuring the toiletries are actually inside the cardboard packets (mine were not). Easy to miss but still it is the small things that can taint a reputation. We had dinner in the restaurant which was nice and the service was great. Breakfast was ok, but to be fair I expected a little more class, it was your average breakfast foods and the bacon was tough. But the service was good and the chefs friendly.

A manager came over and quickly tried to make things right and apologized for the lack of internal coordination. We eventually got two rooms but not without effort. My guess is like stated before with an over 90% occupancy they do not have to work hard to get people to come and it is clear. No issues with the rooms or breakfast all were very good.

The only window in the room was like an attic window and part of the room was slanted because of the roof. I always worried that my husband would hit the roof because he is six foot two so I slept on the side of the bed close to that wall. We paid quite a bit on the room and in fact it is the most expensive accommodation we had during our three week drive around of Ireland. I understand it might due to its good location but I expect a better room and better services especially housekeeping. We were out and about really early the second day but by the time we got back at 3.30pm, our room was still not made up. We had to leave again to Allow for the room to be made up and told the reception that our room was not made up. Instead of apologising, the reception staff told us it was because they wouldn't want to ""kick"" guests out of their room early on Sundays (it was 3.30pm when we returned!) I rather she told the truth something like we don't have enough staff on Sundays then I would understand. Anyway, we didn't make a fuss and just went out again. But what greatly annoyed me was the next day when I took a shower, I found that the shampoo, conditioner and body wash were either empty or nearly empty! They were all small tubes and they were placed neatly standing up like new so I wasn't aware that they haven't been replaced! Otherwise I would have rung housekeeping and asked for new ones BEFORE I went into the shower! I left the used one without putting back their lids on the floor to indicate they needed to be replaced the previous day and how the housekeeping staff think a little tube can last two days for two people is beyond me. It's not a big thing but it's these little things that makes a difference, particularly the hotel claims to be five star.

At the price of over 300 per night this is what we got:- drunk obnoxious neighbours who were falling in and out of their room slamming the doors all day and all night - hotel staff that offered to move us (even though we were sleeping rather than moving the drink neighbours). We checked another room which was even worse than the room we had before. It was facing inside the hotel in the bar area so windows could not be opened. So hotel's idea of helping is downgrading the room - elevator that smelt like two days old alcohol and made us want to throw up going into it - after getting no sleep, I had to get used at 7am for work So if you are looking for somewhere nice to stay that is professionally ran and has knowledge of hospitality, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!",1,Never again will stay at this hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212680-r502633375-The_Westin_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Elliana1974

I knew the hotel was near capacity so I was prepared to get a double standard room: however, we were upgraded to a double superior room and they included a blow-up mattress for our 5 year old at no additional charge. The room was a nice size and loved the marble bathroom with separate deep soaking tub and shower (although I wish there was a larger shelf in the shower). I love old world elegance and this hotel has it in spades. Our room faced Westmoreland Street but barely heard any street noise being that we were on the top floor. This hotel is central to everything - we walked everywhere from the waterfront, to Temple Bar to Grafton Street. We had the buffet breakfast every morning which wasn't too bad, but there is a Starbucks across the street and a couple of Rolling Donuts within walking distance. Definitely have a drink at the bar downstairs - it's gorgeous and the cocktails are amazing.There is a lot of construction in front of the hotel due to the expansion of the Light Rail but it's happening across the city, so there's no getting away from it and the noise really was non-existent.

I booked a room for one night using air miles; the description on the aeroplan website promised spacious rooms decorated in characteristic Irish decor. I arrived at 10:30 and had to wait for a room; I was promised one in an hour or 90 minutes but no one called and three hours later I returned. At that time I was given a tiny room that faced a busy street and a building covered in pipes. I complained, and was shown another room that had a view of Trinity College (much better), but also was tiny. The decor was more LA designer than Irish, with an upholstered black faux leather headboard with metal studs. Not what I was expecting. The curtains were thin and did not entirely cover the sides of the windows, which meant that the room was not dark. The street noise was not bad, but there was sound transfer from other guest rooms. I did not sleep well in this hotel compared with the other hotel I stayed at on arrival.The staff were friendly enough, but when I arrived no one was at the door, and I had to pull my luggage up a ramp myself. I noticed that the main entrance was often unattended, and when I returned to my room in the evening four young men followed me into the elevator. When I asked them what floor they were going to they just laughed. None of them had room keys and I think they were just having fun taking a ride in the elevator. I often travel alone for business in Asia and North America; this is the first time I have had an experience like this. The Westin Dublin needs to be more responsible in protecting its guests from uncomfortable situations like this. I read reviews and decided against eating at the Westin.

A/C was the main draw for our group since this was our last night in Dublin and we had seen the more trendy areas. The Spencer is located in the business district which is more updated, clean and modern. The down side is the lack of a lot of pubs but there are a few nearby. It is about a mile from the Temple Bar Area and very close to the Epic Heritage Tour. We stayed in room 642 which had two twins in one large room and a queen in another room. It was very modern looking with floor to ceiling windows. The rooms were very spacious with a large bathroom that could be accessed from the master or the hallway that lead to the other twin room. This had an apartment feeling with a front door that led to our rooms. The air conditioner was heavenly and the rooms were quiet. The bar downstairs looked nice but we didn't stay for drinks.

The parking garage is a bit difficult to spot (€18 per day) -- four turns onto a windy street behind the hotel... The front desk gave us a map to the hotel parking which said to look out for ""Spencer Hotel Parking"", but I passed the garage twice because the sign actually says ""Clarion Quay Car Park"" in big letters with ""Spencer Hotel Parking"" in tiny letters underneath. The hotel map made no mention of that fact. When I was leaving after 3 nights in the hotel, I went to collect my car and the ticket wouldn't work... I had to back up; re-park the car; walk out to the hotel again, and return to the front desk. The manager (at least he claimed he was), Elton, told me my ticket wasn't validated. When we registered our car with the front desk, no one told us we'd have to validate it. When I informed Elton of this, he said, quite rudely, ""Didn't you see the little sign? There's a little sign."" I got my ticket validated and went back down to the garage, looking for the sign. There was no sign. Peeved at his rude attitude, I went back to Elton and told him there was no sign. I took photos all over the garage to show him. I got no apology. Elton just gave me more rudeness, and insisted there was a ""big sign."" It was a lesson in poor/rude customer service. Spencer Hotel should: 1) tell customers looking for the car park to look for the sign reading ""Clarion Quay Car Park"", or make the Spencer Hotel lettering larger.2) tell customers they need to get their tickets validated AND put up signs at entry/exit points and in the parking bays letting customers know they'll need their tickets validated in order to exit.",3,manager rude; parking inconvenient,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d206333-r504800239-The_Spencer_Hotel_Dublin_IFSC-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,KidsOnTheRoad

We took advantage of that and then went to breakfast at their pantry.We were advised breakfast would be 15 euro each, which felt a bit high but since there weren't many other dining options nearby and we were tired, we went for it. The breakfast was a very nice buffet. When we went to pay and the manager asked for our room number, he actually gave us the breakfast since we weren't able to check in yet. This was a nice gesture that we really appreciated!The room itself (304) was much larger than expected and had a nice view of the River Liffey. We had a king bed that was very firm and comfortable. We were a little concerned that the room was directly across from the elevators and adjacent to a vending machine, but it was quiet both nights despite the hotel being full (we were there on a Thursday and Friday night). The only thing that didn't hit the same standard was the hotel bar. There is a comfortable sitting area, but the two times we visited we found the service to be inconsistent, slow and unfocused. We had a sharing platter of various Asian fusion items, but it was fairly mediocre. The overall location was convenient if you don't mind a little walking.

Even though I was given instructions to park in this # place and the garage was 1/3 full, someone decide to call the parking authority vs, call the hotel. Because I had to catch a plane, I had the hotel deal with Hertz. The clamp / boot caused damaged to the wheel well. 3000 euros later, I find out my credit card, does not cover Ireland collision. Of course the hotel claims no responsibility and they gave me a hard time when I was trying to resolve. Lesson learned. Parking at Ireland hotels is a challenge.

I was surprised on how patient they were and eager to show us the options. For 60 euros more we were upgraded to the apartment size or presidential suit and it was amazing!!!

It was first time for two of us and 18 yrs prior for other friend. Since we only had 3 full days of touring, we need a hotel with the best location - This hotel hit the mark for us. First off, the staff were awesome! Hazel and Marko were so helpful at the front desk over the days with all our tourist questions. The breakfast buffet was perfect and consistent every day, and we were greeted with smiles.Room - we had a Business Class with 2 twins and a rollaway and we had plenty of room to maneuver. Closet was fine. Plenty of outlets for adapters for phones and other electronics. Look under bedside tables! Hair dryer provided.Bathroom - 10 out of 10 for shower pressure/hot water. Rain shower plus handheld. Deep soaking tub with hand shower (you will use after pounding the streets all day).Decor is modern comfortable, in deep warm tones. Hallways are wide and beautifully lit, again with deep warm wood tones. Love the shoe shine station at the elevator on each floor. These items are all important, but the best reason to stay at Raddison Blu Royal is the location on Golden Lane. Walking distance to everything. St. Patricks, Guinness, Grafton, Temple Bar, Trinity College ...etc. We were hoping to stay in Temple Bar (it looks so darn cute, and it is). Thank goodness we didn't. Way too crazy at night to stay there in our opinion. Enjoyed the fun and we were happy to walk the 4-5 blocks to our quiet oasis to sleep and get up and do it again. Taxis have easy in and out right in front of lobby. We can't wait to return with our husbands or not, ha! Dublin is a wonderful town for women travelers, Dubliners are warm, friendly and go out of their way to help you. Love that!!!! BTW - Taxi drivers are the best - We were laughing all the away to the airport with Brian T. Hysterical!

You could explore the entire city on foot. There are tramway works going on in front of the hotel, which did not bother us at all. However, please make sure you pick the room carefully: more expensive rooms overlooking the park maybe exposed to noise. We were perfectly happy with our quiet, courtyard looking room (Superior Room). The room layout is modern and smartly done, I would have just preferred some extra storage space (a lot of space is taken by safe/mini bar), perhaps a little refurbishment one day would make it more practical.But what makes the big difference in this hotel is the service and kindness of the team, from check-in until check-out. Concierge service was very efficient and proactive, porters tried to anticipate any needs, breakfast service was fast and impeccable (breakfast as a whole I would say) and prompt check in and check out. People made you feel at home and went out of the way to give you advice, approach you in your own language, etc.The only negative I would have to warn against is the pricing policy. Their website advertises lower rates when booking in advance but in fact we should have waited and booked last minute. Prices in fact go down and by quite a lot. Since we stayed in June, I had time to do check this for other dates and it was the same thing... Well, when you get this through brokers you know it is part of the game, but when I it is the hotel itself... I wish they would have a transparent pricing policy.

However, I would have no issue staying here multiple days if the occasion presented itself.The staff at the front desk were very welcoming, unpretentious, and did their absolute best to check me in to my room well before the standard 3:00pm time (my flight arrived a 7:00am). The breakfast staff were equally friendly and efficient.Breakfast offerings ranged from basic (cereal, fruit, juice, tea, etc. available as self-serve) to continental (which includes cooked to order porridge accompanied by slices of toast and a nicely prepared plate of cheese and ham) to full Irish breakfasts (again prepared to order and cost a little more). Note: all the breakfasts are separate from the room rate unless otherwise stated.If there is one slight issue with the breakfast hour, it would be the dining space - limited seating and a little cramped. I recommend you get down there earlier rather than later.With regards to the room, it was very clean and cozy, had a comfortable bed, an infrared sauna (which I didn't try), tea kettle, complimentary tea, hairdryer, and iron with ironing board. Wi-Fi is available in all areas of the hotel on an open network, free of charge.With respect to location, the Roxford is on a quiet but very well connected street in an affluent area of the city. The Aircoach from Dublin Airport stops just a 2 min. walk away from the hotel's main entrance (at the Schoolhouse Hotel) and there is a stop for other public transportation right out the door. I had no problem getting around the city on foot and most major sites are within reasonable walking distance from the hotel. Right away (across from where the Aircoach stop is located) you have the Grand Canal Walkway (which is very picturesque and divides the city into North & South). Turn left onto the walkway and follow it along to reach Leeson Street. Turn right on Leeson (north) and you'll end up at St. Stephen's Green (25 min.). Cross through the park and you'll get to Grafton Street (30 min). If you head North on Northumberland St (head right when you come out of the hotel) which becomes Mount Street, you'll hit the Tourist Office (Hop-off, Hop-on Bus), Trinity College, Temple Bar, the Liffey and Ha'penny Bridge in roughly 30-35 min.When considering this hotel, I suggest you first look at their site for deals and book directly from there rather than a 3rd party.

Even with the offer it was still pricier than a lot of other hotels that we looked at (even with no breakfast included) but the fact that Roxford Lodge offered 'luxury and style' sealed the deal for us. We were distinctly underwhelmed. The room was pretty much the size of the bed. There was barely any cupboard space or room even for us to place both our weekend cases on the floor side by side. I appreciate that the hotel is described as 'boutique' but where was the luxury exactly? I ended up asking if there was a larger room available as this really was not what we had had in mind for our romantic break. After coughing up an extra £100 we were given a bigger room. The member of staff who helped was accommodating but didn't seem overly fussed that we were not happy at all with the closet we had been originally put in.

The front desk staff were always warm and personable and gave us suggestions for sites we might want to check out. We found the location of the hotel to be perfect for our needs.

This was perfect for us and allowed my partner to get the rest he needed before the weekend properly started. On the initial reservation I had told them the occasion for our trip and requested a higher floor in the hope of better views and that was exactly what we got! We had a welcome letter, birthday card and some chocolates in the room on arrival. We ordered some room service on Friday and shared a burger between the two of us!

The staff were simply fantastic. So helpful when we wanted to know how to get here and there and gave us ideas on different activities to do throughout the day. We didn't have an evening meal in the hotel but the breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel. The location of the hotel was great. 2 min walk from the tram/luas stop and in 5 mins we were in Dublin City centre for a little of €2.

For sightseeing in Dublin, various Hop on Hop off tours are easily accessed. From the hotel it's a scenic walk along the Liffey to O'Connell Street. From O'Connell, Grafton Street, Trinity College (Book of Kells), the National Museum of Archaeology and newly reopened National Gallery are just a few blocks away. Hotel amenities meet or exceed expectations; rooms are lovely and comfortable; staff, friendly and helpful; dining, delicious, especially the ""Full Irish"" breakfast buffet.

If I were ranking on our second, one night stay on our way back through Dublin, it would get a 4. But that night we got upgraded to a suite and didn't have many destinations in the city center. The location, room quality, and some spotty service on our longer stay in a standard room takes it down to a 3. If you're playing tourist and like to walk the city, this one's pretty far out there and it's not the best area for a walk. If you prefer trams or are in town for business, this might suite you better as it's right near a stop. I felt a difference in the level of service between staying on floors 7 and 4. One typically does, I suppose. The restaurant is a place I would avoid for both food and service. The standard room was a double bed and not very comfortable. If the primary function of the hotel is a good night's sleep, it came up a little short. The bathroom was tight, but not the smallest I've had in Europe. Bottom line - I could recommend this for business travel if you pay up for the suite, but would look for alternatives otherwise.",3,Split Decision,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212690-r505273716-Ashling_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Travis W

There are coffee/tea making facilities in the room. We asked for a quiet room - one that did not face O'Connell Street. There was a big sports bar under our window. When they got late and loud, I just closed the window -and turned on the air conditioning. The windows appear to be double glazed, and keep out exterior noise well. There are also decent black out curtains, if you want to sleep late. Do not sleep too late, or you will miss out on the included breakfast buffet .As other reviewers have noted, a lot of the front desk staff are ESL. They try to be helpful, but do not always have a very good knowledge of Dublin. I asked at the front desk where we could pick up the No. 9 bus to the Botanic Gardens - the young lady had no idea ( turned out to be across on the other side of O'Connell Street)Easy 10 -15 minute walk to the Trinity College or Temple Bar area. Lots of city busses stop right in front of the hotel. The LUAS tram is just a few blocks away, on Abbey St. The north - south LUAS line is being extended up O'Connell Street, and will soon stop in front of the hotel. If you are feeling tired or lazy, you can always grab a cab, as there is a taxi stand in front of the adjacent Gresham Hotel.There are plenty of places to eat and drink in the area.

Loved the fact that not only was there ample room at the end of our beds to move around, there was a little alcove with a narrow closet, a safe, and a table for things or your suitcase. Some reviews have complained about lack of space for putting things, but our room had a bench/shelf that ran all along the window wall that we found was great for nearly everything we had. We folded our clothes into neat piles and put our purchases there as well. And used it to sit. We are not travelers who need drawers, in fact we prefer to not use drawers as things may be left behind. Easier to see it and pack it. Hooks on two walls for coats. Bathroom was huge! The only complaint there was we could not figure out how to let the water out of the sink as we could not find a lever to open the drain. Took five minutes to understand one simply had to push on it to open or shut it. :-) . Eating area is clean and spacious, options pretty much UK Holiday Inn Ex standard: eggs, bacon, beans, cereals, breads, fruit, beverages. Good enough to start the day. Seating/lounging area also clean and the whole place is modern. Desk staff are wonderful and the elevators are super-fast. Our room was quiet, we slept well.

So to stay in Herbert Park hotel for a couple of nights 39 years ago, 4 kids and 2 baby grandchildren later means so much to us. I rang just now to reservations (Karen) and I was complicating the booking with special requests, she was so kind and understanding. She rang me back a short while ago with everything in place.

When you spend this much time at a hotel you really get to know what they do well and what can be improved. First the many positives about this hotel:-excellent and friendly service. This hotel's service staff to include those at check in and the restaurant were simply outstanding. Helpful and knowledgeable about the city and sites to see.- excellent location far from the maddening crowds. A bit out of the crowded parts of the city but only a 20-25 minute walk to all the main tourist spots. Also adjacent to a beautiful park.- convenient informal lobby dining, set up with comfy sofas and chairs, perfect for the business traveler dining alone or with colleagues.-modern and spotless dining areas and room-excellent restaurants all within a five minutes walkNow for some areas for improvement and there were only a few that I saw:- a makeup mirror in the bathroom -a little more variety for the hot breakfast, while there was always plenty of food I would suggest switching out the McDonald's style potatoes for real home fries-more guest umbrellas.The bottom line I would highly recommend this hotel, the employees take pride in this hotel and it shows!",5,Modern friendly hotel with great service ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214540-r509685787-Herbert_Park_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,MB M

I hadn't been to Dublin for a couple of years so had some reservations about what I might find on my return now that Intercontinental have taken it over. What I found was it's still a great property with some of the original staff still working there. Some aesthetic changes (decor) and updates (like improved wifi) and still relatively generously proportioned room sizes. The location works really well for me as it's close to the city Centre but still far enough away to enjoy the beautiful scenery in that neighborhood. There are some small issues to work on and improve but the staff that I worked with were very friendly, pleasant and efficient and they took my feedback and acted on it so I and my group left as very happy customers who are likely to return. There's a great running circuit that takes you along the beach of Dublin Bay and through the local neighborhood with its diverse and impressive properties so if you enjoy a run, this is a great hotel for you. There are nice shops, bars and restaurants nearby so I really like staying here.

We could clearly hear everything the occupant in the adjoining room was saying as if he was in our room. He was on the phone talking at a normal volume. For me when traveling, location is key. Because of the conference held at the hotel, it made sense to stay here and if you are in Dublin for business, then staying out in Ballsbridge might be just fine.

We both chose the crafted g&t cocktail which was served in a teapot accompanied by garnishes of apple, cucumber and a delicious ginger sugar syrup to start. The presentation wasn't just what you'd expect from a 5* hotel it was much more than that, with twists on all the classics adding character and giving the elegant afternoon tea a shake up and a refreshing relevance. The classic ham&cheese was served on tomato bread and topped with goats cheese & cucumber, the pork belly was phenomenal, there was a Caesar taco which both looked and tasted fantastic but the showstopper came in the form of a foie gras & white chocolate lollipop which was a taste sensation- a must try before you die kinda thing!! Sweet treats were equally as impressive with a selection of strawberry eclairs, salted caramel macaroons and ginger meringue cones but the gin infused panna cotta was the talking piece, served with tonic foam and cucumber caviar it took real will power not to lick the bowl!! As an overall experience can't recommend it enough, the manager Nicky(who took the time to congratulate us in person and offer us complimentary prosecco) and his team are doing a fantastic job.

We were put in a room with two twin beds and our daughter had to sleep on a cot/roll-away bed. All were extremely uncomfortable. Not that we were sleeping anyway, but it was extremely loud!

Staff were very friendly, though I found that getting things done took longer than expected. The minuses: The port area is surrounded by construction, which means that at some point this looks likely to become a buzzing area. But at the moment it is a 15-20 minute walk to the Grand Canal Street area, with its great restaurants and cafés, and longer to the city centre. The walk didn't bother me, as I happened to be staying during a week of fine weather, but I wouldn't be keen to be so far out of the centre in rain or cold. Moreover, taxis seemed to have a problem both picking up from the hotel and dropping off in front - we kept getting dropped off a few minutes' walk away, which I didn't appreciate late at night. Also, the floors dedicated to rooms are a maze.

Very convenient location for the arena, excellent parking arrangements and generally a very clean, contemporary design. I wouldn't recommend the location otherwise (restaurant choices in the area very limited, and it's a long haul into town, even with the Luas at the door). Room was comfortable with sliding door opening to courtyard area. Like so many hotels, the TV setup was poor. Most of the channels were fuzzy with strangely squeezed or elongated images. I wasn't there to watch TV, but I can't figure out why hotels have such a hard time distributing TV signals that look decent.After the gig at the arena we went to the public restaurant/bar for a drink, but strangely they closed this at 11:40 and directed us to the small residents' bar. It had a very tiny selection and had run out of much of what it was supposed to stock. Why not keep the main bar open (there were plenty of customers there at the time it closed)? And how hard can it be to keep the smaller bar stocked? I wouldn't mind if this was a budget hotel, but it's pretty pricey. Pulled out extra blanket, only to find it was covered in what looked like chocolate stains.",3,"Smart contemporary design, strange bar setup",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d1765611-r507095816-The_Gibson_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,EnricoCaruso

Executive rooms with a balcony are very disappointing & overlook a construction site (noisy too) Superior double rooms feel a bit claustrophobic. Windows don't open. I had a family room which was very nice with opening windows overlooking inner courtyard so very quiet. Would definitely recommend this rather than balcony rooms or river view rooms (the river view is rubbish) Bed was comfortable, good hairdryer, iron etc & complimentary water.No mini-bar which was a bit disappointing. The restaurant/bar........very dull, lacks atmosphere and boring background music played (the same it seems each night) Strange menu mix of Asian food & burgers/steaks etc After the concert the public bar closed by 11.40pm & we were told to move to residents bar, again very dull & boring.

The hotel itself is in a great location where you can park and travel by tram from just in front of it into the heart of Dublin. The room we had was amazing! We got the one that has a king bed, sitting area, semi private huge balcony and a giant bathroom with the most amazing shower I've ever seen or had. The views of the city, however they are building right next to the hotel and there is a LOT of construction! The staff was really really nice! Everyone was very helpful from the front desk to the bar and restaurant staff. This is probably the best looking, most eloquent hotel I've ever stayed in! The bed even had a light glowing from under it! But.... there are a few stains on the carpet and seats and but...So we wanted to eat at the hotel and due to a ton of private functions, almost everything except the bar and Asian cuisine was closed. My wife had no issue with this, but I'm not into it. You can also order room service, but we didn't want to sit in our room. The room! It's so beautiful! But holy cow, the sun hits the glass and it was so hot all day and into the late night. It took forever to cool off. Then the A/C is in the sitting room and the bathroom is really far from there. It never cooled off. However, we left the AC on high and fell asleep, waking up to it freezing at like 4am. So again, probably the most lavish place I've ever stayed with some really super people working there. But they have to figure out how to make that room cooler/ quicker! They also need to work on the eating issues. The breakfast was great, but I would like more options then rice and noodles with spicy chicken or beef. I would absolutely stay here again, just for the rainfall shower that was in a huge glass closed in area. It's also a true rainfall shower in that I am 6'4 and still had about a foot above my head. For the price, if everything that was an issue was fixed, it couldn't be better.

We had a package that included valet parking (no other parking on site) and breakfast. The hotel is lovely; located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance. I love this part of Dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre. We were greeted at the door and check in was friendly, efficient and exemplary. The valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when I realized I had left them in the car. Great service! The hotel itself is not overlarge, but is welcoming with cool décor. Every staff member we passed greeted us. The room was big with superking bed (king for US travelers), 1930's style interior design, quiet, and sumptuous. The bed was really comfy (so much so that I checked out the brand of mattress so I can buy one for home). We had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of 8 plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles. We also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience. The breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites. It was great.

Sparkling still in refillable water bottles in the room (tap water doesn't taste good).7. Great job cleaning the rooms.8. I paid 174 euros but for a bit more you can stay at the Intercontinental 5 star, which is light years ahead on every level. This is adequate if you are on a budget, just be aware of the following.Now the negatives:1. No air conditioning, just a portable fan. Also someone had turned on the steam heat behind the curtains and I didn't discover it until 3 days later. Uncomfortably warm!2. Insufficient staff. Check in time is 3pm but I waited for 2 hours in the lobby after traveling all night for my room to be ready. Many others had to do the same.3. No brewed decaf only yucky instant coffee.4. Although there is an elevator, there are multiple steps up and down from the elevator to your room. No problem unless you have heavy luggage.5. Very small closet space in this old building with attached hangers which drive me crazy.6. Very noisy room on the street and you have to leave the windows open for air. Had trouble sleeping.

It didn't; the stay was a good as the first. We like the kind of quirky old-world charm of the building and rooms. But this is not the right hotel for people who need or want each room to be the same or like a newer hotel; it is a period place that is modernized but not modern. For people with mobility issues it would be quite important to make that known when reserving the room, because there are stairs and landing doors involved in getting in and out of some of the rooms. A picture of the hotel is attached to this review to illustrate the situation; you can see that tBuswell's is made up of several old buildings joined together, and the rooms don't line up perfectly according to the floor in many instances. Do keep that in mind when booking if an accommodation for mobility or other issue is essential to your stay; not every room is accessible at Buswell's. The location really is ideal; the airport bus lets you off on the side of the hotel that is along Kildare Street and it is just a short block to the outbound airport bus at St. Stephen's Green. Everything in the city center is a few minute's walk away.Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at about 4 PM and the manager very graciously bought us a drink while our room was being made up. We didn't expect that and it was a thoughtful gesture. The hotel was entirely sold out and at peak occupancy. So, we passed some time enjoying the atmosphere in the bar. We had some snacks while waiting, too, and those were good and reasonably priced. The staff really is a pleasure.Our room was small (we were told this when we booked) but perfectly suited to our needs. It wasn't very warm so we didn't notice the lack of AC, which is something that is missing in most Irish accommodations, especially those that are older or in the country. There was some street noise but it was not intrusive during our stay. It's an old building right on the sidewalk, so there is no way to really buffer out the sounds of the city. For those with city noise or AC concerns, this might be an issue. We did not find it to be a problem. The room was very clean and the shower had wonderful water pressure, which is always a good thing at a hotel.We love the Georgian look of the dining room and had an excellent breakfast with a marvelous array of items. It's not over-the-top, but very complete and delicious. An attentive breakfast staff catered to every need.Buswell's has been a comfortable and incredibly convenient hotel and we plan to stay there again and again on future visits.",5,Another Great Stay at Buswell's; Superior Staff and Ideal Location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209076-r507163001-Buswells_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,withkidstravel

Location is really the icing on the cake for this hotel - walking distance to many things and within view of Christ Church Cathedral.

First impression, really lovely decor but not so lovely that you are afraid to put down your glass or touch anything. There was a really relaxed feel in the hotel. People were just sitting around, chilling in various locations (there are chairs and sofas around every corner...so nice). The people on check in were lovely but special praise goes to Beatrice. She went above and beyond. About 10 mins after booking us a taxi to longitude another couple made a similar request and she suggested that they approach us and share, saving us both money. I thought it was a lovely touch. She was there again in the morning when we were checking out and made time to ask how we got on the night before. Silly maybe but we both agreed that Beatrice's kindness added to the great buzz of the weekend.  The beer garden is really lovely. While we didn't get to eat at the hotel (other than late night pizza) but I think you could honestly go to the Sandymount and not leave the grounds. At one point I thought we would just forget Longitude and stay in the garden :) We were driving so with regards to public transport, I am not sure what the options are like but given that the hotel is co-located with the Aviva Stadium, I assume they are good.Last but not least, a shout out to the two gentlemen on reception who were there to greet us on our return from longitude in a perhaps 'little under the weather state' wanting food and more alcohol. I am sure you wanted to murder us but pizza and cokes were a far better option. :) I would highly recommend the location.

We were in Dublin for the U2 concert at Croke Park and it was also my Husband's Birthday. I booked the hotel direct, it was really easy and we booked a classic room and late check-out. We chose this hotel based on the great reviews and the fact that it was near the coast which my Husband was really keen to visit - we were not disappointed with our choice!! We travelled by taxi from the airport to the hotel, the journey took around 15-20 minutes and cost 25 euros.A few days before we travelled, I contacted the hotel to confirm our reservation and to ask if there was anything they could recommend in the immediate area of the hotel that I could arrange for my Husband to do on the Sunday as we were seeing U2 on the Saturday evening. I got a very fast and very friendly response from Iamina who also provided me with website links to the recommended places so that I could get more information. Fab!On arrival we were impressed, first impressions were really great! The hotel looks really impressive and the reception area was spotless with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere. The receptionist was super-friendly and she gave us loads of information about the area and as we were travelling to Croke Park, she told us where to find the Dart station (about a 2 minute walk) and how many stops we needed to get near to the stadium. She also advised us that we had been upgraded to an executive suite, which was just so lovely. The room was large and had a king bed and a single, a lovely bathroom, a desk, wardrobe and dressing table. Nice toiletries were provided along with robes, tea and coffee making facilities, a hairdryer etc. There was also a bottle of wine and some chocolates for my husband which again was so lovely. The room was absolutely spotless too (and I have a hygiene OCD!).As it was fairly early we decided to find the Line Out bar and have some food and a drink before we set out for Croke Park. The bar looked great, plenty of room inside with a little decked area outside. We chose our drinks, they have a great range of beers and ales and some nice wines and food. The food menu was good with a great mix of main dishes, burgers, wings and ribs etc. I ordered a chicken burger and my husband ordered chicken wings. The food came out quickly but unfortunately my order was wrong. The staff couldn't have been more apologetic and handled the situation really professionally. Twice they offered us complimentary drinks to make up for the mistake, but we refused as they dealt with everything so beautifully we didn't feel it was necessary. The food was really good - too many wings for my husband though! When we arrived back from the concert at around 11.40pm, the receptionist told us the bar was open until 1am and served pizza after 10pm until closing, so we sat at the bar, had a pepperoni pizza and a couple of drinks - it wasn't overly busy but the atmosphere was so relaxed and everyone was so friendly that we didn't want to leave when it closed and could happily have sat there until dawn! Breakfast is served in the restaurant. Again it was spotless and there was an amazing choice of food - cereals, fruits, juices, lovely bread, jams, porridge, scrambled eggs, bacon, white and black pudding, sausages, mushrooms, tomatoes, hash browns etc. Tea and coffee was served at the table and it was genuinely one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had (and I've had a few!).After breakfast my husband wanted to go to the beach for a birthday stroll, it took around 15 minutes to reach the coast, the beach was lovely but the tide came in really quickly so take care! We walked back along the front admiring the lovely houses then decided to go into the city centre for some window shopping and a drink. The Dart journey was very quick from the station near the hotel, about 5 minutes and using the Dart is really easy and so convenient. It was our second time in Dublin but we wandered around Trinity College and Grafton Street before hitting Temple bar for a drink. We when walked back and took the Dart back to the hotel to check out and the receptionist called us a taxi to take us back to the airport.We absolutely loved our stay at Sandymount Hotel and i'm so grateful that they went out of their way to make my Husband's Birthday special despite us only being able to stay for one night. I'm sure we will be visiting Dublin again in the future and would 100% stay here again. Thank you to all at the Sandymount for a fantastic stay.",5,Fantastic stay!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209090-r508735938-Sandymount_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,MrsLizB

The Georgian house is charming, and our room at the back of the house was sizable and very clean, with a spacious bath and comfortable bed. Lovely view out on the garden and the rooftops beyond. There was some barking from the resident dogs at the start of each night, but they soon quieted down so it was not a problem. Fabulous breakfasts with a variety of cooked options in addition to an extensive buffet. The staff were attentive and accommodating, especially Irene who was most helpful and and welcoming.

The terrace was closed for us on the evening of our stay, which was initially a great disappointment. However the hotel arranged for a rooftop terrace breakfast for us all the next morning which was excellent. We were all very happy with the city view and the breakfast and the special way of looking after us. All bikers departed for the Wicklow Mountains very satisfied with the stay.

We checked out a few sites where you can rent a room, house or hotel. We opted for the Castle Hotel because it was convenient, included a full Irish Breakfast, and had room for 3 (an odd number when traveling). Our room included a twin and one double, roomy enough for our group.The breakfast was a great way to start the day. They do mention that certain hours are particularly busy so we were sure to get up early to beat the crowds. Breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans, assortment of breads, jams and Irish butter. Fruit, juice and coffee/tea were included. You could go up for 2nds too.At night we went to dinner downstairs as it included live music. We had their pasta the first night which was heaping (2 bowls served the 3 of us) and the 2nd night we had the Irish Stew which was excellent. The hamburger with frits was also great. The first night we had regular western, soft rock, but the 2nd night was Irish music (both with one musician). It was a fun way to end our evening. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. And the staff was exceptional, always serving with a smile and very helpful. The cost for 3 nights was on the pricey side, but because we booked so last minute our options were limited. If we had more time and more options we might have booked elsewhere. But since we know what to expect next time we visit Dublin we would probably go again or at least dine there as the food was really good.The location is right near the Writer's Museum and that is also next to a DoDublin Hop-On/Hop-Off bus (also Airlink to airport). So the convenience alone may be worth it for you. There is no air conditioning but you can open the windows to let in the cool air at night. There are lots of street noises so bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise. The location is sort of on the edge of town so you won't hear as much noise as you would if located in the center of town.The front desk staff was great. When they learned we had an early morning tour they arranged for a sack lunch knowing that it would be difficult to get food beforehand. We had a nice ham and cheese on Irish bread and a piece of fruit, just enough so we weren't starving on our tour. Also, when we arrived, our room was not ready, but they stored our luggage and we were able to use the restroom before going on the Hop-on/Hop-off bus.The building itself is pretty old and the rooms a bit musty. If they were in better shape the price per night would be better justified. But the staff and food made our stay worth while.There WAS free WiFi, so if that is important to you, then this hotel has it. The speed was excellent in our room and I've heard that is not the case in all hotels, nor is it free in all hotels. We were able to FaceTime my family in the states and we had a great connection.",4,"Conveniently located, comfortable rooms, Irish breakfast included, music at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212936-r500979262-Castle_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,PlanItPlanet

The bathroom looked as though it had been updated recently but there were no surfaces on which to place toiletries, there was no mirror above the sink and it wasn't possible to reach the towel rail from the shower. The complementary toiletries consisted of a tiny bar of soap and a tiny tube of hair/body wash which smelt like aftershave. The breakfast room was nicely decorated. There were cereals, tinned fruits and yogurt, cooked items and baked goods. Hot breakfast items aren't cooked to order and the baked pastries looked a bit battered.

There was no counter space for toiletries, and the shower had miserable water pressure with a fluctuating hot/cold rhythm.

I liked how the breakfast was served by staff but you still had the choice to choose what you wanted. A wide choice and good quality food.The rooms are a little tired but it is a three star hotel.

The fan in the bathroom didn't work, we kept the window open with a water bottle, the bath tub was chipped and one of the sockets looked really unsafe.WIFI is not great, actually quite useless, didn't work moste of the time.The doors rattle everytime other guests walk past it or use their own doors. crash, boom, bang.Breakfast was ok, but it was a bit chaotic, baskets with rolls, croissants etc. were empty and it took the staff a while to fill them back up.Staff at the reception desk is ok, but we wished a would be a bit more warmer and welcoming.The Irish live music in the evening helps a lot to overlook a few things and the hotel is close to the city centre which is perfect, but I wished I would have never seen the blood on the quilt.",3,"Great location, but needs lots of work",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212936-r508467662-Castle_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Kathi W

They don't really have a restaurant, but share an entrance with the pub next door which provides their meals. The single beds were extremely uncomfortable. The room was hot. We had to leave a door open to draw to draw a draft from the small window, and the two fans provided barely moved any air. The first refrigerator in our room had the plug cut off! They replaced the plug and the light worked but it didn't cool. So they brought in another one that barely cooled. (We had been told we'd have a mini-bar). The view was of other roofs and exhaust vents that made it so noisy we wanted to close the window but couldn't because of the heat. And some one was apparently recycling glass nearby, because several times we would hear what sounded like someone dumping a barrel full of bottles! The sink had two faucets, so the only way to mix the water to the desired temperature was in the bowl of the sink, which we thought went out over 50 years ago! Some of the staff were great, but some were rude. On Sunday, we tried to call the front desk several times with no answer. When we went down, they said our phone must not be working, but then called us moments later! Also on Sunday, despite being out of the hotel from about 11 a.m. until after 3pm, our room was not cleaned. (Otherwise, the cleaning was fine.) When we asked at the front desk, we were told we must have had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out, but as we pointed out, we didn't even have one with our room! On Saturday, we had no trouble having the front desk order us a taxi to the city center. We knew it was only a 15 minute walk, but we were getting ready to meet a tour that we knew we'd be doing a lot of walking on, and we wanted to be sure to meet them on time, so we thought the taxi was a good idea. On Sunday, we tried to get a taxi to roughly the same area, maybe a few blocks further, thinking we'd walk/tour on the way back. The person at the desk implied we were crazy to get a taxi for such a short distance, and said the taxi driver would be mad! Since we weren't meeting a tour, we went ahead and walked, but were not happy about getting an argument from the front staff for requesting a taxi to save us some walking! (This was the end of our two week vacation in Europe, and we'd done our share of walking already!) And you have to leave a 20 Euro deposit to get the key to your room safe, but for some reason, they didn't tell us that until after we checked in to our room!

I was aware of the nightclub when I made the booking, and was prepared to be awake till around 3, but 5:30 is ridiculous. Nowhere on the website does it specify when nightclubs close or when the noise is likely to settle down.Our room faced onto the street, and the windows are not double glazed. The noise from the street, coupled with the noise from the nightclub, was deafening. On checkout I refused to pay the full fee, and without even coming to meet me and apologise, the manager on duty told the receptionist to give me a discount. Now, while I appreciated the gesture, the reduction only brought the charge down to the 'normal' nightly rate, which in my opinion is still overpriced.

We were on the 6th floor and the elevator only goes to the 5th so we had to go the last floor on a small creaky set of stairs.

The location is very close to everything I wanted to see in the central area of Dublin, and it’s very close to the Temple Bar area. I wasn’t particularly interested in seeing that aspect of Dublin, though it was certainly worth walking through. It’s only a couple of blocks from the Liffey River, which is also enjoyable to stroll next to. The hotel is situated on a very busy street with lots of vehicle and pedestrian traffic. This is probably one of the reasons there are very heavy drapes that can be pulled to cover the windows at night. I was one floor above ground level, so there was a noticeable amount of noise. It is not particularly quiet in the early part of the evening, when there is a band playing in the bar downstairs and lots of street traffic. This seemed to end by 11:00PM each evening, so one could get some sleep after that.The condition of the hotel is acceptable, though there is very obvious wear and tear. As a solo traveler this wasn’t really a problem, though, if she had been with me, my girlfriend might not have felt quite as comfortable. The room was quite large, as was the bathroom, which was an aspect I appreciated after having stayed in very small rooms in Amsterdam, London, Paris and Rome. There was a tub/shower with one of those retractable laundry lines in the bathroom. There is a restaurant downstairs, where the bar is, which serves food throughout the day. I tried the breakfast buffet one morning for 9 euro but did not eat there again. The price did not seem fair to me given what was available, so I used nearby restaurants and stores after that. There are many choices nearby. I used the Spar store several times, which was 2 blocks from the hotel. There is also a pot for boiling water in the room, so I could have tea each morning. I bought a box of 50 teabags for 4 euro at Spar. The desk clerks were always present and reasonably congenial. They offered to keep my bags after check-out on the day I left, which was very helpful.Overall I found this to be a good hotel for my purposes on this trip.

The location of the hotel is excellent -Right on the edge of Temple Bar (which we normally avoid like the plague) so really accessible without being ridiculously busy and loud. I slept really well on the third floor with the window open - even with the fan in the room it would have been too warm and stuffy without. There was very little noise, though yes, the walls are thin and floorboards creak. Couldn't hear the music from the bar at all. The doors slam a little too easily, I suppose, but that's down to other guests not treating people with the level of respect that we afforded them when coming and going from the room. The staff are approachable and personable and the bar/restaurant downstairs has a pleasant atmosphere, free entertainment in the evenings and isn't badly priced. We ate there the first evening and the food was excellent. The hotel has already stated on here that they are having a refurb in the coming months, so I won't comment on the decor other than to say it's just a bit tired. The bed however I will not have a bad word said against - yes, it's two singles put together to make one but that is common throughout Europe now. Unlike many places though it was one queen size duvet instead of two singles - far better! I slept wonderfully on a firmer bed to the point that I think it's time I looked at changing my own for something similar. I have scoliosis and struggle to find a comfortable position to sleep in but this bed supported me however I lay. One thing to note is that housekeeping is carried out earlier in the day than I have experienced elsewhere - 9am on a Sunday morning! However, the do not disturb sign was honoured with a note pushed under the door saying to contact reception for fresh towels, tea making facilities etc. On the subject of tea - my only piece of (constructive) criticism is that three teabags for a double room is liable to lead to divorce! We picked up a box of Barry's tea from Spar for €2.30 but that of course left us short of milk and sugar - however I'm sure if we'd been desperate we could just have asked for more!Teabags and Temple Bar aside, we would not hesitate to book with the Parliament Hotel in future and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a conveniently located base for all Dublin has to offer.",5,Great location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212670-r505366757-Parliament_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Niki G

Unfortunately, the service on the whole left a lot to be desired.Checking in was fine - no smiles or interest in me as a customer, but also not rude. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but the whole 2 double bed thing is still a mystery to me! Bathroom was clean and fresh, with a lovely rain shower and an abundance of products.The TV was rubbish (terrible sound quality, no entertainment and a poor signal). The thing that really let this hotel down is the fact there is no air con!! No air con!! Yes, you read that correctly. It was hot and their was no air con. Not even a fan to compensate. Yes, the windows could open wide, but they opened into a courtyard in the middle of the building, so there was no breeze.There were other guest staying there who decided to have a party in their room - both nights. The second night we had to call down to reception to ask them to do something about the noise as clearly either no-one else noticed or they just didn't care. We, on the other hand, did.The service at the bar was very slow and poor - the guy serving us both nights struggled to understand what we were ordering and took an age to pull 4 drinks together.Checking out, we were met with the same apathy as when checking in - in fact, it felt like we were an inconvenience to them.

However, with the hotel being supposedly 4-star and so well renowned, it was highly disappointing and is, at best, average. In this day and age, having wifi at a snail-like pace is an absolute disgrace and having to go down to the lobby in the middle of the night to check your messages is a joke. Despite having full bars of wifi on your device, the wifi still will not work. I had to go through the hassle of calling reception on multiple occasions to resolve this issue, but the staff at reception always turned the sitatuion around to make it seem like I was the one slowing down the wifi; the wifi was hotel-wide and not per room, so the mere suggestion of the cause of the problem being me and my devices was ridiculous.Aside from this overwhelming techonolgical difficulty, the room was clean, spacious and there was a TV and a nice ambience in the hotel as a whole. However, where the room fell short was the lack of mini-frdge (although it is available upon request), the room service was extremely overpriced (€16.95 for a portion of fish and chips) and there was no air conditioning or any sort of temperature control. There was also a bit of stinginess with the lgithing, as there was no main lgithing fixure in the room, only lamps.The door was also very creaky, so much so that my dad compared it to an accordion. The bathroom had a few problems - smelt vaguely of urine, the showerhead was not detachable, and there was no conditioner.Overall, the hotel is frankly not good enough for the ""4-star"" title it carries, and falls flat on the face of the 21st century. Requires massive updating (specifically the wifi) to be even in the same ballpark as most 4-star hotels these days.",2,Not very good for a 4-star hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d2587316-r507929858-Ballsbridge_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Maheen S

An over night stay booked as close to Ariva stadium, cost £200 without breakfast. On arrival the hotel was chock a block with football fans (not a problem was a nice atmosphere) but queuing to check in was painful....staff pleasant enough just not enough of them. A quick visit to room on 7th floor to drop bags off....very shocked by state of the room...I've honestly stayed in better Blackpool b&bs on hen nights! The walls were filthy...not dirty or in need of a spruce they were absolutely black :( skirting boards had big chunks of wood missing and again dirty beyond words. Furniture and curtains ok, drab and outdated but in ok condition. No main light only lamps that didn't work.When we returned in the evening hotel was still packed with footy fans and after trying to find a table for food we gave up and returned to room to order room service. A Blt and burger with chips 2 soft drinks 50 euros...I could live with that if it was nice...deliver on filthy trays and the glass was that dirty I had to use a mug to drink out of. Food order was wrong and as I have an allergy couldn't eat it....chunky chips not cooked so literally ate the burger out of both meals as the thought of trying to wait any longer wasn't worth it.Overnight kept waking up to the overpowering smell of body odour :( after checking several times it wasn't me! Quick investigation it was the mattress that stunk.Next morning had to be up early for taxi so needed to get up and out quick only to find the shower didn't work....had to stand in 2 inch of bath (no time to run a full bath) water and try and wash the smell of someone else's BO off. Toilet also flooded every time you used it.I've stayed in some holes in my time but never paid £200 for the privilege....taxi driver said it's due to be demolished soon.....got to say I can see why! Such a shame as you can tell it was probably a lovely place years ago but the lack of upkeep has taken its toll. I genuinely wouldn't stay there again if it was free although I can see why it stays open with the location. Must say I didn't have any problems with staff always pleasant just not enough of them.

While the Dawson had a fantastic location and looked great, its beauty was only skin deep. It has a long way to go to get near other boutique hotels we've paid similar prices for.Things started well. It would be hard to better the Dawson's location, on a gracious street full of upscale shops and restaurants that links Trinity College to St. Stephen's Green. Directly across the street is the gracious Georgian facade of the Lord Mayor's residence, Mansion House. After passing under a glass and wrought-iron canopy most likely added by the Victorians, you enter a classic Georgian entry hall and proceed up broad, elegant stairs to the lobby on the first floor. They certainly have the boutique look down, with oversized gold-gilt Georgian and Baroque furniture and luxe fabrics mixed with modern accessories and lighting, and all of the calming neutral wall colours currently in vogue.We'd upgraded to a junior suite, primarily because we'd booked at short notice and rooms in the city were limited. It was also clear that people in search of peace and quiet should avoid the cheaper rooms facing onto the main street; the Dawson described them as ""vibrant"", especially on weekends. (Translation: the hotel's bar is just one in a line of trendy establishments that pour loud groups of merry-makers onto the pavements at night. During the day, construction noise and a bus stop for several of the city's hop-on-hop-off tours keep things lively.) Thus the anticipation of almost £200 a night hitting our debit card raised expectations, as well.The Ares Suite was indeed beautiful, with an enormous bed under a canopy, a fanciful footstool and sofa, a capsule-style coffee maker and a bathroom the size of a double bedroom with a striking free-standing tub. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the linens of top quality, and the room was blessedly quiet. But little things niggled. There was no shaver point in the bathroom, leaving us without the ability to charge our toothbrush. There was an unprepared hole in the wall (perhaps power was on the way?) More frustrating, the bathroom only had dusky mood lighting. Great for a romantic soak, but frustrating for more prosaic business. Surely a luxury boutique could offer two-stage lighting? I appreciated the fridge in the room, but was puzzled to find it hadn't been plugged in (hope nobody arrives with stuff they need to keep cold) and surprised to find it completely empty. A true boutique usually stocks your rooms with a few goodies.Service was adequate, but lacked the personal interest and the sense of going above and beyond I associate with boutiques. This might have been, in part, because the lobby is off to the side of the main stair. Once you check in, you have no reason to pass through. This means there's little contact with staff. When we did interact, it was efficient but perfunctory. We didn't encounter anyone with a local accent; though it may be an unfair assumption, the whole staff seemed to be from somewhere else, adding to a more corporate, impersonal feel.Our biggest issue, however, was breakfast. I hadn't confirmed that it was included in the rate, making an assumption that at that price ... and in a country that makes a big deal of its breakfast ... the meal would be part of the experience. And I sense that, under normal circumstances, it is. But we arrived to a notice that the kitchen had been closed due to ""unavoidable circumstances"". Probably just unfortunate wording, but I immediately imagined a health inspection shut down. The offered a continental breakfast instead. This was a disaster.Breakfast took place in a bar to the side of the main entrance, primarily free of staff and curiously cluttered with boxes, as if throwing people into the room for breakfast was an afterthought. The breakfast spread ... inelegantly scattered on a side table ... comprised boxed cereal, some fruit, yogurt containers and a stack of sale scones. There was a vat of boiling water and tea bags, but NO COFFEE. And no staff to handle any requests. Climbing upstairs to the lobby, we discovered they would bring us cups from the Nespresso machine there.I understand kitchen issues. But if you're going to put yourself out there as a luxury boutique hotel, you can do a better job on the continental breakfast. Have a staff member in the room to take care of people. Decant your cereals into glass jars. Lay on some platters of sliced meats and cheeses. Offer a varieties of pastries. Fresh ones. And, for heavens' sake, coffee. Ideally cafetieres or pots for each table so people can linger over their breakfast without having to request the next cup. Lacking all of these things, we sought breakfast elsewhere two of our three mornings.I wouldn't completely dismiss the Dawson. Its location is extraordinary and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. But all those little issues frustrate when you're presented with a sizeable bill on checkout. It's a hotel that could be great but, right now, it's not fully earning its ""boutique"" appellation.",3,"Great location, but misses the fine points needed to earn the boutique badge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d309650-r503161325-The_Dawson_Hotel_Spa-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,BencardsBites

I arrived at the airport around 9pm and had to take a cab to the hotel that cost nearly €18 (remember that detail). Upon arrival, the check in process was smooth and the staff was somewhat friendly. I asked about the airport shuttle they advertised and was shown the timetable for the shuttle that limited its use to a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the early evening. On the way up to my room, I noticed the place was either new or recently renovated. Either way, it was nice. The room was hot due to unseasonably warm weather in the area. The entire exterior wall was made up of windows and a glass balcony door but only one window opened a few inches and the door was locked. There was no other source of ventilation so I accepted the mildly uncomfortable room. On the balcony was a large seagull sitting very still. The bird was so still that I assumed she was sitting on an egg or a hatchling. It wasn't until I noticed a couple of flies that I realized it was in fact dead. The bathroom was very nice with a huge bathtub and very modern fixtures. The television was slightly larger than a postage stamp but there were quite a few channels to watch. Thinking that this part of Ireland was still part of the U.K., I tried plugging in my phone with my U.K. adapter only to find the Euro style plugs. Luckily I had both adapters. There was plenty of hot water for bath/shower and minimal noise while I slept. The breakfast downstairs was hot and filling and the dead seagull had been removed by morning. While checking out, Shannon at the front desk frowned deeply when I told her about the €18 cab ride. She said the cab shouldn't be more than €12 and called me a cab from a reputable company that the hotel frequently uses. She also addressed the hot room by pointing out the unusually warm weather and said they had fans for guest use. I didn't think to ask. Either way, if it's hot they have fans for guests. The cab Shannon called arrived within a few minutes and her estimate was pretty spot on: €13 for the ride. If I have another lengthy layover in Dublin again, I'll most likely stay here.",4,Decent and Affordable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d634898-r505764251-Travelodge_Dublin_Airport_South_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,ShooterX

Security were pushy and we ended up losing our temper with one security guard whilst trying to get food one night.. I don't think he was expecting it as his job usually seems to consist of pushing Dublin teens around on the 'meat-market' terrace and having two middle aged blokes challenge his nonsense quickly lead to a change in attitude. Food and drink prices were however good with most drinks costing €2.00 in the afternoon/early evening. Whilst the rooms were extremely dated in terms of emanates and decor, they were comfortable and were good value for money. The only faults were the lighting (extremely dim) and the constant music that went on until 3:00am every night, we were on the top floor and it was still loud, however ear-plugs were provided in the room on arrival.

We booked the family deal with Dublin zoo tickets, dinner on the first evening and breakfast both mornings. I was a little nervous about staying after reading some of the reviews and on arrival as we turned the corner I got even more nervous with the appearance of the hotel, however on entering the hotel I noted that it was definitely more modern and nicer looking. We were quickly checked in and given our tickets for Dublin zoo and I was pleasantly surprised when we entered our room. We could immediately smell fresh paint which was nice and our room was really clean and nicely made up. It wasn't a huge room but fitted us all in nicely, the bathroom had little flaws but was clean. I think we stayed in the refurbed part of the hotel as it looked a lot differently than the other part of the hotel where the kids movie night was held. The kids movie night was being hosted by two very young hotel workers but they were pleasant and very helpful. We had our evening meal which also surprised us as it was 3 courses for adults and 2 for children. The food was nice and ok. Not fancy in any way but totally edible, feeling and nice. We had a drink in the bar located in the hotel and it was nice and had tvs to watch. There was music on the second night but we didn't go in. We slept ok, very warm but the beds were comfortable. We didn't use the pool as we couldn't justify paying for the head caps required to use the pool. They were 3 euro each. Our kids were excited to go to the pool but we thought the price was unjustifiable for the length we would be in. The times weren't also suitable as kids weren't allowed in before 9am and after 7pm which meant if your planning to go to Dublin for the day as we did, we would have to cut short our day.

The gym is very well set up and I enjoyed the virtual reality running machines.

You can still walk to Temple Bar and Grafton for all the main shopping areas and bars. But you are in a lovely, quiet area with everything still at your fingertips. You also have more locals around you than just the tourists that take over Temple Bar. The hotel is beautifully designed and very artistic. We had a king room with an entire corner of windows. The rooms are also designed very creatively, but also very clean and elegant. We had a record player with and a vintage speaker with modern technology (blue tooth, adapters, etc). At level 2 of 10 it was SO loud - we are actually going to order one for our own house. We have a Samsung sound bar, but this speaker was so clear and crisp. I love the unique art in the rooms with the artists listed- I took pictures and plan on ordering art by them! The bathroom was large and clean with a great shower and even heated towel racks.

Thanks for taking the time to flag this with us. We do have big issues with noise on Harcourt Street. We have some rooms that are quiet-er but nothing we'd consider silent by a long stretch. Harcourt street is the singlemost busiest area in Dublin/Ireland for nightlife in general, we're completely surrounded by night clubs/late venues. Although there is little we can do to control this, we try to assign the quiet-est rooms to corporate guests, longer stays, pre-requests etc. to minimize the impact on our guests. I'm sorry if this wasn't communicated on arrival, I will follow up internally to prevent the next guest from being in the same position.  As recently as this week we have undertaken additional construction work/acoustic insulation at our expense to isolate us from our neighbours. We're working hard behind the scenes as a management to lessen the impact of noise on our guests comfort.  In relation to the lights, coffee machine and basin - we greatly appreciate feedback and I have personally followed up with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to ensure it does not happen for another guest.

There was no shower gel or shampoo in the bathroom, just a really ugly box in the (tiny!) shower attached to the wall, but this was actually empty! The shower itself was also quite dirty, and the taps were broken and there was a dead fly on the blinds.

They had to tell me when they'd unlocked the door - there was no other indication.A decent-sized room, with a very pokey bathroom - plenty of towels were provided, but there was nowhere to put them!

Staff seemed very unorganized. We heard several guests complaining because their orders were wrong even on quiet mornings. On one occassion the buffet had no bread or croissants and guests had to ask for this at 9 am ! Breakfast was supposed to run until 10 am so we of expected there should of been plenty of food left . The waitress went and got more croissants when requested but first served herself and one of the other waiters before putting it in the buffet for guests. Other guests consequently didnt get any croissants and were understandably disgruntled especially as we could see the staff eating the food we had all paid for. It was really bizarre!! The same waitress also dropped dirty cutlery right next our table when we were eating and rather then picking it up and apologising , walked away laughing.There just seemed to be one good waiter called Stephen doing all the work! Despite this the irish breakfast was cooked well and we liked it. The hotel is easy to reach on the 747 bus from the airport and cost 12 euros for a return.We liked the queen of tarts cafe next the hotel which was great for lunch & cake & we would recommend the botanic gardens which has free entry and is a short bus ride away on the number 9 bus from oconnol street.",3,Great location.

It is in a great location however I had a number of problems with my stay which I don't think the hotel staff seemed to give enough attention to. Firstly when I arrived, I was told that I had only booked a double room. I explained that I had double checked my email and it says triple room and I paid more, to which the receptionist pointed to his form and said no it was a double. Clearly this was not my fault or the receptionists fault but his response was pointless. There is obviously an issue between the booking site and the hotel details. He did find me a room with a double and single bed and I was grateful as we were all very exhausted from an active day.When I got to the room and ready for bed, we discovered a problem with the electrics, only one plug in the room worked. As it was late I decided to get some sleep and report in the morning.I reported the problem to the receptionist on the morning and he advised he would get someone to look at it.We arrived back to the hotel late that evening and I asked the reception staff if he was aware if the plugs had been fixed in my room. He didn't know anything about it and I hoped this was a good sign. Unfortunately when we got to the room there was no change. Again as it was late we just wanted to get to sleep.I reported the problem to the receptionist in the morning and when she checked the system she said the fault had been noted but there were no maintenance staff available on a Sunday to fix it. I had made the most of a frustrating situation and moved furniture to be able to use the hairdryer in the room and asked reception staff to charge phones. while I accept these difficulties can arise I feel the staff in this situation need to learn how to effectively communicate. I should have been told there were no maintenance staff, I could have been offered an alternative room and I should have had a phone call or message left for me on my return. In addition the standard of finish and cleanliness of this room was poor, it was very dated and grubby. I feel that due to the initial booking conflicts I was put in a room that probably was not properly prepared for use.

This took about 30 minutes but there was no extra charge to us for the room.The rooms were in ""The Address"" which is the newer part of the hotel. They were very nice and modern. Really cool technology for lighting, AC controls (yes, AC), room attendance, etc. No sheet, just a comforter (duvet), which annoys me, but it’s the same in most of northern Europe. There is a nice roof top self-serve café for those in ""The Address"". I don't think it is accessible by those in the older section of the hotel. I'm also not sure how rooms get booked in the older vs. newer section or if it just luck to get the new one. There was nothing differentiating the two on the mobile website.Morning breakfast buffet was well stocked but the room got quite busy, likely due to peak tourist season.The location is great. It is right across the street from Connolly rail station. It's about a block from the bus station. The airport busses (747, 757) drop off on Talbot street coming from the airport and pick up at the bus station. It's a short walk to O’Connel street. Within a 20 minute walk to most of the city center attractions. About 30-40 minute walk to Guiness, Teeling, or Jameson.The restaurant / bar was nice with friendly staff and good food. They were accommodating for our young kids and had goodie bags for them.

We booked a very smart 5 star hotel off St. Stevens and looked forward to it, a bit of class and luxury. However, some friends found out we were coming and the aspect of the trip changed and we realised that we would not be in the hotel so much so why splash out. We decided to down grade a little and found the Address North Star.Well, what a great decision. Although not having the plushness of the original hotel, the quality was excellent. Ok, its maybe on the north side of the Liffey but everything in Dublin is easily accessible and the hotel is handy for the bus station, Luas (tram) and Connolly Street Station. You can walk to the Grafton Street within 15-20 mins no problem and there is plenty to take in on route.I noted someone mention that the trains from Connolly ""made the hotel shake"". This was not our experience at, all and we overlooked the track around 150 yards south of the platform.The train passed directly below our window. I could have jumped onto the roof of it. In the morning you were aware they were there, but no more than a main road and our intention wasn't to be having a lie in a vibrant city like Dublin. (Harsh comment I felt).We used the 7th floor lounge for continental breakfast which was ideal for something quick before heading out.The rooms were excellently furbished and you will be short of nothing. There is a lovely quiet ambiance to the hotel as you wind your way through the old railways arches into which the public areas are built, and the bar is excellently stocked, used by non residents and has great atmosphere.I would certainly recommend it. Our friends told us that in he past it did not have the best reputation and when we described our room and the hotel they admitted that it sounded like some recent refurbishment had taken place. If this hotel is trying to make a mark of quality in this area of Dublin then its doing a grand job.Make sure you visit some of the local pubs in the area. less touristy and great Craic.",4,"A Last Minute Change, and Was Worth It",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212672-r510834747-North_Star_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,DavidandPauline

This place however tops them by a good way. It's pure nasty so where do I begin? I'll start with minor grievance of only 1 towel in a 2 bed room. I've had 4 towels in a no star hotel in Lobito. The front desk staff are not up to their job and are clueless. Could not offer alternative room when I complained at the rooms allocated. Small shoebox rooms with old and substandard furniture. Our daughters bathroom is smaller than our downstairs guest washroom so it's a little on the snug side. Our rooms do have a fantastic view that is if you are an avid trainspotters and want to experience the closeness and rattle of speeding locomotives at all hours. ""Ah this city center hotel this normal and what you get"" was the sympathetic front desk reply. The all day restaurant is all day if you exclude a large proportion of the day. The photos on the website and booking sites must have been extensively airbrushed or outright doctored as even with lights off and a skin full of Guinness would I be would be hard pushed to say the room is the one shown online. To top it all they claim to have been awarded the hotel of 2016. In what way was that even remotely possible? The only way I can get my head around that if if the catagory was ""The best hotel call Beresford on Store street as judged by morons"".

We have stayed in Dublin before at a different hotel for less the price and had the perfect stay. Our stay this time was not good at all. Our room was so hot it was uncomfortable. We could not open a window as it was next to the tram track and railway and was very noisy, in fact it was noisy with the window closed too. The bed was so hard I probably could have slept on the floor and had the same nights sleep. The shower was actually a tap on the wall. The room service came at between 4pm - 4.30pm in the afternoon. This was far too late for us and when we spoke to them about this they said their English was poor so didn't really understand. We also made the mistake of drinking in the bar and found that this was also extremely expensive, like the breakfast. £60 for four Bailey's and three coffees.

It is not. For a hotel surrounded by car rental depots and other commercial and industrial premises, it is totally misleading to describe it as a quiet haven.When we arrived tired and hungry at 9:30pm, later than planned due to travel delays, we were told the restaurant was closing, even though we had called earlier to check we could still get food until 10pm. The receptionist (who greeted us in a rather cold and fed-up manner) called the wait staff and ordered them to keep the kitchen open, so we rushed through to the restaurant. The waiter to be fair was sweet and smiley, but he did start the conversation by saying ...”oh the chef is gonna be pissed off, grab a table and order quickly!”. The food was not good. We had booked a twin room that, according to the photos on Booking.com had two small double beds. On arrival we were told by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite. However, the “suite” was a room on the ground floor, at the front of the hotel, next to the busy car park. It was a room with one small double bed a tiny single bed. It was noisy and depressing. My mother was really quite upset as this was not at all what she expected when booking. I went back to reception to query the room, and before I had even finished my sentence I was interrupted by another grumpy male receptionist to be told they were fully booked. This was not an answer to the question I was trying to ask, but it did make it a little clearer as to why we had been “upgraded”. I have worked in the hotel industry as an assistant manager and I know how these things work, so it was not a kind gesture but actually a shuffle of rooms to accommodate all the guests. In short, the two receptionists were very unhelpful, cold, and dismissive. We went to bed feeling really deflated.The next day we tried to look on the bright side, we had a nice day out in Dublin but had already decided that this was not the hotel we had thought we’d booked, and certainly not the quiet haven we expected. As a consequence, on Thursday morning (we arrived Tuesday night), we changed our flights to fly home 2 days early. The hotel gave us a receipt for all 4 nights even though we had only stayed two. They said that this was because we had paid up front through Booking.com. They tried to charge us for all 4 breakfasts (we had only had two), until we asked them to please refund us the £40. The staff in short were awful, and since returning home we have tried to get a little compensation for the 2 nights we were not there for, but no response. I highly advise steering clear of this so called Hotel.",1,Terrible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d277118-r507329696-Sheldon_Park_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,tessmabbitt

Then when we went for breakfast the following morning (that we already paid for at check in) we were told we had to pay €12 each. When we stated we paid the charge for breakfast already the girl argued with us and would not accept that we paid. We were told to sit down but we were given no apology for the mistake.

Unfortunately the bad outweighed the good on this occasion.Upon check in, we were able to get into our room early which was brilliant after a 2 hours train journey from Belfast and the weather was scorching. However the receptionists were so busy talking between themselves that we were overcharged by €100! Unfortunately we did not notice this until we got home but after a quick email to the hotel, we were refunded quickly. Had the check in staff been paying more attention, this mistake would not have happened.When we got to our room in the blazing heat, we were delighted to find it clean and bright, but the corridors were tired. However the heat was stifling! You are not able to open the windows due to safety catches and because we were above the busy main road, the traffic was deafening. No win situation. I now understand that the hotel provide fans on request - maybe something the staff should make clear when checking in, rather than having conversations with each other? After a good nights sleep? Forget it. Because we had to keep the window open all night (so as not to suffocate in the heat) all we could hear all night was traffic and drunk people directly outside the window. THEN, at 8.00am, a knock at the door from housekeeping. When check out is at noon and after a shockingly bad nights sleep, being disturbed at that time was utterly ridiculous. She apologised and ran off down the corridor...

The hotel's decor is art deco - plain but true and consistent. The public areas are restrained/modest, so one isn't inclined to lounge and the hotel lacks a ""buzz"". The room was very nice and comfortable, but it was a rare hot evening in Dublin and although they supplied a mobile (loud) aircon unit and a fan, it was very difficult to get the room temperature right, made worse by a bar courtyard (adjoining premises) below playing loud music. That said, this would not be a problem 95% of the time, given the climate! The TV didn't work very well and there was a limited range of channels. Not a huge issue for me. Breakfast in Cleaver East was nice and the dinner menu looked interesting. Service throughout my stay was excellent. The hotel is in a prime tourist location. I think it's better suited to tourists than business travellers, but it was close to the Four Courts so that suited my purposes. By Dublin standards, the price was good and as such, it represented very good value.",4,Value for money,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d187625-r503402414-The_Clarence-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,RolloPollo

That changed not so long ago and given the opportunity I decided I would try and stay. I was struck by two things immediately - the availability was easy and the price was not out of line with other options provided by the conference I was attending. Great! Sign me up! I would refer to my first impression as ""this is authentic""... I may have been expecting something more extravagant given ownership and what is the norm at boutique hotels in London and NY. Excellent is Cleaver East - no doubt about it. Breakfast out of this world. I would have eaten there again if it wasn't for other responsibilities due to the conference. Lift to room - quaintly ""oldschool"". The room - very nice, well appointed with a large washroom and good ammenities. Ah now let's go get a beer in the famous Octagon Bar.... okay this needs serious help. Back over to Cleaver East for a pint at the bar. I had not researched the location - it is literally a 2 minute walk to Temple Bar (the bar not just the area). Great - if you like this sort of thing. S--t if not. Very close good news options - Roberta's and The Liquor Room. Hop across the Liffey and go to Terra Madre for Italian - tell Alessandro I said hi. Otherwise the city is small and you can walk to everything you'd like to touristy - The Dublin City Gallery, The Brazen Head, The Dublin Castle and Gardens, Grafton Street, Trinity College, The National Gallery of Ireland and local musts Kehoes and Mulligan's.

Like those others, we stayed here because the hotel is partly owned by Bono and the Edge. Kinda nerdy, but there it is. I wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but I can't. This is not a Holiday Inn, you're paying more for a better experience and in some ways The Clarence fell short.The hotel is in an excellent location for being a tourist. It's an easy walk to all of temple bar, the book of kells and the fun stuff on O'Connell Street. Its also very easy to get on the local public buses to get to places such as the Guinness Factory. Most public buses run on either O'Connell Street or Dame Street. Either one is a five minute walk away. The Temple Bar area felt safe to me and at no point in time did I feel uncomfortable walking around, regardless of the hour. The staff were excellent at helping me get my bearings for information regarding the transit system, printing out maps etc. If my review ended there, it would have five stars.The best parts of this hotel were the service at the front desk and the beds. The bed was probably one of the best I've ever encountered in Europe. The front desk and concierge were helpful without being overbearing. They made me want to stay longer. This hotel could be so much more, sadly. Several of us met in The Study to have a drink and chat. Our server seemed to go out of her way to avoid dealing with us, and other tables. Finally several of us and others simply went to the bar themselves to be served because the girl working the room as not available. To be clear, she was not busy, she just was not interested. She would stand at the serving station and read her cell phone, pretending not to see you if you tried to catch her attendance.The rooms are very nice, they are clean and quite lovely. Not fancy, but unique none the less. Our TV never did work in the room, which wasn't much of a loss given that it only had three channels. That I could live with, however my bigger complaint was the toilet. It broke twice while we were there and both times the individual fixing it put in a stop gap measure. Irritating not to be able to flush a toilet. In that regard, I expected better from a place like this.All in all, it was very nice, I would stay there again as it was perfectly situated for being a tourist.

We were in Dublin for the U2 concert and visiting the city for the first time so I wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis. The hotel was great. There are four of us--two tall teen boys in tow--and i wanted to be sure we weren't stacked on top of each other. I'd read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations. It did and then some! Upon arrival, we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready--fine since it was well before scheduled check in. I'll pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the US that flights arrive in the morning, but the hotels aren't always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program. Getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation Americans have of being arrogant travelers. We saw this again upon arrival at this hotel--Americans angry that no room is available at 11 am. Checkin is clearly noted as 3 pm. If your flight arrives at 6 am and you want to be in your hotel at 7 am you need to book it for the night prior. If you cannot do that, then don't schedule a flight that arrives at 6 am. Most hotels will store your bags for you while you explore, but admittedly that's a hard thing to do when you're jet-lagged. Plan ahead. Now, back to the review--we left our bags and walked an easy 2 blocks to a pub for lunch and back again to have our room ready for us. The family room consists of two queen beds and a single bathroom. But unlike US hotels, the queen beds were not side by side. The room is an L-shape with one of the beds in an alcove on its own. There is plenty of nightstand and desk space in the room, a fridge and microwave, a safe, a large wardrobe and, unlike most European hotels, a large bathroom with a tub/shower combo. We found plenty of outlets to charge our phones including in-wall USB which meant we didn't have to share the adapter. The beds were super comfortable and the towels were good quality as well. Unlike most European hotels, this one even included facecloths in the bath. For families like ours which two older teen boys or even for four adults traveling together this is a good set up because it doesn't feel quite so cramped. The hotel was undergoing construction to add A/C but they clearly stated that on the website and I didn't find it disruptive as the work was limited to daylight hours. I wouldn't characterize this hotel as charming and the neighborhood is not quaint--it's a main thoroughfare by the river, but it was reliably comfortable. Location was excellent for what we were doing--touring Dublin and seeing U2 at Croke Park. We could walk to Croke Park, and we certainly weren't alone in doing so. Joined by 20-30 thousand of our new friends, it was a safe and easy walk. The double-decker bus stops at the hotel--both green and yellow. We liked yellow. Across the street from the hotel are the Dublin city-bikes which we used every day we were there. For 5 euro you buy a 3-day pass and from there the cost of the bikes is minimal. I think for the entire time we were there, our family of four charge was a whopping 21 Euro! We used the bikes to get to St. Stephen's Green and the Little Museum of Dublin (both awesome) and to ride up and down the Liffey. The food at the hotel restaurant was as good as anywhere else we ate in Dublin and the portions generous. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. Ride time in a taxi from the airport = 20 minutes max. Ride time in the 747 Airlink from the airport = 30 minutes. To note: we had a family of four so it was actually cheaper for us to take a taxi than to purchase the Airline tickets. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone traveling with a family who wants a reliable, practical place to stay in Dublin and isn't looking for a traditional Irish hotel or a specific neighborhood. As it was the weekend, this area was not populated because it's near the financial district. We shared the hotel mostly with other Americans who had traveled to see U2.",4,Great family hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209088-r506677530-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Dublin_Custom_House-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,TVBelle

As a regular Hilton user i was disappointed to find the price to be hiked so highly having paid around £125 a night in Orlando, Manchester and Leeds recently but this Hilton charged £299 per night. We contacted the hotel before confirming the booking and explained we had to be somewhere by 2pm could we check in earlier than the 3pm stated on line or we would have to book else where and we was told that they would do their best and it should not of be a problem. On arrival one member of staff could not of been more difficult, the First Lady was trying her best and was going to speak to house services but then a lady interrupted and took over and pointy blank said check in is at 3pm and nothing more could be done, it was only after complaining hard that they agreed to try and took our telephone number saying they would ring us when the room was ready and that they arranged a cleaner to go straight to our assigned room and repair it. After two hours we had received no phone call so rang the hotel and again the second lady who took our call was rude and and snapped that check in was not until 3pm, I reminded her that she had stated she had sent a cleaner to the room to prepaid it 2hrs previously. We got a call then 5mins later to say it was ready. Also our booking was removed from my name as a Hilton rewards member and changed to my wife's name removing the Hilton rewards number although she was only listed as a guest. Again the lady was adamant that this was my doing and not their mistake even when presented with an email of my confirmation from six months ago. Other things I found poor was the completely ridiculous costs of breakfast compared to other Hilton hotels, also as a Hilton member we have sometimes recieved nice little touches such as a free drink voucher or my kids have received warm cookies on arrival but this hotel offered nothing. Lastly no room service after 12am although we were allowed the use of a phone to order food to be deliver which we had to wait in reception to arrive. Also both the sink and toilet had hairs on them and a stripe of tooth paste was across the bathroom door but maybe that was my fault for rushing them to prepaid the room for us.",2,Over charging and poor service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209088-r505534030-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Dublin_Custom_House-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,robwxm

Very easy to find as the 747 Airlink bus stops right outside on Cathal Brugha St! Very welcoming reception staff and was processed very quickly. Lobby very smart and looks very nice which leads into the bar/restaurant. The only downside is when you exit the lifts they are decorating this area but signs do warn you of this. People also for some reason left empty glasses and bottles in the lift area on the floor which I found very odd! We had room 247 which over looked the back of the hotel. Very quiet room even on the main road! Air conditioning nice and cold and couldn't hear from other rooms either which was nice. Bathrooms very nice and clean with soap and shower dispensers and a hairdryer. Coffee facilities in the desk drawer. Only thing to be picky about was the quality of the picture on the TV. Wasn't great but we didn't use it that much anyway.

Our room was quite nice with a lot of space but my parents stayed in march as I told them the rooms were nice. Their room was horrible. Only just enough room for a small double bed. Disgusting.

Why did I return? Because i had a good experience in June, because of the hotel's location and because of its value for dollar/euro. Having said that, the experience in late July was not as good. Why is that? Because the Hotel is a victim of it's neighborhood. There is a sports bar right next door. When folks leave there, invariably drunk, they are extraordinarily noisy. They are joined by the drunks passing through the neighborhood en route to their own homes in a marginal neighborhood. Then there's the homeless in a churchyard across the street. They have a knack for setting off the church alarm at all hours of the night having climbed a locked gated perimeter. The police come, remove them and they're back within an hour. Then the trucks come to make deliveries around 3 AM with back up beepers and running engines. The tour buses that park across the plaza for their overnight charges fired up their engines and idled early in the morning. The staff work extremely hard and they are terrific. Frankly, they don't deserve this constant barrage on their efforts. My room was an adequate size. It was spotless. The bathroom and shower were very good. Daily breakfast was comprehensive and an afternoon or evening pint was well poured in a friendly atmosphere. So, should you stay here. Yes. Just get a room in the back of the hotel.

After doing some digging I saw that Cassidys had a secure car park at the back in which you could pre-book so opted for there. The parking was about €12 per night which I would have happily paid but on arrival the receptionist said I could use a tucked away area without charge which was even better. The car is protected with an electrically operated gate controlled by reception.From the hotel it was only a short walk into all the main areas. I didn't venture as far as Temple Bar as I'd been there before so had a few beers in the immediate area. After one very dodgy pub I found some nice ones including The Confession Box which was fantastic and very welcoming. It should be noted that drinks are massively cheaper in the area the hotel is in rather than a Temple Bar.I ate at a Korean restaurant approx 50m from the hotel and it was first class. The following day I had the full breakfast in the hotel which was excellent and amongst the many things on offer was iced water with mint which my body needed after a night in Dublin.

Very convenient to most bus services, taxi rank & Luas tram stops. There is the newer Executive wing but rooms in the rest of the hotel have continuously been completely refreshed and modernised. I have never found fault re cleanliness and house-keeping. The hotel could operate as a training ground for other hotels as regards how to train staff in excellent customer service, they really go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

It is a solid choice for business travelers to Dublin, and is conveniently-located next to the Green Line Luas, for easy transport out to the business parks and suburbs south of the city.Check-in has been quick and professional, as was check-out. I've had rooms on both the 3rd and 5th floors, and there is an important difference between the two, even though the 5th floor is ostensibly reserved for HHonors Silver members. I much preferred the 3rd floor room: while both rooms were clean, plenty big, and offered a desk and chair and a comfortable king-sized bed, my room on the 5th floor, while it had been recently remodeled per the front desk, had *no* usable power outlets on the headboard wall. No place to plug in my phone to charge and use as an alarm or charge my watch. The lights on either side of the bed were wired into the headboard behind the bed and whatever outlet they plugged into was inaccessible.I had to call the front desk and get an extension cord sent up, which I had to run all the way across the room next to the TV stand in order to get the power I needed on the nightstand shelf. I've *never* stayed in a hotel, of any class, that didn't have power available at the head of the bed, and I am astonished that a business-friendly hotel would overlook this critical feature.The second issue I had with the 5th floor bedroom was a complete lack of dresser or drawer space of any kind in which to put my clothes. The television console, with its mini-fridge and pull-out shelves with a coffee/tea maker had no drawers, and the hall closet had an open shelf at the bottom in which sat the safe, and an open shelf at the top with a spare pillow. BUT NO DRAWERS. Again, I have *never* stayed in a hotel that did not offer at least *some* storage space for clothes.My room on the 3rd floor did not have either of these problems, and was perfectly acceptable. It also had the bonus of having a nice coffee/tea maker near the elevators along with a snack stand on which there were croissants and pastries in the morning, and either cookies or donuts in the evening. The sweets weren't incredible-tasting or anything near it, but the gesture was nice.If I stay in Dublin again on business, I would consider the Hilton again, but would definitely not accept a room on the 5th floor. I don't know if the remodel was only partially completed, but the lack of the two amenities I mentioned above make them unsuitable for me, and I would imagine, for many other travelers as well.",4,Solid Business Hotel near the Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d213298-r507283839-Hilton_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,dunadan

Perfect and means it's just a little bit quieter and more relaxed than staying in the centre. Loved Dublin as a city. Don't expect anything hugely picturesque but is has a brilliant spirit and wonderful, welcoming people. Eating and drinking is a joy as there are just so any places to choose from. Transport options from the airport were superb. We chose the Airlink and it dropped us off about a 10 minute walk away.

But the towels are thin and worn, there is no vanity kit in the bathroom and no water in the room. Yes yes, we know that Hilton blue members don’t get free water but just because that’s what it says in the manual doesn’t change the fact that guests expect it and other hotels across the world and Dublin provide it. If you can’t or won’t provide it, please put water coolers on each floor.The breakfast once again is adequate but cheaply done. Self-serve tea and coffee, tinned fruit and basic cereals, pastries and hot food. There is cheese, meat and yogurts and you won’t go hungry but once again entirely forgettable and much better elsewhere. The one positive is that you can ask for a paper bag to take a few things away (if you can find anything you’d want to).The gym is disappointing. These days hotel gyms are a differentiator enabling guests to work out while they travel in the same way they work out at home. But the Hilton gym is just very basic – a few cardio machines, a set of dumbells and a couple of benches. Yes you can work out but a few investments here would really pay off for the hotel.In the same way as the hotel is forgettable, it appears that guest are too. The staff are helpful when you ask but they don’t seem to really care about guests.I would stay again if needed but there are definitely better places to spend your money in Dublin.",3,Acceptable but forgettable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d213298-r503741208-Hilton_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Nicola J

The hotel is in a great location, within easy walking distance of Grafton St, Temple Lane, O'Connell St etc. Price - poor value for money. Our room was small for the price we paid and the bathroom is in need of maintenance. Our shower had been cracked and glued back together. Shower power was also lacking. What was particularly frustrating though was that on both nights we stayed the hotel was hosting private functions, a retirement party and a wedding which restricted the 'normal' guests use of certain parts of the hotel, courtyard etc - no reduction in price was offered despite this. The noise from the hotel is significant also (we had a room facing onto the courtyard).Staff - rude and inattentive. We had a problem with our room key card, it wouldn't open our door. When asking reception for help, rather than just fix the problem we were told very clearly it was our fault as we must have had the key card next to a bank card or mobile phone which then affected the magnetic strip!The lack of courtesy of staff continued at breakfast. Despite the extortionate room rate breakfast was not included, however at check in, reception had authorised 100 euros on our card ""to make it easy for us to pay for any costs we had while staying in the hotel e.g. Breakfast/room service"". Upon arriving at the breakfast, we were told ""we have no record of this so you will have to pay cash"". I asked if it was possible to check with reception, reluctantly he did and we were left to wait in the queue holding up other guests. He returned said ""okay that's fine"" and gestured us into the breakfast room. No apology, nothing!At check-out, we were then presented with a bill for €28 - for the breakfast. We explained the situation about the €100. We were then told this was for the hotels safety and would be refunded to our card in up to 5 days but meantime we had to pay another €28. This was completely different to what we were told at check-in and effectively they wanted €128 when we had only spent €28. This mattered because we were using a travel money card, not a credit card which had a set amount of money. If we had been told the truth at check in, we wouldn't have done this. Again staff were rude and treated us as an inconvenience, quoting ""hotel policy"" rather than acknowledging their error and the ridiculousness off the situation. Only when I refused to pay the additional €28 pointing out they actually were due us a refund of €72, they somehow changed their minds about charging us the extra €28, our refund did not credit our account though until 4 days later. Again no apology!I have no issue paying higher hotel prices providing you get value for money, friendly and courteous hotel staff and full access to the hotel facilities. And if something does go wrong that it is addressed quickly and with an apology where necessary. I did not get any of this at the Trinity, I will never return and wouldn't recommend to anyone. Dublin is a great place and thankfully has lots of other hotels to choose from, I would recommend you do.",2,Good location but overpriced with rude staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212667-r501797448-Trinity_City_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Smacx2

The hop on hop off bus stop 15 is also directly opposite the hotel.When we entered I was impressed with the decor, it has a very luxurious, boutique feel about the place.We arrived at about 3:30pm to check in, 3 staff on check in, we waited around 10 minutes & were given our room keys for floor 4, there was a wedding going on in the hotel so we had to walk through all the guests to get to the lift, we struggled to open the lift area door with our keys & someone else opened the door for us, we found our room & our keys wouldn't work, my husband went back to check in, by this time reception was chaos with lots more people checking in, finally got our room keys sorted & into our room.Room 439Nice size, no view & very dirty windows, I'm aware construction work was taking place on the upper levels / roof.The lighting in the room was fine during the day, but impossible to apply make up in the evening as there's just one lamp by the mirror, the bathroom needed a good bleach! The tiles, floor & grout was disgusting! The shower wasn't very good at all, coukd do with more shelving in the bathroom, the bed was comfortable & a nice size, the pillows were great!

We found the hotel to be in a great location and was beautifully appointed. We had spent a lot of money on a double room since we needed two beds for the kids and one for me and my wife. We had dinner and drinks in the restaurant by the lobby and listened to some great music and saw an example of Irish dancing. All seemed to be going well except around 7 PM the Dublin city road crew started erecting barriers right outside the hotel and within half an hour had started jackhammering at the street. At 10 o'clock the racket continued and we thought it must be finishing by 11. I called the front office and was told by someone that the front desk would call me back. They never did. I called back again around 1045 only to be told that someone was going to look into contacting the city to find out when the road crew would stop doing the work directly outside of the hotel. Keep in mind that our room was on the third floor facing the street and even with the windows closed it was too loud to sleep. No one called our room - again. At 12:15 I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening. The gentleman behind the desk could not tell me what was going on. He said he could not give me another room because it was completely booked. He said he would leave a note for the manager, who had gone home for the night, to speak with me in the morning about the noise. The hammering continued till around 2 AM. We were booked to be at a morning Dublin bike tour at 9:30. At 8:30 I went down to the front desk to check out. Granted, the whole family was pretty tired from the lack of sleep. I asked if there was any note attached to my file about speaking to the manager. Again the new person behind the desk, a nice woman this time, knew nothing about my complaint regarding the noise at night and had nothing to say except the manager would be in at 10.  So for anyone staying at the Arlington, you're going to get a great hotel and a great Irish experience so long as nothing unusual happens. As I've said in my note, I tried three times to communicate with the front desk. They told me enough to send me on my way but never dealt with the problem. Granted, the construction wasn't their idea, but nor was it mine. And at the end of the day I had paid for a room to sleep.

We shared a king/two twin bedroom on the first floor for one of those nights which was miserable.

I would be shocked if there was any insulation at all in between the floors. On top of that, the room was very hot. There is no A/C so if you want to be cool at night, you need to leave your windows open which means you will hear everyone walking home from the bars at 2:00 a.m. and you will be awakened by the sun at 4:30 a.m. in the summer. There was no sheet (which I learned is typical in Ireland), only a thick covered duvet. One woman at the front desk staff was grumpy every time we went up there. However, the woman who sat us for breakfast every morning made up for the bad experience. She was delightful, cheery and remembered our large party liked to sit together. The breakfast was typical and pretty good. I can't say the same for lunch....very mediocre. We enjoyed the fact that there was a large breakfast and lunch room where we could sit and play cards during down time. The elevator was weird in that you had to insert your card every time you used it and it took several tries to get it to read properly.

The front desk people were friendly but there only seemed to be one on duty at any given time.My only complaint was the poor breakfast service.

Sure, if what you are looking for is a clean, convenient place to crash and you understand you are not getting 4 or 5 star accommodations.

While the historic exterior of the hotel is still attractive, the hotel inside has a tired look and is definitely in need of refurbishment. That said, the location next to the recently re-launched National Gallery of Ireland has a brilliant location and the famous Irish pubs of Dublin's lower baggot street with great breakfasts and bar food all day, including my favourite Doheny and Nesbits as well as Toners. Staff were very pleasant and helpful but during my four night stay, the fire alarm in the whole hotel went off several times in one day and I had to quickly get dressed and run down the fire escape stairs along with all other guests. This was very annoying- particularly as the hotel manager said that the cause of the alarm was steam from showers in some of the bathrooms!. Well - Fix it please!I booked a delux king room. There was a kettle and tea/ coffee making facilities but NO mini-fridge. This is a big draw back during the hot summer months in Ireland. No complimentary bottles off water - even on the day of arrival. Small bottle of water were on sale at the main reception deck or one euro . Breakfast was hood value at 10 euros per day- additional to the room price. I would rate Davenpprt as a three star somewhat tired looking hotel. It has lost its sense of sumptuousness and I would not stay there again.",3,Comfortable stay but fire alarm in hotel kept going off and had to vacate my room each time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212562-r503391806-O_Callaghan_Davenport_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,GENEZANNO

The rooms we had included a double bed and a twin. That worked well for my husband and I and our son. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. As is the case in my places in Ireland, there is no ac so you need to keep your window open if it is a warmer evening. When the windows are open, you get a nice breeze. We were on the 6th floor and it is a quiet area, so there was no problem with doing so. Next to the hotel is a large market with food, fresh pastries, drinks, and other assorted good. Across the cobblestone way is Jo's Burgers, as well as a great breakfast place called Sparks and the Cobblestone, a traditional Irish Pub is right across the street. It was a perfect place to stay for the evening. The one drawback is keeping the windows open on the lower floor, where another family member stayed, tends to be more difficult as there is some noise on the street. Also, to put your car in the garage it is an additional 14 euros a day and you have to pay every time you take the car out and return. This is the reduced rate when you stay at the hotel.

On arrival there was only one staff member on reception, at a weekend and as she was dealing with someone we were left waiting which wasn't a great first impression. The hotel seemed a bit tired to me interior wise, both the lobby and our room. The room was a nice size, the bed was comfy and I liked that they use eco friendly toiletries in the bathrooms. There was however a fingernail sitting on my bedside table which may seem fussy but it was one of the first things I saw on a dark wood surface so I don't know how the person cleaning the room missed it and it made me wonder what else has potentially been missed.

There is car parking available at the hotel for a discounted rate of €13 per day if you are a guest.The breakfast was nice, with a good choice of cereals, fruit and breads. The cooked buffet was good considering how many they are catering for, although for how much they charge for breakfast, better quality sausages wouldn't go amiss.With the exception of one receptionist, the staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge, if you managed to find him, was very helpful and knowledgable about the city.When booking the room, I phoned to book as I needed to request a cot in the room, and could not do this online. I was not given the best deal over the phone, I could have saved more choosing my deal online, but took the hit as I needed the cot - which was provided free of charge. Upon checking in though, this addition was not added to my room and we had to wait to check there was a cot available, which luckily there was. Also, the receptionist who checked me in did not give me any information regarding the restaurant times, breakfast times, check out times etc. Not a major problem, but it is a basic requirement when checking in, and certainly one I would expect from a 4 star hotel.We enjoyed our stay, it was a very comfortable, clean room.

But overall, this is a hunky dory hotel and we had a happy time there.Now do be careful if you order breakfast and parking on arrival. We bought both for two nights and paid up front. So receiving an extra charge upon leaving was a bit of a surprise, since we'd had no extras. Apparently we had only been charged for one day's breakfast, not two. So I paid up, but did check the bill. Another surprise, the second day's brekky was more expensive than the first - as we had 'not pre-booked it' - but we had. At length the lady at reception agreed to refund me the difference - but then noticed she had not charged us for the second day's parking. So all in all, I was going to have to pay more.

Unfortunately our room wasn't ready so we were told to leave our bags with concerige and try later . We left the hotel to get some dinner and returned and tried again to check in at 4.45 pm . We were asked to present proof of our booking by the young man on the desk as they had no record and then we were told for the third time our room wasn't ready . We were annoyed at this stage and he offered to get the manager . He returned after almost ten minutes to say room was ready ( no manager ) . We received no apology no welcome to the hotel ( that seemed to be only for the guests who's rooms were ready ) and no refreshments while we waited . We like a lot of the guests checking in we're in town for the Phil Collins concert and the room prices were increased to reflect this 239 euro plus 13 euro for parking . Gate for the concert opening at 6 pm so not giving us adequate time to refresh before hand . We weren't the only ones having trouble getting our rooms on time and the manager should have come out to apologise but he left the young man on the desk to deal with disgruntled guests . If the hotel can charge almost double for the rooms on these occasions then maybe they should ensure extra housekeeping staff on duty to ensure rooms are ready .

Got in the lift and went up to leave our bags in the room before dinner. Room was OK. Was nice and clean but it was small. And the shower had no power in it at all.Went down to the bar then to get food. I got the chicken wings to start and my partner had the leek and potato soup - both which were really nice.For mains my partner got the beef rib which he really enjoyed and I got the Thai green chicken curry. I would defo recommend not to get it. It did not look appealing at all. I have attached a picture of the curry. It came out cold - both the rice and the curry. We said it to the waitress who was really nice and she took it back to the kitchen. About ten minutes later it came back by a manager who did not even say sorry. Curry was hot, rice was still cold. I did not want to say it again so I had a few spoon fulls and then realised I could not eat any more. It was revolting. It was watery, bland and there were no vegetables or anything in it. Just the sauce and the chicken. I put my knife and fork on the plate in the 'finished' way while we finished our drinks. I seen three waitresses look at my plate but chose to avoid me as they could see I didn't eat any of it. In the mean time I saw three other people send back their food. Two of which were at the same table. When we finished our drinks we asked for the bill which they brought us for €74 euro for four drinks, two starters and two mains. We paid and left (with my food still in front of me). The second I got up I seen the waitress to straight to my table to clear my plate, which she obviously just didn't want to ask me what was wrong.. Also there was air con blowing right down on our table making us freezing cold and we asked them to turn it off but they couldn't which we understood as all the air con is connected to the whole hotel.That curry just put me off everything.It was about half nine when we ordered and service dies stop at ten so they were probably trying to rush it.

The first time I visited was when the hotel was a Doubletree - that was an excellent stay with a large room and good views. I returned in April this year for the first time as the Clayton and also enjoyed the stay, although that time I had a much smaller room and a view of the buildings at the back of the hotel instead. Because of this, I booked an Executive King instead of the Standard Room for this visit as I hoped it would be for a larger room similar to my first stay. You can imagine my absolute awe when I was - out of the blue - upgraded to the Presidential suite upon checking in. The member of staff who checked me in was so, so lovely and I only wish I had asked for her name to be able to mention her directly in this review. She even took the time to ask the next day how the trip had been and I left feeling most looked after - thank you.As for the Presidential Suite.. I was speechless. It was beautiful - with wonderful views, a living area, dining area, kitchen, two bathrooms, two coffee stations, a walk-in wardrobe, a study area and the most comfortable bed. Needless to say, none of the intended plans for the city that night took place as it was much more enjoyable to just have a few drinks in the hotel bar and enjoy the wonderful accommodation instead!The Clayton has excellent parking facilities, bus links outside the front of the hotel and cheap taxi fares into the city centre. The reason I have continued to return here for short stays in Dublin are because of the amazing breakfast buffet, the fantastic bar and the excellent staff. For those driving down from the North, the hotel is so convenient to reach from the motorway and your car is secure (no tricky, underground car parks with narrow spaces here).I knew I would be returning again anyway based on previous experiences, but after this last visit I don't think I could speak more highly of this hotel.

On the first evening what should have been a relaxing bar experience after our journey was another disappointment. The bar man focused his attention solely on mature American guests and ignored us, when it was quite clear that we had empty glasses on our table and required service. There was certainly no excuse for this as the bar was not busy. In addition our bar dining experience was yet another disappointment. Having ordered and received our steaks they were both not medium/well done as requested, in fact they were medium rare. No service check was provided to enable us to easily rectify the situation. One would expect this to be a natural part of the food service in a hotel of this standard. Worse was to come, we attempted to order desert only to be told that the kitchen was closed. Again guests would expect to be warned of the impending kitchen closure whilst finishing ones meal so that any final orders could be fulfilled. Staff attitude and communication left a lot to be desired in this instance. After receiving a lack of information at check in we approached a member of staff in the coffee area to enquire about hotel facilities. However before he could ask him a question he stated ""ehhh I'm kind of closed"". Yet another example of an unwelcoming and poor staff attitude! At check out one would have expected front desk personnel to make the standard enquiry about our level of customer satisfaction for the stay. Again, such was not the case and we were not given the opportunity to register our disappointments. In the light of the experiences encountered during our stay I feel that we were poorly treated and experienced inferior and unsatisfactory levels of customer service as outlined, whilst clearly being victims of ageism and discrimination. A special birthday treat became a major disappointment which we did not anticipate. Throughout our stay this hotel certainly does not match hilton standards and in addition does not provide a clearly stated ""make it right"" policy which that chain utilises. This is a totally unacceptable state of affairs reflecting very poor customer service for a major 4 star hotel where guests are not treated equally regardless of age.

She was advised that she would not be able to amend the date or be issued with a refund. As she was under the impression that the booking had been fully paid for she offered me the room as she did not want to let the reservation go to waste. I knew I would be travelling late and called the hotel to query the latest check in time and when the residents bar closed. I was advised that 12 pm was the latest check in time and 11 pm was the closing time for the residents bar. This was misinformation as my husband rang straight after and was advised that you could check in at any time and the residents bar in fact closed at a much later time. We explained the situation over the phone and was told to come on ahead. When we arrived we experienced the most unpleasant check in I have ever experienced. We were met by an extremely rude member of staff, who really should not be dealing with the public in his mannor. Judging by his dress code and age I would assume quite a senior member of staff. As the first point of contact to the hotel please retrain this man in customer service. When my husband was trying to explain the situation he kept rudely interrupting saying ‘you do not understand sir’ and at one point during this conversation my husband was trying to resolve the situation by simply stating the booking reference number and he assumbed this was a six digit pin and he said he did not want to see information of this type aand my husband also explained that we had came here on the understanding that the room had been paid for fully. In response, the staff member seemed to become quite irritated with us so my husband went to the car to get his phone to phone the person who had made the booking. This person was willing to confirm her card details over the phone and pay for the room as she thought the room had already been paid for anyway as if we had not turned up to take the room the money would have been taken off the very same card infact. We were cautious about paying for the room when asked in case this meant that the room had been paid for twice. The member of staff refused to speak to the person who had made the booking over the phone and stated that he needed the card to be physically in my husbands hand there and then in order for the payment to be taken. Due to the treatment we received from this staff member if it hadn’t have been so late at night we would have turned around and went home. The staff member showed us a complete lack of respect and we were left feeling disappointed. Very poor customer service for a hotel of this star rating. At check-in time we were not informed of breakfast serving times or locations. We assumed that are door would be knocked 10 minutes prior to breakfast serving time as this is the procedure used in many hotel that we have stayed in over the years. At this point my husband mad the full payment for the room in order to avoid further embarrassment. It is key to note although we were in the position we were able to pay for this reservation at such short notice many couples may not have been able to. Next we were issued with our hotel room key and handed over to another staff member who brought us to the car park and brought us to our room . This staff member was extremely helpful and courteous. After leaving our luggage in our room we headed down to the main bar area for a few relaxing drinks after the whole ordeal. We were served our drinks by a Barman by an extremely friendly bar man but unfortunately the pints that he pulled had absolutely no head on them and were flat. I could clearly see this man had not received proper training in how to pull a pint correctly .My husband had to change his drink over to wine as a result of the standard of the pint served , and my husband would not usually enjoy this as his main drink in the bar. When we arrived up to our room afterwards we noticed our room was very clean although the décor was quite outdated and the bathroom looked like it was from the 1960s. To conclude the are much better hotels based in the Dublin area with better locations, service as well as value for money. I would not advise anyone to use their hard-earned money staying here if you wish to feel valued. The old beauty and charm of the hotel has gone , that my mother and father talked about as they stayed here for years. I would have hoped the standards would have raised instead of dropped.",1,Terrible visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209082-r503968911-Hotel_Riu_Plaza_The_Gresham_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,tina274

When asked if everything was ok I did inform the staff of this but the only response I got was 'sorry'! I definitely wouldn't eat there again as it's not good value for money at all. The breakfast was better though. They claim to serve until 10.30am but if you aren't down before that time most of the buffet has been put away and only a small amount of hot food remains available so get down early!Finally there is renovation work underway at the front entrance which is surprising for the time of year. I would have thought that this type of work could have been completed early Spring or in the Autumn time not during peak season. The workers are very noisy resulting in some difficulty hearing the very good reception staff. They too appeared frustrated with all the noise from dropping tools and banging equipment.

The location was perfect for walking to and from the stadium. The location is also convenient to walk across to the more interesting areas south of the River Liffey.

Breakfast was included with our package and it was a very nice buffet again with good service.The room itself was small and seemed especially so compared to another hotel we had just stayed in the two prior nights. But the accommodation was clean and relatively updated, the bathroom nice - it actually had a fan! (I can think of very few, if any, bathrooms with fans in the places I've stayed in Europe.) The bed was comfortable, though also small for two. Our room was 1013, in the college wing, which was nice because there were very few rooms on that stretch of hallway.The only downside was being on the first floor and basically at the corner of a couple busy streets. The taxi stand was right below our window and there was one across the street for another hotel. It being Saturday night, there were a lot of people out late so we could hear a decent amount of street noise. It wasn't terrible, but I'd want to be in a different room if I stayed again.

Paid 200 euro for a room without breakfast. For this price would have expected much better service. Arrived about 11am knowing this was too early for check in but needing to drop luggage and enquire about possibility of room availability. Traveling on my own with lots of luggage and a very tired young child. No room available (fair enough) but was told I would get a phone call as soon as possible when room available. Never got that call! I left my luggage, went to bar to order food, found my own menu, nobody served me despite waiting several minutes and I left to find something on O'Connell St.Three hours later I rang hotel and was told no room still available. Child now asleep on top of me and I pleaded with receptionist who then found one. I arrived back to hotel to lots of people checking in. I queued with child asleep in my arms and looked around to see if chair in reception but none there! Nobody came to my assistance during that process despite me struggling to hold my little boy. I eventually grew tired of receptionist chatting to a customer at concierge (not checking in, just chatting) and I asked for my room key. She then kept asking me for my luggage tag despite the fact my hands were completely full. I told her my priority was child and room and I could worry about luggage later. She finally let me go and then I wandered forever through long corridors holding child (staff looking at me but not offering direction or help upstairs) and eventually found the room. Room very underwhelming. Old fashioned and not in a charming way. Children's channel not working on tv. Child disappointed at this. Bathroom had no shower cap, none of the ""extra"" little things like cotton wipes etc. Very basic things provided. Definitely overpriced for 200 euro. The service was poor with the definite exception of Dino and another porter the following morning - both had the customer service the Gresham used to be known for. While the location is excellent, I will not be in a hurry to return. Would recommend shopping around for better service. To management- if you read this review I suggest you ask reception staff to consider needs of parents traveling with young children.

First of all, the location of this hotel is absolutely perfect!! So, if you want to stay in the city center, then this place is for you! You can walk down O' Connell Street and you are in the city center. There are multiple shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and everything that you need as you walk out from the hotel. Also, the Hop On, Hop Off bus has a stop right outside the hotel! The AirCoach (Blue bus) also has a stop just right outside of the hotel. I cannot say how impressed I am with this bus service that is offered between the airport and the city center. You can just purchase the tickets from the bus driver. It is either 12 or 14 euros (I don't recall 100%) roundtrip to airport and city center per person. So you cannot go wrong with that, and it is much cheaper than a cab.Overall, the hotel was decent and comfortable! The front desk people are very helpful and friendly. The room itself was very small, enough to fit a queen size bed, desk, and two smaller chairs. The bathroom was decently sized, and it had a towel rack heater, which was a nice surprise. The one thing I didn't like about our room were the paper thin walls... I could hear when someone was flushing the toilet at 4am. But, I got over that! I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location.

Our room wasn't ready of course, but we asked if another one was. Indeed a upgraded room was available right then, so we happily paid the $50E/night surcharge, went to our spacious room and had a magnificent four hour nap. We had a great bed; sofa and TV; desk area; ample closet; mini-fridge and kettle. The bath was spacious with a strong Swedish shower head. Quiet is extremely important to us. We were right over the road by the Liffey river, so there was a little noise but the windows had pretty good insulation and traffic dwindled in the evening. Actually more annoying were the hardwood floors, which creaked when we walked and when our neighbors upstairs walked.We had breakfast one morning; thought it was good but not outstanding. There is a pretty simple buffet of breads (usually very coarse), juices and cereals. You order hot items off a menu--standard Irish breakfast, omelettes, pancakes, etc. (Then again, we were never thrilled by any of our breakfasts over 17 days! This isn't France or Italy...)The staff was friendly and helpful. I wanted to print tickets for Dublin Castle and after I emailed it to them, they said, you don't have to wait around. We'll put the tickets in your room. And they did.The location was terrific: easy walking to all the major sites but not in a crowded location. We did feel the price was a little steep, but weighing all the pros, it was well worth it.

The bathrooms are not large with a bath shower. We found both room comfortable (no air conditioner) with comfortable bed. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast that's got everything you need from eggs thru fruit. The downside --- the street is noisy well passed midnight and you can hear this in the rooms. At 6.15am someone pulled the fire alarm that woke the entire hotel. It's unfortunate that this happened but indicative of the area and some of the patrons this hotel attracts.Overall --- I found this a very well priced product, though the location versus noise a good tradeoff and would have given them four stars but the 6.15am false fire alarm forced me to downgrade them.",3,Great location but that's also the issue ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209078-r512081253-The_Morgan-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Erich M

In the bathroom the stem on the shower head was quite loose so the shower head could easily swing right over the shower screen. It was clear that although there were new wall tiles and shower screen they had left the old bath in... would have been so much better to have taken this out and had walk in shower instead... especially as the baths are quite narrow! The bathroom sink although a new modern basin had a crack in it. In the room the bed was very comfy, I can see that pillows could be a bit flat for some people but ok for us.

The rooms are modern and you will not miss a conventional hotel. What makes it super special are the people who manage it. We were welcomed and upgraded into a family room so we could have more space. The chef even made a custom kids meal of buttered rice & veggies for the kids one late night after our city trip. Kiddos were also treated to extra ice cream by the team at Knights Bar. The Knight's Bar serves hearty Irish meals, so go on and enjoy their Lamb stew, Fresh haddock and even light eats. You would find local families dining out here on weekends. So, its always buzzing with people. Breakfast is a good spread and the breakfast rooms are nice & sunny. The rooms are spotless and the housekeeping fantastic. There's a gym for diehards. Taxis are just one call away. Airport or train station about 18-20 Euros max. If you're hiring a car, there's free parking. We would love to come back on our next trip to Dublin. Tip : Hire your car straight from the airport or online before u arrive.

Breakfast was fresh, much of it was home-made, and it was beautifully served in one of the castle's characterful rooms. Travelling to and from the city did take some time: around 10 min walk to bus/DART, and around 10 min. transport time to Connolly station, leaving every 10 minutes or so.

It is an unique experience and I was delighted to partake on Sunday 30th July 2017 as a final treat and to end a perfect few days stay in Dublin with my daughter. We had booked for 1pm and I was pleasantly surprised at the seating area were the tea was to be served it added to the overall experience, large comfy chairs to sink into, table at proper height and beautifully set. Glass was the theme and crockery was all glass not the usual vintage theme which is used in most establishments so different and refreshing. Cormac the bar manager approached our table he introduced himself in a very professional manner but he was friendly which is also important, he helped us to sit back relax and look forward to what was in store. He had wit him a wooden box which stored all the samples of teas in glass storage jars he proceeded to explain the origin of each tea and we were able to smell each one (it was better than wine tasting) he gave his recommendations but the final choice was entirely up to ourselves. Michelle was in charge of serving our afternoon tea and Kirsty also helped, Michelle explained how the afternoon tea would be served, savouries first and she described what was in each treat and she did the same for the sweet section. She was very helpful and professional . The food served was of a very high standardand and was plentiful there was a combination of unusual flavours which worked. I have had afternoon teas in other establishments but i have no hesitation in saying Clontart Castle 's Fusion Afternoon Tea was the best, the attention to detail, the setting, the professional manner the staff carried out there duties and the food was superb, all these factors added to the unique experience of afternoon tea at Confarf Castle.

This was an amazing hotel and we both have no reservations in giving it the full five stars. Prior to arriving we got a bit lost and Adam was most helpful over the phone in redirecting us. Adam was also very helpful and polite upon checkout too. During our conversation he informed us that he was a newer member of staff having only been there a few months; this didn't show and he is a credit to the hotel. Once we arrived, we were greeted by Luke who was professional and welcoming. He couldn't have done enough to help us, for example we were VERY early (check in is from 2 and we arrived at 10:30am) but he managed to get us an early check-in and a great room which in essence he had no obligation to. Thanks for this, Luke. The hotel is amazing. Plenty of parking spaces if you are driving (as we did; we hired a car from the airport) and good facilities. The outside face of the building looks original, authentic and simply stunning while the decor inside the hotel is equally as impressive. As you enter the hotel you are greeted by knights in shining armour, medieval type decor and a beautiful fireplace where we later sat by to who a delicious and gratuitously tasty/filling afternoon tea. The rooms are also beautiful: the bed was extremely comfortable and we liked the facilities such as the smart television in the room. We also booked breakfast in the morning which was tasty, varied and a great way to start the day. One thing I'd like to add before drawing this review to its conclusion is the fact that we had gone away for my wife's birthday and I'd treated her to tickets for The Riverdance. Now I can't remember actually mentioning this to staff but I obviously did at some point so when we came back after our night out, we had a hand written note from the ""Lords and Ladies"" of the castle wishing my wife a happy birthday and saying they hoped we'd had a lovely time watching The Riverdance. The note was accompanied by chocolates and an official plush toy/teddy for the hotel. This came as a lovely surprise and goes to show how attentive the staff there are and how they go the extra mile. Overall this was an amazing stay. This was our first trip to Ireland but we have traveled all over the world (east and west) and have high standards - this hotel met them and then some.

He congratulated us on our wedding anniversary celebration and gave us all the information we required. Room - (room 217) - The decor was classy with a twist and my wife and i really liked it. The bed was incredibly comfortable and a good night's sleep was had after the concert. If i had to find a negative I would say that the bathroom was a little tired looking in comparison to the very fresh and modernised room - although in saying that it was totally spotless and that's the main thing!Food: We had dinner in the bar - my wife had the fish of the day and thoroughly enjoyed it; I had the chicken burger and it was likewise very good. Portion sizes were generous. Definitely value for money and in line with other Dublin eateries. My favourite part though was breakfast the next morning - a lovely buffet selection of cereals, breads, fruits and cooked breakfast. Little freshly prepared smoothies and juices were welcomed too. I stay in Dublin quite a lot for concerts/weekends away and can genuinely say this was probably one of the best breakfasts I've had in the city.Special touch: The gentleman who checked us in left a little gift in our room for our anniversary whilst we were eating in the bar prior to our concert. This was a wonderful surprise. We tried to catch him again before his shift finished and didn't manage to, so please pass on our thanks. Location: The hotel is a good 10-20 mins outside of main centre of Dublin. If you have a car it's very easy to get to - 12 mins took us to the 3Arena - (or there's always the bus stop next to the hotel), but be aware of this and note that there isn't much to do directly around the hotel. This didn't bother us as the hotel fully met our needs but may obviously be a negative for tourists etc. Overall - a fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable stay. We will be back and have since recommended to family/friends.",5,"Classic, Quality and Charming Clontarf",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d212688-r504149906-Clontarf_Castle_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,lee770

I have never had to do that in any other hotel.The desserts I have to say were beautiful and delicious - best part of the afternoon.They appeared to not have enough staff on for the number of guests attending afternoon tea which is a real shame. Only when I made brief eye contact with a staff member they would come over and attend. Also, the tables are quite low too - I understand that may be the décor but just it doesn't do it for me.I really had high expectations for this hotel given its reputation for being exquisite and beautiful, but I was let down immensely. €47 per person was not justified.I am sure it is a fantastic hotel to stay in, but I would not be in a rush to go back for afternoon tea.",3,Afternoon Tea Review,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d208232-r508037024-The_Merrion_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,19EmmaLouise88

Are the accommodations in Ireland in general less nice than in other parts of the world? I cannot figure out how this hotel merits so many five-star reviews. I am legitimately puzzled. The service is VERY GOOD--that I cannot fault. However, the facilities are kinda like if you were to go to an Eastern European country and stay at a hotel built pre-communism that has never come back to its former glory. The carpet is dingy, the lighting throughout the hotel is dim and yellow. The spa made me cringe and I left quickly. My bathroom looks like it is out of a hospital, except a hospital bathroom would not have the stained old marble tiles. First I was given a room that had a small industrial iron balcony with a large white blockade. This was to cover the sight of construction below. They quickly switched me (as I said, good service) to another room which, though it looked out on a chipped, painted black wall was much nicer as it had two windows that let in light (my sister later checked in and received my old room, so I didn't escape it). I wanted to get something special for my mother, so I booked her a very pricey ""special suite."" A ""special suite"" is a normal room with a desk blocking the old doorway. Attached is a colossal, semi-furnished room with a very tiny ""fire"", the electric sort that sends up colored mist. We laughed at this. My mother tried (and is trying, as I am still at the hotel) to be nice, since I booked the room to ""give her something special"" and the cost was substantial, but I caught her talking to the front desk and trying to vacate it (she could not, the hotel is fully booked). I am going to tell the whole truth in this review and here it is--I immediately burst into tears and fled to my room and cried while looking at the black, chipped wall. I felt like an absolute failure booking this hotel for my family (I booked a total of four rooms). I FEEL like an absolute failure, as I am still here. Now, it is true in general that I call myself spoiled. I don't live in splendor, but I live very nicely and am used to staying in very nice places. Here, the sheets are nice. The pillows are rather nice. The rest of it--I don't get it. In truth, I would give this hotel two stars for facilities, four or five for service. The food is neither good nor bad. This is the first place I have stayed in Dublin, the fourth in Ireland, and I have to say honestly--I just don't get it.",3,I don't get it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d208232-r509276097-The_Merrion_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Erica D

How great is that? But we didn't stay long. Just liked knowing we could. It is a very traditional place. I thought the rooms were very comfortable and traditionally decorated. The funny thing I noticed is that if you want to blow dry your hair or curl it in the bathroom, it really isn't possible. This is common in England and Ireland.

The staff was some of the best that we've encountered. They were top notch! We had two connecting rooms for our family of five. Not exactly an ideal hotel for little kids but our teens enjoyed the luxury of this hotel. Breakfast at the Cellar was fantastic and the excellent service continued. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were light and airy. Bathrooms were beautifully appointed and well done in white and grey color scheme. One comment that I want to share was that the shower stall was very small (and my husband and I are tiny people). My other comment was that there was no dresser or shelves to store our clothing which is never a deal breaker for me, but just a minor annoyance as it makes unpacking very tricky for two people. The courtyard areas are lovely and if the weather cooperates, it is perfect to sit outside in the afternoon and have tea or an early cocktail. My biggest complaint was that we encountered two different guests who were very rude to the staff at the Merrion. Once upon check in and the other time at breakfast. My teens were actually offended by the rudeness of the guests and they claimed that ""there were too many high maintenance guests"" at the hotel. In both cases, the staff handled the situations very well and it is a good reminder that it is never acceptable to be rude. The location is the best as the hotel in a quieter area of town but close enough to walk to many of the restaurants in town so you never have to call a cab/Uber.

The Cellar restaurant also kindly sent up our food to our room when I had to rush out of the restaurant and specially made me a plain salad to eat when I couldn't stomach anything else (I wish I could have eaten it!).Keeping me from giving it 5 stars:-- The pipes in the toilet are REALLY loud. Every time we used them it would go on for ages afterwards -- this made for an unpleasant experience if you had to wake up to go to the bathroom.-- The steam room and pool were nice but there is no sauna in the spa.

The hotel oozes hospitality coupled with excellent quality in all areas, including bedrooms, restaurant and bar facilities as well as free car-parking, which most certainly is very rare in Dublin! From the moment that guests step into the spacious lobby, they are cordially greeted with a warm friendly smile from each and every one of the receptionists, including the concierge staff. We have been guests in the hotel on numerous occasions and thanks to all the staff, we have enjoyed many happy stays over the years. Each time we arrive, we are amazed how every member of staff can call us by name in such a friendly manner. Mr Sean Reid, Deputy General Manager ensures that he is always on hand to meet and greet all his guests with such warm hospitality. Even though he is such a busy gentleman in every area of the hotel, he always finds the time to have a cosy chat with the hotel guests, especially on match days. Sean is a true Dub supporter, but it must be said that he is to be admired for the greatest respect that he has for every other county teams' supporters. His friendly banter with guests from all parts of the world certainly make everyone's stay a truly delightful experience. With Sean we always find ourselves so warmly welcomed in opulent surroundings with such impeccable service, and an incredibly luxurious stunning ambience. No request, large or small, is ever too much for Sean and the ever efficient staff in each of their own departments, unfailingly deliver quality customer service that exceeds all guests' expectations.The bedrooms are very spacious with double or super king-sized beds, with large luxurious bathrooms. They are tastefully decorated to include mini-bar, and safe, not to mention bathrobes and slippers. Soft duvets and pillows are a real treat for a brilliant night's rest. Breakfast is a wonderful relaxing affair in the Sideline Bistro, again with staff who have been highly trained in their own particular role in the restaurant. Food is divine with an extensive buffet menu. The traditional brown bread is delicious as well as the wide selection of fresh fruit and cereals, coupled with hot breakfast items. Tea/coffee is brought to the table with fresh toast as often as one desires. The dinner menu is a culinary delight with a wide choice to suit everyone's taste.The Executive lounge on the 4th floor adds such tranquility to one's stay. Complimentary newspapers, tea/coffee, soft drinks and fresh fruit are continually replenished to ensure that all guests on this floor truly enjoy the benefits of the 'Executive Rooms'. The additional extras as well as the comfortable armchairs and large screen television are a real treat.The entire staff, who are great ambassadors for the hotel, compliment their exquisite surroundings and the overwhelming experience is certainly one of 5 star luxury. Superpower free wifi adds to the overall classy experience where the whole ambience lends itself to a brilliant relaxing break. Well done once again to all the Staff in the Croke Park hotel.

Our room was on floor 1 (which is actually the second floor) but it was very quiet, even the night after a big match at croke park.The one thing I didn't love was the location (trade off). It was a solid 30 minute walk from downtown. We timed it one night, took 35 to 40 minutes to walk from Christ church. There's not much around the hotel. Bleecker st cafe is a 10 minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee. Some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every 30 min or so. A can from temple bar costs 10 to 12 euros.

It was the BEST hotel we stayed out out of all of the hotels!This is a hidden gem that deserves a HUGE spotlight!!!The hotel is literally right in front of the Croke Park (which is an 84,000 seat stadium where they play Gaelic football). We booked our stay almost a year in advance and lucky for us, the Gaelic championship was going on so we had the chance to meet with locals and travelers and get to know them. It was an unexpected and awesome experience. It is very close to City Center (about 10-15 minute walk) and very close to other places (pubs, restaurants, tour bus, banks, etc.). The rooms (and hotel itself) was lovely! Super clean, very spacious (even the bathroom was spacious!), better than average furniture and actually, an unusually comfortable bed with extremely nice pillows. They had great amenities and more than just the basics.We had a lovely breakfast (all kinds of pastries, breads, jams, cold cuts, cheeses, fresh fruits, different kinds of coffee, yogurt and unlimited toppings (like granola, dried fruit, nuts), packaged granola bars/cookies) and as a traveler, I greatly appreciated the FREE BOTTLED WATER. It was really thoughtful of the company and hotel to provide this to guests. That alone was amazing. The staff was EXCELLENT. When I think of customer service"", the ladies and gents from Croke Park were the prime examples and have set the bar very high for other hotel staff.If we ever return, I am definitely staying here and I HIGHLY recommend that others stay here also.

The Reception staff, whilst not warmly welcoming, ensured we had the information we needed. They ordered our taxis on time. The breakfast was excellent. I love a hotel that provides great breakfasts and include cappuccino-style coffees in the cost (rather than an extra). I love a breakfast that provides loads of fresh fruit, yogurt, seeds, nuts and crunchy granola. My husband went for the cooked bacon, eggs, tomato and toast option and he was very happy with the options. The downside for us was that the hotel is not near the Dublin attractions we wanted to see: Kilmainham Gaol, The Book of Kells, Christ Church Cathedral, Temple Bar etc. We needed a taxi to and from these, each time around a cost of 10-12 Euros. But thinking about that, if we stayed at a hotel where we could walk to these attractions, we would have missed all of the lovely and informative chats we had with the Dublin taxi drivers. All (but one, who wasn't a 'local') of the taxi drivers where friendly and really up for a chat and happy to explain more about the city and about Ireland's history. So, when considering your hotel options, factor the taxi rides into the cost of the hotel room. The Croke Park is a comfortable hotel to stay in, plus you get the bonus of the local flavour in your taxi rides.",4,"Clean, comfortable, great breakfast",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d559524-r506358631-The_Croke_Park-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Annata_CrowsNest

From arrival to departure everything was done without fuss. Small issue with noisy A/C was immediately addressed by a room change. Special thanks to Sandeep and Krischna and the front desk (Sophia) for their help during my stay. The executive lounge was fantastic and has all you need for a continental breakfast. I basically nested there for the day as I had returned from a long haul flight. The coffee machine is a little tempermental and may need a service as it was giving trouble regularly.I stayed in the Sam Maguire suite for one night as it was a special occasion. Again Krischna and the front desk were very helpful here. The bed was extremely comfortable and the toiletries (White & Company) were excellent quality. It was nice to have the space and also the stadium view which is impressive. From this close proximity to the Croke Park stadium one can only imagine the view immediately outside the Colosseum in Rome when the Roman empire was at its height (see Gladiator for nearest modern interpretation). Also on Saturday morning we culd hear the soundchecks from Coldplay which was cool.Went for dinner in the Sideline bar and service was a little slow (as was room service), so these are small things to correct. I walked into the gym and it looked adequate and smelled fresh so it is being kept clean.The only thing missing to make this a ""must stay"" as a family hotel is a swimming pool. Even a 15m swimming pool would suffice, like in London city centre hotels.Underground secure parking is brilliant. Definitely an option for an overnight stay for the Cork hurling matches later in the year.

The level of service is like no other. Upon our early arrival, they noticed the ages of our daughters and gave them their own room connecting to ours at no extra charge. They basically received a king room to themselves. It's busy season too so this was an amazing gesture. The last few days here have been filled with the same kindness and hospitality. I wish I knew the name of the woman who cleans our room, she is the sweetest person. Derek who we spoke with before our morning trip to the Book of Kells was another stand out in my mind, so sweet...like he's known us forever. I could go on and on. The location is just perfect, near the best shopping and away from that awful Temple area. Trinity college is a short walk as are many of the sites that are popular with visitors. There is a pretty little Catholic church almost next door where you can go for mass or have a nice breakfast and coffee in absolute peaceful quiet.

We booked the night before our arrival because our flight was getting in very early & we wanted to be sure we had the room. Apparently, there was a miscue & the hotel thought we were a ""no show"". Well, this amazing staff jumped right on it & had us in a room in no time. They were really concerned that we might be inconvenienced in some way. It went uphill from there - they recognized us when we were in the lobby & asked if there was anything they could do to make our visit more enjoyable. We were amazed by the fact they continued to check on us throughout our 6 night stay. We booked the room through Virtuoso (we use them or AmEx's platinum program which lists a room upgrade, if available, upon check in). The hotel didn't have the upgrade the first night but called a day later & moved us into a junior suite. Really lovely! Each & every employee from the front door to housekeeping is so well trained in this hotel & make every effort to make guests feel special. Joseph is the Guest Relations Manager who does a terrific job of making his guests feel welcome. Rory is the Front Office Manager who we are still talking about. WOW! does he love his job. We watched him interacting with guests & spending more time with us than he really needed to - an affable manager who wants everyone to be treated as special guests who will return again & again. We most certainly will!The level of service here ensures that guests will tell all of their friends when they return home. We certainly did & can't wait to return - which we shall do!Regarding rooms - we stayed in the standard room which really is fine. A wee bit small as they would be in any city. Of course, the suite was luxurious. Could have moved right in. There is a hearty Irish breakfast buffet with wonderful staff. They even made me an iced tea each day! Our favorite treat was afternoon tea with champagne - don't miss it!",5,Fabulous - Thanks To The Staff!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209084-r508665454-The_Westbury-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,RSFLucy

The gallery, bar and dining areas all tingle with a magical atmosphere, especially during the latter half of the week and there can be few finer places to meet for a pre-dinner drink at the Sidecar Bar for a touch of Gatsby in Dublin! Front of House, Food & Beverage and Concierge teams are all first class - they usually anticipate my needs, are prompt, courteous and efficient so well done all.

Staff are exceptionally gracious and go far beyond what is asked for to accommodate guests. My room was comfortable but the bathroom needed updating although the heated towel rack was much appreciated in Dublin’s damp weather. There was a tub with rain shower but no separate shower stall so entering and exiting the shower required climbing over a high tub. My room had plenty of lighting, a large desk and comfortable easy chairs. In-room WIFI was fast and reliable. There is nightly turn down service. Breakfast was above average with a buffet of fruit, yogurt and breads and a variety of made-to-order egg dishes that were very well prepared. However, the dining room was unpleasantly crowded at breakfast most of the week because of a large pharmaceutical company convention.My 5th floor bedroom had a large window that looked out over rooftops. Soundproofing from the hallway was good but rooms on lower floors have windows that face directly into other buildings in the back or onto Grafton Street in the front, which is very noisy. The hotel is in the city center, surrounded by bars and shops. This makes for a noisy environment, particularly in the front of the hotel, which faces down Grafton Street with its rows of bars and hundreds of patrons standing in the street and drinking throughout the evening. You would hear some of this noise if your room faces that street but my room faced the back of the hotel and for most of my week-long stay, it was quiet. However, on my last night, a loud, thumping drumbeat from a party on another street continued past 1:00 AM until I called the front desk. They were very responsive and after deciding it was not coming from Grafton Street, came up to my room to check it out. I was told it was coming from a rear street and they would try to stop it. Within a half-hour, it had quieted down. Whatever the annoyances, the exceptional service certainly compensated. I probably would have appreciated the Westbury even more if I had not stayed first at the elegant, historic (and much quieter) Shelbourne a few blocks away. I am giving it four stars only because I cannot rate it as highly as the Shelbourne.",4,Exceptional Service. Comfortable Room. Attractive Public Spaces.

Booked 2 rooms using points. I was Hilton Diamond at time of booking but only Gold as of arrival date. Arrived at hotel approx 10:30 am. Rooms were not ready, as they were connecting rooms and one of the rooms had a very late checkout for the previous guest.Staff kept us posted as we snoozed the time away in the lobby. Room 324 was ready at 12:45pm. Room 325 still wasn't ready as of 3:45pm, but staff had offered us the use of a different 3rd floor room until 325 was ready. This wasn't necessary, so we didn't take the hotel up on the offer. The signature Doubletree chocolate chip with walnuts cookie tasted a bit different - was it a double chocolate dough instead of the usual (in the US) cookie dough? Good cookie, just not quite the same as I've had in the states. The staff at front desk were excellent, giving us good advice on sites and hop on/off bus.Breakfast was high quality. Honeycomb was a great surprise. Baked goods were very good. We received buffet and also ordered from the menu at no charge.Great location, 50 meters off the River Liffey and near lots of the action - 2-3 minute walk to Halfpenny Bridge. Rooms very well done. This is branded as a boutique hotel under the Hilton umbrella, and that's exactly what it felt like - in a GOOD way. Smaller property, NOT a high volume tour bus type location.Beds were very comfortable as one would expect of a property in this caliber.Overall, a great stay.

When we got to the desk, the chap there asked who arranged for that car? And it was him! He was quite embarrassed and to make it up to us paid for a cab to a restaurant later in our stay. The room on first floor with a view of the river was a bit larger than other rooms and so worth the extra money. Paid to include breakfast and that was well worth it. If you ask for them to make eggs a certain way, they accommodated it so that was quite nice. For us as Americans, the biggest drawback was the bathroom. The flush for the toilet is a metal bit sticking out of the wall and to push it into the wall (for a small person such as myself) meant standing and leaning over toilet to push full body weight on thumb and then you got a pretty weak flush so you had to do this multiple times for not a great result. And the tub (again for a short person) was a challenge to get into to take a shower -- it was up too high and quite a step over and down to reach back to the floor. Maybe if they have a shower stall in a room that is safer and easier.

The hotel was a great welcoming to the beautiful country. First and foremost the staff was wonderful and very friendly. It was also centrally located to all the main attractions which we loved being able to walk every where. One down side to our experience is that our hotel overlooked a roof with a generator so not really what we were hoping for but we didn't spend much time in the hotel anyways. The only thing holding me back from rating 5 stars is that this hotel was a bit overpriced. In total, my husband and I were in Ireland for 2 and a half weeks and this hotel was the most expensive one we stayed in, however not the nicest. The price may be in large part due to it being in Dublin however there were far fancier hotels we stayed in across the country at a better value.

The concierge was full of good ideas and routes, the restaurant staff at breakfast were always smiling. The front desk were helpful but a little remote and spoke to you as children.

The bed was comfortable, and there is even a menu offering different types of pillows! We enjoyed the Hairy Lemon pub and Super Miss Sue (awesome fish and chips) - both of which are literally around the corner from the hotel.My (admittedly minor) quibbles:1. The website photos are misleading. The lobby was darker and had just a couple of armchairs - no sofas. The ""classic"" room was MUCH smaller than it appears in the photo - we could barely walk around the bed.2. Showers were less fun because the shower curtain was hung less than 20 inches from the wall. A curved shower curtain rod would transform the whole experience.3. The shower was in a deep bathtub, and there was no grab bar on the wall. My in-laws had difficulty stepping in and out of the tub. They tried holding onto the towel rod, but found it was already disconnected from the wall (apparently previous guests had the same problem and pulled too hard on the towel bar).This hotel gets the major things right and is a good value.

Our cab driver brought us to the Morgan straight from the airport. We were tired when we arrived and were happy to learn from the front desk person that our room was available for early check-in. We brought our 2 pieces of luggage with us onto the lift and went to our room (401) to freshen up. The room was very tiny, basically enough room for our double bed. There was no AC, but luckily a fan which would come in handy later. The bath was even smaller, with a shower so small I almost needed to stand at attention while inside. The room did have a closet area and nightstand and a wall mounted TV. One other quirk was the power in the room. My phone needed charging desperately and I plugged it in mid day and again overnight. It only charged from 5% to 20%. I thought perhaps something was wrong with my phone, but when we picked up a car during our second day and plugged the phone in it charged normally. Not sure if it was just the room or the whole hotel, but that was definitely strange. I have seen pictures of other rooms in this hotel that look great, so I think we just happened to get stuck with one of their duds.Now the good news. The hotel is located right in bustling Temple Bar, a fun place to be for dinner and nightlife in Dublin. If was also located close to Trinity College and a nice walk to Dublin Castle and St. Stephen's Green (via Grafton St), where you will discover more things in terms of shopping, restaurants and of a historical nature. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. The hotel had a vibe to it that reminded me of the W chain in the US. The hotel was also very well maintained and clean.While the Temple Bar area is noisy - especially on a Saturday night - we kept our windows open to help cool the room down until later at night, when we had to close them to shut out some of the noise outside. Luckily we had that fan or else it probably would not have been a very comfortable night for us. When we came back to Dublin on the back end of the Ireland portion of our trip, we chose to stay at another hotel in the Temple Bar area. So based on my experience, there are better options. To me, the Morgan was too much of a mixed bag to recommend.",2,One Night in Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209078-r509146187-The_Morgan-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Jeff W

It still has its great location - step out the doors and your in the midst of everything on Fleet Street - but has lost quite a lot of its coolness. Apparently the owners are cashing in, and not re-investing in the hotel. The staff is nice, but at least two in the reception where claiming ""I am very new, so I don't know"", so checking in/out was a long and cumbersome and quite disorganized exercise. Our room was not ready until 4pm (our room was not ready yet, but then we got another room instead), which was also a let down. The room (we stayed in a junior suite facing Fleet St) was spacious, but worn down. Big cracks around ceiling lights, one light in the bathroom was broken and one bedside lamp did dot work (and couldn't be fixed by the staff). The bed was tired and super-soft (not to my liking), and the chair in the room was covered with a sheet to cover up the wear&tear. Only one TV, located close to the sofa, made it impossible to watch TV in bed (possible to live without of course) but good storage/wardrobe and good with a empty fridge (given that Tesco is just opposite the hotel). As mentioned, the location is VERY central for those who want to party. Impressive sound proofing though meant that if you closed the windows it got very quiet. However, then it gets very warm, and there was no AC - just a fan outside the sleeping area. The breakfast was non-impressive, with seating at large, shared 6-8pax tables. So, all-in-all, the location is great for partying, the hotel is from my perspective loosing its cool and is in a pretty worn-down state.",3,"Good for party weekend, but not a great hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d209078-r507299532-The_Morgan-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Krister Z

When we did check in we were a bit disappointed with the room - the hotel has a quirky style which would've been lovely when it was new but is now pretty dated and on the shabby side. The bedding and towels were more grey than white and the towels were frayed & shredded. There was an oversized (too big for the room) arm chair with a similarly grey cover with holes in and all of the lamp shades were wonky. The lighting was poor, particularly in the bathroom - not great for 2 girls getting ready to go out. The shower was over the bath & because of the slope at the end you have to do a yoga style back bend to get your hair wet, the angle couldn't be adjusted & just flops down, plus the shower screen doesn't extend far enough so soaked the floor, toilet & loo roll. There was no water & one bruised apple. It didn't bother us as we were exhausted the 1st night & out until 2am the 2nd, but there is a very loud nightclub on the ground floor that we could hear loud & clear even though we requested a quiet room.

Room service food was good, and delivered well within the stated wait time. The bathroom was a bit of a let down. The shower curtain had mold on it (although a very tiny amount, but still visible), and the plug stopper in my bathroom did not work. I had to reach in and try to dig it out with a pen, and then with my hands, otherwise my shower would turn into a bath. Each day the room cleaner would put the stopper back in the bath so I had to dig it back out again when I wanted to shower - yuck! I was pretty put off by the end of my stay.

Then have plenty of free space, enough to fit another double bed if they wanted. Rooms also include a big bathroom (although the shower is not as powerful as I would like), a refrigerator and tea & coffee making facilities. Free wifi is also included in the room rate.I did not eat or use the leisure facilities so I cannot comment on these.Although Bord Gais is directly across the road I found that there is not much around the hotel except bars, and is a decent 10-15min walk to O'Connell Street so a bit out of the way. Aviva Stadium is also roughly a 20min walk away. Location is the only let down I had but it really was a fantastic hotel!I would stay here again not problem especially if there was something on in Bord Gais.",4,A one night stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d550920-r510707957-Clayton_Hotel_Cardiff_Lane-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,duck49er

That's where the conveniences end! Apart from one efficient waiter, the service was slow and disorganised, there appeared to be a total lack of communication among the six or seven members of staff who came to our table over the course of almost two hours. A group of work colleagues, all ladies, arrived for our reservation before 5.30pm for a much anticipated evening out. This was the third visit for some of the group. 20 minutes later the Manager noticed that we were still sitting waiting for service and was most apologetic. He gave us two bottles of Prosecco which were very welcome although given the heat of the room we would also have appreciated the jugs of water we'd asked for on arrival (they arrived at around 6.30). An hour after arrival we finally got starters and drinks and it was close to an hour and a half by the time we got our main courses. At 7.10 we had to make the decision to cancel the rest of the order and leave for the theatre. For those who had decided to skip the starter and enjoy dessert, this was a big disappointment. The icing on the cake however was when the Manager ran out onto the street after us and accused us of not fixing up the bill, despite the fact that we had paid his colleague in cash and left a €30 tip (this was an act of convenient mathamatics and not a reflection of the service provided!). He then offered all sorts of future compensation but I for one will never return to the Clayton Hotel, life is too short to willingly repeat mistakes. And while we were given the Prosecco and a discount off the bill for our inconvenience, it was never about freebies or prices, good management should realise that. As for the food, it's difficult to comment, it took second place behind all the other chaos. However I can say that the croquettes were delicious although a little cool for my taste (this could have been again due to the serving staff and not a reflection on the chef), the risotto was delicious. So, if you don't have any other plans perhaps give the food a try but expect to wait, and wait for it.",2,Stir Restaurant Pre Theatre Chaos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d550920-r508327325-Clayton_Hotel_Cardiff_Lane-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,moofisch

The restaurant staff were very friendly and my son made friends with the Restaurant Manager. All staff were helpful ensuring our food was cooked correctly and that we were happy with it. The Club Vitae was open to us as guests and the pool although only 22 metres long was adequate for my son to practice his swimming. The gym facilities looked good although we did not use them. The only gripe I had was when I wanted to book an additional room for the Saturday night, the room rate quoted was very expensive and I felt they could have taken into account the 6 nights we had already booked and paid for. Car parking is available at a secure public car park a 5 minute walk away and a discount ticket is available from the hotel reception however like all car parks in Dublin, it was quite expensive.",4,Very helpful and friendly staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d550920-r507482442-Clayton_Hotel_Cardiff_Lane-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,sueatno3

We didn't eat in the restaurant or use the pool so can't comment but cheap eats are available just around the corner (see Munchies review).

Great staff. Comfortable hotel rooms and great location . I did notice that toiletries were very sparce this time. Shampoo and soap provided- but call to reception if you need shower caps ? Surely cut backs should result in lower prices? Not so I'm afraid. Breakfast has improved I think. Fresh bread and hot food even for latecomers.  What really disappointed me this time was the bar food. We were in a hurry and just asked for sandwich and some chicken wings. The sandwich was smothered with mustard and arrived in a box with no garnish whatsoever. The chicken wings were inedible I'm afraid. No taste at all.

Guinness storehouse, Kilmainham Goal, Penny bridge,... etc. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything you want/need. To my opinion they offer real comfort with an ironing board/tea service,.. We had a room with a view towards the Christenchurch which was a big pro.  Only thing I missed was a little mini bar. I do want to point out that most hotels who provide breakfast have a small offer. But here it was a big breakfast with a lot of variety. And normally I don't speak very highly about breakfast because I do love my breakfast and it's not easily to please me with that but this one just ticked all the boxes. Everything is also very clean and hygienic. Furthermore I also would definitely recommend to visit O'Neills bar and Elephant & Castle restaurant. O'Neills bar is a perfect typical Irish pub with live music.. typical Irish dancing and they have a food buffet bar with great food and a variety of beers available.

We were heading to a big game in town so the Skylon is an obvious choice for lunch beforehand.We have been visiting the Skylon for many years. The food and service was always great. However, a number of months ago, they decided to no longer provide a carvery option for lunch. That in itself is not an issue as long as the kitchen and servers can work together efficiently to get orders taken, and food delivered, efficiently.Unfortunately, you may have seen on my previous review since the upgrade that the service and food was very disappointing overall. We hoped for a better experience on Sunday, but it wasn't to be.We arrived at 1.20 and met friends who had got there before us. Their lunch order took 40 minutes to arrive. The food was only warm, not hot. Our lunch took 55 minutes to be delivered. We almost had to cancel it as it was simply taking too long.It's hard to know where the problem is because there are LOTS of people serving in the restaurant. My guess is that the problem's in the kitchen. The fact is, the food was taking far too long to be delivered to lots of tables, not just ours.As mentioned, the Skylon is well located to capture trade from people attending games and concerts in Croke Park. However, they don't seem to be aware of this, and are certainly not taking advantage of it.When our food eventually arrived, it was fine. Certainly no better than what was previously available in the carvery, so the overall experience was poorer given how long it took.To the Restaurant Manager, my feedback is... Must Try Harder!Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself.",2,Disappointing Service for Sunday Lunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d206795-r510455780-Dublin_Skylon_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,FD85114

The significance of Fleet Street is the this the main happening area of the city with countless restaurants and pubs one after another from the end that we stayed for a half a dozen blocks. In other words, if your vacation involves wanted to plenty of food and drink options within an easy walk of the hotel, this is a great place. Fleet Street is one way and only allows some cars and taxis out front. Further, only the first two blocks are open to a few cars, otherwise it is pedestrians only. AS suggested in advance, we took the Airport Express 700 bus from the airport (7 Euro one way or 12 Euro round trip). The bus lets you out on the O'Connell Street bridge from which it is maybe an easy quarter mile walk to the hotel. Since this bus is an express few stops from the airport. O'Connell Street bridge was the second stop (maybe 10-12 minutes walk (easy), depending on the traffic lights. On the way back to the airport we also took the 700 Airport Express, the return pickup point was even closer. Just around the corner off Fleet Street - maybe a 100 yards and less than 5 minutes. Arriving at the hotel, reception could not have been more pleasant. We arrived around 8 AM and they allowed us early check in, which was nice as we dropped bags and were off immediately into the city. Throughout our stay, we found the front desk staff so friendly and informative. They helped us greatly in knowing where to go and how to most easily get there. They were an amazingly wonderful part of our stay. The rooms too were more than perfect to meet our needs. Truthfully, we were only in them to sleep. However, for anyone that wanted to spend more time within them for a rest or to watch TV, they were nicely furnished and comfortable. All rooms come with ear plugs. Let's be real, this hotel is in a party part of the city. Friday through Sunday may be a bit noisier with people in the streets having fun. We did not hear music from any of the nearby pubs, but could hear people when in our room. However, although my other half did use earplugs a couple times to help sleep, I did not. I had no sleeping issues during the eight nights we stayed. I am not lying when I share that over two dozens restaurants and two dozen pubs can be found within a quarter mile radius of the hotel. If you extend the distance to even a mile, you have more different choice than you could exploit if you ate somewhere different twice a day for three weeks. If you do not want great Irish cuisine every meal (but who wouldn't), you will find a Hard Rock Cafe, TGIF, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, and Starbucks in the immediate block area. We had the breakfast option as part of our stay. The Toast Restaurant is off the lobby. It is GREAT. A buffet style restaurant with great fresh food - eggs (scrambled, fried, pancakes, waffles, sausage, bacon, ham, black pudding, white pudding, hot or cold cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurts, coffee, tea, juices, milk, fresh breads, rolls and muffins. This was also my favorite meal each day, getting us ready for a full day in the city or out in the country side. The pubs are great. Most have music, frequently live entertainment, and so close to our base of operations. Actually Busker's is a pub right in the hotel, which had great entertainment and cannot beat the convenience. Do not want to eat out? Literally directly across the street from the front of the hotel is a market, which has essentially any essential as well as fresh fruit, fresh baked goods, sandwiches, etc. Also, want to have a drink (beer, wine, other) in your room? You can get what you like right in this market. Need to exchange money? They can exchange at the hotel or at a nearby bank. However, they will honestly share that these will be the ""worst"" rates of exchange. Rather on day one, reception directed us around the corner to an Official Exchange Center - maybe three minute walk. We went here several times to trade dollars for Euros. How perfect? We also saw a number of attractions from the Molly Malone statue to the Archaeology Museum to Dublin Castle To Dublina to Christ Church to the Business Storehouse to the Jameson Distillery and more attractions. All of these were ""walkable"" from this hotel. Again perfect. We too took two days bus excursions out into the country side. The tour bus stop was only a block up from the hotel, less than 10 minutes walk. Again, making the Temple Bar Hotel a perfectly excellent base of operations. We loved our stay at Temple Bar and in Ireland. We would delay love to return. You will definitely have a great time in Dublin and the Temple Bar Hotel can help assure your needs are realized.",5,Perfect Residence in the Happening Area of Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214554-r502594095-Temple_Bar_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,ChiefGuru

The breakfast could be better for the price (it is not included in the cost) as the selection is minimal however, as stated, the service was good.

The experience was enjoyable and memorable however (more so for me I think). It is located in the centre of shops, restaurants and attractions and I would definitely recommend getting the 27 euro bus pass as it enabled us to go everywhere for the 3 days we were there- so much easier than paying for a ticket each time. I would also recommend going to the Guinness factory and the hotel is very close to this attraction. As it is in the centre we assumed it would be noisy however they provide ear plugs to help sleep. Overall, it was a great trip and we enjoyed coming back to this hotel at the end of a busy day!",4,Lively hotel in the centre of everything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214554-r508499814-Temple_Bar_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,Isaac P

While the Temple Bar/Fleet Street area may be considered ""touristy,"" and we usually prefer to stay off the beaten path, we wanted to make the most of our short 3 day stay in Dublin.We took the Airlink 747 shuttle bus from the airport which was about a 30 minute ride and the Fleet Street stop was about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Really easy! We arrived early in the morning and were offered complimentary coffee. They didn't have a room ready but offered us a €30 upgrade to check in early, which we opted to do so we could freshen up after our flight and explore the city.The room was clean and spacious. We were a little concerned since we were given complimentary ear plugs, but we never had an issue with noise, even on Friday and Saturday night. My only complaint is that the toiletries provided were shampoo and body wash. This is a total nitpick since I usually pack my own, but this time I didn't and I could have definitely used some conditioner! Especially with the misty and windy weather in Ireland! The hotel is really perfectly located. It's toward the end of Fleet Street, so only a 2 minute walk to bars and restaurants, but it's just far enough removed not to be super loud. We really enjoyed how central it was and had a great visit overall!",5,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186605-d214554-r503446618-Temple_Bar_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,flutterrutter

When checking in I was told that an extra €50 would be added as a deposit for the room but would be returned on the card as soon I we checked out, now this shocked me as the room cost €279 I would have thought that would have been enough. The room wasn't overly big we stayed in 426 didn't hear any noise which was good and slept fine. The receptionist had offered breakfast at a discount of €17 which we declined, personally I thot after spending €279 there would be more than a €3 discount. Reading through other reviews I see the hotel offered ice creams, little extras in the room which didn't seem to be the case in our experience.
