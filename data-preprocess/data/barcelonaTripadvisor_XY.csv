0,perfect place to stay in we spent nights there clean spacious rooms good service the staff were very helpful and spoke good english i recommand definitely worth the money we will visit again,1
1,we are a family of we stayed at casa camper for nights and thoroughly enjoyed it we had a suite which has a double bed sofa bed and hammock which slept and then a standard room that had a double bed and a separate which had a single in it the buffet worked a treat the kids loved it there is a basement area with a bar seating and pool tables the roof terrace has an outdoor seating and honesty bar and a rainforest shower having never been to barcelona this waste perfect place to stay,1
2,it truly felt like coming home when we came through the doors of casa camper we were just a wee bit afraid that things might have changed since the marvelous susanna martin had left the helm but she had trained the staff well and our beloved georgina was there to welcome us and show us that casa camper was just as fantabulous as ever having been in the air forever with layovers all i wanted was food and protein and georgina led me right to their clever where i scarfed down a yummy sandwich wrap etc feeling revived we headed up to our lovely room and then out the door to get our first glimpse of las ramblas which is so close casa camper is beautifully located and the staff goes out of its way to give you info on wherever to want to go and whatever you want to see and the chef well words ca even begin to describe the breakfasts but if you go away hungry then there is something seriously wrong with you all i can say is that if there was a casa camper in every city where we travelled and georgina could clone herself then i would never have to research our hotel choices again this is a in my book,1
3,this hotel is ideally placed within reasonable distance of all the major attractions and just a stones throw from las ramblas the hotel staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble the facility of a free help yourself refreshment facility for most of the day was very welcome after a hot day sight seeing and the rooftop terrace with honesty bar was lovely and a great place to relax with friends before after dining hotel itself was spotlessly clean and all room equipment and fittings were in good working definitely stay here again of we return to barcelona,1
4,casa camper barcelona is a lovely hotel it is centrally located the rooms are very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and ca do enough for you the breakfast is varied and you can help yourself to soft drinks and snacks at any time during the day on the roof terrace they have an honesty bar which works very well we only stayed three nights but would happily have stayed only criticism is that there are only two of these hotels the other being in berlin and there is definitely room for many more of them,1
5,our room was lovely comfortable and clean we could walk almost everywhere breakfast had many options and was delicious there is food and drink complimentary available a good portion of the day and the desk was knowledgeable and friendly very consumer friendly and well worth the few extra euros for all the convenience and comfort,1
6,we stayed at this hotel and will never stay anywhere else in barcelona again service is beyond rooms are beautify and rooftop is to die for with only rooms this is genuinely a boutique hotel bliss,1
7,casa camper is truly special and unique i spent nights here and it became home i had the corner suite and it was incredible space comfort light filled and the most heavenly bed did i say the bed yes that bed is the best i have had in all my team is amazing and they make a stay at this property feel full of warmth just incredible enzo francesco valentina morgan isa and so many more i can not remember everyone name but truly the team here is a gift plus the pepe manager of the hotel is so breakfast is excellent and the wonderful team member from argentina who prepares the meals is so so kind and will get you anything you want eggs pancakes whatever the rooftop terrace of this property honest bar and hours snack area really make casa camper feel like it is your home this is my new home when i return to barcelona thank you casa camper team,1
8,the location is very convenient you only a short walk to la ramblas the desk staff was nice but the manager was useless the air conditioning was working but no one came to fix it the first night i tried to open the window for air but it is so loud all night long from the foot traffic below when the manager finally came to my room hours later after i complained a time he was rude and tried to insinuate that it was my fault that the ac was working as opposed to a dead battery in the wall switch i would not stay there again,0
9,having booked this hotel as part of a package and then looking at the reviews in detail we were very apprehensive before we went regarding the comments about being unsafe however we really loved our stay in hotel alba the hotel is in that it is a little tired in its decor in places however the room was of a very good size there was a fridge chairs suitcase stand and a comfy double bed the bathroom was also of a very good size everywhere was neat and clean the rooms were cleaned every day with new towels and new bedding every day which was unnecessary but lovely all the same the cleaners and reception staff were very friendly and helpful we even got a little present of turr√≥n as we left the location is superb minutes from the metro liceu and from las ramblas yes this does make it loud outside at night but if you do the same amount of exploring and walking as us in the you will sleep regardless plus the room has great air conditioning that we did even open the windows or use the balcony even with the weather being yes the side street is probably used for certain indecent activities but this is spain and the streets even this one is busy at gone and there are plenty of people walking about the hotel is keycard access only and there was always a friendly smiley face at the desk to great you when,1
10,this hotel promised a lot however we had a few hiccups the front desk ladies were lovely and extremely helpful however the owner is an elderly gentleman who got involved in a dispute we had i was unable to pay with my travel credit card loaded with euros as it came up on the payment screen with the option to pay in my jo currency i said no as i did have any of my home currency on the card just euros but they would accept it i had to go down the road and get cash out costing me fees instead of using my card like i normally would in every other place it seems like the owner runs his business before the computer was invented with piles of folders behind the desk with all the paperwork i felt sorry for the girls working there another issue we had was that our room was in another part of the building so we had to pass through two locked doors with difficult locks to get to our room we also had no way of looking outside as we had double windows open one to reveal more frosted glass which was very claustrophobic the room itself was fine although the handheld shower was a pain,0
12,hostel in itself was clean and tidy and the night manager was what i can only imagine was the cleaner as he was the only one with keys decided to use my bank cards which i stupidly left in the room and do some online shopping the day manager refused to accept this was the case even though i had messages from my bank and told me had been in the although the room was cleaned and the bed made so they try and rob you but at least they clean your room would not recommend as this ruined our whole stay,0
13,we decided to go to barcelona at the last moment so it was almost imposible to find a room the hostal paris solved the problem although they only had a room with a shared bathroom everyday the bathroom was clean we never had a problem with a busy bathroom the checkin was good and the employees were very helpful and attentive the hostal is close to everything and public transportation is very accesible near food shops pharmacy bus stop metro station important site seeing everything is close,1
15,good things good location ner subway and la rambla quite cheap hotel bathroom quite fresh and they cleaned the room everyday friendly staff cons our specific room had a not so modern design with old furnitures and had not been renovated for many years also very noicy from the streets outside and the other hotel rooms not soundproof at all but this mainly bothered us during the weekend and not the weekdays when you use the bathroom there is zero soundproof for the rest of the hotel get what you pay for and we think it worked quite well since we wanted something cheap and central,0
16,we slept five nights it near the main touristic street la rambla good public transport close to the beach its very clean very very kind and friendly staff we have a wifi all time in the room only thing i do understand is that room has balcony but you cant step on it because you only have big window but no door d maybe its because the safety,1
17,this was an answer provided by hostel after arriving to the spot with booking confirmation code and pin received from maybe it is not entirely hostel fault that overbooking occurred room was booked hour before arrival due to missed flight but still it happened around the midnight for super tired person or maybe it is a policy of the hostel anyway not the experience i would wish for traveling i wish to believe that confirmation of booking means that i have a roof over my head otherwise we screwed,0
18,i searched in for a reasonable price hotel in barcelona and one of those oprions was hotel barbara i booked it as a hotel but when i entered to my room i felt i decieved it was not a hotel but was just a hostel and a very dirty noisy smelly one i never had a quite time there and the smell of cigrattes was in my room all the never recomend it because if i wanted a hostel i could choose too many better options in the town,0
19,clean friendly very central wifi was great our room was newly done only one thing was our shower had a shower curtain not a train smash we already booked and paid for another hotel otherwise we would gone back there after our cruise since you are only going to sleep there it is great value for money,1
20,the location is good but the services are very poor the air conditioning was not functioning only in our room the smell in the bathroom was awful the receptionist told us we will have the ac repaired but it remained the same for days so they told us to just open the window the cleaning service was very poor,0
21,i would like to leave a comment about your hotel i have to say that i am really disappointed we are the very first room in the hotel as soon as you come up the stairs for the reception i can hear every single conversation in the reception and doors slamming all night long it says in your website that we have air con and hair dryer that not true the air con if you need to adjust it you have to go to the reception and they would change for you during the night i was hot and then cold and i did want to go the the reception at in the morning to change my ac as you can imagine the hair dryer we have to go the the reception and get one that is shared with at least or other rooms there are no windows at all nothing was saying in your website about the absence of windows there is barely a door between the room and the toilet which is very uncomfortable the shower is awful the doors barely close is very small and some of the functions are not working the tv is literally so high almost on the sealing that if i am in bed i can not see anything i can already tell you it the first and the last time i will be staying in your hotel,0
22,can here for a day break before my husband undergoes surgery and wont be able to travel awful hotel dirty and dusty room hairs in the bathtub mould on the room wall and bathroom and worst part the ac in our room does work,0
24,very good hotel i would rate it stars if the wall wasnt so thin u can hear every single world happen next rooms and specially if you are in the ground floor in addition there is no refrigerator in rooms,1
25,good location with easy access to metro all staff were very friendly and helpful from start to there was only flat pillow per bed we stayed four nights and old towels and rubbish was taken out or toilet roll renewed for the whole time we stayed i had to go downstairs to reception twice to ask the receptionist to get us towels and toilet very basic things in my seemed annoyed when i went down the first day that it had been done by accommodation staff yet it happened again the following day again nice clean basic rooms great power in the work nearby acted as alarm clocks at most mornings and people coming in an out of other rooms on the corridor could be heard,0
28,we visited the gran hotel barcino early july for three nights the location is fantastic right in the middle of the gothic quarter we had a room on the second floor it was simple and clean and had floor to ceiling windows that opened to a small balcony gorgeous we did not pay for breakfast as there are so many local cafe the staff were really friendly and the safe only costs euros a night to hire other reviews mention the noise yes it is noisy at night especially friday and saturday night but after a few estrella and mojito i was flat out so it was an issue i would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be going back,1
29,visited for nights as a group of females in mid july the location of this hotel is absolutely excellent can not be faulted right in the heart of the gothic quarter with numerous caf√©s bars restaurants and shops all within a stones throw within walking distance of las ramblas the beach and we also walked to the sagrada familia the latter took about minutes but was a pleasant walk through barcelona the room was basic with single beds but was clean spacious had a large bathroom and a small balcony the safe is a night and is payable on staff on reception were extremely helpful when we struggled to check in for our flight online also a taxi to the airport from here is approx and takes minutes there is one downside to this hotel and that the noise if you sleep well like us then this will not be a problem but if not then remember your earplugs all in all a basic clean hotel in an excellent location with fab reception staff would highly recommend,1
30,booked through hotwire big mistake this time since hotel web had better price and included breakfast we got a nice room almost on top floor not very big but nice and clean buffet breakfast was good with a perfect choice for us to staff in the reception very helpful with all kind of information it not situated that close to ramblas but we like to walk and feel a city so it was ok,1
31,i stayed for nights in this hotel great location on the corner of la rambla many restaurants and shops in front of metro station and min walking to room is old and dusty the ac is too noisy the bed is hard and not comfort at all and the staff is not friendly,0
32,i am delighted i booked the monegal it is right on the plaza catalyuna only steps away from the ramblas this is the area you want to be in the hotel is basic no frills small rooms butperfect ofr me for a day stay it is clean and quiet at a good price there is a very generous breakfast offered as well i would certainly stay here again as i hope to visit this glorious city again,1
33,since years i was staying in your hotel after opening it was really good value for money in a perfect location and really im the centre location is still great but despite of that everything else worsen neither the rooms or the hotel has undergone any renovation or replacement the walls are dirty and full of spots in the restaurant as well need some new paint the furniture is partly broken and need some paint or replacement as well the included breakfast is a great idea and used to be really nice but now the area for breakfast is dirty nothing is refilled flies everywhere the handle of the breadcontainer is broken etc why did you stop it that the guest select one pastry or sandwich from the bar why did you stop that the guest orders his coffee from the bar and serve now bad filter coffee in a thermos during our days stay the bed linen got changed only once probably because we asked the floor in the room and bathroom was not cleaned at all in those days the staff working at reception was not really helpful neither interested to make our stay and time in barcelona to a good experience also i booked a double room and we got a mini tiny room on the evacuation plan this room was asssinged as a single room but reception said it is a double room and showed again no effort to give any alternatives i am really disappointed,0
34,we spent night out of intended on this hotel because it was so noisy and very dirty the ceiling in the batroom was moldy the bed mattress smelled of vomit and the drinking glasses were not washed at all from the previous guests after one night we cancelled the rest of our stay and moved to a different hotel disgusting place,0
35,the hotel is located near the place de catalunya which is just a walking distance from la ramba marina sagrada familia and many other tourist attractions you can leave your luggage at the reception and the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful they borrowed us a phone charger and gave some paracetamol late on a saunday evening when shops were closed there is a restaurant next door where the breakfast is served it basic but good and includes water milk and cereals croissant bread ham cheese and fruit,1
37,this hotel is in a perfect location with a a very modern stylish the rooms are small claustrophobic made all the more difficult by very poor lighting this occasion our refrigerator did not function our air conditioning was below par management offered no solution except by sending a supervisor up to see us who could not speak were evident on the lip of the bath suggesting a poor level of to not having a functioning refrigerator we requested an ice bucket for our wine hotel does not have an ice one should have the capacity to communicate in spanish in order to make any level of communication ie complaint successful all in all one had the impression that guests were secondary to managements expectations other words the guests did not all the places that we have stayed in around the world this was the very disappointing end to our holiday in spain leaving a bad taste in our memory john e,0
38,booked the hotel because of its location which is ok the rooms were v small for the price in our first room there was black mould around the bath the view from the window was a brick wall there was construction work going on room service was poor pillow case changed in such a way that it was not put on properly causing crease and discomfort pillow in cupboard had been cleaned and were smelly and unusable bathroom accessories not replaced towels not changed room window left open during day presumably to save on ac costs letting in mosquitoes that bit causing considerable discomfort ac itself was weak and were hit in miss some grumpy some helpful,0
39,at arrival we got some confused information that the first night our booking had been changed to a nearby hotel if we accepted these changes we were promised a compensation for this inconvenience the hotel also assured us that everything was taken care of no need for payment etc at the spare hotel despite the assurance from sansi diputaci√≥ we were requested to pay at check out from the spare hotel both for the stay and the breakfast both already payed for at return to sansi diputaci√≥ no one had any knowledge about the the discussions additional transport etc took significant amount of time and energy despite repeated contact from both our side and the hotel has not responded or given any additional explanations or apologies and we never saw any breakfast that you can add to your stay is not worth the money save this and buy your breakfast at some nearby caf√© also recommend to avoid this hotel due to the customer treatment,0
40,i had booked this hotel a few months before the visit once i arrived they told me there were no rooms for me as they accidentally overbooked now this is annoying but i know all hotels do it so i ca fault them for this they did give us free drinks and taxi us to another hotel relatively close by they had told me to get a receipt from the other hotel for breakfast so that they can refund me too this was all sounding great even gave me a card with a number to call in the morning so they could arrange a taxi to take our bags back over and put them in the room for morning comes around i get my receipt call the number on the card and i met with this number has not yet been assigned to an agent the staff at the illunion hotel were fantastic and helped get in touch with the sansi hotel only to find out that they had no record of me needing a room or for them to pick up my stuff after a bit of back and forth and the sansi staff calling a manager they realised they were supposed to give me a room and pick us up we dropped our bags off and headed out for the day the sansi hotel is in a great location minute walk to the docks upon returning to the hotel we checked in and i asked about the refund,0
41,hotel staff were very friendly and helped us out when expedia cancelled our booking without our knowledge they found us a room and kept the price of our original booking the room was great and included air con it is a bit far from the city so iif i was travelling to barcelona again i probably stay a bit closer to las ramblas,1
42,nice and cosy small hotel at barri gothic nice and helpfull personnel hours of reception close to rambla clean but small rooms just in the midle of the best of barca old building with ancient athmospere,1
44,i really loved my stay here friendly desk staff spacious room with equally spacious bathroom a great place to stay located behind the barcelona cathedral in the center of the gothic quarter a two minute walk to la,1
45,we booked our room at the hotel through secret rooms and were promised a star hotel in a central hotel is definitely not star the rooms are very dated and small and are desperately in need of refurbishment what was supposed to be a double bed was singles pushed are a few positives the staff at the hotel are very polite and friendly the location of the hotel is excellent within walking distance of the beach and most major attractions unfortunately this does compensate for the hotels faults our room was cheap for the nights we stayed i would stay here again,0
47,this is a very nice hotel on a reasonable price the location is good in terms of interesting sights and metro stops although the hotel is located on the top of a hill which might be an issue for people with difficulty walking there is a flat walk to a metro station about min away i would recommend this hotel of a nice quiet stay,1
48,i was visiting barcelona for nights for a hotel was down from approx a night to approx a night so i went with that despite it being a bit further from my conference than i have arrival i was pretty pleased i had paid a night there is nothing wrong with the hotel inside etc but it certainly would have been worth that staff member on reception was friendly dropped my bags off an popped out for food i returned around hoping to get some sleep ready for day of the am i was still trying the hotel is based on the corner of a busy road with junctions and a set of traffic city is very busy with mopeds which are of course fairly loud and with the lights you get them pulling off with the noise of the nights of this and upon my conference finishing i decided there was no point staying for another bad nights sleep before flying home the next day at additional cost to the wasted nights cost of around and the additional to change my flights i was left out of pocket it found be fair to say the lack of sleep impacted my a little bit narked that when i went downstairs to tell the reception lad i was leaving a night early because of the noise from the road he just nodded and said like leaving bad reviews but given the location alongside the road this hotel would be worth avoiding,0
50,we looked at a dozen hotels before selecting the regencia colon located next to its upscale sister the colon for a fraction of the took a taxi from the airport for and were dropped off at the square steps away from the front of the hotel i was concerned about other hotels located on closed narrow hidden streets and was relieved to see the regencia so close and visible from the street and fact that is the beauty and genius of this hotel it is metres from the main square within seconds you are in the middle of everything that is barcelona we arrived and walked straight down to the beach mins but it felt even shorter as we wandered through the gothic quarter down past the pier and onto sandy rambla and lunch at the boqueria were mins away so is the open public square placa reial where we had dinner it was a longer walk to the sagrada the next day mins but time passed quickly as we strolled up passeig de gracia to view the architecture and visit the shops next time we take the metro back from the sagrada to placa de catalunya the location was key as we came back to the hotel for late afternoon siestas before heading out for this is a review of the hotel not a travel guide and so let me say that was made very easy and welcoming by anselmo we were in room right above the hotel regencia,1
54,the hotel offers adequate rooms in a good location central close to transport shopping and various sites big minus we were charged twice for our two night stay we paid cash upon checking out and then our credit card was charged a few days later we are now aud plus card fees out of pocket if staying here be careful re payments also breakfast was crap,0
55,this hotel was a great find in the city of barcelona we were so well located to shopping restaurants and bars city sights and the beach we took public transport to and from the airport which was so easy we were also able to walk a lot which is a great way to discover the city we felt nothing but safe throughout our stay they have a hour desk and you have to buzz in during the late hours if you wish they can keep your passports in a safe free of charge while the furnishings are older the hotel is very well kept the room was clean we stayed in a private room with a full bathroom our room was basic two towels two bars of soap and a fan what else do you really need though all staff at the hotel were more than helpful a special thanks to marc antoni was so kind and friendly on a future trip to bcn i have no doubt where i will be staying,1
57,i was not happy with the lack of cleanliness for this hotel the cleaning staff did not change the sheets or pillow cases once in my night stay even when i pulled the sheets off the bed and put them on the floor with the dirty towels they were put right back on the bed each time the bathtub was moldy and would drain the water neither did the sink the elevators did not work much at all i ended using the stairs for fear i would get stuck our window view was of a dirty alley and brick wall the breakfast was decent enough i would not stay again at all,0
59,this is just a to my previous paragraph on serennia all went well the person met us with the keys on time we had a great week the apartment was spotlessly clean the balconies gave a lovely view of barcelona street activity we have already booked serennia for next year,1
60,goodlocation good bakery next door for breakfast that room was tiny little bigger than the double bed there is nowhere to put your luggage let alone sink had a large flat bottom and drained very slowly so anything in it like toothpaste settled on the bottom and would not rinse away the same for the shower in the shared bathroomthere was no hot water at all at times sometimes it was cool or moderately warm never was only electric socket and it was over the sink in a room for people my phone is not waterproof neither is my camera there was a to adapter but the electricity supply was unreliable my camera was not fully charged after hours the same with my phone at first i thought it was the to adapter causing a bad connection but it was the same when i plugged direct into the socket i could see the power light going off on my camera then i thought it could be the charger but it did not happen at all when i plugged it into a socket in a nearby bakery so it was the socket in the room the lift was very slow and was blocked from use by the cleaners in the morning i needed the use of the lift as i can not carry heavy weights for long distances i had to carry my luggage down flights on because the cleaners were using the cleaners cleaned the bathroom at on a saturday,0
61,everything about this hotel exceeded my expectations the location is ideal for exploring walking distance to the gothic area the medieval synagogue in the jewish quarter markets las ramblas gaudi casa batlo fabulous restaurants cafes the big plaza and shopping on passeig de gracia the building beautifully renovated and chic breakfast superb and the room had all the comforts of home plus what really makes it special however is the amazing staff everyone from the front desk doormen bell hop and waiters to the manager went out of their way to be beyond helpful and genuinely kind during our four night stay if i am lucky enough to be in barcelona again i will definitely stay at the grand hotel central,1
62,from the moment we walked thru the doors our stay could not of been better we arrived on their opening day everyone was so friendly and kind marjorie at the front desk was great check in was smooth and fast we got a great last minute deal on our room we loved all the small details in the room from the pencil and notepad the coffee cups the pillow menu if you want a specific pillow not a problem we took advantage of their continental breakfast great way to start the day one of the servers paola gave us some great recommendations on restaurants and bars thanks again paola the hotel is in a great location we walked everywhere the beach was about a min walk the rooftop pool was a great way to cool down after a day at the beach the ice cream floaties were a nice touch as well we ca wait to visit barcelona and yurbban passage again thank you for a great stay,1
63,this excellent hotel has a great location and a very helpful staff the swimming pool has an amazing view i wrote down my when i made the booking and the very friendly man who checked me in made a successful effort to make me happy someone else whose service stood out was the doorman alonso who gave me some good suggestions for exploring the area by foot on the night all the taxis in barcelona striked one suggestion for improvement i was not impressed by the quality of the food and coffee at the breakfast buffet,1
64,what an incredible experience i could not fault this hotel the location the room the staff the breakfast and the amazing roof top pool made it the best hotel i have stayed in anywhere in the world there not a lot i can add apart from i will be back,1
65,week really was long enough in this hotel we were greeted so warmly by all staff when we checked in we were offered cava coffee and water our bags taken to our room for us and staff explained all that was needed to know about the room rooms were spacious com and clean every staff member went above and beyond their job asking about our day and certain staff recognising us each day breakfast was beautiful and amazing buffet selection perfect for anyone and enough variety to not get bored after a week the city restaurant offered amazing food service was excellent and food amazing we felt like we ordered way too much food but the value for money was incredible and finally the sky bar a beautiful pool sun beds and fresh towels a large range of cocktails and the tapas option in the evening was perfect for a light nibble for would definitely recommend to anyone and we hope to return in the future,1
66,my husband and i stayed at this amazing hotel for just two nights but we were made to feel so welcome it was our wedding anniversary and chose this hotel for the central location and rooftop pool area nothing disappointed and everything exceeded our expectations friendly staff throughout the hotel we were greeted with a glass of cava a room upgrade and champagne on ice sent to our room the pool area is breathtaking and we enjoyed our evening set meal too i would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting barcelona that are hoping for a central location with a sophisticated touch thank you grand hotel central you helped my husband and i make some wonderful memories on our anniversary,1
68,ca beat the location of this hotel right in the middle of the heart of barcelona walking distance to everything the beach is min walking you got everything you need in the la rambla room was clean and spacious the guy at the reception was funny and tried his best to help us out planning our trip in terms of sightseeing and what to see good value for the money,1
70,i stayed here for two nights with my fianc√© for a break in barcelona i could fault it one bit the hotel is in the heart of barcelona just off la ramblas down an alleyway the hotel staff were very friendly and welcomed us on our arrival our room was very clean and modern clean towels were also available the room was very comfortable outside the hotel was slightly noisy as there appears to be a outside the hotel which could be a problem for some is a restaurant service meals and snacks we attended the restaurant for our breakfast and had two cooked breakfasts and coffee costing approx each we both enjoyed the breakfast the hotel is situated in the heart of barcelona and we used the nearby underground station just a couple of minutes from the hotel on las ramblas and we got around quite a bit of barcelona and saw some very famous landmarks an all day ticket costs around the underground service is fantastic on the day of departure we still had a full day left in barcelona hotel staff were very accommodating and kept our luggage at the hotel for us in a safe place we came back and forth that day and they allowed to access our luggage at anytime without any problems all in all we were very happy with our stay at may ramblas hotel and we will definitely be coming back here to stay thank you very much to all the,1
71,like in many other industries lack of skills and improvisation do not bode well for hotel eur night without breakfast in line with some of the cheaper but real for the same dates is around the corner and bingo you would expect a proper hotel management not some type of experience in the evening reception closes and check in is delegated to a clueless nice night guardian who only speaks spanish and takes pictures of your passport with his mobile phone ops also he has no idea whatsoever of the hotel facility room features etc some work done to remove the persistent sewage odor from the hotel modest air conditioning in the room only works while you are in so when we arrived we were greeted by room temp of degrees how nice no minibar if you are thirsty during the night you have to convince the night guardian to sell you a no the usual low pressure water from shower icing on the they close the nice roof terrace small pool when they feel like it with no real reason very light rain in the morning of july it then stopped at lunch time and in the afternoon and weather turned to sunny spells at no chance to access the roof terrace when asked the receptionist said they keep lounge chairs covered with plastic to avoid them getting wet and he told me it reopens at manager discretion likely the next day likely furnishing a roof outdoor terrace with,0
74,stayed at this hotel for night due to us booking a cruise it was perfect for us view was lovely from our room we had a balcony where we could sit and chill room was lovely clean staff friendly breakfast included and was plenty of choices book here again,1
75,the location of this hotel was brilliant for us there is a square just outside the hotel that does get busy as other reviewers have mentioned but we did find this intrusive and were pleasantly surprised by how clean it was again by the next morning lots of little streets to explore with a wide variety of bars and room was nicely finished in a contemporary if slightly minimalist style the bed was incredibly comfortable and we both slept well there were a few minor niggle points in that there was no fridge iron or tea making facilities within the room in fairness they were not listed within the amenities but we felt the room would have benefited from having them the biggest problem for us was the sliding bathroom door this had obviously been fitted as a space saver which would have been fine except we really struggled to get it to slide across and could get it to move at all after our first day so it possibly needed to be a higher spec this left us a little compromised in terms of bathroom access we did mention this problem at reception but unfortunately it was not resolved for the rest of our did use the ground floor bar or dining room but both looked pleasant the rooftop terrace and pool were lovely for relaxing in the sunshine drinks and snacks were available from downstairs but would have benefited from an order system down to were friendly and,1
76,we checked in for one night at this hotel at about the just went off when we called the front desk we were told the technician was at home and would not be able to attend to the issue until the following morning when we asked to be moved we were told the hotel was full when we asked to speak to the manager on duty we were told she is not answering her phone we ended up suffering through the night at c or degrees beds are saggy and wifi weak what a terrible place lacking any sense of customer service the only saving grace is the location but for the money i am sure we can do better,0
79,the hotel is located in a very nice zone close to the beach the rooms are clean big with clean staff is recommend this place also for families with is breakfast is international,1
80,room the room itself was basic the bed was very comfortable and clean and the shower worked as it should was also very effective the safe could be rented with a deposit of euros which was returned wifi was particularly fast but it was alright and connected easily enough we were happy with almost all apart from one were really helpful and friendly you had to give in the key when leaving and collect when returning the staff were casual and friendly unlike many hotels i visited over the years breakfast very basic bread which you could toast cured meat ham cheese shrink wrapped croissants and cakes yogurt limited fruit oranges and bananas orange juice and tea and coffee sometimes there was less of a selection as the guy who was looking after breakfast most mornings did exactly rush to fill things up we did get a bit bored of this but it was ok for a bit of something to start the great location about minutes walk to las ramblas and the sagrada familia minutes to the beach metro station was too far away for those journeys where we did want to walk as much for us it was ideal not in the touristy bit and in an area where you saw real citizens of the it was a basic hotel with helpful staff and in a good location we did really hear noise from other guests either we would stay there in a sort of apartment building so,1
81,stayed here for vacation the hotel is in a good neigborhood right next to the beach and close to restaurants stores and public transit we lost our connecting flight so they adjusted our stay with no extra charge they were very kind at the front desk they charged my iphone for me as i did not have an international plug they have a good breakfast it does have sugary juice as someone pointed out but the coffee is good with buffet of eggs meat and yogurt and cereal there are some specifically spanish sausages and flan i found the rooms to be clean and the bed perfectly comfortable since i had read the warnings about hot water i used the lukewarm which was fine room had good mirrors closet drawers television,1
82,this hotel was just what we needed for our long weekend in barcelona rooms are fine with air con and safe although i did miss making facilities minute walk to the beach just be aware it near the nudest beach nice buffet style breakfast was welcome in the morning wifi was fine in our room on floor minute walk from the metro reception staff very helpful great base for lots of walking and exploring the city and the beach,1
86,the rooms are clean and comfortable our room was a little warm we could not control the air conditioning the elevator was a little scary as it bounced when it approached a stop they have a really nice breakfast which was not included in our reservation it is a person we bought it and we very pleased with it it had fruit pastries eggs cold cuts cheese it is far from the old town and most attractions we had to take the metro to get places it was bad to take the metro very easy the is two blocks down the street there are also lots of restaurants in the area most of the staff was friendly and helpful one or two were not,1
87,we stayed here for days the room was clean and spacious with a big bed the hotel is very well located there are lots of shops around supermarket the metro maria cristina is walk from the hotel which is very good to get to the city center to get to catalunya the reception of the hotel were very kind and nice the only bad point was the isolation of the room because we could sometimes hear our neighbors but only when they did scream or laugh recommend this hotel and will come back for sure for my next barcelona trip,1
88,the hotel was nicely situated in the city closer to the mountain than the cruise port the staff were friendly and quite accommodating as we arrived early from our flight and were let into one room for storage of our luggage we found the room to be typical of european hotels a bit small compared to us but nicely situated the bathroom was rather open with frosted glass surrounding it rather than actual walls the power points outlets were european so converters were needed for us taxi fare to the cruise port was from here the breakfast was good and open at appropriate times offering both hot and cold options the front desk staff were very helpful at arranging rides and providing directions for us clean and comfortable accommodations would definitely stay here again,1
89,our family group of eight people stayed at this hotel for two nights four rooms we used our visa cards to get a free breakfast which was wonderful the front desk staff was so friendly especially rebecca i accidentally left my sport coat in the closet of my room as we went on a cruise ship rebecca found it and saved it for me to pick up two weeks later when the ship came back to barcelona i ran in on the way to the airport and she had it ready for me outstanding service the hotel only has about rooms and is reasonably priced compared to other barcelona hotels but with the service expected in a marriott hotel great service by the english speaking staff it is only a few blocks from the bus and you can get your tickets at the hotel front desk they have internet enhanced internet is free for marriott gold members even if you are not a gold marriott member this is a great hotel it is a couple of blocks from a nice park great for the morning run or in my case a place to relax and smoke a cigar i highly recommend this hotel when in barcelona,1
90,arrival without booking at pm dying for a bed a slow finding out if there a room starts said there was but in a hotel they do know and need to check the price he offers is higher than in and when i suggest that i can instantly book it there he says no more min typing in the computer in the process the only guy takes two long phone calls after the second he says he needs to go to attend a room service and that we should wait when min later he is back after my comment of i hope now you paying attention to us he answers back that we can look for another hotel if we want we certainly did we left and found other much nicer faster and warmer receptionist,0
91,possibly one of the worst hotels i ever stayed at in my entire life i have been to motels in thirds world countries that are painted better than this there is about one advantage of staying at this place the hotel is within walking distance of shopping centers a few good restaurants and public transportation now let me tell you everything that was wrong with this hotel during my stay in roon the sink would not drain properly we brought our baby with us and it was incredibly tough to wash bottles in the sink when the water wo drain pictures attached the shower space has mold all over the place pictures attached no clock safe or iron available in the room is extremely small but rates are comparable to other better hotels the hotel staff are all nice but tend to either give you bad information or information that contradicts other staff members more on this later there are two phones in the room which makes no sense because the room is extremely small and does need some hotel staff may tend to argue with you about the quality of the hotel more on this later the ac is as powerful as you expect it to being a marriott gold member means absolutely nothing supposedly there are no upgrades for rooms at this hotel more to come on this later every time i asked for a better room i got one of there are no upgrades available right all,0
92,the staff is super friendly helpful and warm they work really hard to make this place great the room was very clean bed very comfortable with very spacious bathroom once we got into the hotel we felt like we are leaving the chaos of the big city to enter a really peaceful really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend it to everyone,1
93,the hotel is small and modern great breakfasts excellent shower i stayed for a conference and brought my teenage daughter who enjoyed the hotel very much the reception team were extremely friendly cyrielle in particular went out of her way to help us every time she saw us we had a great stay and would recommend the hotel highly,1
94,one night business stop over handy for diagonal and camp nou good breakfast and clean quiet room coffee from a machine was actually very good and staff easy going with good english not a lot in the immediate vicinity but as usual in bcn you can find fruiters and bakeries close by,1
97,we booked a double standard room for our honeymoon and were obviously given a single room did look anything like the photos and we were given a single bed to share it was horrible uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all we could have about the room size but really who wants to do that on their honeymoon take a dip in the upstairs jacuzzi if you dare it filled with cloudy murky water be prepared to hear the train go past underneath the hotel and your neighbour go to the toilet there no sound proofing at stay here again,0
99,we just left from a night stay at the garbi millenne we was a little worried about our stay before we arrived after reading some of the reviews but we found our stay there to be very nice the communal areas of the hotel are very well kept and clean and the consierge at the front desk is always very happy and polite the room we stayed in was a nice double the air conditioning worked well and quiet enough for us not to notice while we slept having a fridge in the room is great with so many supermarkets on the door step it easy to re stock with water and snacks daily take your own coffee if you like a coffee to start the day although the cups provided with the kettle are very skipped breakfast at the hotel and tried a somewhere new every day the hotel is in a great location and all the tourist areas are easy to get to be only downside we had was that the bed was not very comfortable and to hard for us but it a hotel and only a short stay so did let it bother us over all we enjoyed our start barcelona and would be happy to book the garbi millenni again,1
100,had a great stay at the sunday aston very centrally located very close to metro bus routes and main train station staff were very friendly and helpful could not fault them room fairly basic but very clean and comfortable rooms cleaned everyday with clean towels would definitely recommend,1
102,i stayed here for nights and loved the location and the vibe of the rooms were lovely and modern with an amazing waterfall rooftop pool and terrace was an added bonus as was the funky bar in the basement with live also a great bar next door too which had live flamenco one loved my stay and the warm welcome from staff,1
103,went on a four day city break with my partner to barcelona i booked hotel niu barcelona last minute i was dubious as what i would turn up to but when we arrived i was amazed as the hotel was absolutely spotless so modern we arrived late at night so the next morning we woke up to find a lovely rooftop pool and loungers a lovely bar in the reception and also a club downstairs with various artists on we was literally a minute walk from las rambles which is the main part of barcelona i would definitely recommend this hotel look forward to returning for another city break,1
105,my partner and i stayed in the niu barcelona during a night stay in the city in mid hotel appears to be fairly new i not sure of the exact opening date but it ca be more than a year or so old as a result everything is very clean and everything works as expected the staff were very pleasant and helpful we arrived a few hours early on our first day and were allowed to check in slightly earlier than the advertised time which was much appreciated after a long room itself was clean with comfortable beds a flatscreen tv a table and a nice bathroom with a large walk in of the best parts of the room was the system going back to my previous statement that everything is fairly new and works as it should this air conditioning was a godsend especially in the high degree heat of barcelona in the middle of july after a day of exploring it was great to be able to come back to a nice chilled room before heading out again at night the location of the hotel is fantastic you are within minutes of la rambla and the gothic quarter but the area the hotel is in el raval is great for bars and restaurants too the doors of the hotel open out on to rambla del raval which is home to many bars shops and places to eat a short stroll along career de will take you right on,1
108,i really loved this hotel the rooms were small but really fresh and modern as were the bathrooms lovely big windows in the rooms overall quiet and charming service was great too i would not hesitate to stay here again,1
109,hotel the hotel interior is very beautiful the rooms were clean and spacious we received fresh water and tea every morning however on our night we saw ants in our room we were directed to another room immediately no questions asked staff we were looked after by many staff members who were very helpful and polite especially sergio he went above and beyond for us thank you so much sergio the breakfast i would rate stars there was much variety however the staff were helpful and accommodating when asked to bring out more ilunion bel art was a lovely hotel very close to the alfons station and la sagrada familia,1
111,this was a truly appalling experience one night in this dump and i was bitten to distraction by bed bugs check the photos when i complained the next morning i was asked by the receptionist whether the bites were the something i eaten yes madam i had a tasty tapa of bedbugs and then crapped them out in the night and they came back to bite me an absolute disgrace of an hotel,0
115,we stayed in a superior double which was very comfortable and clean very good beds and nice bathroom with all equipment you need quiet and a view over the small garden and pool very helpful staff nice location with a lot of restaurants and shops around the corner,1
116,very nice hotel with excellent location walking distance to shopping and lots of restaurants in the areawe stayed in an apartment supermarkets and breakfast cafes very close by if you do want to use the hotel restaurant nice pool area for relaxing or cooling down after a hot day in the city,1
117,hotel exe laitetana palace was absolutely amazing the room were nice and spacious the view we had was of the cathedral behind the hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the stay the breakfast could have catered abit more for vegetarian and fish lovers salmon bagels etc but it was good the room was clean aswell with ac and open door windows aswell room service is from a separate food company but the food was amazing and they arrived within the time is great minutes walk to the beach from las ramblas from sights like arc de trimof parc de cuitadella etc easily accessible aswell get taxi from airport for like euros would definitely recommend,1
118,good location but that about it we enjoyed walking around the el born neighborhood and barri gothic word of bring earplugs the walls were so thin we could hear everything happening on the street below it a pretty busy street to begin with plus ongoing nearby construction made it even worse no one likes to wake up to the sound of a hammer drill on vacation to make things worse we could hear all the commotion in the room next door to us also terribly designed bathroom there nowhere to put anything and the toilet is so close to the sink you have to do an awkward shuffle to sit and stand probably the most uncomfortable bed of our entire week spain trip do yourself a favor and stay in a quieter part of town,0
119,we spent six nights here the hotel rooms are simple but comfortable and clean the service people at the front desk were great the front desk personnel particularly dikra helped us considerably in booking tours and answering questions the hotel is very well located within walking distance of many shopping areas such as la rambla restaurants and tourist sites such as the barcelona cathedral and the picasso museum altogether a very wonderful experience highly recommend the hotel,1
120,we stayed here for a week in july we had a room on the floor over looking the roman city walls at the back of the hotel which made it quiet during the night great location in the gothic quarter short walk from la rambla minutes walk from the cathedral minutes to the beach room was small but clean and well decorated and well furnished air con was effective which made the room very comfortable all in all a good stay,1
121,stayed here for a surprise birthday weekend for my partner in early june booked the hotel through easy jet and had a great experience with it all ignore the star rating this place is fantastic this hotel is by no means the rooms are spacious with lovely clean bathrooms polite and respectful staff the lady at breakfast was ever so polite and attentive and ensured the buffet stayed topped up large selection of continental breakfast items on offer beautiful modern decor minute walk to the city centre but only for a taxi depending on the time of day,1
122,this is in the old section just a few minutes walk from metro which made it very convenient narrow streets with shops and supermarkets close by the hotel had a nice courtyard with rooms all around it the service was friendly and the breakfast very good and plenty full,1
124,came here for a couple of days in june with some friends and family i booked it because of its perfect location minute walk from las ramblas and minutes from placa catalunya and its price which because it was so cheap had me worried i did need to be though on entering the hotel the people were so friendly and the courtyard beautiful yes the rooms are very basic but they big enough with lots of wardrobe space and enough room to move around the air con also worked brilliantly and the shower had plenty of hot water i also could believe breakfast was included for the price and included a wide selection of breads cheeses meats spreads juices and decent coffee the only slight negative would be that there was a slight damp smell in the room and that using the shower did mean the bathroom got drenched every time even if you were careful because of the price and location though i could give it any less than stars and will definitely be recommending it to anyone who wants a bargain in barcelona,1
125,the hotel is alright for what it is it close to the shopping center but about mins away from tourist attractions and the beach the shower was a little impractical it was nearly impossible to take one without soaking the whole floor the front desk team and the rest of the staff is friendly and tries to be helpful when they can however the manager anna was an incredibly frustrating person to deal with on their check out card it states that check out time is am we were confused as standard check out time is noon we asked the front desk staff to clarify if there was some sort of misunderstanding but he confirmed am as in midnight with no where else to go the night before our flight we had no choice but to book last minute accommodations at a hostel for the trip was booked through our travel agent and i reached out to her just in case she was unaware about this oddity to my surprise she emailed me back saying she had spoken to the front desk and they confirmed checkout as noon we spoke with the same front desk staff member from before where he apologized for the mistake but offered nothing to help us other than a complimentary breakfast but only after we became insistent we asked to speak to the manger who was in to the next morning around with the manger anna had to be the most frustrating experience of my,0
127,very friendly staff we had a room in the attic clean and room is very basic but all we need is a bed and a clean own bathroom the breakfast was more than enough especially considering the price,1
128,this is one of the closest hotels to sants railway station great for an early morning member of staff at reception when we arrived was a bit grumpy but the room was good and we found a great place for dinner nearby and another place for breakfast next morning it was a breeze to wheel our luggage to the station and hop aboard the train,1
129,great hotel easily access all tourist areas as it well connected with public transport especially handy for parc gu√´ll and tipidabo which are within walking distance if you keen nice staff too clean comfy rooms and good to see another neighbourhood by travelling on public transport you more than double your bang for hotel buck it by cab from placa catalunya after midnight,1
130,we were marooned in barcelona due to the british airways computer meltdown in may we were supposed to fly out immediately after disembarking a cruise instead we ended up spending hours in barcelona airport during the wait to rebook our flight we realized that we needed to find a hotel room for the night and we did want to trust british airways to help us we had stayed in a hotel near cristal palace in our last planned stay in barcelona when it came up as having a room available we jumped at it and were very happy that we did the staff were very helpful especially once we told them how we managed to end up staying there that night the room we had was on third floor there was much of a view but the it had a good bed with ample space the bathroom was huge with good water pressure and temperature the wifi was easy to access and was quick the breakfast buffet the next morning was excellent with ample choices and everything was fresh upon leaving the young lady at the desk invited us to come back if we encountered more troubles at the airport on our next trip to barcelona this will be the hotel we will try to book first,1
131,i stayed in a double room nights from july to july room is room is air conditioned and provided with twin beds closet with sliding doors and included as safe wall hang tv full length mirror desk with a chair mini bathroom is provided with bathtub double sink wc bidet my room was not provided with any view but yet comfortable room was always clean thanks to housekeeping hotel location is perfect i it is walking distance from passeig de gracia la rambla and also near bus station metro and also nearby many shops restaurants i always pass by the hotel to drop all of my shopping bags and go for dining i used bus from passeig de gracia to reach to guell park and it was really easy to reach there and it is a really recommended destination and i enjoyed walking in la rambla and reach to the sea hotel staff are friendly and breakfast includes variety of food several types of cheese bakery juice fruits cereal etc and i would like to thank restaurant staff for being friendly helpful and smiling all the i enjoyed my staying so much and i will recommend your hotel to my friends and i hope i will be back soon,1
132,i went to this hotel and asked for a room the girl at reception who was too busy flirting with a mexican old man took a long time to even say hi when she finally acknowledged my presence she gave me a price for a room which changed every day what the f and which ended up being different in total when she finally gave me the room higher than she initially said as she kept adding things she showed me one room that looked nice and big before booking it and then gave me a key card for a very small one with a very small bed the hotel does not look good inside halls elevator etc i was very upset so asked for a refund and left i do not do con artists or liars i recommend you stay away from hotels that abuse their customers go to hotels that respect you and have decent honest prices that match what they offer,0
133,very friendly staff and very good location nearby metro and taxi stands i walked the length of las ramblas to the beaches from here no cooked eggs for breakfast lots of places to eat nearby the tour buses at the top of las ramblas were close by,1
134,this a modern hotel down a side street near parallel and near the port end of the city the area is quiet and safe even late at night and only minutes from las ramblas and minutes to the area has many decent little restaurants nearby when i stayed there was a local festival and i saw the real essence of the area friendly passionate people the local roads were closed and within metres of the hotel a stage was set up given lively entertainment in to the early room was basic bed wardrobe television on the wall with english channels safe cost a night very good air conditioning and bathroom with shower the floor had marble type tiles which made the room cool when the temperature outside was about degrees was two problems with the room one was the view from the window looking on to a brick wall in a central courtyard and the shower did not drain very tried the breakfast on the last day which was fine for euros a basic continental breakfast in a small area by staff were absolutely fantastic spoke basic english but were helpful and you are looking for a no thrills hotel this is the one to go for,1
135,stayed here for nights very basic room but clean comfortable and was reasonably priced staff were friendly and accommodating it is in a good location for the on hop off bus route would stay here again and have no problem recomending this hotel if you are looking for a city break,1
136,traveled with her teenage daughter the hotel was chosen because of the locationthe hotel is clean a spacious room unfortunately uncontrolled air conditioning good breakfast responsive staff very convenient location city center,1
137,amazing cleaning service the cleaning staff need to be honoured as we were overwhelmed by the spotless room we would return to and we not the cleanest bunch of year olds they would even fold up our clothes and pile them in the cupboards and welcoming hotel staff who all speak very good english love from england,1
138,have just returned from nights in this lovely hotel and was really pleased with my stay my room was perfect for one clean and comfortable and had hairdryer too this is an ideal base to explore barcelona it is not situated in the busy tourist area and so is a lovely retreat after a day exploring it is right next to the hospital clinic metro so ideal for travelling very easily to all the places the buffet breakfast was brilliant with a varied selection coming back after being out all day to the rooftop pool and jacuzzi was bliss and the views from the roof are beautiful free wifi which worked straight away and was reliable the staff were all friendly and helpful and being a solo traveller i felt very comfortable i will definitely recommend this hotel and return in the,1
139,the hotel is in the best part of the city in the eixample but it s a minutes walk for the underground a hotel itself is really clean the rooms also there is cleaning service everyday the rooms are amazing for us the beds were really comfortable the room itself wasn t big but it was enough for us it s important that there is no fridge in the rooms the bathroom is also okay the is slow in the recepcionist are really kind they helped us to find any transportation places to eat or with any other personal needs as i mentioned there was no fridge but we had some leftovers so we asked them to store it and they helped immediatelly even at s important to note that the hotel is built together with hotel aston we have to go in that hotel if we want to have breakfast over to use the pool during breakfast you can use from various foods i think it was a really good thing but nothing was too tasty the pool is really small also as the jakuzzi so these are not the advanteges of the hotel but otherwise it was marvelous,1
140,the hotel was well located for transport links and also for shops restaurants the hotel was also close to the hospital in case whilst staying anyone needed it it was very clean throughout and staff were very helpful there was a hairdryer in the room if you needed one and the rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed as well as complimentary toiletries i traveled alone but i felt very safe there breakfast was very nice buffet style pool and jacuzzi was also very nice the hotel is not in the central tourist area which was nice but it was close enough to be able to get anywhere in the city,1
142,great apartment with a lovely terrace from the terrace the holiday maker can enjoy views of the mystical mt tibidabo the room and terrace can only be matched by the extremely knowledgable helpful and friendly staff when we return to barcelona will definitely return to bonanova appartments,1
143,accidently booked this hotel by mistake meant to stay at the ramblas boqueria which i have stayed at before and is was dingy and exceedingly small and did not have a nice feel about it needs updating badly staff did find us a better room but i would never stay again,0
144,this hotel is located right on la rambla it has great restaurants nearby and you can catch the metro nearby too the hotel offers a breakfast so you can eat until you are stuffed with lots of choices to satisfy anyone taste buds it is a very clean hotel but make sure you do get a back room as the apartment next door can be loud the market is just across the street and down a block where you will find the most wonderful experience in culinary delights it is a must visit if you are lucky enough to be there for barcelona biggest festival in september you will have parades going by every few hours on friday saturday and sunday,1
145,my stay at internacional cool was one of the worst i have ever experienced the room was per night for nights my room was so small it barely fit a full sized very uncomfortable bed the manager who was cordial said he could make no changes the bed was so bad with thin old mattresses that i ended up with back and neck pains the shower was so small one could barely turn around it was a very high priced for barcelona low quality hotel avoid at all costs the only thing it had going for it was the location on the ramblas,0
146,the hotel has free wifi and is located in one of barcelonas most busy streets a short walk gets you to great restaurants as stores and that about it the room was really small having a suitcase got to be a problem we had to place some of our luggage in the bathroom the bathroom contained some hair from other guests and god knows what else the elevator did work the tv had three spanish channels and the breakfast cost extra perfect since the room did offer a simple do not disturb sign it was easy for the housekeeper to wake you up at to tidy your room next time no thanks hotellet er plassert sentralt i barcelonas mest travle gate g√•avstand til butikker og gode restauranter gratis wifi der stopper det positive kun spanske kanaler p√• sm√• rom uten plass til koffert eller sekk sekken m√•tte for √∏vrig plasseres p√• badet badet inkluderte h√•r fra tidligere gjester heisen var i ustand og alt dette til tross for en vanvittig h√∏y pris for rommet i tillegg manglet enkle ting som et ikke forstyrr til d√∏ra pga dette kunne man raskt bli vekket kl noen skulle vaske rommet neste gang nei takk,0
147,the location is the only good thing about that hotel it unclean and very noisy the king size bed is very small and uncomfortable i found a dead spider on my pillow and blood on the bedsheets when i complained they took it very lightly and said they will have it cleaned tomorrow because the housekeepers left lol its only when i yelled that they changed the pillow cases and bedsheets on the spot the breakfast is also terrible no way on earth that i book rialto again you will surely find way better alternatives in the same street,0
148,i was sceptical about booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews but decided to go for it for the location oh boy did i make the right decision not only was the location so perfect but the hotel itself was lovely also the location is snack bang in the middle of the old town the gothic quarter with everything that you could possibly want right on your doorstep the buildings in this area including the hotel are just stunning and exactly what i expected of barcelona there is a place called reial which is a square of gorgeous restaurants and bars which is a minute walk from this hotel and this turned out to be one of our most favourite places in barcelona the hotel was a little outdated which is the reason for giving it stars rather than but we had a gorgeous floor length window which was stunning when we opened it the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful when we asked about which buses and metros to take the metro is only a minute walk from the hotel also and this can take you stop away from the beach which is also a walk if you would rather walk overall i was very pleased with this hotel and would definitely return if i came back to barcelona i had a lovely time,1
149,we had booked the hotel rialto for our one week holiday in barcelona we stayed in the hotel for nights and then decided to book another hotel even though we did nit get any refund for the missed nights and this sums up our stay in the hotel very arrived late at night to room that smelled like mold we were able to change our room after our first night we had a room facing the street but the street noises did not bother us at our floor aircondition did not work properly it was way too cold in the room during nights somebody came to our room without knocking the rooms were dirty do look under the bed and not dated the bed was very uncomfortable it was very hard no proper location was very good that is a definite bonus if you are thinking about booking a budget hotel think twice before coming to rialto there are better options available in barcelona for this price range,0
150,having been to barcelona a few times and seen all the sights my daughter and i chose this hotel because of its location in the gothic area which we reviews of a hotel are not enough to deter us and we have always been fortunate to experience a good stay wherever we have course there are better hotels in barcelona but for a short break in an area of authentic narrow strees little shops and sunny squares where you can enjoy a glass of sangria and a few tapas hotel rialto fits the room on the floor overlooked the street but with the window closed there was no noise and offered us an excellent view of a few paradesair conditioning in the room was a blessing but it was a bit cold during the night and i had to use the blanket stored in the wardrobe we found our beds to be hot buffet breakfast was not to our taste but there were the usual cereals yoghurts fruit different types of rolls toast cold meats and cheese to satisfy that is not enough there is an abundance of snack bars cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood at competitive prices,1
152,i recently stayed at barcelonaa fira travelodge i found the staff to be friendly helpful professional and caring the hotel room was spotlessly clean great showers and good location and value for money in particular i would like thank frank daniel for making my stay welcoming pleasant and friendly highly recommended,1
153,we are a family of who stayed at travelodge fira to be convenient to airport we found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming with plenty of information on travel shopping etc the rooms were lovely and cool in the hot summer and the beds were very comfortable the reception booked us a taxi for an early flight but the metro is also very close we would highly recommend this hotel,1
154,booked a one bedroom apartment but was upgraded to a very pleasant surprise the apartment was huge and we could believe we were in the middle of barcelona central location very clean and i did think the furniture was old at all the welcome were also a nice touch to help us feel welcomed the kitchen was spacious and easy to use and we cooked on a sunday when a lot of restaurants were closed glad we had laundry as we got drenched one afternoon in a sudden down pour we had breakfast one day at the hotel part one morning and enjoyed that as well,1
155,this location is perfect for anyone wanting a mix of culture beach and we had a triple room there was enough space storage was great really modern the balcony was a nice addition great staff air con ace shower very powerful breakfast was not great and let this hotel down,1
157,worst experience ever i donot recommend any of the tourists to visit regardless of the good location the room cleaning was awful the covers were dirty whereby me and my wife got bitten by the bed bugs and we suffering now,0
158,great position many restaurants and attractions near bye rooms excellent for star good beds and breakfast friendly service at reception close to waterfront as well only mts from the amazing la rambla blv very happy,1
159,i enjoyed my stay at hotel moderno which is located perfectly at the intersection of la rambla and carrer de in central barcelona the welcome from staff was friendly and i found the room clean and comfortable the wifi signal was excellent it could get a little noisy at night but that is only because you are metres away from one of barcelona main thoroughfares the air con can take a while to cool the room on a hot day but once it gets going it does the job i did try the hotel breakfast,1
160,no problems at all very clean very nice atmosphere degrees hot outside perfect quality air condition in reception really helpful and not at all in the fake smile way would stay again any time,1
161,i was there for two nights the hotel is modern but each room is pretty small and worst than that the hotel is really that i could hear people having showers and they limited television set volume up to a max level,0
162,i had to stay here when my easyjet flight was cancelled i arrived very late and was sweaty and exhausted and annoyed but despite this reception were friendly and helpful as easyjet hotel of choice they are probably used to dealing with frustrated customers unfortunately when i was there all the electronic keys had stopped working so you had to be escorted to your rooms to have them unlocked am sure they have that fixed soon the room was odd seemed like a studio with the bathroom sink in the middle of it they provide separate shampoo and conditioner soap and body gel which was very useful given my unexpected visit the bed was big and nice and clean however pillows were the lumpiest i seen and i almost could sleep because of it another thing that stopped me sleeping peacefully was that walls are paper thin i hear could anyone talking outside in the hallway and there were a few loud excited people who woke me up the tv is enormous but has the volume fixed to quite a low level so you ca go above it this makes sense given the lack of sound proofing but was a little too quiet for me to hear the breakfast was very nice quite a small selection but really good quality nice spanish tortilla and chorizos nespresso coffee overall it was fine but the noise factor would put me staying again even though the transport links are very good right next,0
163,we stayed at the ac hotels sants for days the location was so perfect that the sants station was just mins walk all the staff person at the reception are helpful and friendly specially paula breakfast was great and if you prefer to eat out specially at lunch there a lot of restaurant just around the hotel the hotel cleaning staff do good job cleaning and providing you with toiletries i will surely recommend this hotel to all who will visit barcelona lastly it is very easy commute to and from the airport,1
165,safe to say this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in simple ok lobby but a rickety tiny elevator dirty in nooks and crannies tiny tv noisy and creepy hallways the worst part was a hole in the roof of one room looking directly up into some kind of dark and dusty storage area above this creeped us out so the entire family decided to sleep in one room good location though,0
168,as other reviewers have confirmed the hotel is basic but makes up for this with the location which could not be better although the hotel is basic it is clean and the staff are lovely we arrived early but the staff happily locked our cases away for us we will stay again,1
171,stayed here for three nights at the end of june room was very clean and well maintained the view from the spacious balcony was beautiful the breakfast was absolutely perfect with an endless supply of a fine selection of ham the ladies who provided breakfast were lovely and cheery also very helpful i sincerely hope we can return soon,1
172,if you need a good and relaxing place after a long trip do go to the catalonia park putxet in has no access for people with disabilities i supposed that was a must for hotels but i guess i was wrong it had a fake electric chair to get down the steps to go check in but it was not working it was there for show only hoping i believe nobody would need staff was very rude unaccommodating and in no uncertain terms told me to go somewhere else because they did need to accommodate me well i did after i demanded it they sent me to another hotel for the same price and paid for my had never seen or met anybody as rude in the hotel business or anywhere else for that matter anywhere in the world,0
173,located on a back street from a main road upon first impressions the hotel was gleaming clean and smelt receptionist was very helpful and checked me in without had a double basic room on the floor it was what i expected vey clean good poor view expected in the city room service every day all very polite do a good job there is no swimming pool just for anyone confused by certain photos on google images the food is delicious they have a large selection on display all coffee machine gives a good coffee regard to distance to main areas la ramble the beach etc it is a busy sweaty bus ride depending on traffic from the beach to the hotel it is one long good if your prepared to pay for a taxi approximately to the beach front i would also say that the main area is around la rambla food shopping bars theatres so on personally next time i will be booking a hotel closer but it was all part of the experience all in all the hotel is lovely there is nothing for children more for solo business,1
174,the staff was friendly and helpful the room was nice big and clean the pool was way smaller than the pictures show which disappointed us a bit but overall a good experience and we enjoyed our stay,1
175,we stayed here last week hotel in general was nice but the staff are by far the most unfriendly non welcoming people i ever seen i work in the industry myself and could imagine treating people the way these staff breakfast is from till on week days it bein our holidays we did go to breakfast till about any morning we went only to be hassled and rushed by the waiter it was just us other tables got the same treatment and i heard them say that breakfast is over till which it does state the waiter then proceeded to argue with all the tables that they have to be gone by but most tables ignored then came to us and said u need to hurry up i have to clear up breakfast is finished at i checked the time it was all i had was toast and tea i went in the second morning and he was doing the same thing to every table in there i did bother having anything just went out for breakfast after paying just for breakfast and to get that treatment is crazy we tried the bar food one of the nights crazily over priced our bar tender was rude and very unfriendly i ordered a ham and cheese pizza and i asked if i could get french fries with that and the waiter said we do do french fries only with certain things on the menu and the tables across from us had,0
176,the hotel is decent but it definitely does meet the hotel is pretty close to the lesseps metro station but you need to be aware that you need to climb a pretty steep hill from the station to the staff is friendly and the rooms are clean although the furniture is quite old and totally did like the fact that the hotel canceled my reservation with just hours before i arrived because they were unable to book the reservation payment from my credit card they sent me a message while i was traveling in the plane but i only found out about it when i arrived at the hotel i was lucky that nobody else booked the room before i arrived,0
177,a lovely modern hotel situated in a quiet area surrounded by local shops and restaurants air conditioned rooms and a great breakfast buffet the staff are easy to talk to and helpful close enough to walk to park guel approx mins and even las rambla should you want to hrs with metro access to think about if you after a relaxed time with some sight seeing,1
178,we were really happy with this apartment and also the staff we were arriving late and were worried that this may have been an issue as they do have a hours manned reception but there was a smiling young woman waiting for us outside the building the apartment is one of quite a few which is managed by mayerling and ours was very modern with ply timber walls not a large apartment but everything we needed including an efficient ac and kitchenette staff were so helpful we ca wait to go back also ca go wrong with a supermarket a few doors away,1
179,this hotel is in a great location a quiet residential area but an easy walk to the metro that connects you to the entire city the staff was friendly and very helpful the room was exactly what we expected and the breakfast was great on the day we left our train did not leave till the evening the hotel allowed us to check out leave our bags and pick them up after one more day in barcelona we were very happy with our stay,1
180,we spent nights at this place one block south of diagonal the area is nice with bars and restaurants within walking distance the metro station is a short walk away max minutes the rooms are big and the beds a very comfortable even the sounds of the street are limited to an absolute minimum on our especially would like to mention me josep from the reception who was very helpful und friendly the only thing i would have expected wasthat the deposit box and coffee on the room with the coffeemaker would be included the prize for the nights nevertheless this little extra fee does not lower our experience made would stay there again,1
181,this was our first trip to barcelona due to our flight cancellation to lisbon we had no reservation in barcelona until days later one word of caution always book your flight with one booking this way airline who had the will be responsible to take care of tourism office office referred us to guitart grand passage we needed room for people adults and kids thankfully manager jenny misurelli at guitart hotels accommodated us on a sunday night the hotel is priced well and it is close to the ramblas street it is very clean and room service is efficient make sure you choose the breakfast option the quality of breakfast is very good as staff assisted me with just about everything such as getting direction and making reservation for la sagrada familia most important everyone is polite and speak different highly recommend guitart grand passage the address muntaner barcelona espana,1
182,a three night stay at this boutique hotel excellent amenities and polite staff a shame they do have tea making facilities in the room but i loved the location will definitely want to stay there again,1
183,we stayed nights in continental palacete and we enjoyed every single minute we booked a twin bed room but were given a small twin bed room different from what we saw online luckily due to the room ac malfunction we were moved almost immediately to the room with the seat out over looking beautiful restaurants and staff are outstanding and the hours buffets provided needed repast after full days of only found english speaking news channels on the tv everything else is in spanish or french i think since we spent most of our days out of the hotel it was no biggie for is a taxi park right in front of the hotel and the train station is far it located right in the middle of the city centre with shops and restaurants right next definitely recommend the hotel you get value for your money,1
184,luckily for us we love it but it definitely quirky we returned to the palacete after staying here years ago it has not changed and is still as charming as it was then the hour complimentary snacks and drinks are a great bonus highly recommend the versailles suites this time we stayed in the suite on the left of the main lounge unfortunately the name escapes me which is much better in configuration to the suite on the right so try and request that one the only downside is you can hear the conversations of guests in the lounge next door and vice versa which for us with children was problematic trying to get our kids to speak quietly so as not to disturb the other guests eating and drinking in the lounge the location is excellent super convenient to la rambla and the cathedral an awesome bonus is the proximity to ciudad condal recommended by gemma at the hotel and an excellent tapas restaurant just minutes away in the next block when not snacking at the hotel we had every meal here for the entire duration of our stay in barcelona if you like small quirky hotels at a reasonable price you ca go wrong with this one we will continue to return,1
185,we stayed here one night on our way to ibiza from dubai the staff were warm and we were kindly given an upgrade to a suite which was huge and appreciated the breakfast was good would stay again when in the city,1
186,the honest of the assistant service personal is questionable i lost an important mount of money of my room and they didnt anything to find it i make an p√≥lice report in the p√≥lice station and i waiting the results,0
188,quiet clean comfortable boutique hotel located in neighborhood very friendly and helpful staff close to underground metro lots of restaurants and coffee bars near by safe and walkable area of barcelona good value for the money,1
189,i have stayed at carlit over the short business and leisure weekend in barcelona the hotel is very clean and the staff helpful best thing is the location walking distance to a few metro stations and even to sagrada familia lots of possibilities to eat nearby i would come back and stay again,1
190,thank you for a fantastic time thank you for your kindness at the desk and your help and good recommendations about places to visit and trips out of town and for a good chat after coming home in the evening we had a great room with a beautiful view and very good cleaning every you to all of you,1
191,we booked this hotel rooms as our train from paris stopped in barcelona and we needed to be close to the train station for our final leg to staff were friendly despite us arriving very late due to delays with the train leaving paris wonderful hotel very friendly professional staff rooms were very clean air conditioned and comfortable hope to stay at this hotel again and for longer as it is great value for money,1
192,for the second time we stayed in expo hotel still think is a great hotel for the value and its location is common spaces are looking good but maybe the rooms need improvements some things in our room seemed old or somewhat new decoration would be breakfast is great and perhaps better than the last staff is very polite and friendly and always ready to our months baby with us made us need some boiling water and hot soup and that was never a problem for the staff,1
193,we wanted a hotel with a pool and by the time we booked within about a month before we arrived there was many but we got a fairly cheap deal for such a nice hotel it very minimalistic and spacey as soon as you walk in the room was so lovely and we had a cracking view from the wee balcony iv seen reviews complain about the balcony size that you ca get a chair out but there is the rooftop bar so it not even a problem bathroom is big and plenty room to unpack and put suitcases the beds were changed everyday extremely comfy great duvets and pillows the rooftop views were amazing the pool was small but fine enough to cool down in the only thing i would say is more sun loungers i do know if it a health and safety thing tho the pool opens at and if you want a spot all day on a lounger get there at folk were lying on the patios the bar food is fine not much choice the underground and main rail station literally across the road a minute walk would definitely stay here again if i came back to barca,1
194,not aceptable very dirty and a lot of dust very old and it smells smokey in each room the breakfast was ok but it does matter with such bad rooms we cancelled and booked another hotel this hotel does have stars in my eyes,0
195,just back from a weekend stay in the expo great location just outside of sants railway station which provides both metro and train only a walk from staff were great on the desk on very nice and great at providing information on the city our room was lovely very big with a nice corner balcony great views of city as on floor room was very clean comfortable bed and good bathroom good size tv and in good working order only thing i would say about room is no plugs at the bedside for charging phones bar was very nice and reasonable price wise did not eat here overall a great hotel for the price would defo come back here if in barca again,1
196,this hotel is not in the city center but metro station is very close so you can reach it in minutes the room is spacious clean the temperature in the room was great and staff was really helpful the only minus is that the pool is a little bit too cold and that you have to walk up hill to reach the hotel,1
197,we stayed at the hotel for days the hotelrooms were very clean and tidy bit small but we did spend time in the room that much because of the great weather also there was ac bathroom is also very clean with and good really liked the staff they were very helpful and nice even though we did speak a word food did really stand out only are there pool was a lot smaller than we expected also meter deep so not really for big swims we just used it to cool down and chil around it the hotel was very close by the metro supermarket and you walk down the street to the roundabout take a right over the bridge with the metro on the left if you cross the bridge and cross the street you and go to the right the supermarket and bakery will be there overall great experience,1
198,very nice and clean hotel room size is big for europe beautiful lobby and restaurant nice area in lobby for socialization including a bar for those who drink rooms were very clean nice large beds staff very friendly and helpful rooftop pool is amazing with sitting area you can see la sagrada familia and city views from the rooftop at night it is breathtaking the pool does close at there is a fitness room and it opens at not sure when it close had enough equipment and weights to get a good workout during this vacation i traveled to greece and italy and by far this is the best hotel i stayed at,1
199,we are heading out from a night stay here at margo house we ca believe the attention to detail and the service provided we are staying in room and loved the modern sparse decor there was ample space for my husband and me the hotel staff has been exceptionally attentive we ca recommend this place enough some hints breakfast is amazing let yourself fill up on some amazing jambon cheese and pastries and then have a nice pastry before you take a siesta use the loaner bikes to tour around town they are easy and enjoyable and barcelona is set up for cyclists take the route bus right out side our door up to parc guell each and you get to see parts of the city you might not otherwise the parc guell itself is stunning and home to the gaudi parc travel just a little north west of the hotel for some more local but still stylish food options do get stuck in the tourist trap restaurants,1
202,barcelona was our first stop on our euro trip and we could have been more excited the staff was really friendly and helpful we loved how it was walking distance to many sites and the metro the neighborhood was quiet and quaint we had the largest room we stayed at in europe we also went to paris and rome the only thing we would suggest is free continental breakfast coffee or snack we would definitely stay here again,1
203,minutes to la rambla just across from the gothic district with barcelona cathedral and a short walk to the marina with good value restaurants very close to the tube station and bus stop with access everywhere my teenage son loved the hotel it was very modern and the lounge downstairs was comfy for him to chill out and download his videos on the free wifi the supermarket along the road is great and has water bottles for cents which we stocked up with everyday did hear any street noise from inside the hotel we arrived very early at and were found a room to check into immediately we were then able to leave our bags on the day we left labels were attached to them and a corresponding one given to us so we could enjoy a full day and left about very friendly reception staff every day i would recommend this hotel,1
204,i stayed here in and the hotel was a great find back then i felt it was in a good location and the hotel was clean and modern however during my recent stay it was dated the bathrooms were the cleanest and the staff were not friendly the place has gone downhill there are also no safes provided in the rooms in a city with pick pockets galore you think this would be a standard amenity in a nutshell shame on you for claiming you are a star hotel,0
205,my partner and i had a night break here we can not fault it the staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place is clean and modern our room was exceptionally comfortable and a lovely bathroom too good value and great location,1
206,we had a day city break chose the onix liceo hotel its position just off the ramblas is perfect the hotel itself is spotlessly clean beautifully cool as in cool breakfast is buffet endless well worth the stayed in room which was exceptionally clean well staff genuinely want to help you have an enjoyable stay i would have no reservations in recommending this hotel will without doubt use it again,1
208,will go back friendly kind reception start to finish clean room service was very quite swimming pool was great my friend learned how to swim there his confident he can swim in the sea now,1
209,a great place to stay and enjoyed my time there a great room which was well equiped and a comfortable bed the ensuite was well appointed and lovely shower the breakfast was great with a very well presented selection a great start to the day,1
210,this is a tale of two visits the girl on front desk on sunday lovely and kind free afternoon tea nice quiet room nothing like the bad reviews i had seen then the monday morning experience my quick breakfast was interrupted no less than times as the waiter wanted to make damn certain i had paid for it which i explained i had then at the end as i was leaving he was friendly then i went to check out and the guy on front desk asked for for my sushi i explained i already paid directly to the delivery guy and instead of believing me like a normal human being he took the cash with a promise of reinstating it i have mentioned the pre pay charge for a dog if you travel with a dog they charge up front in case the dog damages the room so potentially for a dog breakfast paid twice which i just and sushi paid twice it may look like a good price but an unaware tourist could be out of pocket for almost nightmare i go anywhere else with this guy in charge he only after your tourist money,0
212,had a wonderful time during our stay here last summer the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly especially the reception staff and the lady at breakfast who on one of the days went out to buy croissants for us as they had run out before we came downstairs breakfast is plentiful and the hotel in general is very quaint and well location minutes from monjuic fountain and super easy access to tons of restaurants and cafes minutes walk from a huge mall too so you get the best of both worlds with the local places on the street right next door to the hotel and the fancier places inside the mall the metro is also right near the mall so again a minute walk plenty of authenticity in this area room was clean and very roomy we booked a quadruple room and were not disappointed the cleaners also found my watch which i had misplaced in the room and left it on the bed truly enjoyed our stay and when we come back to the beautiful city of barcelona will definitely be staying here again,1
213,it is a lovely hotel with a stunning elevator witch is my favorite company the service is so nice and my room was on the floor the top floor my room number was the food on the floor is nicethank you and this was my review,1
215,we stayed for our first short break as a couple the room was clean and nice not one english channel on the tv to have on while in the room the pool area was lovely as for the hotel reception staff we found them rather rude as we booked our booking on booking com and booked it at and had to pay as they put on street tax wen we got there and we were not informed of this via email there was also a taxi strike wen we were there and the hotel did inform any of the guests about the situation it would have hurt to put a notice up in the reception area the hotel is miles away from any amenities and barcelona we found was very expensive as it was euro in a taxi to most places,0
216,very clean place excellent food nice personal friendly an all question very nice location close to every point to be transport we very happy to stay in the hotel if we ever travel to spain we will choice the hotel,1
217,its a nice hotel with clean and modern rooms we were on the first floor overlooking the street and it was still quite it is close to the water front and in easy walking distance of a lot of the attractions parking is about meters away there are many nice restaurants and bars close by,1
218,the stars mean something different in the old world good location no area to leave baggages middle of the street incredibly small rooms even for european city standards the staff was nice but most are not in condition to help you with the usual tourist questions they know nothing about restaurants tours etc if you a couple below and no kids i guess it ok otherwise i would recommend it,0
219,weeks ago we stayed there for a family vacation this place offers a good location but is not good for families with small children staff in front were nice but were not locals all were from other countries and in times for help well they did not knew the city very well or were able to recommended anything useful nevertheless location is right there in the middle of gothic old town which is great for local shops and restaurants again most things were walking distance also the time we visit was really full of tourists making our stay with a toddler a very difficult one there room was very small but they did provided a crib this place is better for young couples without children or people which did not care about space and can sacrifice other comforts to be right there at the city so we understood out limitations as a family in our care was booked with an agency we requested stars hotel in barcelona but this place did not reflected stars in any way breakfast was good thou,0
220,stayed here for nights great location right next to the metro staff were always friendly air con was a little bit noisy but not too much of a problem misses bag got stolen on our first night and the staff were very helpful with getting hold of the police highly recommend,1
221,we checked into room which would have to be the smallest hotel room i have ever seen one side of the bed is flat against a wall therefore you can only access the bed on one side the bathroom is unbelievably small the basin is so tiny you ca even wash your face without water going all over the mirror yourself and the floor as you sit on the toilet you are squashed between the door and the shower positives of the hotel include air conditioning nice balcony however always too hot to use staff where friendly the location of the hotel is perfect and very central and good water pressure from shower negatives include very small room when asked to change and even pay extra we were told nothing was available the smell of the hotel which is strongest in the room is horrible it smells like some strong chemical when we checked into the room the sheets where stained and we asked them to be changed to which they where changed within the hour and breakfast has a poor variety and is would not recommend for families or couples probably best for one person who will spend minimal time in the hotel,0
222,a nice hotel with an experienced and friendly staff located close to joan miro library and park and walking distance of plaza de espa√±a please visit the shopping mall where the plaza de toros used to be and go to the restaurants on the top roof the view is amazing,1
223,the hotel is in an excellent location and is very well connected the entrance to the metro is across the street and bus stops with buses to major attractions are a short minute walk from the hotel las ramblas is a minute walk there lots of restaurants and cafes in the vicinity we ate out mostly in district which was a minute rooms are simple but clean bright and modern it looks like the rooms were recently refurbished there was a flat screen tv safe and air conditioning there no coffee making facilities or a fridge which would have been useful bed were very a lovely decked garden and seating area breakfast is available but from memory it was quite expensive we had coffee and pastries in the many cafes nearby instead the staff on reception were friendly and helpful i would definitely stay here again in the future,1
224,it took me less than mins to get to hotel marvi from barcelona airport terminal by aerobus return tickets valid for days there many restaurant and nearby we were greeted with the newly renovated hotel from the reception to our rooms the staff are friendly and helpful in showing us around barcelona on the free maps that the hotel provides the triple and double room are spacious the beds are comfortable with fluffy pillows the toilet are equipped with decent shower facilities and hairdryer there also a nice terrace refer to photo at the reception level pity that i did get a chance to chill there throughout my days stay here pleasant experience with hotel marvi,1
225,we currently staying at this hotel there a sign on the door that says it about to change names to chic basic probably should thought about that name a little however the rooms are spotless kudos to the cleaning staff there hotel in general is very clean there are no kettles in the room which we already saw on trip advisor before arriving but there are tea and coffee making facilities by the lounge area all free of charge we did have the breakfast it euros which is steep in my opinion you can have an actual meal for at the places a few steps from the friendly and location a few minutes walk to las ramblas we hired bikes from a shop nearby so used that to get around not that we needed to great transport links nd places arguably walkable depending on how far you like to walk so pleased with this hotel,1
226,we stayed one night arriving and departing by train the hotel is very close minutes to sants surrounding area is quite pleasant we enjoyed two good meals in nearby street hotel itself looks rather grand we were allocated a rather grand room on floor do know why but the restaurant was a bit too fancy for our needs it lacks a simple cafe in the hotel but there is plenty of choice nearby,1
228,stayed nights with our year old and were very happy that they had put an extra bed into our room for her the location is very close to the sants station but a bit far away from the city attractions the hotel breakfast was good lots of choices and the rooms were clean,1
229,stayed in this hotel last week and was so impressed fantastic welcoming polite staff and the room was so clean the best thing of all was the super comfy bed it felt like home from home would highly recommend this hotel and intend to return one day,1
230,the hotel is in an area of the city so seems a bit desolate if you are there at the weekend as everything is shut not a wealth of bars or restaurants in the immediate vicinity the positive of that was it was fairly felt safe at all times walking around the area the beach and marina are a minute walk and easy to find the metro station is minutes away taxi rank directly outside the room was very clean and comfortable good aircon all staff we encountered we friendly and helpful breakfast was euros and was a really good standard lots of choice free wifi was good all over the hotel the spa looked lovely did have time to use it,1
233,it was practical for the office i was visiting but not the best hotel room was lovely and clean and the service was was really good and enjoyed mine outside near the come back again,1
234,we have visiting barcelona with two small kids in august and stayed at vila olimpica in the overall hotel is nice spacious lobby small but cosy pool area modern and large rooms kitchen in the rooms comes with extra charge and you are not able to have it if you stay under hotel is built in but it is already needs some small fixing very friendly and helpful stuff as it is normal in spain prepare to wait a bit for everything not much variety in food at breakfast not really worth the price the restaurant is a bit overpriced for just an ordinary food location is not the best one but ok the best area around the hotel is not so nice metro station is close trip ticket costs and there is a long street with lots of restaurants and some shops just in minutes walk the beach is also in accessible distance by walking taxis are quite cheap so if you are not able to walk it is easy to get around by taxi trip to sagrada familia to park guell to the airport spa was for those who is travelling with kids be aware that you are able to use spa only in the would definitely recommend this hotel to others,1
235,very clean hotel convenient location near la rambla and other nice and plentiful breakfast but it could be rooftop pool was very appreciated after a long hot go back,1
236,am having to right this out of frustration deep annoyance if the way my friends i have been treated by sunotel central we booked rooms back in march around through a booking agency we realised we had made a mistake within hours of the booking so through the agency who called the hotel direct at to try and cancel the rooms they refused to do so stating they had a non cancellation policy it was explained that as the holiday was not until september surely they could take a small cancellation fee but no they stuck to their policy rigidly my friends i worked something out so we could still use out of rooms i called the hotel again requesting they cancel just rooms however again they refused to budge repeating like parrots their no cancellation policy i think a bit of consideration understanding would go along way i only want to cancel rooms which i sure they would be able to re sell before september very unhappy customer who will not be recommending this hotel the rest of it chain ok thanks for letting me vent unfortunately it does get my money back,0
237,a good location with excellent room was small and had no view but was spotless clean and staff was got the room for early checkin at am on arrival a very nice room was always cleaned while i had area on the roof is not that big but had around sunbeds a small pool and a jacuzzi very location of the hotel is really good just a short walk down to las ramblas and the area around the hotel is filled with local restaurants and two brewey pubs,1
238,i would give this hotel if possible but decided to swing to to help boost overall figure we booked a basic room just a few days before we stayed and found the price of per night a good deal at such short notice if you book a basic room and are surprised by the fact it is small and does have a great view then you need to loosen the purse strings a bit the basic room was cosy very clean had a fridge big bathroom with rainforest shower cleaning service every day if you want it and all the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming the rooftop pool was small but very clean and there were enough loungers it seemed to stem the flow of people coming up at various points during the day the view was good pool temperature perfect for summer weather and clean toilets up there including a shower and hairdryer for people who check out early but hang about the pool until their you flying into el prat then the aerobus stops at universitat which is minutes walk from the hotel the hotel is surrounded by well priced bars and restaurants and is minutes walk to ra lambla but eixample itself is great for up and coming gastro places thank you sunotel we will stay here again when we return,1
239,i will not add to the previous reviews mentioning the facilities and the beauty of the architecture i would rather add to them the outstanding attitude of the staff there from the front desk mariano to customer service suzanne the operations manager jaume and all the room service and concierge staff members it makes you feel that you know all these people for so long even though on a short stay we were upgraded to a suite on arrival and hence got the full treat it will become our next destination every time we visit the city,1
240,we just came back from barcelona where we stayed at el palace hotel i just want to say that it was one of the best hotels i ever stayed everything was amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous with a prime location our room was beautiful and always clean the housekeeping was doing a great job every day the stuff at the front desk and the guys at the door were just amazing always friendly and always helpful the guy who spoke russian was the one that we talked the most i regret so much that i forgot his name he was always caring and attentive and always went beyond his way to help us i would like to point out a special lady by name julie who made our stay unforgettable my husband was in touch with her before our arrival since it was our year anniversary we were given an upgrade to a better room and received a bottle of champaign with chocolates including a hand written note from her she took time to meet us in person later during our stay and it was a real pleasure there is absolutely nothing negative i can say about el palace if i am back to barcelona i would only stay there,1
241,i just returned from a stay at the el palace hotel i was most impressed with the staff who truly tried their best to make our stay enjoyable my favorite was amal from guest who went out of her way each and every day she worked during our stay to ensure our stay was perfect and that all of our needs were met she was so very welcoming and warm and helpful amal helped to make our trip extra special i also so enjoyed guiseppe who works in the winter garden restaurant he was so friendly and enjoyable and made our dining experience fun,1
242,what an amazing piece of art in the heart of barcelona every detail is well thought of from the decoration impressive big size of the rooms the roof top terrace with a panoramic view of barcelona best view actually to the extremely respectful staff the professionalism of the concierge who were very helpful in giving the needed guidance surely the palace hotel made our stay my husband and i memorable in barcelona the location as well is perfect walking distance to catalunya place or passeias de garcia and yet very quiet highly recommend this hotel for families or any person looking to have a great stay in barcelona because this hotel will make sure to fulfill all the needs of their customers,1
244,i had a very bad experience with this hotel staying days most of the worst customer services you will ever get especially senior managers of the hotel are not helpful and rude they look tired and they totally dont want to work it looks like if they are making favours to the customers by replying if you booked this hotel just cancel it as it will ruin your holidays which you have worked so hard for they make your stay stressful and without any services at all and its not that close to the centre you still have to get a taxi to the centre by walk it will take you at least min there is no such balcony as on the all you get is one small window looking outside so do even rely on their pictures on the website basically you will flush your money for no service not great room not great view breakfasts has no choice at all very poor prices are too high for such place absolutely waste of money,0
245,the hotel looks very and clean the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was not small which is the case in many other hotels also the shower was perfectly spacious hotel was right at the beach and a bus stop was around the corner,1
248,i bought this trip through travel republic as a surprise for my husbands birthday i emailed ahead and asked for a nice room with a view as it was a surprise i had booked transfers arrived and there was no one waiting for us we waited for half an hour but nothing we walked minutes through the terminals and we came across the transfer office they did not apologise just made a phone call and said minutes minutes later still nothing so i went back to the desk and they made another call and said minutes we were completely fed up by this arrived at the hotel and the lady on reception told us to check in at and took our bags and gave some information about catching buses etc she was the only helpful person i came across we collected our luggage and went to the room yes we had a sea view and the window opened wide which was nice and that is the only good thing i can say about this hotel the room is in dire need of updating walls are badly marked and when u pull back the curtain there was mould the bed was hard and the only plug socket you could use was if you unplugged the lamp or fridge trying to get ready was a big issue as a woman the hairdryer was in the bathroom but getting ready in there was impossible no air con in bathroom gets too hot to,0
249,eurostars monumental is a great choice for a stay in barcelona just a minutes walk from the monumental metro station and a minute walk from the sagrada familia there is a supermarket next door and many places to eat and drink are also a relatively short walk room was very spacious and comfortable beds were very comfy bathroom was a good size and shower was great breakfast is a buffet service which had plenty choice of both hot and cold food as well as drinks my only negative around this is the the breakfast room is very small and fills up quick so i can imagine this can be a problem at busy times,1
250,stayed here for nights last week and was disappointed the good point is the location lots of restaurants within walking distance of all metro station virtually outside the hotel but even as a base this hotel falls short of reception tiny bar in corner of reception never saw it being used this is a shame because after a days sightseeing its nice to have somewhere to sit and relax there was no atmosphere as its in the reception theres a small amount of chairs that need replacing as etc most reception staff helpful the younger girl on in an evening doesnt speak english or french so there was no way of communicating our problem to her so we gave up a hour reception needs staff fluent in more than one language everytime we passed reception she was on her mobile rooms were small with inefficient air conditioning all buttons had been removed on the control panel to prevent people turning it up as the room was small it was very stuffy there was no option of opening the windows as the traffic noise the room needs updating the beds were very hard and cheap quality and we were woken numerous times by doors banging loud noise inside the hotel and drilling on one would expect making facilities in a was a disgrace didnt even bother going on the last day it is in the basement in a small stuffy airless room with no windows there are only tables and no,0
251,we booked this as a top secret hotel on it was supposed to be a hotel we thought we pay a bit extra to treat ourselves and were really looking forward to our holiday in barcelona the hotel staff was quite friendly however the room was a tiny dingy cupboard there was no ceiling lighting in the room as there was only one free power point we had to unplug one of the bedside lamps if we needed to charge more than one thing which plunged the room into near darkness the wardrobe was also so small that only one of us could unpack the luggage for our week long trip when we arrived the safe was working because the batteries were run down we asked to have them replaced but they used such cheap batteries that it continued with low battery warning very very disappointed this is definitely not a hotel,0
252,been there for nights on very nice hotel nice room very clean very nice neighborhood with restaurants and coffee shops all the receptionists were very nice and try to help with every value for money,1
253,hotel glories is clean with large rooms and the staff are had a very enjoyable stay in our air conditioned room located close to the strada which was the main reason for our visit perfect,1
254,we stayed for night here in july and it was great the staff were super friendly and nice all of the staff spoke english it has air conditioning and a pool on the rooftop if you want to stay in central barcelona i recommend it,1
256,air conditioning broke and after time of being told someone would fix it they never came no refund or compensation degrees in the room floor heat rises unbearable terribly reception staff too,0
258,just for a two days business trip the location of the hotel is good just a minutes food walk to the beautiful where clean be aware about the inside rooms without a windows will work for two days and if you drink something rest of the hotel is good and clean nice service,1
259,the location of the hotel is perfect las ramblas is about minutes away gothic quarter is about minutes away there are markets and restaurants right around the corner the staff is very friendly when we arrived they were outside waiting for us and helped us with our luggage check in was smooth and the front desk receptionist even came up with us to show us the room and how to work the ac the room is kind of small but good enough to satisfy our needs our room view is great we facing one of the side streets our room has a mini fridge but it does not have a microwave or a coffee maker there is a safe but it old school and it does not come with a key the front desk said they would hold our stuff if need be the room does not come with an iron but if you ask for one at the front desk they will provide you with one there is no ironing board i guess my only complaint is that the hotel is missing some of the amenities most star hotels include this hotel is nice but it should be advertised as a star hotel rather than a star,1
261,i stayed in this hotel last week for several nights and it was great the hotel is located on the street right next to the la boqueria market the ladies at reception were so nice welcoming and willing to help they were the greatest breakfast is not that good did have much options to choose from but had fresh orange juice and great coffee each morning rooms is good size including balconies right to the fabulous i would defiantly recommend the hotel,1
262,we decided to stay here because it was in the heart of la ramblas and close to the boqueria we loved it here close to the metro buses restaurants beach etc we had a room in the front overlooking the la ramblas and it was in june we had the airconditioning on at all times so we had no need to open the doors yes opening the doors noise but keep the airconditioning on and we slept all night with zero issues the breakfast was average i would buy it especially being next door to the boqueria you can eat there everyday it was clean convenient and close to it all i would go there again,1
263,lets begin where our journey started we looked up the prices through and a dutch travel agent called tui the travelagent offered a superior twin room which was also a roomtype on the website it was combined with a flight the price was about the same so we booked trough tui when we arrived at the hotel it was very clear that the room that was booked for us was not a superior room but a standard room we tried to change this because we booked a superior room but according to the manager he offered this room as a superior instead of the real roomtype because of the company were we have booked the room this was unbelievable for us he just laughed at us and did nothing to help us with this problem he did not listen to our story but was only looking at the line with people who wanted to check out behind us because everything was full we had no other option to stay in the room is interior in a building it looks like a closet and does not have enough space for two persons who stay nights there is a semi double bed but this wasnt even close to the worst things every night we heard noises from the room next to us there are a lot of young people in the hotel that like to go out every night that fine and fun but when they came home at they kept talking,0
264,beautiful and comfortable hotel min from the beach and min to the main street la rambla hotel is very clean and the rooms have air condition on the floor there is a beautiful terrace with a well furished bar and a little price is well balanced with the quality they offer,1
265,has this a star hotel but it is clear why the rooms are quite basic but comfortable and the staff were very helpful there is a buffet breakfast with a decent range of food and a terrace and pool for guest use we did have swimsuits so did try it out the aircon did struggle a little in the barcelona heat but i still had a comfortable night it is close to the barceloneta port and the gothic quarter,1
266,my first booking at this hotell great location by the end of la ramblas and the gothic quarter swift even though i arraived very early in the morning got a good clean room with a good bed,1
267,what a great hotel only two stars but we went off the reviews on and here and got ta say it great staff very friendly and helpful the roof terrace has a small pool and a bar that does cold food to a high standard and whichever cocktail you ask them to make really good sun trap and everything done to a high standard the rooms are small but well presented and very clean no fridge but much better than most star hotels i stayed in before but the the location is amazing in the gothic quarter it is a short walk from port olimpic short walk from the main square in the town centre and short walk to tourist hot spots the tour bus route goes right past the hotel too highly recommend best value for money hotel i ever been in and i tracked maybe five times a year,1
268,located at start of residential eixample district good value clean nice sized rooms and bath good ac close to public transport and lots of bars restaurants nearby try ugot for breakfast or lunch just across street some rates include free parking,1
269,we stayed here for days in july staff was friendly room was clean this hotel is near to city attraction this is easily accessible from metro as well as airport aero bus we really enjoyed our stay,1
270,this is a nice hotel close to the main city centre attractions easy enough close to a number of underground stations staff were friendly my boyfriend and i would like to mention member of staff miriam in particular she was incredibly helpful with check having to change to a quieter information nothing was too much trouble please send her our regards and best wishes rooms are a good size with a decent bathroom could perhaps do with some slight updating but it totally adequate for a city centre base did not have breakfast with the hotel as there are affordable alternatives nearby would recommend this hotel to friends and family,1
272,not stay at hotel we paid for nights at hotel oasis believing their promises of an inner city oasis what a mistake we made my partner and i are not picky nor do we have unrealistic expectations for hotels all we wanted was a clean comfortable room but from the moment we opened the broken door to our superior room we were extremely balcony doors were also broken so anyone from outside could get in towels were dirty and the was broken initially we decided to put up with these issues but the constant disruption from builders next door tipped us over the edge from early in the morning to late afternoon there were builders renovating the room directly next to us we wake up to the sound of industrial drills and hammers and the smell of dust and cigarettes obviously we were really disappointed and requested to be moved the manager laughed in our faces and dismissed our complaints but promised to move us to a better room later that day we were directed to our new room and i have never been more appalled the smell of cigarette smoke was so pungent that my partner and i began to cough and react additionally the basic ugly wall fittings were falling apart and there were stains all over the walls and lampshades the lights didn t work either sitting in a room knowing that the manager of hotel oasis was probably taking great pleasure in our misery we asked,0
273,this hotel is a treasure excellent rooms breakfast very welcoming and helpful staff the hotel is just from a metro station and from a small supermarket perfect hotel for a city break,1
274,just returned from a three night stay hotel is situated in a area which makes it quite nice as it out of the busy tourist area still offers a lot around with great restaurants supermarkets and a market within min walk the metro in min walk and only stops from the main station the hotel itself is small but adequate staff are a real asset to the business on i discovered that my safe was not working and the receptionist on duty tried to fix it was unable to so called out the maintenance man who arrived an hour later to resolve the issue daily housekeeping was good cleaned the room thoroughly room had an air con which was definitely needed only let down was breakfast service was great and breakfast was neatly presented however the quality of ingredients was not that great which is a shame maybe we were spoiled by eating at one of the nearby bakeries two of the days but i think that this is one area that can be improved upon i would rather pay more charged at pp and have freshly squeezed juice better quality yoghurt etc having said all this it would not stop me staying again overall a great little hotel in a great area,1
275,not too bad a hotel has most things you need we came with our year old son and they provided a cot for free there is also a safe in the room which is free if you ask for a key from get free tv and air conditioning thankfully as if you come in summer you pretty much guaranteed you need a mid afternoon break from the heat if you have a young family and they appreciate it too the hotel is about minutes walk from the rambla which is one of the main shopping streets that leads to the advice take water with you or shop on the side streets for it as in the centre you pay euro a litre and on the other streets off it you pay maybe to cents for the same the same goes for other stuff there was a really cheap mini supermarket on the same block so it pays to look around turn left on the main street to the rambla and turn right and walk for minutes to the fountains they do a dancing fountains show at wednesday to sunday but get there an hour early for a good it pays to work or streets off the main road for shops and quirky little bars and places to eat there is so much to see also the mini bar fridge does great for little things like milk or butter or a bottle of water hotel provides everything you need and the,1
276,all good just a short walk to the harley dealership overall not a bad location little challenging to drive to but doable after a couple of lapes lol this was our last day in spain parking is nearby and this is a plus,1
277,hotel is located near metro and it is in a quiet part of the city the hotel is very clean and employes are very nice and ca give a review on food because i did eat it but i am sure it hotel is not that close to pla√ßa catalunya but it worth going on foot,1
278,stayed long weekend wit my wife nice tidy clean hotel reception staff very helpful and pleasant situated just out the way so nice and quiet but within easy reach of everything used taxis as opposed to public transport very cheap there is a opposite the hotel which is great value and the staff are brilliant very spanish full of locals try it only complaint we had a ground floor room which was quite claustrophobic and dark no view other than a brick wall from the window otherwise the room was fine but if i was there any longer i would have asked to move all in all well worth the money and i would stay there again,1
279,just back from nights at your hotel we had a fantastic time seeing the sights of barcelona nou camp which is a minute walk from the hotel we found the room to be comfortable and the bathroom was a good size and both very clean and was kept that way during our stay breakfast was fantastic such a variety of foods on offer staff where very helpful and friendly during our stay and were happy to answer our questions particularly would like to say a you to goretti who works in the bar so pleasant and friendly always so helpful to us during our stay she is a credit to your hotel we look forward to coming back soon and also in trying one of your sister hotels,1
280,stayed here for nights with my mum for my birthday honestly this place has hardly any faults we were greeted by a friendly security guard by the doors and a helpful polite multi language speaking lady who checked us in with a whole hotel smells lovely probably as a result of the spa in the room had a inch tv in it although we only had english speaking channel room service was excellent and our room was tidied up every day electric beds and air con with black out honestly me and mum felt like we were posh enough to be there the rooftop pool and decking made us feel relaxed and secluded towards the end of the holiday it did become noisy and rife with what seemed like a school trip but ca fault the hotel on that did notice no life guard or staff on the roof though which may have been spa is mainly a water experience with all kinds of different pools this was peaceful and free for guests in the mornings which was a great way for us both to start each day the buffet restaurant always seemed to be closed however we may have just missed opening hours as we were exploring the city every major fault is location me and mum love a good time and it was a while away from most lovely bars very close to the football stadium definitely visit to all staff who were extremely helpful especially our friendly,1
282,located next to the famous nou camp metro nearby many food shops around they are open until about easy to a catch a taxi but we used public transport barcelona center is really nice a must at night time not to mention other stuff i mean lot to see in barcelona anyway hotel was nice and would stay here again,1
284,been there for nights with my wife we also stayed at the petit palace in malaga and madrid the one in barcelona is by far the worst in terms of facilities quite dirty and hotel is currently under renovation and there is dust around the reception area and other communal parts the path to the lift is poorly lit also reception the personnel is quite unfriendly albeit polite they distil relevant information slowly including on how to access the hotel with your hotel card compared to the other two petit palace they have a long way to connection simply embarrassing slow choppy and unreliable breakfast very expensive turn right and walk down one block then cross the street and keep walking down on your left you will find el fornet high quality breakfast for a very reasonable were also unlucky as the other guests were quite noisy and impolite our sleep was interrupted by abrupt noise in the middle of the obliged please stay away analysis very poor,0
286,the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,0
287,i stayed at the petit palace barcelona for nights with people rooms and it was utter disappointment to start off you walk into the lobby and everything is very dark the furniture the walls and a lot of the decorations were either black or very dark which is not appealing for a hotel it gave a sort of muggy look and scary really the hotel rooms had a lot of issues such as doors not locking securely tvs not working and leaking from vents the maid service was also unacceptable after being out all day we stopped by our hotel room around and the room was still not done after calling the front desk they mentioned the maids were gone for the day and the best thing they could do was give us fresh towels just towels i thought that was unacceptable overall although the petit palace barcelona has a good location it does not compensate for the lack of service given to its pros about a walk to las ramblas and main area about a walk to the sagrada familia walk to two different train stations,0
288,having booked this hotel following flattering reviews on tripadvisor six months before we found to our surprise that the hotel was being refurbished when we booked in we had to change rooms three times during our stay because there were certain aspects of the accommodation that were unsatisfactory however the manager alex taranilla and his team dealt with all aspects our complaints in a truly professional manner bearing in mind that this place is being refurbishedthis place has a lot of good things going for it it is located near all the famous sights within to minutes of walking distance the breakfast served by the hotel is truly remarkable in that it caters for all different types of dietary requirements one can also hire bikes for free to tour the cityone thing that is truly remarkable is the management and his team who are kind and considerate and very accommodating to our heartfelt thanks to alex and his teami will certainly stay at this hotel againkind regardstushar trivedi,1
289,my stay at petit palace barcelona was quite unique it started with a very nice room that unfortunately looked like the housekeeper did finish the job in the bathroom the faucet was still running and there was some dirt in the tub otherwise the room was very clean i do think it was a genuine night manager andy handled the situation very professionally he immediately gave me keys for another room of the same type unfortunately the shape was very awkward and smaller than the other room i would have been able to use the desk for work and it did not have a patio like my earlier room he was very apologetic and provided me with a suite to use for the night my stay would have been unenjoyable without andy next morning i spoke with the gm and she was also very apologetic and allowed me to stay in the master suite and sent a bottle of wine the hospitality was great the staff were very friendly the hotel has bicycles to use in the city definitely try to book the suite with the balcony,1
290,the hotel it located a little far from the city center or plaza catalu√±a but it really close to the green line of the metro station and about stops to las ramblas there is a very complete supermarket just around the corner the room are renovated and very spacious with mini fridge and cable tv ac works just fine the housekeeper removed the card from the controller and when we arrived at night looking forward for a cool room was hotter than outside breakfast it average very friendly and helpful personal internet is free of charge,1
292,we stayed at the hotel in april the room was spacious and the kids had a bunk bed in an ante room type space they had a small but well kept green space which was perfect for some running around for the kids and drinks for the is conveniently located when it comes to metro access not many eateries around though there is a big supermarket in a block close by they do have order in facility in conjunction with a local place and must say their pastas and pizzas were good,1
294,we stayed here for nights and were satisfied with the place good staff helpful and friendly the hotel is situated about a minute journey from the centre of barcelona we made the mistake of using the service through the hotel which was so bad pizzas were terrible the hotel is quiet and just what we needed for our stay here the aircon could be cooler with the rooms being a bit warm at night would come back thanks,1
295,the hotel place is a good point and you can go to anywere by bus or metro you can walk in about one hour to reach gothic area of the city or beach but our rooms was good enogh and the service was below average our room was in first floor with a small window if you opened it you could just see emergency exit with ugly view there was any blanket in the room and when we asked for that we recieved a dirty one without cover we had some problem with the safe box too and waited two days until someone came up and fixed it if you want a cheep hotel near bus or metro its a good choice but next time i choose a different hotel for sure,0
296,we stayed for days in we were on the floor with a corner room although the room was on the small side it was very clean and functional the shower was very good with toiletries and a hairdryer provided tea and coffee with an electric kettle is supplied but it is paper cups and no milk provided but that is no problem as there is a fridge and several supermarkets close by the wifi in the room was good and a small furnished balcony overlooking the junction the breakfast was very good with a variety of fresh fruit yogurt rolls cake ham cheese etc every day the coffee was unusually good to say it was from a reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful and there is a computor on the first floor that has a printer which anyone can use free of charge on the floor there is a solarium with sunbeds and table and chairs but the lift only goes to the floor so the stairs then have to be hotel is a wedge shape on a corner of a fairly busy junction but we did not find it a problem transport is very close by either bus or metro to take you anywhere you can walk to sagrada familia and also to the san pau hospital which is a beautiful building now a museum many good bars and restaurants all close by without having to go too from the airport is the quickest and most direct way,1
297,hotel is just minutes walking distance from sagrada familia well connected by buses just around the corner and metro sant pau nearby easy transport access to every major tourist attraction welcoming and helpful staff can book visits to top attractions on offer and skip queuing in line would keep in mind to visit again in the future,1
298,the best thing about this hotel was the location just a few blocks from la sagrada familia and one block from saint pau hospital a lot of cafes bakeries restaurants and mini markets around the hotel itself is just ok but not very comfortable and extremely noisy possible to hear people talking flushing toilets and having a shower in the other rooms at all hours beds and pillows could be better too no places to put the suitcases at all lights are really weak in the room shower has good pressure but it not well built the bathroom completely floods after a shower as there no door also the bathroom ceiling was moldy and the exhaust fan had a lot of lint and dust which flew around while it was on the staff at the reception was polite not very friendly but one of the ladies was very helpful,0
299,this hotel is located in a very good position for las ramblas and all central areas excellent service staff were very helpful check in very swift and efficient hotel clean with modern facilities the breakfast was very good catering for all needs fantastic room on high floor at front of hotel good and free to use would recommend to all visiting barcelona,1
300,this was our final stop on a bike trip from the uk parking for the motorbikes was clean and secure and a good price as was the hotel room were friendly rooms were clean and breakfast was a decent variety of foods to suit all sweet and savoury location was fab a short stroll from a lot of tourist sites,1
302,one of the best hotels i ever stay exellent location just to minutes walk to any key point super friendly stuff spacious modern well decorated and very clean room with fast site parking lot for very attractive gives me experience that i was expecting from overbooked summer sure will come break administration must place additional information regarding location of parking lot on hotels web site its really difficult to find it,1
303,good hotel in a great location in the city people in the reception where very welcoming and helpful we also ate breakfast in the hotel which was very good lot of places to eat and shops around the hotel,1
304,this hotel is in a really good location ten minutes from placa catalunya and two minutes from casa balto it has very friendly staff we also had a very nice room with a good city view and a balcony with a table and chairs the room was very clean and nicely decorated the bathroom was also clean and had a toilet and large mirror and sink it was a good hotel for a good price and it easy to get everywhere there a hour supermarket round the corner if you need anything and nice cafes around the area it would be a five if it had had tea and coffee facilities in the room,1
305,la entrada muy limpio y el personal muy amables todo estaba bien asta que entre a la habitaci√≥n cuarto limpio pero el ba√±o estaba horrible la regadera estaba sucia con moho podr√≠an usar un poco de cepillado para sacarlo el aire acondicionado no enfriaba parec√≠a una sauna estaba muy caliente the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly everything was fine from there the room was clean but the downside of it all was the bathroom the bathtub was dirty with mold you could see that it needed a bit of scrubbing the air conditioning was terrible room felt like i was in a sauna it was very hot was fast,0
306,absolutely perfect ideal location short walk to lots of major attractions and beautiful beaches rooms are immaculate staff could be any more helpful friendly and welcoming and breakfast was delicious with a vast array of sweet and savoury food on offer rooms were as i mentioned beautiful and clean as well as very secure and noise proof would definitely stay again and recommend ca quite remember the names of the men at the desk but a massive thank you to you both for making the experience in your hotel amazing,1
307,hotel is very well located right next to the avoid the single room it is extremely small for even just one person the double room is is very a good budget hotel,1
309,whilst rooms were breakfast excellent our holiday was ruined because on out of nights our sleep was constantly disturbed by revelers on our floor doors banging people running in the corridor and loud shouting when reception was approached both during the night first thing in the morning they showed little concern and even appeared to be amused no apology was given ironically a card is left in each room with a quote from the dalai lama sleep is the best meditation what a joke,0
310,the hotel is set in a quiet neighborhood in barcelona it is well communicated with metro the room was cozy with comfortable bed and a nice terrace the best was the service the breakfast was also worth thanks we will come back,1
311,clean rooms good location and money value staff not frendly except one young receptionist that just started working there very good english very friendly and helpful supermarket is just across the street and bakery around the corner,1
312,i have nothing to compare with in spain however if i judge this hotel in comparison to star hotels in usa than it is very good hotel ladies at the reception desk were friendly to me and kindly provided any help i needed printing tickets that i ordered online or even helping order the tickets or some other stuff the rooms are clean and have most of the thing one need they supply toothbrush toothpaste shampoo bathgel soap disposable razor blades shaving cream comb shower cap and more the breakfast is quite reach the hotel have restaurant inside with bar however i never seen someone using it the parking place at the hotel is very small about parking places only the parking is very narrow quite hard to park it cost extra and you need to specify that you will need it however since the hotel located in the center there is a big parking place and more expensive available nearby a lot of restaurants close to the place supermarkets across the street inside a room small frig available so after i told you about my personal experience it is up to you to decide,1
313,the hotel is typical stars with a minibar and safe box it is clean and the towels cosmetics etc changed daily the hotel situated at the intersection of the streets carrer de viladomat carrer de valencia and carrer d arago in a calm area the noise from the construction work across the hotel front was felt just one morning for days spent at the hotel the closest metro is at m called roca fort exit cambria the station has exits on one hand the hotel is not far away from the downtown boutiques and department stores and tourist attractions on the other hand km in the humid and hot nevertheless such a position beyond the tourist area has an advantage you may eat better and very good seafood restaurant called the crown marine is located at the intersection of carrer d arago and carrer rocafort esquina carrer carrer de rocafort barcelona normally it is not cheap but the menu served from pm to pm is only euro the dishes of the menu are changed every day and they are all delicious because of the local clients it is almost impossible to find a table up to pm later it is quite possible the trip from the airport to the hotel is possible by taxi subway metro or express bus the bus stop is m off the exit from the main terminal of the airport baggage claim of arrival area on your right the bus is called aerobus the cost is,1
314,stayed here for a long weekend hotel itself was clean and staff were very friendly even had security a short walk from the beach minutes lots of lovely shops and cafes on the way to the beach however central to the bars restaurants beaches and on buses absolutely no concerns and would return to this hotel,1
315,the apartment was delightful we had room and that had a terrace which got the sun around lunch time to around ish if you wanted sun from the start of the day the sun terrace and plunge pool on the roof was a lovely place to read a book and get relief from the heat in the pool it was not at all busy when we were there in the first week of july the kitchen had all the pots pans cutlery and crockery you needed to make snacks and light meals with the two ring electric hob microwave and fridge with icebox for ice a tray of which was ready for us when we got there the layout of the apartment was good and it was spotlessly clean with cleaners visiting daily we could get to the local train station av tipidabo in a minute walk and it took minutes to get to the place catalunya it was so easy travelling around on the metro system with a day travel card the hour reception staff were friendly and efficient and very patient and good humoured while i practiced my beginner spanish tend to go to barcelona once a year and we would gladly go back to this establishment which suits us down to the ground,1
316,i think that this place offered good value nice location close to beach and restaurants and bars also close to metro station i would stay here again thanks to the staff at the hotel enjoyed my stay here,1
317,their staff was friendly ans helpful we were people and booked apartments stay was great with walking distance to eating restaurants and train station there is a grocery store just below the apartment and daily wine can be purchased easily,1
318,very clean very good and helpfull staff good location best hotel manager jose who makes sure that the hotel guests are happy and comfortable by asking them daily about there satisfaction and their comments if any simply the best hotel manager i ever met,1
319,we spent nights in this hotel the staff was friendly and helpful the room was quite small however comfortable we enjoyed the location of the hotel it is near the la rambla de poblenou the street where many shops and restaurants are located plus it is near the metro station,1
320,service and facilities were excellent the staff made us feel at home the front desk staff who checked us in did get his name unfortunately saw that my sister and i were so tired from our travels and did his best to get us a room asap beds were comfy hot and cold shower available basic amenities were provided excellent location as well just a few minutes from restaurants bars and cafe and the beach there is a bus stop right outside and the metro station is just a few minutes walk away we loved our stay here,1
321,hotel catalunya is easy to get to from the barcelona airport take the bus to the plaza catalunya city center and it is a few blocks away it is just off la rambla easy walk to the picasso museum la sagrada familia the basilica of santa maria del mar the public market beach etc the list goes on and hotel accommodations are simple and clean my room overlooked a side street and building so it was quiet a breakfast buffet is across the street in another hotel for a fee or there are shops open early right next door for coffee pastries sandwiches etc the grocery store is a few blocks away for any other needs lots of wonderful restaurants and shops are close by as noted in other reviews the location is perfect,1
322,the best thing about this hotel is the location we did not use a taxi besides when we arrived from the airport and left to go back to the airport we walked everywhere we shopped alot too considering being in the heart of the city the hotel was perfect for our needs clean nice not too small we found it quiet at night unlike the reviews i had read before booking this hotel i suppose we were on the side of the building and not the front which mea no balcony but we truly did not need it the was perfect and the wifi is very speedy no complaints here we will be back if we are ever in barcelona again,1
323,great staff great location great breakfast i come back in a heartbeat easily accessible to public transportation and near everything la rambla just minutes away lots of shopping restaurants everything you need for a great trip,1
324,excellent with family children this hotel is so central and was excellent value for money it was approx minute walk from las ramblas and minutes from plaza catalunya catalunya metro station is only around the corner the room had single beds and they said that of my children will have to share a bed this was perfect we pushed singles together and of us slept there and on the other single bed there was no issue with noise outside at night i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone there was no issue with the air con cant comment on the breakfast as we didnt eat here staff were very helpful and friendly,1
325,the hotel if located in gothic quarter just off la rambla street a quite busy street with tourists and party staff was quite welcoming at our arrival and helped explain everything in detail the hotel has hours reception desk they also provided sleeping cot for was quite simple no eggs or meat there were some corners in the bathroom that were a bit rusted so a bit eyesore but everything was working fine just a refurbishment is due,1
326,the hotel is situated in a great location just off the ramblas the staff are very friendly very welcoming and went through everything we needed to know on check in the rooms are small and basic but are kept very clean and tidy what more do you need when you are in barcelona we certainly did spend much time in our room i would definitely stay here again it is a fab base for getting out and about and seeing everything that this beautiful city has to offer,1
327,i am currently staying here and this place has been nothing but a was very expensive for a four star yet shower gel is just a basic pump style thing that you get at a budget get a measly five bits of tissue conditioner coffee was told what is with the kettle is what you get and nothing else only tea uncomfortable poor breakfast ca believe i paid extra for thisonly positives are that the room was always left clean and the inside of the hotel is quite modern and disappointed and there no chance i ever recommend this place to anyone,0
328,the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,0
329,hotel situated in eixample little on the edge of most of the tourist attractions but easy to get to them close to a metro stop rooms are a little compact but clean and comfortable could do with extra pillows in the room bathroom well proportioned good breakfast also served til quite late which was helpful a nice little find,1
332,across from the famous ciudadela park this is a delightful place to dine very good food attentive staff well worht a stop if you wandering the park or arc de triunfo area i am reviewing the food not the hotel,1
333,great hotel with great location close to everything and the ramblas is just minutes walk close to the sea and port and the mall the room is a little bit small then other hotels i have been but it was very beautiful and had everything we needed the staff was very polite and answered every question we had,1
334,this hotel was located in a perfect place on the main street of laietana near the waterfront one block and you are in the heart of the gothic district and across the street is the area for best restaurants where local dine the front desk staff were particularly helpful for a first time visitor to barcelona the room was quiet with comfortable beds,1
335,this hotel would be a star in australia but even then you would get some complimentary coffee or water in the room safe broken no mini bar no room service they have vending machines hotel bar never open receptionist bell boy managing entire hotel to their credit room was nice bathroom amenities are basic sachets of soap and shampoo no toothbrush body lotion etc was expecting so much more for the was its great location and housekeeping service,0
336,this is a centrally located hotel in barcelona right on the square at the barcelona cathedral very convenient to picasso museum shopping and restaurants buffet style breakfast is good but over priced stop in at a nearby cafe instead great beds and shower,1
337,perfect hotel close to sagrada familia plenty of restaurants and bars around for various dietary needs minutes to el clot metro station giving you access to the city clean tidy and well presented the rooms were a good size and comfortable would definitely return and would recommend,1
338,i have to say the location is excellent close to las ramblas seafront and old town apart from this it is not worth the money it is a four stars hotel quite expensive and you pay for the location we booked for just one night so we were going to stay much in the hotel anyway but we arrived at and the rooms were not ready yet they told us to wait for about one hour i asked what was the allowed check in time and they said we wanted to have lunch as we had eaten yet and i even asked to have two rooms who were next to each other that we did mind but they said it was not possible as they would be different price rooms etc so we left and came back about two hours later for the bathroom they only give you three little sachets of shower per person not conditioner body lotion or any other thing you can think of not enough for four stars in my opinion horrible window view to interior patio there was a safe but instead of a code there was a key lock but no key the next day we went for breakfast and the lady asked us to go back to the room to get the room number paper and honestly it could not be worse chistorra and sausages were cold we came down at as we had to catch a train and bad albondigas looked like,0
339,all excellent good location good air con cleaness staff facilities just did have time to enjoy the swimming pool my sister tried but it was full she went back to the room lovely balcony very comfortable bed,1
340,we booked this hotel for a short break to celebrate silver wedding anniversary staff were very attentive and polite giving us a free upgrade to newly renovated junior suite on arrival along with complimentary drinks the room was nicely decorated immaculate with a super king bed seating area satalite tv bathroom was spacious with separate wc and separate walk in shower unfortunately we did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to see as much of barcelona as we could in the day visit hotel was situated in the residential area which suited us as the city centre was very busy and noisy close to clot metro station approx min walk and minute walk to sangradia familial basilica which is a must see lovely street of cafe bars near the basilica used the tour bus for day which made it easier to see the city only wished we had booked a day pass as there was so much to see would definitely recommend this hotel and hopefully will return soon to complete the tour of this lovely but very busy city the reception staff were outstanding and helpful and always asking us by name how we were and is there anything they could help with,1
341,if you are courageous enough to use the metro then this is a good location as it is only a minute walk from the nearest station the breakfast is quite good depending on who the grill chef is that day one guy is very friendly and very competent while the woman seems grouchy and is not quite as good kamil is a friendly server that always smiled while she worked and always made me feel welcome the rooms are good with a small balcony i did use the balcony except at night when the air was cooler the only challenge is that if you want to try a nice restaurant with some atmosphere you may need to jump on the metro and hit the city center back alley ways or the ramblier drive there is not a lot of great options near the hotel although the food at the hotel is quite tasty,1
342,a very comfortable stay for family of very close to more expensive hotels but for considerable lower cost excellent wifi shower air conditioning helpful and available front desk some street noise and neighbors can be loud in stairwell but no complaints otherwise small set of stairs to elevator very happy with the accommodations,1
343,my family and i stayed at the splendom suites for almost a week in june the location is outstanding situated near the center of the city in the beautiful eixample neighborhood basically everything we wanted to do was a short and inexpensive cab ride or short to moderate walk away the staff of the splendom suites were very friendly from the desk to the cleaning service to the nightly bed we stayed in a suite which easily housed four people the room was very well equipped including a washing machine kitchen appliances and wares and a private rear balcony the room also featured a second outer set of on the front to help noise from the streets which made it much easier to sleep i not only would gladly stay at the splendom suites again i would also look there first for available reservations if i were to return to barcelona,1
344,shame they did not warn these young people in a graduation came at to and they charge th√®me an additional night absolutely unfaithfull way to make money on the back or young and unexperienced people do send your kids,0
345,this is a very trendy hotel that offers wifi daily breakfast and a friendly staff who speaks english it steps away from the metro train restaurants shops and the supermarket also it minutes away from high end department stores which is why it located in one of the nicer part of barcelona,1
346,great location in the centre but close enough to the beach exceptional staff that is willing to go the extra mile they were friendly professional and helpful the breakfast was ok but the chef made up for the limited choices by being helpful and efficient the eating area was clean and looked out onto the golf range,1
347,as quaint and charming as the city itself small like most of the hotels in the city it is well appointed with cafe tables in front a nice breakfast room and a roof top pool easy walk to many city attractions,1
348,a second recent stop over at the catalonia barcelona golf this time with our son in a triple occupancy just what we needed for a couple of nights clean comfortable room friendly and helpful reception staff very convenient for the gracia part of barcelona did eat in at all there are many nice local bakeries as alternatives,1
349,excellent facilities and friendly helpful staff in a fantastic location within walking distance to main tourist areas the hotel did everything they could for us when we needed an extra room at short notice nothing was too much trouble would definitely recommend,1
350,great hotel great location very helpful staff that helped me with my train tickets when i had friendly and fluent in english and spanish breakfast was great i would certainly stay here again taxi stand right outside beautiful rooftop patio,1
351,we were at the america hotel for daysthe hotel is perfect we traveled adult and children we have got rooms with conecting door it was great very clean comfortable bedsthe roof is very nice the best thing was the service very kind and helpfull we will come back,1
352,i stayed here for nights with my boyfriend from the july to the july we had stayed here previously a few years ago back in and were fortunate enough to be offered an upgrade on room view from room spacious and powerful was very comfortable and cosy roomthe rooftop rooftop bar is a wonderful gem to unwind with a cocktail or beer after a day of sightseeing cocktails were nice service efficient and the atmosphere was always friendly both during the day and the night did have time to try the pool out but it looked extremely inviting and ideal for a few hours sunshine it was popular with guests but not overcrowded i will definitely utilise this on our next i found all staff to be professional friendly and hard working and always happy to help out we were made to feel welcome at all times i could fault any of the area some nice bars tapas places brunch spots and shops in the local area within a short walk a wonderful area to another fantastic barcelona trip and a lovely stay in hotel america i will definitely return again soon,1
353,excellent apartments modern spacious and clean only a minute walk to the nearest tube and close by to the fountains we found clubs and bars close by but only a taxi drive from main area on evenings bargain prices would stay here again,1
354,i spent nights with my family at this hotel it fantastic and i never thought this was what i would get kids love the swimming pool and there is free parking value for money and will always recommend it to people visiting barcelona the hotel is working distance to the national museum and plaza espanol quiet and lovely atmosphere minutes drive to camp nou to la rambla and to the beaches i rented a car but there are metro and buses to everywh,1
356,we arrived very early after hours in the hands of singapore charming receptionist was wonderful and stored our luggage and hurried up room preparation he a unfortunately had been used by a convention of smokers disgusting smell bathroom excellent bed comfortable breakfast is varied fresh and delicious,1
357,while visited it was under renovation a smell of paint was spread all over rooms are slightly small but extremely is good for those who like to walk they can reach plaza espanya las ramblas and many other attractions on are very helpful and in the lobby you can get discounts is good,1
358,friendly staff and great location rooms size was good but could hearing people talking and snoring in adjoining rooms breakfast had good variety other than being very noisy could not fault this hotel if you have trouble sleeping i would not choose this hotel,1
359,het hotel needs a renovation my room was dark noisy woke up several times a night and old people at the front desk were very unfriendly the breakfast is very expensive and in an unpleasant basement only the location and the pool are worth its money,0
360,we loved this hotel air conditioning worked well with a nice and clean continental breakfast offered a very large variety of food local and staff were very accommodating knowledgeable and hotel is two minutes walk from la ramblas well located and nice and quiet the only drawback was the lack of a view,1
361,this hotel has a four star rating but does not offer anything close to european four stars standards our room on the first floor was really dark and we had a view on the hotel ac system we asked if we could have another room but were told they had no other room available when they had rooms available to book online the staff is not particularly friendly either the pool area looks nothing like the pictures i would definitely not recommend this hotel as i have stayed in barcelona several times before and you can get a lot better for value for your money,0
362,for a city hotel you ca fault this location the tiny roof top pool is small and really welcome with a bar snacks and loungers no umbrellas maybe a hazard if it windy but ample shade good car parking but very expensive at per day the reception area and staff are very welcoming breakfast good and they even had gluten free bread negativeswe were in room very noisy from you could hear running children and even the lifts opening and closing we would return here when improvements are finished as sleeping areas need modernising,1
363,very conveniently located bars and cafes around easy walk to plaza catalunya where the hop on hop off bus is airport bus shuttles are also within walking distance rooms are clean though old design hotel staff are friendly would recommend superb value for money,1
364,same high standards lovely rooms great staff great location spotless nothing too much trouble only down side was the poor lady looking after us at breakfast she was amazing but needed a helping hand,1
365,spend a lovely few days at this hotel room was very spacious also came with a large balcony which we did request but were delighted with good coffee at of pickpockets in this area very close to metro short walk to la rambla also,1
366,this hotel is just off placa universidad and is a few mins walk from where the aerobus to and from the airport drops you off and collects which is really helpful there is also a metro close by which i recommend using during your stay not a good connection to the airport though maybe an easy min walk to la room was clean and quiet the air con was actually really good comfortable bed the mini bar was pretty good value especially compared to any of the shops only spanish tv channels and no facilities selection was small but everything that was there was fresh and also have a front desk and a really good luggage drop off option i would recommend this hotel as a practical and reliable place to stay with friendly staff no luxury but perfectly comfortable,1
368,this was the third time we have stayed at the regente this time we stayed for days in june and july we booked in september last year in order to secure superior room which has a large terrace and lots of room the staff were as always superb and could not do enough for guests a special thanks to sandra the reception manager all in all this was as expected another excellent stay at a well run hotel in the city centre an extra special thank you to silvia the hotel manager for again making our stay so enjoyable,1
369,am writing my review from the hotel right now the hotel is beautiful a bit older but nothing major the staff here do their best to help you in anyway the breakfast buffet also good hot bacon scrabble eggs and fresh juice the only fault i found with this hotel there are tiny ants everywhere in the bathroom and in the beds before i leave am definitely shaking out my suitcase also if your looking to sleep in it impossible due to the morning rush in the hallway yelling or talking the location of the hotel is spectacular everything is right around the corner from high end shopping down to mac donald lots of tapas to try also if you like u can buy your own wine or beer at the local supermarket with is a min walking distance i forgot to mention if your looking for a night cap check out the roof top patio for your complementary drinks and the sunset absolutely beautiful,1
370,this is a beautiful hotel close to la rambla and also placa catalonia super outstanding service from all of the staff including paulina who was very helpful focus and good service at the beautiful hcc terrace with a wonderful views value for money was ok and the breakfast presentation and quality just outstanding stayed july travelled with group,1
371,hcc regente is in a great location within walking distance of many sights and a metro station there are also many restaurants cafes and bars close by staff at the hotel are very friendly rooms are nice without being exceptional and the buffet breakfast is excellent the rooftop bar is small but nice and the small pool is a great way to cool off after a day of,1
372,we upgraded the the room and got room at the top floor with balcony and street view but the room is very small the brekfast is good the hotel is minutes walking to catalunia square but the hotel located in center so you have many options around,1
373,great hotel with a great location stayed here for nights and had a wonderful time the rooms are nice and cosy they have everything that you need staff is very helpful and friendly they will tell you what all to visit and how to get there breakfast is ok nothing out of the world but just basic food it has a mcdonald right outside and handful of restaurants around the main airport line metro is just steps thanks for the awesome service,1
375,we stayed for days at madanis hotel recently we were given the floor room which was always tidy provided with a brilliant housekeeping service as we were very active in barcelona trying to see as many things as possible we did not spend much time in the hotel however there are many touches that made our stay a pleasurable experience first of all the staff they were all really nice and helpful constantly smiling especially the lady at reception when we checked in she gave us a map of barcelona and immediately circled around all the most important and interesting sites to visit which was very nice of her staff were all really responsive and first class spot on i also work in a hotel in england and i must say that the details in madanis are most certainly worthy of the it has,1
377,daughter paid for this trip for xmas present lovely clean hotel perfectly positioned for camp nou and close to metro to get into the city ate here one night and could fault the food or the lovely waiter would definitely recommend,1
378,we stayed at this hotel in second half of july the location is simply unbeatable it is right on the main ramblas street next to placa de catalunya metro station bus stops hop on hop off stops and dozens if not more places to eat and drink nearby however the room and bathroom were a bit small we expected bigger based on the photos on room was basic with a tv and wifi no mini bar and no coffee service the room was clean and the balcony facing the ramblas street was good to watch all the activity,1
379,stayed for nights excellent central location on main street for access to metro hop on hop off tours airport bus that came with downside of noise at night which did affect my sleep room was clean bathroom was very tight on space and i could see difficulties emerging for customers who may be obese as hard to close the door pass by the toilet to get into the shower breakfast room was clean also fresh fruit of bananas apples and oranges fruit juice water of cereals croissants and bread for toasting were available for guests never met staff members in breakfast room but staff on front desk were friendly and have no hesitation recommending this hotel for a city break just try and reserve a quieter room,1
380,this hotel is a little gem right in the heart of the city great location and friendly staff the rooms are nice clean and more than adequate you can fall out your bed and straight onto las ramblas it is also very handy for the aerobus bus stop,1
381,this hotel is amazing location in centre barelona room is comfortable and reliable price is not bad friendly staff it on the la rambla everything is easy to reach the environment is a bit noisy but a place where barselona is a place to live,1
382,excellent location rooms are luxurious and clean perfect quiet airco and very good breakfast diner possible with nice price menu of the day for wine included metro and bus stops within and close to casa batlo,1
383,it a nice centeral hotel easy to walk every direction close to atractions hotel staff is helpfull we came face to face with heavy rain eventhough we are in the middle of summer they gave us their umbrella and really friendly people,1
385,the location of this hotel is enough to make it a perfect stay it in the heart of barcelona and real close to everything the rooms are rather big and clean the breakfast is great for europe wifi is free and it the negative reviews here ignore the fact that it a star hotel the only drawback i can think of are the pillows being too hard but maybe it a local thing,1
386,a very good hotel in an excellent location just off la rambla less than minutes from pla√ßa de catalunya where the airport shuttle bus runs from the room we had was a reasonable size clean breakfast was a typical continental buffet with cold meats cheese bread cereal yoghurts excellent coffee a great way to start the day english language tv limited was limited to bbc world news but at least we got weather attractions including the beach zoo la pedrera barcelona gaudi la sagrada familia cathedrals are within reasonable walking distance if you enjoy walking park g√ºell is a short bus journey from pla√ßa de catalunya,1
387,i booked this due to it location and i really happy with my choice my room was on the second floor with the window looking out on to the anna is a nice little hotel is very clean i think it been redecorated recently the walls curtains and bathroom look pretty fresh the beds are comfortable as are the pillows this is really important the shower has great pressure and is easy to adjust the temperature the staff are friendly and helpful the only thing i did like was breakfast i would bother unless you happy with toast or a had a spoonful of yoghurt which tasted artificial and it had beef gelatin in it that a bit also had a bite of an apple it was a nice apple so i ended up buying my breakfast from the local i think if you ca provide a nice breakfast then do bother providing breakfast because half of it will be thrown in the bin anyway other than that everything was fine i would stay here again,1
388,this is a really nice hotel located in a perfect location just off la rambla the staff were all lovely with really lots of useful information available my room was small but well furnished with some nice touches including a welcome basket the only thing lacking was the absence of electrical power sockets my travelling companion and i both like to charge our devices and this was not easy the rooms were very clean and well maintained with good wifi and hot water breakfast was also good for the money and the barista making fresh coffee was really nice some more high fibre cereal would have been good but the yoghurts and croissants were really nice i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value centrally located hotel for a reasonable price,1
389,this hotel is situated in a lane that leads to la ramlas our second floor room was spacious and accommodates it had a bar fridge and a lovely snack basket chips juice the bathroom was clean and spacious toiletries were provided the breakfast was excellent at the end of the lane you have access to taxis buses and the metro about minutes away is the tour buses it is cheaper to book for days we booked for days as there was so much to see and we still have not seen it all across the park was the airport shuttle the pedestrian walkway was always busy with tourists as there are many top brand and local shopshere also lots of restaurants we were spoilt for choice shops and restaurants are open till late many theatres in the area spanish dancing at the other end of la ramblas is the sea we would love to return and stay in the same area,1
392,great location new and clean rooms great hospitality lovely and caring employees just a little bit small rooms but it did bother us very good restaurants around you could walk lots of places,1
393,me and my friends stayed here for nights and we left booking to the last minute so when we came into barcelona we had absolutely nothing booked lucky we quickly found this hotel through and for us it was a little expensive compared to staying in hostels but it was such a nice hotel the staff were so lovely helpful and it was very clean and quant the beds were so comfy and the bathrooms were really nice they had a huge wardrobe as well with mirrors i think it was central to most things although we struggled in barcelona because it all so busy and it hard to find your way around i would definitely stay here again we did get to try the breaky but then again we did want to pay for it either also the laundry prices are way too expensive but all in all we had a great experience at this hotel thank you to all the lovely staff,1
394,our family of four adults stayed in barcelona from and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel accommodations we found the hotel staff very helpful with answering all of our questions about getting around where to exchange money where to find a lavanderia laundromat etc the hotel has good security since the front desk staff will let you in and out if they need to step away they will return quickly we had a family room with four single beds the room had tv with a few american channels the bathroom was very large and the air conditioning fantastic we could not have been more pleased with the location and the fact the street was quiet at least for us since we had an interior room my thanks again to the hotel staff for their help especially upon arrival after an all night flight they offered to store the luggage though we opted to use their lockers and pay euro per locker for the day we will stay there again if we return,1
395,this hotel is located on the extension of la rambla so is very close to the main tourist location but far enough away to be safe and quiet there are dozens of tapas bars and restaurants along the street and lots of goods shopping very close we were able to walk to both cathedrals and the water front from the hotel,1
398,nice friendly hotel clean and location for getting around distance from the segrada familia local supermarkets and bars and restaurants and metro witch is great for getting is continental and the same every rooms have no balcony this is an extra and i wish i had payed for it as the hotel has no pool only a small sun terrace on the check in staff spoke english and were helpful in helping us plan out barcelona not many people speak got back to this hotel for a weekend,1
400,worth a visit get a guide it worth the extra we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit inside and out our guide from trivago was extremely knowledgable and answered many questions he seemed to know everything,1
401,very comfortable hotel with all amenities food in restaurant and breakfasts excellent reception staff polite and knowledgeable particularly about local transport pool very clean and quiet stops on metro into barcelona or a bus stops outside hotel big enough to accommodate groups without affecting couples and families,1
402,they do understand the difference of freezer and refregerater when i was check in at midnight i asked the staff to freezed the icepack that i brout form my home because to make it cool to carry my sons eye medicine but after four days when i checked out and asked them to bring it back they give me a unfrozened icepack when i complained they just said sorry but now i really worry about the medicine if you are travelling with a child who need special care this hotel is not the right place the staff of this hotel are lack of professionalism,0
403,the hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants it also quite close to the zoo a bit further than the nearest metro station there is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the aquarium nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty large room for the rest of town we had to use the metro which means x to walk the line close by is not really well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere the view well if you see the sea it ok the sunrise was quite orange some of the buldings nearby look however depressing,1
404,the staff are friendly and could help us enough but the breakfast menu was a bit overpriced apart from that it was a lovely hotel it was close to the beach and shops i had a decent night sleep and really enjoyed my stay,1
405,stayed with husband and son for a long weekend location is fab very close to beach and fab restaurants cafes and bars a stones throw from the hotel due to recent surgery i have mobility issues so this was just perfect we walked to beach and picked up tour bus which allowed us to see barcelona without much walking pool is small but sufficient for our needs no pool bar but plenty of supermarkets round about to buy your own drinks etc that you can have at pool no towels either so most people used towels from their room did have breakfast in the hotel as plenty of places round about to try rooms are a good size and very clean air conditioning very effective perfect location for us and we will definitely return,1
406,almost everything was good the desk and the room service was excellent i think the breakfast was over priced unless you wanted to gorge yourself we had breakfast at a little bar mar i the cetre ville plaza ham omelette toast coffee jam euro each salads were great deserts not so good tirimisu nothing like came out of freezer still frozen in not comment on the pool or fitness centre as we travelled from canada and we do not want to lounge next to a pool when the beach is mins away,1
407,we enjoyed our days stay at ilunion barcelona in the heart of poblenou the streets around the hotel have a quiet provincial atmosphere as the whole area its location is very convenient a minutes walk took us to the popular playa del bogatell on one side and to the lively rambla del poblenou on the other and it only blocks to llacuna metro station where we could easily reach the city centre we also found a taxi stand just opposite of the hotel to go to the is modern clean relatively recent with a design decor lobby is spacious and stylish amenities and services were suitable staff was efficient we used the business center but neither the gym nor the pool we ran away from the breakfast hall looking like a shopping mall cafeteria our room was large bright functional silent with comfy beds including the extra much it costs has varied from day to day one night was quite expensive,1
408,we stayed there nights days a mint walk from the beach there a ling street right on the corner mint walk filled with bars and resturants even halal food is available there are also small spas nail and facial a couple of supermarkets location i cant say mint walk from metro station everything you need is there also you serrounded by bike shops used the taxi to city center because my grandma could walk you oau around one way mints away by are not comfy and if you book a triplet room they give you a roll on extra bed they dont have rooms with main beds and yes the rollon beds are even worse than thier main beds if you have a back problem or care much about your sleep i dont recommend it but there are many positives that makes me overlook the bed cleaning staff arent very dedicated tou have to tell them specifically to clean around the sink and to change tour bed covers even i saw the cleaning lady taking the bed civer from the room facing our and putting in our room instead of getting a new have little staff if you want something you need to go down get it youself most of the time even the bags we mived them by ourselves they do keep your bags after checkout for friendly staff i must say always smiling they do have a tourists office but they try to help as much as offered,1
410,nice hotel with spacious rooms much larger than usually found in barcelona location is great to go to the beach while still quiet because it is not too close to the hectic city center we checked in late and ariel was great in fact all front desk staff was super friendly and helpful we also enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the morning and the rooftop pool which is a bit small but so cool definitely recommend,1
411,great location in a nice quiet area close to metro and other transportation minutes walk to big shopping mall very friendly staff and always helpfull brekfasthall kind of small and very little space,1
412,was very impressed with the room size and what it had to offer including mini bar and a balcony the service the staff provided was spot on and could not fault anything they did i would definitely come back,1
413,i stayed here in may only remembered now to do the review as i was looking up other places in barcelona as i am going again next stayed here with a friend and as soon as we got out of the taxi when we arrived at the hotel there was an over powering smell of the hotels fault but just pointing it nice clean hotel and good breakfast were so of the days in the late afternoon i had a bad migraine i tried having a nap before dinner and the room next door to us had music on full blast with their doors open could sleep or even hear myself think i phoned down to reception to ask if they could ask the guest to turn the music down a little which they did as we were leaving the hotel to go to dinner i complained again about the music at reception where the receptionist just laughed at me and said they could play music if they wanted as a paying guest like everyone else our comfort and every other guest should be a priority also the cleaner took our spare room key from our room while we were at the pool and when i confronted her she reluctantly gave it back to me it made me a little uneasy as to why she would take our room key security at this hotel is the hotel is a short enough distance to the beach and there is a lovely,0
414,i liked this is near the city center and the subway room was very clean and bathroom was clean and breaksfast was very good international buffet stayed nights,1
415,this is a good budget hotel the room was clean and functional the bed was comfortable and the staff were pleasant and kindly looked after our bags for several hours after checkout it is also well located fairly close to two metro stations we decided the breakfast was too expensive to justify the one thing to be aware of is the traffic noise in street facing rooms as the hotel is on a very busy street barcelona has more than its fair share of crazy drivers and they thrash around at ridiculous speed including on ear piercing mopeds this starts as early as i know that as i was woken by them at around that time in our third floor room if you are anything other than a very solid sleeper and are in an aforementioned street facing room please remember your earplugs,1
416,very clean nice and safe area many cafes shops around not too close to the center but transport makes it easy helpful staff nice sleep quiet at night we got the information we needed for nightlife called a cab for us when we asked separate room to guard our luggage before the flight,1
417,we stayed here at very short notice and we were made very welcome by the excellent reception staff the room was of a high quality perfectly clean and the bed very comfortable it is a good place to stay should you be in this area of the city an dis a short walk from good bars and restaurants,1
418,we booked a family room and instead got a very tight room with no space for the of us we had paid for the extra spacious room but it turned out they had room is stuffy as there is no circulation of bathroom is small and floods with water after reception has a strong smell that i ca quite place it like a damp staff are fairly friendly the location was the only excellent thing as you could walk or commute with would stay there again though at least not for the price they charge,0
419,the hotel located with many cafes shops and metro nearby however the room does match with the photos shown online the room is old and small a bit expensive for this size of room i stayed nights the hair dyer is attached on the wall and broken on the first night the staff came up and tried to fix but not success and do not have a spare one to borrow i told them that i will go out early in the morning and hope it will be fix or switch room or they need to buy a few hair dyer that is not attached to the expected they can not fulfil any of my time is noon the cleaner started knocking hard on my door at and and woke me up twice and they ca speak english i have no idea what they want it was scary when i i complained to the front office and suggest them to make some do not disturb sign and avoid this happen to any of the tourists they mentioned the sign is on the desk but not hanging on the door and it was not in my room,0
420,this was a short break for myself and daughter booked through secret escapes the hotel was very central just a five minute walk from last rambla the receptionist was very friendly and informative our room was small but clean we followed instructions for the safety deposit box but could get it to work we see told it would be done the next day not ideal to carry your valuables around the city complimentary wine and glasses after use were left in the room for our entire stay despite housekeeping every day the lights in the bedroom stopped working after the first day we were advised to play around with them until they worked did then the bathroom ceiling leaked water from the upstairs room breakfast was varied and acceptable but food remnants remained under the tables after tables were wiped on our checkout surprisingly we were asked if we enjoyed our stay,0
421,two very tired teachers stayed here recently july as a quick break away to start of the summer holidays the hotel could not have been better fab location min walk to the main square with help from the very friendly hotel staff who were on hand everyday sorry to tell us the best places to visits and what to do in barcelona our room was cleaned everyday and was very modern and ideal for us we never wanted to leave thank you to all the staff for your help and guidance we had the best holiday love katie and priya x,1
422,wow a great hotel if you are looking for somewhere smart but not in an ostentatious way then this is the hotel for you tucked away from the hustle and bustle but not too far to walk in what we would describe as a trendy up and coming area modern quirky and a great place to stay we loved the feel of the hotel right from stepping of the pavement friendly accommodating staff who spoke good english sorry our spanish was so bad just the type of place you would want to be seen in a lovely room with an amazing shower that i need in my life for days of the year not the we stayed a hand written note welcoming us on arrival the latest edition of a glossy fashion magazine to read on the desk bluetooth speakers comfortable beds controllable air conditioning great lighting a good choice of products for all those things you forgot to pack good quality towels and linen lots of considered touches that we enjoyed we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends we are now looking to stay at another hotel in the chain for our next break good value for money too we had a great stay thank you,1
423,this hotel was outstanding they gave us an early hector at the front desk was very helpful anytime we wanted to get a restaurant recommendation they knew exactly where to send us comfy and amazing breakfast yummy loved our experience,1
425,we stayed one night and had two rooms for people rooms were spacious and comfortable did not eat at the restaurant because the breakfast price was outrageous within a minute walk to one of the hop on hop off bus tour stops which was convenient for us do even think about getting laundry done price is per item for a pair of underwear to be laundered hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood,1
426,had to stay a week for business at the uni which is next perfect perfect staff is clean and despite the few unavoidable traces of wear here and had a one person room and as a result there was not much space one person bed no double bed great location with caf√©s up the street and metro stations minute walk from la your experience will greatly depend on where your room is the first days i was in right in the middle of the corridor and with the bed next to the door the light sleeper would have trouble finding sleep when i came back for one night i had and it was much quieter being at the very end of the corridor but the same could be said about any was good too even if i could do without the soft drinks they had for yeah no problem whatsoever recommended for sure,1
427,this was my trip to barcelona and this is my personal experience i have been in hospitality management for over years i am always willing to bend break the policy when it comes to legitimate human life issues of my i prefer to cultivate a relationship based on trust and return business with my clients on july we had a family emergency but even after explaining the situation were denied a refund for the nights stay on the that we could not use as we had to fly back home to on this personal experience when i return to barcelona in i will book elsewhere,0
428,perfect location easy walking to port and ramblas some nice bars in the area for cocktails room was clean and large staff friendly bathroom was clean beds comfortable tv in the walk to hop on and hop off bus stop,1
430,not a bad hotel but when your flight gets cancelled and you let the hotel know that you will be joining them the following evening and you arrive to be told that they have given your room to someone else and the only room available is a double and of you are travelling so my partner had to sleep on the floor the first night of our stay so not a great start rooms were clean and tidy food was good to plenty of choice even for gluten intolerant people,1
432,after a rough wait for everything else went smoothly the room was nice and worked fine it is in a good location easy to walk to la rambla and a metro station the room was clean and inviting the breakfast is a bit expensive but wonderful,1
434,our first trip to barcelona and this hotel is perfectly placed to catalunya and las ramblas room was lovely and the hotel itself is beautiful breakfast and it setting is very relaxing staff are very attentive and polite we would very much stay here again thankyou for making our first visit very comfortable,1
435,with my son and a friend we were in barcelona to attend a football match at camp nou we spent one night at el jardi this little hotel is ideally located in barri gotic area its charming facade is overlooking typical pla√ßa sant josep a drink at the tiny bar del pi we came into the historic building we were kindly welcomed and proposed a cozy functional simple bedroom view from the balcony on the famous catalan gothic church santa maria del pi was really a short but quiet night we came down to eat something and have coffee as the breakfast room was a bit gloomy we went outside and took our caf√© and bu√±uelos at a nearby terrace looking at the city coming to life around the pine planted in the middle of pla√ßa del pi all in all we had a pleasant stay at el jardi,1
436,we enjoyed our stay very much at this hotel itself was ideally placed it was very clean and well presented with some lovely period features and the dining area was very nice our room was clean but only thing we did like was it was an internal room with no window except to a service shaft which was very noisy the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful and i would recommend this hotel,1
437,this is a nice hotel in a historic part of the city dating from it was apparently only the third hotel in barcelona although i do know if the other two are still there i did initially realise it was that old though as it feels like a modern hotel other than a slightly quirky layout the staff are pleasant and lots of letters of thanks are on show in the reception area our room had balconies overlooking the square below which was a pleasant feature the accommodation was functional and comfortable we got the impression the walls of our room were a bit on the thin side when we were awoken by a couple loudly showering and leaving at approx we got a discount of for paying cash which was a nice bonus for good value basic accommodation we would stay there again and recommend to others,1
438,this hotel is good for price and near all kinds of shopping and stores and a big mall loved the staff and they were so helpfull and friendly not the closst to city center but buses and metros are easy to you,1
439,we stayed here for nights and had a great stay our room was quiet enough interior room remember that spain builds and decorates with stone tile and wood hard surfaces sound carries easily in these situations our room was clean and comfortable to move around it the beds were a little firm but good for me and my daughter you ca beat the location it in the middle of everything it so easy to just wander and get lost in the history and ambiance of the area lots of little restaurants around to eat or drink parking in this area is not easy we had to park in the underground lot by the cathedral of barcelona it pricey by the day but you can purchase multiple days in the garage and it gets more reasonable for days once we parked we left the car there even though you get a pass that allows you to come and go traffic getting to the barri gothic is heavy i would definitely stay at this place again,1
440,we crossed path with emirates crew members at the ac marriott forum barcelona we asked them how their stay was they said that their stay was good worth we assume that our stay was good worth as long as they stay with us at same hotel emirates has good taste and right choice where crew members can enjoy and get good value we loved swimming pool and quiet bar on the rooftop of the hotel the hotel is located next to marbella beach and forum shopping mall including grocery store of course the hotel is ideal for families big minus is not reliable computer center where business center is located on ground floor at ac marriott forum barcelona there is forever problem with computers and internet however our stay was good worth anyway,1
441,the first thing to get out of the way here is location its on a square that also includes the basilica santa maria del mar if you are the sort of person who prefers to have a hotel close to all the action this is a great choice less than a minute from la rambla the lanes adjoining the hotel in the gothic quarter are fascinating and even after a week in the hotel we left feeling we not done all of them justice it very close to several metro lines i was attending the barcelona rock festival at can zam the other end of town and it took me about minutes to get there and back even past midnight thanks in no small part to how well connected this area is i wo waste time talking about the numerous food options which have more than adequately been covered but this is also five minutes away from some of the best music stores in the city from big box retailer fnac practically extinct in india and singapore a city i live in and one that i visited of late to revolver records who have two stores one of which specialises in progressive and mainstream rock and the other which is more skewed towards indie and alternative and heavy metal specialty store pentagram the staff at the hotel were pleasant unobtrusive and very helpful whenever we went to them with a specific query the breakfast quite adequate and the wifi fast,1
442,a nice hotel to stay in when on business trip amazing location close to diagonal mare mall rooms are clean comfortable bed u might hear a bit on street noise if you are at lower are very friendly and had the chance to dine at the hotel as i was enjoyed food outdoor in such beautiful city at the best weather,1
443,stayed with family for a recent conference hotel is perfect for a business traveler to barcelona with a family it ok if this were our first visit to barcelona we would be disappointed with the location as it is far outside the center however the links to public transport are excellent staff was very good,1
444,as a very seasoned global traveler i would highly recommend the ac hotel barcelona forum marriott hotel because of the excellent service attentive staff perfect location and comfortable traveled to barcelona for business and found an absolute jewel in the ac hotel barcelona forum the location was exceptionally convenient we had a professional conference at the convention center which is next to the ac hotel barcelona easy walking distance to the metro the metro underground subway is very easy to navigate very clean air conditioned and staff are available to assist if you need help passengers are also a great source for help the people of barcelona are so helpful buy a multiday pass at the barcelona airport or at the metro rooms are clean clean clean the hotel staff are friendly and incredibly efficient we appreciate the staff for their pride in keeping the rooms at the end of a long or hot day take a quick dip in the pool there are poolside loungers tables and more tables inside the restaurant the hotel can provide pool towels and the staff are very attentive enjoy a drink poolside the view is absolutely beautiful across the street is the diagonal mall lots of shopping food choices and good restaurants asian italian spanish we enjoyed an evening of tapas and paella which were very tasty and reasonably priced a grocery story is located inside the diagonal mall get some bread wine cheese a bit of prosciutto and fruit for your hotel,1
445,i had a great time here the hotel is very nice super clean good service and it in the perfect location the area is great with tasty bakeries nice bars and restaurants and a metro station right across the street from the hotel,1
446,the hotel is located in a very good situation near the metro station it has a small lobby the rooms are neat and clean but they are small it has a very very small pool breakfast is very good and delicious the hotel is about to minutes to la rambla street and sea you can find lots of shop and food and cafe nearby,1
447,good centrally located hotel room with a lot of space the airco did not work optimally the breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly while the period that we stayed was very hot it was a welcome to go to the open swimming pool,1
448,the silken concordia hotel is centrally located in barcelona easy walking distance to buses metro etc the staff at the front desk are very professional speak english and are just willing to help you the rooms are well maintained and spacious breakfast well presented and caters for various tastes,1
450,can not rate this hotel highly enough we arrived earlier than expected and was greeted with such warmth and professionalism and unexpectedly they checked us in early and with room far exceeded our expectation for comfort and space considering it a star hotel boasting large beds excellent bathroom facilities storage and dressing table we had views spanning from the sea gothic quarter placa de catalunya to montj√Øc the pool terrace was in the sun all day and the bar has the best sangria we had in our visit called us to barcelona on my business the location of the hotel and the pool facilities enabled me my wife and i to both enjoy some time together so nice to be able to use the pool and sunbathe on a break location wise it could not get any better as it is central to shops cultural attractions our favourite restaurants and bars and just one minute from the metro station whose line services all of the beach stations we will certainly stay at the hotel again if i had been checked into a room that was noisy as other reviews suggest i would have asked to move as our room was very facilities in room but the hotel is flanked by excellent coffee shops which we frequented for breakfast,1
451,this is a pleasant clean hotel with a great location we always choose our hotels for location and this delivered although just a star hotel we could not have asked for a better location it was perfect clean had a swimming pool and served a reasonable breakfast included in our rate all staff were friendly and extremely helpful we emailed ahead with some and they came back immediately helping in every way possible our room was great we had the top floor with a large balcony comprising sun loungers tables and chairs all with a roof top view could not have asked for more the room and bathroom was modern with a huge bed and exceptionally clean we would advise anyone to read the blurb on the hotel as tea and coffe was not supplied in the room however this was not a problem for my coffee addict husband we took a travel kettle with us water was not supplied in the room however a supermarket close by sold bottles reasonably priced there is no concierge however the reception staff are on hand to answer any questions about this city we purchased the open top bus tour through the hotel saving us a couple of euros there is no entertainment here just a bar with little atmosphere buy hey you are in the heart of barcelona go out into this beautiful city and embrace it it right on your door step we enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate,1
452,this hotel was a very good choice for our stay in barcelona it centrally located the subway station is right in front of the hotel the staff was very friendly and the rooms were very well kept we could enjoy the pool so no review about it,1
453,granted this place is clean and in a good location however this is where the positives walls are paper thin so we can at this moment hear the couple on one side of us having a conversation and the cleaner vigorously cleaning the room and possibly rearranging the furniture on the other every time our neighbours take a morning shower at or this morning at it sounds like a waterfall is running down the wall beside our bed we can hear lights being switched on plugs being put in and out conversations tvs hangers being battered in the cupboards and people walking on the laminated flooring the hotel has a pool which attracted us in the first place but do let that entice you since it only gets sun in the morning and the loungers and swiftly taken by people who do leave them all day so no chance of using it until the sun goes down avoid at all costs if you want a good nights sleep in preparation for your busy trek around the city,0
455,spent a week in this hotel whilst attending a nearby conference it is a bit out from the main buzz of las ramblas but easily accessible by tram that stops outside the euros by hotel is outstanding rooms airy and very clean with good air conditioning the staff were all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was outstanding the beach is minutes walk away the rooftop pool ideal after a hard day and there were several good eating places a few minutes walk would definitely stay again,1
456,we paid for the upgrade to include the executive lounge which was not very executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed it was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel have clearly cut back on the staffing of this area at one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty the toilet door lock was broken the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol i thought this level was over there was little or no food available at the key walk in times like this was repeated in the afternoon this is the year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason i booked the hotel but over the last couple of years it seems to have gone downhill and has got progressively worse i thought last year poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days i stayed there this year it is the last time i would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year i did complain to reception but there was no,0
457,we had been looking forward to a short stay in barcelona and picked this hotel due to the modernist architecture which did not disappoint however it was missing the touches you would expect in a good three star hotel and decent four star service was slow from waiting to be seated at breakfast to replacing faulty swipe cards and failure to replace pool towels for afternoon arrivals the worst evidence of the complete lack of focus on the customer was that despite reporting a faulty lock which allowed us to have interconnecting rooms with our children this was not fixed and we spent an uncomfortable night listening out to ensure they were ok this could be a great hotel but sadly just scrapes into the mediocre category we stayed in far better barcelona hotels it a miss and spend your euros elsewhere,0
459,affordable accomodation small room but very clean and modern with small balcony directly across from a subway station as well as in perfect location not too busy but in walking distance to la rambla friendly and helpful staff,1
460,me and my boyfriend stayed here for nights in june we requested a room overlooking the square which the staff accomadated for us many reviews say the hotel is noisy with the doors closed we didnt hear much noise at hotel was clean modern and comfortable the room had a safe which cost euros per day overall we really enjoyed our stay and will be re booking for next year,1
461,in a hotel waited two hours for my booked room got him and he was dirty not enough the reading lamp was destroyed and i feared an electric shock next thing i booked a comfort room and the porter said comfort is the same as standard lost money i think at least remember hours every porter want a copy of my credit card whats going on well i think therme is more to come,0
463,hotel suizo was a lovely little hotel we stayed in a double room which was lovely and clean as was the bathroom too the space is fairly small as expected in a city hotel but the design and layout of the rooms does the best with the space we even had a balcony facing out onto one of the side streets which was lovely to watch the hustle and bustle below also the lovely smells that floated up from the patisserie and restaurants below was also very pleasant we did opt for breakfast with the room as we were wanted to try local places for breakfast the patisserie on the corner to the left as you exit the main entrance of the hotel is lovely for a quick coffee and croissant the croissant con crema is lovely but they are big and very filling the bathroom is small but the design and use of the space is again good the shower has two heads and is powerful the staff were pleasant and helpful also the metro is located just outside so you can jump on the underground with ease you right in the heart of the gothic quarter too the cathedral is just up one of the side streets there are loads of restaurants nearby too we did find the hotel to be noisy considering it location it a perfect hotel for people who are going to be out the majority of the time exploring but want somewhere comfortable and,1
465,my sister and i spent nights in this perfect hotel in barcelona we had room on the ground floor just off the foyer as it was alongside a park with windows on two walls we thought we would never be able to open the curtains and would have noise problems no this area has the best soundproofing and privacy we could ever want no one could see in we tested it and we could hear anything from outside the room was spacious and beds extremely comfortable bathroom and shower were had the breakfast included and found that we made this our main meal of the day so much variety and you could also have eggs cooked to your liking staff were extremely friendly and hotel reception was also amazing asking if you needed a taxi was your day near the reception is a wonderful bar which serves delicious meals at a very reasonable cost all in all i feel it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in,1
466,i stayed with my kid and wife we came to meet our son and i must say the place is right place for those who wants to cook their own food we are vegeterians and place is idle in terms of travel and availability of grocery etc every thing including laundry is with in min walking distance hop on hop off is quite near stop bust stand metro is a stone thriw away like the friendly ness of staff and eagerness to help customers is worth noticing and would strongly recommend family vegeterian or vegan and would live to live peacefully a d near by every means of transport this place is the place for you,1
467,fab hotel as you walk into reception you are struck by the cool air con a relief from the heat and a spa style aroma reception staff are friendly and professional the hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms spacious and the beds very comfortable we did book breakfast initially but were offered it for at checkin a saving of and the breakfasts were well worth it huge buffet style of hot and cold fruit cereal veg meats cheese eggs breads etc catering for special diets also the rooftop pool is small but big enough to cool off in and offers amazing degree views of the city the spa contains a pool with jacuzzi and a steam room there is also a small gym spa treatments are available if you want a little pampering a little expensive but what the hell it only money a great nearby restaurant for dinner is el clot,1
468,i was going to miss my breakfast as i had to check out early by however the kitchen and reception guys made a picnic basket which we had it at the airport very satisfying experience we will opt to return soon,1
469,got a great deal for four nights at this hotel it is a little out of the way but the subway is just over the road and the main attractions really do take long to get to the rooms were spacious with amazing air con we used the gym a few times and it was great did eat at the hotel but the menu looked delicious reception staff were really friendly and helpful too i asked about the best way to get to the airport early and they booked a taxi for me would definitely stay here again,1
470,we stayed in this hotel only nights if you want to have rest you should not stay in this hotel nights marriage parties too loud music until very late also u can here everything of next rooms no ƒ±t is pity bec it is avnice hotel nice deco nice location,0
471,nice clean hotel in walking distance to sagrada familia and shopping area room was nice comfortable and spacious for a european hotel staff was very nice and had great recommendations for dining our room faced the street and although there was some noise overnight it did bother me at all the breakfast was really good it was the best breakfast compared to other hotels i been to in europe overall great experience,1
472,good location about minute walk to the main area lots of good bars and places to eat around here also peaceful the hotel staff were all friendly the room was kept spotless the whole time we were there week the breakfast was good and lots of it also served to which was great after a late night but as a few people have said some days its was stone cold unfortunately our last morning was one of them the minibar wasnt replenished every day but just spoke with reception and they had water sent up within minutes the noise from other rooms was a bit of an issue though constantly heard people walking above us maybe giving out soft slippers and requesting guests not to wear shoes until going out door would be a good idea big bonus though was that the air con and safe were free all in all though a good clean hotel with a fantastic roof terrace to laze out on after loads of walking around a amazing city,1
474,we ended our trip here to relax before a long international flight could have chosen a more perfect place the hotel is clean modern with an attentive staff we had a room with a view of the ocean pool beautiful grounds we had snacks in a pool cabana swam in the lovely pool relaxed in the hammocks perfect beach walk to end the day,1
475,very good location at an area with a long beach strip of km the beach is a wide sandy type and close to the hotel there are plenty of restaurants the rooms are clean with modern equipment wooden floor and a good bed the airco is a little noisy and the tv doesn t have any english news channels on my room was overlooking the and behind that the beach other than that the room was pleasant they have a huge garden with a reasonable pool and area to relax and get drinks you can go to the beach by exiting the garden the breakfast is of a good level mostly self service beware of the wooden structure above part of the buffet i am tall and banged my head on it the service in the afternoon was rather slow there isn t a lot of staff and they weren t very alert it took me half an hour to get a beer,1
477,this hotel was beautiful and most staff were kind and helpful breakfast was good setup at pool conducive to many relaxing areas and hammocks behind were a good napping spot we were on first floor so had a view of pool but kind of wish the beautiful sea was in sight as well maybe on other floors also wish coffee was available in room staff spoke at least some english relaxation was key here,1
478,the room is small and basic old fashion breakfast is only bread and cheese very poor if you are looking for a place to sleep with a good location and nothing more this is the place for any other wishes look for another hotel,1
479,the hotel is very well placed in barcelona its quite close to some of the attractions such as magic fountains as well as metro would have preferred if the spanish architecture is represented more in its interiors recommend,1
483,very friendly staff and service room was very clean and comfortable excellent buffet style breakfast and a wide choice of dishes rooftop pool was smaller than it looks in the pictures and the bar snacks a little pricey although the view from the roof was fantastic,1
484,comfortable room free but limited and very convenient hotel to the metro system and airport rail could do with a maker in the room but otherwise great place to stay breakfast is adequate and plenty of restaurants and convenience stores close by,1
485,really nice hotel with friendly and helpful reception staff great location further west of the main city centre but we enjoyed being away from the main bustle still walking distance to metro and connecting bus routes as per previous reviews we seen there were no facilities in the room which is always nice to have we did have an iron either but used the iron room downstairs in the hotel on the first evening to iron all our clothes which was fine also the wifi inside the hotel worked ok for us useful to be able to message home we visited during heat and the air conditioning in the room was excellent and really cooled us negative was the very thin walls our room had a connecting door to the room adjacent to us and on the first evening we overheard a long intimate exchange which made us feel quite uncomfortable would be happy to return for future visits to barca,1
486,fantastic staff and clean comfortable rooms location is great as well if you want to shop there is a mall across the street see the city the best way to get around the is city is by bus and there is a bus stop across the street in front of the hotel,1
487,hotel itself is very neat and clean with friendly staff just steps to the glories metro stop we never worried about transportation to all the things we wanted to do while in town the roof top offers great views of all the major landmarks of barcelona including the tower directly next door and overall our stay was perfect i would stay here again if i returned to barcelona just because i know what i getting at a reasonable to the wise do not eat any of the food at the rooftop bar we would go to the local grocery store and pick up cheap wine to drink on the roof each night just to soak up the evening but the one time we got food it was disgusting let me also point out that i easy to please but i thought i vomit after eating about half of the roast beef sandwich i bought,1
488,very excellent we enjoyed and all was good we were happy to be upgraded to suite instead of guest room i will recommend this hotel to all the people that i know the staff were nice and helpful the hotel is located at good area easy for shopping and transportation,1
489,wonderful welcoming hotel in a beautiful and vibrant city the hotel staff was amazing the location of the hotel was perfect for us the neighborhood was fairly quiet at night which we love and everything in the city was easy to walk to and if we could walk the metro and taxis were a half block to get anywhere in the city,1
490,this was my time to barcelona the first time staying in barcelona itself went for gf birthday the location of the hotel was good as it was in the heart of the city on our arrival we had an opportunity to upgrade rooms which we did for euros extra a night the room was good clean and of good standard the staff were always friendly polite they told us about the festival of saint joan told us of the fireworks going off all night and the beach parties nearby the atmosphere was excellent for the festival the hotel staff told us of the best places to eat and their own breakfast was of good standard also would go back to this hotel love barcelona,1
491,we have just returned from a whirlwind stay in barcelona thoroughly enjoyed ourselves we stayed for nights and though we did spend much time in the hotel we were more than satisfied the hotel is modern with a small but pleasant reception area the young man who booked us in was very cheerful helpful our room was modern relatively spacious with a walk in shower in the bathroom open double wardrobe in the main bedroom area the hotel is about mins walk from laccuna metro station about a min walk to the beach if you turn right out of the hotel and walk for mins until you get to a cross roads there is a tree lined avenue full of bars cafes restaurants with lots of people milling around lovely to see lots of choice if you want to stay near the beach but still within easy striking distance of the centre than hotel is a good shout,1
494,i came here with my husband and had a great time as it was our anniversary i requested a room on the top floor with sea view our requested was granted and our room had a lovely view of the sea plus we could see the cemetery did not bother us breakfast was good and the location was great we walked to the beach which was only minutes walk away we also took the metro which was also only minutes walk away we brought a day visitors bus ticket from reception which was slightly cheaper all in all we had a great holiday the only reason we did not give stars was because outside the hotel there was an unpleasant smell you could not smell it in the hotel but outside it was quite strong all the staff were very helpful and friendly,1
495,my friend an i stayed here at the beginning of july or believe our room was or the hairdryer is good i have long thick offer amenities in the room but they also have things such a sewing kits and razors if you call is a safe and fridge in the room was clean good size view was off the hotel and hotel pool across the road we were planning on being in the room didnt find it that noisy but i was back in the room till or later each hallway did smell a bit of sick but i was too fussed as it was a second walk in and location sometimes could be hard to find taxis and there will be a small queue of people waiting for the hotel to flag one down however do not wait just walk to one of the main roads and flag one down metro station is minute walk away i would say is more of a minute gripe i have is that if you checkout they only have a toilet area to change etc at all hotels i have been to in the uk and abroad have always had a shower area for your to get ready for your flight once you have checked what we paid it was a great,1
496,i used smokers room and i am happy with this restoran food was excellent elevators moved was bit slow nice coffee machine in hotel room and good wine also characters is too much for me,1
498,we stayed here for nights monday friday i have been barcelona times before and stayed near by so i roughly knew where we were area itself looks run down as there is a lot of building work going on but a minute walk away looks much more bright and new we did ever feel unsafe walking at night but if you never been to barcelona you may be thinking to yourself where have i ended up the hotel is a few minutes walk from bogatell metro station which is a minute ride from gothic quarter las ramblas everywhere you want to be it also only a minute walk from the beach the reason i have stayed in the neighbourhood before we got to the hotel and the staff were very lovely and helpful even helped us find somewhere that would be serving food as we arrived around we were offered a room but it was on the smoking floor the hallways had an unpleasant musky smell from this but we did notice it in the room thankfully the room was lovely and clean although the floors could have done with another sweep but that me being picky there was plenty of room for us to put our belongings and a safe that was easy to bathroom was clean and bright but if a powerful shower is the and of your holiday do stay here as it was fantastic i say this hotel is suitable for couples and perhaps business i,1
499,enjoyed our stay at barcelona the plaza catalunya location can not be beat there is a metro stop right across the street and the airport bus comes to the square too we only used the metro once as there is so much to see in walking distance i was a little worried that it might be loud but it was not breakfast was not supposed to be included but they gave it to us free two of our three nights anyway they also did our laundry for a low cost staff spoke english and was very pleasant especially alfred,1
500,i made a quick stop in the grand hotel la florida i enjoyed the quiet atmosphere on the beautiful terrace with an mazing view on barcelona the staff was very helpful perfect to relax during the,1
501,we had realised till we arrived just how central this hotel was in barcelona it on the upper floors of a building right in the corner of the busy plaza de catalunya at street level it like entering a private apartment building feels exclusive our triple room was fairly spacious and overlooked the busy square this was not a problem as the double glazed soundproofing was excellent and we were not at all bothered by street noise the room had a good air con unit which was also fairly quiet when the fan was turned down for the night the reception staff were charming and always helpful when we needed advice and the housekeeping staff were stealthy and efficient we thought the breakfast was not good value for us so we ate at a nearby cafe instead a great base for our week in the city,1
503,the hotel is very nice you definitely need a car if you want to see barcelona getting taxis is difficult and the city bus can take a long time too the rooms are spacious and in good condition with very nice furnishings and decor the food is just ok better to have a breakfast in the city for less than half the price and there nothing to walk to so pick up whatever snacks and small items you need before you get there we had a mountain view and overlooked a large fountain at the hotel which made it sound like it was lightly raining all night a nice feature,1
504,this was our visit to this hotel and again the quality of service was second to none can not fault this hotel the staff are so amazing and committed to the guests and daniela our waitresses were excellent and so professional julia alejandro roger and gis√®le were so helpful full of knowledge and extremely friendly can ask anything to the staff they will assist you anyway they can you again we will be back beaufils and family,1
505,my wife is a heat seeking missile for the truly special things in life you know those things that sit at the intersection of great price and fantastic quality it no mean feat then that gran hotel la florida sits among her list of favorite places to stay from to expect a sterling quality of service from everyone the whole staff radiates a sense of pride at their jobs and for the place that they work in they expect to serve you well and they expect that they will be good at do always like dining in the hotel but you should for this hotel the views of barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the barcelona attractions that because the hotel is nestled atop mt tibidabo it overlooks barcelona that means you trade easy access to barcelona hot spots for the view and some particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast an opulent affair spanning all the spreads from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore i particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at la sagrada familia still imposing from a rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable i stayed in parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in gran hotel la florida the turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed our room featured a balcony from which i could check,1
506,nice clean hotel in a great location staffs were very friendly and accommodating hotel was walking distance to a lot of major spots of your travel in barcelona bus stop and metro was just a few minutes walk away a lot of nice restaurants and cafes close by would highly recommend,1
507,i can not recommend gran hotel la florida enough it is beautifully styled and the staff are fantastic they provided us with a very professional yet personalised service that could not be faulted and truly added to making our stay all the more wonderful with regard to the room it was finished to an very high standard we stayed in room which had beautiful sea views and a balcony the hotel itself is something to behold each room is tastefully decorated and it has an exceptionally relaxing atmosphere the hotel is outside of the city which is exactly what we wanted peace quiet and tranquility with the option to hop on the bus and go into the city when need be the bus is located right beside the hotel and was only taking you directly into the city centre the bus runs every and most attractions are within walking distance from the centre i can not recommend this fabulous hotel enough we had a fantastic time and will be back,1
508,not in bussy downtown but an upscale area with good options to dine out metro station is a few hundred meters away the rooms are typical nh style dark wood and the breakfast truly great as in all nh hotels i stayed in this year the service was very attentive also recognizing your status right from the beginning,1
509,overall this is a correct place to stay the location is perfect at about minutes walk to the rambla and the surronding is nice the night live is plaisant with many small palces to stop sit and enjoy a refresment peoples living there are nice to speak with and happy to help when required as i stated in my comments about the hotel rooms are small clean and the personel is excellent,1
510,i stayed here for nights while visiting getting the metro from the airport to the city take the sud to treessa i may be misspelling this and transfer to the until urgell the hotel is just a short walk from the urgell stop i would recommend getting the bcn card for days for at the airport this will cover all of your transport on metro train etc around barcelona as well as the trip to the airport our flight was delayed and i emailed the hotel and they kindly reassured me not to worry they have a hr check in the hotel staff kindly informed us of the onsite gym the restaurant and also the snacks and drinks available for purchase in the lobby hotel also has got a twin room which had a mini bar and the usual requirements the house keeping is very good and the room was always cleaned with plenty of clean towels it is a nice and modern had a difficulty with the safe in our room due to our own error and the lady on the front desk helped immediately to resolve were also stopped the night before we checked out by staff who kindly told us that there would be a taxi strike the following day in case we were getting a taxi to the airport this was first class service as we had not seen any news or notifications regarding the taxi strike it was real personal service and we really appreciated,1
511,clean and spacious rooms friendly staff they put attention to little details and make you feel comfortable on your stay we even had questions regarding our flight tickets and irene assisted us and took time to made online research to help us and if you do not mind to walk a few minutes you can find main streets near to the hotel,1
512,the hotel is in the heart of la rambla it is very convenient from the metro stop liceu getting from the airport and to the metro took about minutes the rooms are very nice and spacious we had a great time here and would come back to this hotel again,1
513,tiny room comfortable bed helpful staff we had a problem with our reservation somehow there were rooms booked for us when we only needed one and the staff were as helpful as they could be about figuring out what happened problem with booking company and a path to resolution great location near lots of beautiful places to visit and nice to walk in the area behind the hotel barcelona cathedral lots of restaurants and shops etc although the area is very active and noisy the room was well insulated for noise and it was quiet for sleeping loved the balcony overlooking the street,1
514,we have been to barcelona numerous times and this might be the best place we have stayed literally right on las ramblas and only a few steps from the mercado de san jos√© de la boquer√≠a plus it right across the street from the metropolitana as if that were not enough it about blocks from the aerobus stop at placa de catalunya the hotel staff was terrific in both spanish english the room was very comfortable the price was right what more can you ask for,1
515,the flor parks hotel is right in the middle of las ramblas my wife and i took the sageles transfer bus from girona airport to estacion nord in barcelona then around euro cab ride to the front of the hotel the hotel is clean and inviting the cool interior was very welcoming all of the staff were very friendly and helpful the young lady who checked us in gave us lots of information about places to see and visit and even arranged our entry into segrada familia enabling us to visit there on my birthday our room was a standard double which again was spotlessly clean with all amenities bathroom was spacious and had a wonderful double size monsoon shower on the day we were leaving we even enjoyed an hour or so on the lovely little solarium on the roof would not hesitate to recommend the flor parks hotel and will be staying there again thank you for a fabulous birthday experience,1
516,efficient experience from hotel staff and conveniently located with supermarkets and everyday article shops located minute walk down to the expo center to see the musical fountains and then les ramblas another ten minutes breakfast layout made the start of the day more problem was that the street did not have facility for parking of large buses and as we were a group of the getting the bus was a rushed recommend to friends and,1
517,has great character clean comfortable and great locationin barri gothic but not too is great feature for upper levelsbreakfast wad greati highly recommend this hotelwould be amazing if it had a bar,1
518,this was everything you expect being in the middle of barcelona it was close to all the action of la ramblas restaurants and street vendors the hotel itself was comfortable and of the old style tall ceilings tiled floors but modern bathroom the staff bent over backwards to help you out ie storing luggage since we were very early for our reservation offering suggestions on dining and providing info on area attractions i would definitely consider staying here again if i returned we attempted to speak in spanish but they returned in english very helpful,1
519,my wife and i found the staff to be pleasant friendly and helpful but perhaps that because she spanish and i fluent so we could chat and joke and we developed rapport the elevator was small and slow but hey we on vacation one really nice side of our stay was sitting on our very nice floor balcony listening to the church bells watching the clouds drift overhead watching the neighbors on their balconies and enjoying the evening breezes as dusk turned to night the beds were comfy and when our tv went out the staff had someone up to fix it batteries in the remote apparently nice bathroom small rooms but since we used to japanese hotels no big deal best of all of course as others have noted the location is fantastic the staff told us where they eat and every suggestion was a home run most were within a couple of blocks despite the location our rooms were very quiet,1
520,we were very happy with our experience the arrangements were easy to make the location was excellent the rooms were very comfortable and the staff was friendly and very helpful i would also recommend the free walking tours of the gothic quarter as suggested by the hotel staff,1
521,exceeded our expectation by a lot food close by easy access to metro highway and amazing customer service suite was sweet plenty of room and super clean hector went above and beyond to help us get around the city this place is a must stay,1
522,we spent nights at the hotel nouvel the central location a block off las ramblas was excellent and the hotel itself was fine if a little tired our room was clean and quiet but small the staff left us underwhelmed however they seemed more interested in surfing the internet in the back room and acted bothered if you had a question when we arrived they also required a printed copy of my reservation i had made my reservations through trip advisor which had linked me to a site called hotelquickly i had even contacted the hotel directly prior to arriving to confirm my but despite all of this they demanded that i print out my confirmation for them i have made many on line hotel reservations and this is the only time i have ever been required to print out my confirmation i m pretty certain that i had reserved and paid for breakfast but they said i hadn t and i chose not to argue it this happened on a couple other reservations in so in the future i think i would just make room reservations and then decide on breakfast when i arrived at the location the breakfast at novel appeared to be quite overpriced and we found many cafes nearby that were open in the including el mos across the street that had the best caf√© con leche we found in all of spain,1
524,good choice for a city trip in barcelona the rooms are small studios with small kitchen in the living room bedroom and bathroom the reception is in the nearby hesperia tower where we also had the chance to enjoy a small breakfast the day of the departure we did not have the breakfast included it is a great value for money not being so expensive to be a stars downsides are the distance from the city centre around minutes to be in pla√ßa catalunya with the red line and the fact that many services are not included there is the coffee machine but the coffee tabs have to be paid apart swimming pool and other amenities to be paid in addition on the other side it is close to the airport that is perfect when the flight is in the early in all it was a good choice with a good service,1
525,this hotel is absolutely beautiful the staff are extremely helpful and friendly its located more with the locals near the airport rather than the hustle and bustle of the main city sits by a metro station which takes less than mins to la ramblas they also have a free shuttle bus you can use i would certainly book again,1
526,loved the very ultra modern with the bidets in the nice the continental breakfast in the morning was well worth the enjoyed every moment of my would recommend to my friends,1
527,i booked this hotel based on the relative closeness to airport and that they advertised that they offered airport shuttles be careful these are limited as i found out positive notes lovely girl on reception very friendly but she was a trainee and had to keep going off and asking questions this meant a less than speedie i had already been up travelling for several hours and just wanted to get into my room it was now late afternoon the apartment block was in a separate building across the street very very spacious apartment bedroom even though i only booked a bed very different in terms of a lot of black so it seemed quite dark the bathroom was all black tiling and very poor lighting excellent shower but it did leak all over the floor the kitchen was weird in that even though it had a microwave etc there was no cutlery or plates so even if i had managed to find somewhere to buy food i had nothing to eat it the internet was very poor and could get a connection at all phoned reception for assistance they said they send someone calls later and plus now getting very frustrated a lovely guy finely came got me connected using an staff access he escorted me back down to the main bar area where i got a couple of glass of wine and me again via a staff internet access restaurants close by and as a single female traveling,1
528,stayed for nights in a family room dbl singles room was small and no views etc but we were there for sightseeing very clean beds not overly wise perfect and surprisingly was not noisyreception staff were very friendly and helpfulbreakfast was very good variety of continental and hot foodno bar area but vending machine with drinks etcwould recommend if on a budget and here on a touristy visit,1
529,the hotel is very clean and the rooms are quiet without sound from other rooms the reception staff members are friendly and professional with excellent english the other staff are also pleasant and breakfast has a good variety of food and hot and cold drinks the hotel is in a central secure location the lockers for luggage storage are very useful,1
530,nice and clean hotel and great staff fantastic location for la ramblers just a minute walk away which was ideal for us did make breakfast the two days we were there but it did look very good rooms were ok but a little small but very clean and tidy with beds made every morning and room cleaned will definitely go back again when next in barcelona,1
531,the hotel is located steps away from la rambla and nearby restaurants friendly staff and good breakfast provided overall a good stay for me and perfect if you wan na be near the barcelona buzz at night,1
532,nice clean room a bit small but has almost everything you needexcellent location minutes walk to placa catalunya and has carrefour right in is good and good ac in the roomgood bathroom with nice walk in shower and good daily room negative issues are the lack of a mini bar as well as a adequate space for clothe and luggage,1
533,great location accessible to major hubs buses metros as well walking distance to the heart of barcelona city centre hotel room was nice spacious and quiet front desk staffs were really cheerful knowledgeable and helpful restaurant menus breakfasts were adequately convenient an upgrade to coffee maker is recommended as our coffees cappuccino expresso tasted rather horrid we recommend overall,1
534,stayed at the rocafort in january this hotel is in a quiet reidential street in a central part ofthe city ideally placed for all the atractions that barcelona has to rooms are stylish well equipped and very comfortable breakfast buffet is more than adecuate and the hotel has a lovely outdoor terrace area just off the dining room a little oasisin the city and helpful staff in all areas i would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a quiet and comfortable base in barcelona from which to explore this wonderful city,1
536,i wo advice you to live there in july i was able to find air condition it ok for one night but its a shame for it location work on service is much needed the room was ok make sure to print your confirmation going the extra for the customer was not their thing i was asked what do you expect from hotel my reply everything on the web but then again it a and for me a star should ask customers such a crazy question barcelona is a city with endless of hotels and hostels make sure to have a look around so book one night and find that which suits you you might even like the place,0
537,very happy with this hotel decent size friendly reception who greeted us kindly informed us about the area called a taxi for us etc great location as well only about minutes walk to la rambla and gothic quarter etc clean and affordable deserves much more then stars,1
538,the hotel is in a very central location and staff was very friendly and than that i would not stay again it had a strange smell in corridors and in the bedroom our bedroom had a small window facing the wall so it was very dark bed was extremely uncomfortable breakfast was of a low quality lacking any fresh produce barcelona has got fantastic restaurants and cafes so do waste your breakfast here,0
539,this was a very nice hotel for our group of people our process was efficient and friendly the room and bed were both comfortable the room provides a counter with television and desk area and a small closet there was a refrigerator with four bottles of water no charge the bathroom has a basin on a small counter with a variety of provided amenities toothbrush comb the has a glass door that covers only half of the opening so it was hard to keep water from running onto the floor during a shower the shower drained very slowly but the water pressure was strong and the temperature stayed consistent the free wifi service in the room and the lobby was strong and reliable we found only one electrical outlet in the room and one in the bathroom for charging electronics but we carry our own plug strip so it was no problem we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would be glad to return in the future,1
541,ideally located hotel in central barcelona it is in walking distance to many sights and close to a couple of metro stations the hotel is basic but suits the needs of a weekend stay staff were very friendly and welcoming,1
542,comfortable boutique hotel we positioned for metro and bus just min away plenty of places to eat within to mins walk magic fountain just min walk hotel staff could have been more kind and helpful bed was comfortable room clean only thing missing was maybe some drawers to let us unpack from our cases,1
543,lovely clean rooms with excellent and very quiet air conditioning unit greatly appreciated as temp this july was around degrees hot the staff are friendly and helpful with good humour breakfast gave good choices of both continental meats cheese and pastries along with some cooked items too we are three women and although the hotel is not ultra modern it is characterful with a lovely ambience we very much enjoyed our stay in this hotel located in the heart of la rambla one slight possible negative as across from the hotel is a nightclub that kicks out at if you a night bird this would be an issue,1
544,this is a top location hotel with very nice stuff however the building is old and not well maintained beds are very uncomfortable what is worse is the noise from other rooms the walls are very thin you can hear every word your neighbor is saying we were not able to sleep at all there is also the noise from the underground metro which is every minutes it stops after am though we were on the floor the water pressure was very bad as well it is a challenge to even brush your teeth a fairly good breakfast buffet was included however outside the rooms and the reception area the hotel is not it is too expensive for what the hotel offers overall,0
545,stayed here for nights at end of july and were extremely happy with this hotel on arrival the receptionist was extremely friendly and gave us a map which she then proceeded to draw the bus stops best places to visit etc so that we knew where we were going the hotel rooms are basic but very nice the bathrooms are split with a curtain from the main bedroom but the toilet is separated by a proper door for privacy the beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms do have air con the roof bar is lovely and has space for sunbathing as well as drinks deals every evening bartender sofia was fantastic close to las ramblas and metro stations definitely visit again,1
546,very clean fab food the roof top only bad thing i can say is that it is situated up a dark street and would recommend walking alone to it the air con was that i would go back,1
548,the hotel is a minute walk to las ramblas and a minute walk from the metro station easy to get to using public transport room was a basic double but the bed was a king size nice and comfortable for me and my husband room was small but adequate you could draw the curtain across from the bathroom and the toilet was ina seperate little room very light and airy only wish you could leave air con on whilst out as it was so hot in august staff were very friendly and helpful and would give you tips of what metro station to use or which line all staff greeted you as you came and went rooftop bar and lounge area on floor was really nice to relax in overall a lovely stay,1
549,i stayed here in may for nights with a friend the hotel was very clean and the staff were extremely helpful our room was small with the shower and sink in the same room as our bed with a curtain to separate and a separate toilet cubicle this took a bit of getting used to but it was an issue although small the room had everything we needed and was ideal for us as we were out exploring each day and did need to use it a lot there was a hairdryer a tv a safe towels shampoo and soap rooms cleaned and towels changed daily the only downside to our room was that there was a huge crack in the mirror though this did cause any issues the hotel has a unique theme to it though do let this put you off as it really interesting there is a rooftop terrace with a bar and sun loungers we ate breakfast at the hotel which was lovely it was a buffet style set up with plenty of continental and hot food to chose from full selection of teas coffee and juices the hotel is less than a minute walk from la rambla and minutes to the metro station there is a mini market opposite the hotel the hotel has facilities to leave your luggage in a safe locker space which we found useful on our last day as our flight home was till late all in all i have no,1
550,this hotel is located in a road parallel and just beside the ramblas at the port is quite basic but has all of the is clean and comfortable and serves a reasonable reception is was a bit of noise from the is great value,1
551,the hotel is ideally located near the quarters of the city making it a perfectly central location to most key tourist locations min walk from the metro min walk to la rambla and min bus ride to the beach myself and friends arrived for our first girls holiday to barcelona and were welcomed with a friendly reception as we entered the quirky hotel with little idea of how far we were from the tourist attractions we planned to visit the receptionist whipped out a map and gave a swift and detailed summary of our closest metro stations most accessible bus services and even the advised us on some of the attractions we planned to visit the rooms we booked two doubles were clean spacious and extremely comfortable we seen on the website that only a mesh curtain separated the bathroom from the bedroom and as we were sharing between friends we figured this would have been a bit intimate however there was also a white curtain which could be drawn for privacy the loo had its own private room as well thankfully i have to say the beds were absolutely incredible so comfortable which was a dream to come back to after our long out we spend a few afternoons and evenings on the spacious and modern rooftop area enjoying the fantastic cocktails and soaking up the sunshine when we were a bit too tired to head down to the beach overall i highly recommmend the hotel we received a,1
552,stayed here for three nights whilst exploring barcelona great location near the metro stop drassanes which is at the bottom of la ramblas we were able to check in a few hours sooner than the time specified which was great they stored our luggage on our last day too room was nice fridge was good to have air con was the easiest to work breakfast is awful we tried it one day do bother would have been nice to have kettle with tea and coffee options in room,1
553,my boyfriend and i chose this hotel did know what to expect but it was honestly such a great find our room was modern it was the biggest but we had a comfy bed and had everything that we needed such as a good shower toilet ac tv etc it was simple and met our every needs the hotel is in a great location literally only a min walk to las ramblas i would definitely book this place again,1
554,we stayed in a bijou room for people v little space in the room with people and suitcases but it was fine for our needs somewhere to change and sleep shower powerful and hot complementary water in room tv little wrought iron balcony overlooking the street was an added bonus no amenities at the hotel but not needed as spent all day sight seeing,1
555,just came back from a days stay at this hotel with my husband and year old it was everything we were looking for and subway was less then min walk la rambla also rooms were clean and the daily service was excellent everyone at the front desk especially marc were not only very nice but very helpful with any questions we had only thing missing was a mini fridge but beside that we would definitely go back again,1
556,for some reason this hotel was cheaper than any airbnb in barcelona so we booked it solely based on it great location having no expectations at all i was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was a great budget hotel close to the metro many attractions and room was very clean quite had great air conditioning hot water and excellent reception breakfast for was a great deal since bakeries in barcelona are on the expensive really do have anything negative to say and would totally recommend it to anyone,1
558,the hotel was a little far from city centre but not that far to min walk a few good restaurants not too far away and relatively quiet area staff were quiet pleasant and helpful we stayed in a double room which was ok bed was comfortable bathroom was big,1
559,firstly the location of this hotel is excellent we purchased a card which allowed us use of the cities excellent public transport system all of which is readily accessible from this central requested a double bed in advance through the app received a room with singles frustrating but not the end of the world the room itself was an ok size for people but felt very small due to the window not allowing much light in after exploring barcelona all day my wife and i decided to spend a little time on the rooftop soaking up the sun in the jacuzzis before our concert that evening we were disappointed to read upon arrival that the jacuzzis were in fact hydrotherapy pools unheated again frustrating but it summertime so not the end of the had bought a couple of beers and took them up to the roof and had sat down for more than seconds before being set upon by a very rude member of staff who asked us to leave immediately as we were not aloud to bring our own drinks to the rooftop i attempted to reason with her explaining that it was one bottle of beer we were unaware of this rule as there are no signs or notices anywhere we had seen forbidding bringing your own drinks plus it was our first visit to the hotel and city all to no avail we offered to pour out the drinks and buy some from the bar no out,0
561,the hotel is quite good spacious and clean little bit far from the city center but has two shopping center right next to it and lots of get a good value for the price you pay,1
562,not sure if it has a pool but i stayed here for two nights with a group room was clean had ac that actually worked window view was beautiful and breakfast was good not too far from metro station and close to market and mall,1
564,unfortunately we did have a great experience at the hotel beginning from the moment we arrived in our room despite booking a double room when we entered into our room following check in it was apparent that we had been given a twin room nothing was said to us about this at check in so we had to head back down to the reception desk to ask to be moved to a double room as per our booking the receptionist was very rude did apologise said that there was nothing he could do about it he could move us he could arrange for the the bed to be made into a double bed and smugly stated that the hotel being able to unilaterally change the type of room a guest had booked was apparently within the terms and conditions we asked if there was anything else he could do for example give us a complimentary breakfast the next day but we were firmly told that he could do a single thing including as it became only too apparent apologise we asked to speak to the manager but the manager was at the hotel until the next day which is worrying in and of itself surely a duty manager should be at the hotel at all times we asked for the manager to contact us the next morning but we heard nothing on check out i asked for a feedback form and described our issue so as to give the hotel,0
565,let me begin by saying the drive from valencia to madrid along parts of toll route produced some views including of the mediterranean that were spectacular my only wish was that there were viewing points along the roadway so that you could take photos the total tolls i paid were finding ibis barcelona meridiana was not entirely difficult even with my bicycle oriented gps map of spain although the hotel is located outside the center of barcelona i found the location to be ideal especially with the amount of that i encountered in the city it is located specifically in heron city and part to a mall that includes a supermarket and next to a cort√©s ingl√©s is a department store the mall includes a few decent places to eat and has a mcdonalds if you are so inclined there is also a nice park directly across the street that contains a large public swimming pool and of course there is also an adjacent residential area to explore listen to the linguistic cadence of the people and find typical tapas ibis barcelona meridiana is located outside of the center the metro station i puig on line is located a minute leisurely walk from the hotel out the front door to the right through the park the cost of a ticket or sencillez is i would recommend taking line from favra i puig to the catalunya stop a minute ride this will put you in the center of much of the,1
567,very nice hotel in the center not too big although it is close to rambla it is in a quiet street easy access to the important places in barcelona very friendly staff good breakfest clean rooms,1
568,our visit to this hotel such a good location and very comfortable hotel friendly staff and good breakfast catering for our vegan diet as well would visit again if we return to bcn keep it going,1
570,the extra touches like the cookies and wine were enjoyed by all early check in was much appreciated after an overnight flight from canada location was superb and the ability to have in a room was great would recommend your hotel and would stay there again if we are in barcelona,1
571,located at plaza catalunya top of las ramblas which is the more affluent section of barcelona with tons of shopping and fashion forward retailers walking distance to gaudi casa batllo and la pedrera nice hotel and great service with spacious rooms perfect for families traveling with kids,1
572,the hotel was so much better than we expected we left booking our hotel for barcelona quite late so everything was quite pricey we booked this hotel due to the location and price and were pleasantly surpised when we could not fault the cleanliness everything was tidy clean and we did not notice any issues during our night hotel is a minute walk to espana underground station which links directly to the city centre stops away from placa catalunya this was perfect for us and barcelona pubic transport is so cheap buy a ticket for under euro which has trips that can be used by multiple only downfall of this hotel is there is not many nice restaurants around the area but this did affect us too much as it is so close to the city staff were friendly but could have been more welcoming on check we were very happy with our stay the room was clean and very large and it was the perfect location for definitely recommend and stay again,1
573,hi friends i stayed at the pestana arena barcelona it was a nice hotel with a nice lobby to relax and have a delicious cup of coffee or cappuccino our room was spacious and clean with a large glass window that opened no screens the bathrooms were very nice modern and clean as well breakfast was a buffet it had a lot of things eggs bacon cereals cheeses ham pastries etc and delicious hot chocolate it was like you were drinking melted chocolate yummy it was close to the bus stop train restaurants and had shops near by i hope you have a great stay,1

576,pestana arena barcelona is in walking distance from the sans train station the staff is multilingual and very helpful the rooms are large and very well appointed the bathrooms are gorgeous i only spent one night here before a cruise but thoroughly enjoyed my stay,1
578,very nice stay would return again the service was wonderful we lost our drink tickets somewhere on way to sagrada familia and they replaced them for us no problem the bed was comfy and bathroom was awesome with a bidet even enjoyed roomservice and it was very affordable,1
579,this place was wonderful it was clean and comfortable the location was very close to everything and the cab stop was right outside the door the front desk helped plan activities and ordered tours,1
580,the hotel is in the centre of the city however very quiet and is in a very prestigious place the sky bar is great with the pool overlooking the sagrada familia staff were great rooms are very clean and comfortable,1
581,i have been in quite a lot of hotels but this one is certainly above average the rooms are clean and spacious enough with very high ceilings the rooftop bar and pool are really nice after a day of traveling or walking in the city and the personnel are very kind and helpful last but not least the breakfast is great,1
582,visited for my birthday requested early had to wait kids running about jumping in the pool charged me room tax twice staff are useless breakfast is awful went back to room day there was a man in our room most of the gym equipment did work,0
583,i was positively surprised with this hotel it not near the touristic attractions but there a subway station two blocks away it an efficient mean of transportation except for the stairs inside the stations a big advantage is the existence of a mall with stores like fnac carrefour h m etc the room had adequate space for a couple with a child wifi was good too there were not many options of tv channels a nice restaurant with activities for the children at diinner the terrace had a pool and fitness center during several evenings there were a musical programming for the guests,1
584,a few minutes walk to glories station here are some from the airport take the metro zona university line to torrassa station then take the train to glories to picasso museum take metro llacuna to jaume walk about to park guell from glories take to catalunya then take green to vallcarca,1
586,we stayed very clean rooms wth staff very friendly breakfast is very very good with a wide verity the hotel restaurant food is very poor quality for the price an we waited for a cocktail we ordered an the place was empty with two members of staff doing nothin that was a major let down to a lovely quiet hotel in a nice location,1
587,front desk staff very helpful and friendly i encountered many problems during my stay that should never happen at a hotel with this rating and the air conditioning one has no ability to adjust the temperature only the fans i found this quite shocking again for the rating and price regardless even with the fan turned at maximum and the temperature at minimum the room temperature was still way too warm on maximum the fan was too weak to adequately cool the room in addition again quite surprising is that when you remove the room key that powers the lights the air conditioning shuts off as well at the end of the summer day when you come in all hot and sweaty from touring around the room temperature was unbearable and took hours to cool staff was not quite competent three times during day stay i had to call the front desk because either the soap was not replaced the shampoo or conditioner was not replaced my bathrobe was not replaced etc again this should not happen at a hotel that supposedly is rated this the final straw my room safe was broken this was verified by the maintenance person the next day someone came to fix it i still could not get it to work turns out the instruction card on how to use the safe was completely incorrect when i showed it to the hotel worker he tore it up and threw it out,0
589,i choose this hotel due to close access to train station but was pleasantly surprised to find it was close to all city transportation close to supermarket pharmacy restaurants and shopping center great area for working and eating outdoors,1
590,the junior suite comfortably accommodated all three of us a king sized bed and a separate area with single beds the king sized bed was so comfortable with really soft sheets i slept so well on those nights that we were there it had a big bathroom as well the hotel is about mins away from a big mall diagonal del mar and very near a number of bus stops the area is quiet and less crowded because it is quite far about mins by bus or metro from the city center and all the touristy breakfast spread was delicious and ample and i have to highlight the service that the staff delivered they were very accommodating and quick to deliver whatever it is you needed the food was immediately replenished,1
591,the positives the location of this venue is absolutely perfect minute walk to the diagonal mar shopping centre and minute walk to the beach minutes walk front desk staff were awesome and always to assist checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no at staff in the restaurant in the evening were very and the food quality was very buffet was fine good choice of and the options for which type of breakfast were junior suite has a large bathroom and the bed was negatives sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to junior suites are on all floors the first suite and not ideally placed next to the housekeeping room so there is a lot of noise from the housekeeping door being and the room attendants and their associated room attendants failed badly on the night first night we opted just for change of towels but nights the room was not cleaned properly not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a job not once but twice after we complained to front desk things were fine but the staff on housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple second problem is that whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time if you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling,1
592,dont stay in this hotel if you need an extra bed in your room my son could not sleep in his and we had to stay tried night but got sore back after having the metal springs in the matress hurt his spine and do not expect to get any help to get better bed either you will only hear lots of even i booked the extra bed week upfront they prefered to give the good extrabed to someone arriving same day who had not booked this in desk manager told me they were a big group arriving bit earlier than really dissapointing,0
593,wow what a great you going to barcelona and would like to stay at what i would call centrally located hotel pick this hilton the staff was welcoming and helpful without coming across as being less than genuine special kudos to the server in the restaurant wish i could recall her name she was terrific she was the only dark hair female so she will be easy to service check staff also very good and host working the lounge also went out of her way to greet and make the hhdiamond members staying on the fourth floor feel taken care off the only minor problem occurred at the lounge when i tried to get a glass of cold water and all the cold drink holders were locked the lounge attendant called for the keys and a grumpy older gentleman came to unlock the fridges but not before complaining about how those fridges were locked at a certain time and then open much later he was quite loud about that to the point that the lounge hostess had to apologize for this persons lack of hiltons that i have stayed before usually have the fridges open for guests to get cold bottles of water or juice do see why this hilton locks the room was clean comfortable and the worked very well bottom line great place to stay,1
594,i stayed here for business and came back two years later with family because of the great location friendly and helpful staff and overall nice experience i was not disappointed and loved my second stay,1
595,very comfortable hotel and location nice and tiny swimming pool area the only inconvenient is if you want a sunbed you have to pay an extra otherwise you can comfortably accomodate on a sofa chair i have experienced a very good service the hotel is next to the seaside and only five minutes walking from the beach whatever you want you just ask and you will have it if you want to surprise your partner with a present to be found directly in the room you have many choices proposed by the hotel management is attentive and accurate good vibes,1
596,we did not get the room we pay for it was clean but very small that is about all bad we have to say nice staf little pool and not enaugh space to go into pool since we close to beach it was no problem with that so we go there to bus and metro but dont eat at the restaurant they need to improve a lot go to restaurant close to hotel instead many many to chose from at the beach and like around there with tapas and other no stars but ok if you want to fill your little belly any way i would go there again the weather is fantastic and walk at the beach nighttime warm is worth the trip and place itself,1
597,this hotel was in the middle of town walking distance or a quick train ride to most of the attractions our room was exactly what you expect from a hilton property knowledgeable and friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms the restaurant however is a hard pass for dinner breakfast was the usual mediocre but dinner was over priced and disappointing there is a tapas place right next door,1
598,currently in the occidental atenea hotel in barcelona writing this reviewafter hours travelling we had a late check in and greeted by melissa it was but she was inviting and politewe were given a room with two great beds and an extra thing in the cornerthe pictures do show a bed that is smaller the image is identical to real life the third bed is not for sleeping it is not a bed nor a sofa it is flat the springs stick out and when laying down you will sink to the edges of the thingabsolutely abysmal three adults paid on a last minute bookingthe extra is not a bed and is not something to sleep certainly not for daysmelissa at reception has provided a temporary solution however we unfortunately will waste the first day of our holiday discussing the issue with hotel manager miguel extremely disappointed so your booking for three people in one room please read my,0
599,we walked in here and left happy the service and the food in the restaurant was excellent and a change from all the other local restaurants offering tapas good choice off menu and wine selection and there is no dress code you just walk in as you are,1
600,i seldom write hotel review but occidental atenea mar hotel made me spend my precious time writing about how awful we felt when we stayed there we were planning to have lunch at the pool and did a bit of sunbathing we collected the towels from the lady at the pool counter and we sat down at two empty sunbeds spent a few minutes to undress and settle down our things there then the lady came to us and said sorry if you would like to stay on these sunbeds you would have to pay she showed us a menu as follow for using one for using one sunbed one for using one sunbed one drink one burger or if you prefer not to pay you can move to the beanbags area on the floor and that is free she said oh well we certainly were cheapskates and we decided to roll over to the floor without spending a cent we did even want to buy our lunch as planned we discussed and decided that we would never spend a further cent at this hotel and would never come back again i have been travelling around the world and this was the first time i felt shocked and humiliated at a hotel pool as a beachside resort hotel occidental atenea mar hotel failed to provide the most basic facility sunbeds how about the couches in the lobby shall they impose some charges as well i did dare to sit there,0
601,hotel banys orientals is an amazing boutique hotel in barcelona old town we have stayed here before and were very happy to come back the rooms are comfortable the staff are friendly and very helpful always willing to help with directions suggestions and hotel strong point is its location in the middle of the old town within walking distance of la rambla and the sea as well as being in the middle of bustling shopping streets art galleries and local restaurants and bars serving delicious breakfast is full of local delicacies and there are fridges full of free bottled water on each floor which are very welcome after a long day trekking around on a side note the amazing staff at the hotel saved our holiday for us when i dropped my phone with our pictures videos etc in the taxi on the way to the airport a quick call from my partner phone to the hotel they were able to find the taxi and get them to bring the phone back to us a big big big thank you to the hotel for this,1
602,very nice hotel with a good location and a very polite and friendly staff on the hallways there was free cold still water on bottles which was very good breakfast the bread was very dry and there was no scrambled egg and bacon which we missed there was no juice only oranges which you had to press by yourself very overall a very nice hotel,1
603,hotel banys oriental is located in lively medieval carrer argenteria a small pedestrian street full of tapas bars trendy spots and old shops in the heart of typical el born one of the most attractive area in barcelona between haussmannian via laietana and spectacular basilica santa maria del mar we were warmly welcomed by friendly and efficient staff at the front desk in the stylish lobby this hotel de charme set in a nice building has an outstanding contemporary decor with elegant bright colors walls design furniture black and white photos floor in the hallways and stairs our room was small but cozy and nicely furnished we specially enjoyed the comfy canopy bed all this creating a subtle unique mix between modernity and tradition,1
604,i was with family but it perfect for couples and safe free and fast perfect great atmosphere extremely helpful good buffet breakfast for extra charge cons no ventilation in the the rooms was very dark lighting would solve almost zero noise insulation between rooms seems like part of the room wall is made of a very thin material a bit noisy during the night,1
605,stayed at this for nights in july i would highly recommend this hotel check in opened staff were friendly spoke fluent english check in was very quick and easy i do recommend asking some staff for directions two occasions we were sent the wrong way they do have maps though so i would read from the map great security in the hotel cant use the lifts without your room card room we had room for of us its perfect and for the cleanliness could not fault the room small kitchenette if you need it two tvs in the room the sofa converted into a double bed was the most comfortable but the main bed is i would ask for more pillows though the pillows are thin room cleaning was done daily and done really well no complaints from me lovely big bath and shower pool area the pool is small yes you can see that from the photos i can see that in winter it would be freezing as in summer it was still cold but it was hot so it was refreshing i think a few more sun loungers would be beneficial and the towels restocking would be ideal my children loved the pool location good location close to shops metro buy a pass which allows rides caf√© across the road is great for breakfast pancakes are amazing as is the musli and yoghurt,1
606,bang next to the ramblas the hotel looks nondescript from outside with virtually no lobby to speak about once you get in the rooms more than compensate very good beds excellent air conditioning which is a must in summer and sound proof rooms with a breakfast points for customer service none of them looked interested in helping or serving anyone staff at check in was rude and looked absolutely disinterested in being you do mind the impersonal attitude then this place is pretty worth it for the value,1
607,we stayed at the condado for nights overall the we stayed in was spacious and clean with plenty of wardrobe room was back of the hotel which meant it was nice and quiet however the windows looked out into an external shaft so had no view and little lighting in the room itself was a little dim but i guess it could be classed as subdued and there is no fridge iron or kettle in the rooms there is a safe hair dryer and tv and good wifi on each floor there is a small fridge with small bottles of water and in the lobby there are computers with a printer to be able print out tickets at the hotel is continental style with sausages bacon and scrambled egg costs euro there are lots of coffee shops and cafes less than min walk from the hotel area is about a walk to the diagonale or gracia metro stations however this is a much more relaxed part of barcelona nice bars and restaurants only a short walk the meatpacking bistro around the corner is really nice over the road there is a big food from the airport was around would definitely recommend the hotel if you do want to be in the very hustle and bustle part of barcelona and do mind a amble to the nearest metro stop or bus stop of which we tried the bus turistic and had very few problems as was replied to a previous review,1
608,after looking dir a good central hotel we found this hotel nice help staff they even allow us stay longer until for extra for people was big breakfast was nice is perfect,1
609,about two blocks from the ramblas and a metro station staff not that friendly but usually responsive great breakfast provided rooms are small view except of the open courtyard shaft in middle,1
610,positive experience a little pricy recommend a rental car taxi or bicycle to get around a really really long walk to the beach for wimps we eventually moved to a less expensive hotel closer to the water and rented bikes near the water everywhere the food was great bring water wine cheese baguette in your small backpack lots of people watch your wallet and valuables really nice hotel pay for a great breakfast,1
611,the condado is a three star hotel but in my experience it should be four star there is nothing to complain about staff were courteous and helpful even to us non spanish speakers rooms were clean and bigger than i thought i was going to get breakfast was good as well everything you need for continental and cooked breakfast was updated by staff all the time and i have to compliment the gent who looked after the breakfast as he never stopped cleaning tables and keeping the food at the breakfast table up to date also the reception was very clean and had fresh iced water for anyone to use the bonus for us was the unlimited supply of bottled water in fridges on all floors all i can say is thank you for a good stay and thank you to the staff member who found my money belt,1
612,we arrived early but there is a room where you can store your luggage while you start to see the sites of the city the room great and and with being close to the square you can walk down to the square where you catch the hop on and hop off buses also other coach tours the hotel is situated so it is a nice stroll to a lot of eating places etc,1
613,room was clean and location was good the front desk staff need to more customer service skills as everyone i ran in to came off as very standoffish and aloof i was afraid to approach them to ask any questions because they seemed so involved with themselves the one time i did ask for some direction i was given a very curt reply overall i would look for another hotel if you are going,0
614,the hotel is near in plaza catalunya las ramblas and the shopping areas there a metro station near the hotel universitat station which makes it easier to take the public transport basically the hotel is not that big but we got junior suite room which is for me pretty big for persons the hotel is clean and their breakfast has variety of food you can choose from the dining area is a little bit small especially when the area is full of guests but all in all i will say that this is the place to stay if you want to be in the center of barcelona,1
615,my young adult daughter and i stayed here for nights to explore barcelona before a great bike trip with creative then returned for one more night days later and it was like coming home to family the rooms are quiet with great double paned windows we were on the floor facing the street and i am a very poor ear plugs in the street noise was barely audible until am when the mopeds were time to get up and explore this wonderful city by then staff are very professional helpful and go out of their way with their clients treat them with respect and a smile and the staff will reciprocate their manners are much more formal than in north america but please do misunderstand this as being cold that is not the like hot herbal tea before bed so although there is not those facilities in the room very common in europe i went to the front desk staff each night with my tea bag and travel cup and they were more than happy to prepare this for me in their breakfast always felt safe in the neighbourhood and the staff are quick to observe the comings and goings at the front door as far as clients that are water bottles on each floor were a godsend as it was for several of those days,1
616,my husband daughter son in law year old grandson and myself stayed for nights in march the hotel was a short walk from the central metro stop which was very convenient as we were using the metro to get around the city the rooms were not huge but big enough and they gave us rooms with an adjoining door so our grandson could wander in and out as he pleased which was great the staff were very helpful there was a buffet breakfast available but we chose not to have that i would happily go back there as it was comfortable clean welcoming well situated for getting out and about and ideal for a short stay,1
617,due to mistakes made with an original booking at a different hotel in barcelona we found ourselves desperately searching for a place to stay i so glad we found akos suite hotel we booked online at turned up at and the staff went out of their way to get a family room available for us as quickly as possible the rooms are big beds are really comfortable theirs a little cooker and fridge we could hear any of the rooms next door or above our twins preferred the little swimming pool on the floor to swimming in the mediterranean i absolutely recommend this hotel,1
618,we booked directly from their website and with cheaper price than et similar we got also breakfast included hotel is very clean positioned between monumental and sagrada familia well served by respective metro stations also buses connect it with center or barceloneta breakfast was fine and relatively vary and personnel was always kind and professional definetely to recommend,1
619,it was very good every thing was ok for got all information i needed the team was you congratulation for pablo for his professional and helpful attitude coffee was free i will come to barcelona and to this hotel a second time thanks to you luck and good continuation,1
620,stayed here for two nights after a cruise from athens with princess cruises on royal took a taxi from the cruise port to the hotel which took about in was quick and easy by a very welcoming room was on the first floor room was a good size with plenty of storage space very good air conditioning in the room was very was very had breakfast on one morning which was good for is very near two metro only issue was on departure when the lift was out of order we were glad we were only on the first floor with two cases to carry down the would stay here again if visiting barcelona,1
621,i enjoyed my stay at hotel sant antoni while visiting barcelona the room was comfortable and accommodated the three of us nicely we very much enjoyed their breakfast each morning and the staff was friendly and helpful,1
622,the hotel is in a very convenient location close to rocafort metro station which provides great connections to the city and is directly next to a large and supermarket however make sure you check the opening times as we were surprised by what we considered quite an early close reception is open hours per day as the hotel does seem to be aimed more at business had one of the most basic rooms available and whilst it was comfortable the kitchenette was so small as to be impractical for cooking anything more than an omelette the room itself lacked natural light with only two small windows and there were enough hangers in the wardrobes to be realistically useful the bathroom was stylish with a surprisingly large shower everything was very clean and the room was with a tv and a nespresso machine,1
623,the beds were decent the bathroom was worn with rust and discolored tile grout but it was all functional and very important for us well working ac the wifi however was painfully slow a limit of only devices was certainly an issue for us as we had to take turns getting on it,0
624,this is a modern well run hotel the room was modern air conditioned and clean with a comfortable bed the wifi wrks well and the hotel is only a short walk from the harbour and las rambla the only downside is that it does not have a bar but i would certainly stay again,1
627,this hotel was terrible i requested a quiet room but i was given a room opposite where a music concert was playing until about so i got no sleep on my first night the windows are useless so you can hear everything outside i moved to another room after a lot of discussion for my second night in this room the aircon did work as the window was broken i had to push a chair up against the window to keep it closed so the aircon would work in this room you could hear chairs dragging across the floor in other rooms one of the worst hotel experiences i had,0
628,great hotel we felt very safe great location especially if you getting off or going on a cruise in barcelona close to las ramblas and the ports close to other sites and good restaurants min taxi to sagrada,1
629,good location quiet and clean room and friendly staff you need to be let in to the hotel via an electronic lock which makes it feel safe we were able to leave our luggage on arrival and departure easy walking distance to restaurants and metro,1
630,had been here in june and the place was a nice cosy place in the heart of barcelona near la ramblas street the place has an interesting decor and looks really good the rooms are a little small but are quiet cosy only con is that they dont allow you to take the keys but there is someone at the reception had a great time there,1
632,although a bit tricky to find initially it location is great just around the corner from a metro station a short walk to la ramblas very clean room was lovely included a small kitchen area including a fridge also a free safe staff very helpful you are able to leave your cases if you arrive early or fly later than your checkout time would definitely stay there again,1
633,chic and basic is exactly basic yet extremely chic and cheap perfect for a short stay at rooms are clean comfy beds and well decorated lovely breakfast and outside area to have would definitely stay again,1
634,this felt more like a business hotel but was perfect for my two nights three days of sightseeing the area is unusual in that it essentially residential and not that close to transport links there is a lot of graffiti around the area but it more street art than tagging and some was quite good my experience at reception was great the lady was very helpful and took the time to explain the best things to do in barcelona which i found very useful i upgraded to a junior suite at reception as it only an extra a night i did regret it as the room was large with separate sections a big spa style bath two tvs king size bed and most importantly a nespresso machine the only thing missing was a balcony being on the ninth floor it was very handy to the floor pool the view from the pool is stunning and goes right around so you can see sagrada familia in the distance i enjoyed sunbathing and reading my book there the pool was quite small however i got the breakfast which was if you book in advance but not great the meats were not high quality and scrambled eggs mushy although the parties were very fresh and there was a good selection of fruit for it ok the room was spacious and very clean plus you can turn the air con up and a great stay and i recommend upgrading to the junior suite,1
635,the hotel is located only a few blocks walking distance from beaches although in a rather industrial aera no problem to walk the staff of the hotel was exceptionel very customer oriented and friendly this is true for the reception teams as well as the people servicing,1
636,the location is the only thing lacking at this hotel the building rooms food pool and roof are all very nice you can take a walk to the beach and there is quite a bit of interesting street art nearby but all the tourist spots require a walk to the metro and longer metro ride,1
637,arrived this evening and was speedy room service order and wait is we are unable to go on planned fancy night out because outfits are creased suitcase such a shame hotel has no iron to offer we will now on his birthday have no choice but to opt for a causal bar,0
638,we enjoyed our stay at hotel continental barcelona the staff were all very friendly and helpful the hour and drinks were a plus the rooms were a little outdated and could use some upgrades the beds were very comfortable we had two rooms with balcony overlooking all of the activity of las ramblas but we were not bothered by any noise great location would definitely stay here again and highly recommend,1
639,loved this quaint hotel at the very top of la rambla only two minutes from playa catalunya so getting aetobus to there from the airport was so handy hotel is in an older type building but that does deter from its warmth charm and friendliness staff always kind and helpful theyd left us a bottle of cava in room on arrival and given us a decent room overlooking the patio at the back as they had promised in emails our room was a good size had a lovely bathroom a free safe and air con plus s little fridge and micro were an added bonus free buffet was a lovely touch wine beer sift drinks tea and coffee breads yoghurt fruit and a small selection of hot foods at all times was very enjoyable good breakfast for a city hotel too would definitely go back great little hotel lovely staff in excellent location,1
640,stayed hear for nights my wife and i and the lad and his girlfriend the hotel is the cheapest but worth the extra due to location which was to none rooms a little dated but nice the hour free snacks was a nice touch even though it was the same every night microwave in your room with fridge but the main thing which i never experienced was the free beer wine fantastic overall loved our stay will be back next year for sure,1
641,been to barcelona before we stayed at a hotel nearby so we already knew what to expect with the location the area may not be the however we preferred to be in the residential part instead of next to bland buildings lots of street art mismatched houses love it if that is not your thing then use google view prior to booking stop complaining about location we had our baby with us felt safe in the area when we walked a few minutes walk to metro shopping centre waterfront such a handy location you away from the bustle of city centre so it quieter but easy enough to get to the staff were really friendly helpful we honestly would have left them all a tip if we had any money left hotel room was fab very clean spacious even with our baby crib in it only issue we had was the people next to us were noisy for a couple of nights so it must be thin walls of course i can not fault the hotel regarding how our behave but i suggest maybe allocating families together if possible the swimming pool is quite small but did the job for us plus the views from the of the building are amazing degree view of barcelona and you can see the la sagrada fam√≠lia hear it ringing in the distance fabulous we felt very welcomed was sad to leave,1
642,you can hear noise from next room walls are not sound proof location was the greatest to down town the rooms are not clean all the time very dusty the hotel breakfast was not good no variety,0
643,nothing to is good central lot of eat possibilities in the near topstaff are very well speaks a lot of languages help in every can recommended espescially you one more by this way,1
644,after days of being covered in sand on a beach i came into central barcelona for one night for a friend wedding which went on until am so i was in the room that much but gracias for the late check out i had to be near the placa catalunya for the wedding shuttle bus and this hotel is walk away it was also walk to the cheap and efficient and frequent every airport bus the staff were polite and helpful the modern room and bathroom facing onto a quiet lightwell rather than the busy rambla de canalettes was spotless the aircon and ceiling fan and safe were all in perfect working order upon returning to the hotel at i admit to having more than a snack at their generous snack bar which is more like a full buffet i slept through the official breakfast but indulged in the snack bar again while sitting on their secluded courtyard terrace for me this hotel was great value for money the only thing i did like was eating off of paper plates with plastic cutlery but i am not going to let that put me off of booking this place again for a city centre visit oh security is really good too book this hotel,1
645,we stayed in hotel teatre auditori for a week from july we had a lovely experience during our stay the hotel was clean and rooms nicely made every location is in a safe neighborhood very convenient to several prominent attractions and walking distance from sagrada familia and downtown attractions and to metro as well also closer to the newer part of the staff were very friendly karina and anna were wonderful and karina in particular was awesome karina was extremely knowledgeable very pleasant explained about several attractions gave useful tips and was never rushed and always had a smile she helped with booking several attractions and air conditioner could be more powerful we did not have breakfast there as there are many options close by overall wonderful stay thanks for making our stay so and murali,1
646,great hotel rooms are tight but very nice and classic place friendly and very helpful staff free buffet including free beer etc very good location been there before and will go again thank you,1
647,my partner and i had wonderful nights here room the service from the get go was outstanding could not fault it at all the room was spacious and clean and very generous with bathroom amenities the room we were in had a small balcony which was lovely the hotel has a gorgeous rooftop bar with stunning views over barcelona and lovely cocktails mojito we also indulged in room service one night which again was delicious and could fault breakfast also had a wide selection and goes til i ca fault the hotel or the staff it was a wonderful spot and very close to a few scenic spots highly recommend staying here,1
648,not too central but only a minute walk to las to and the national theatre room small as i expected air con ok internet good fridge good bathroom was basic but as expected,1
650,we have just come back from our vacation and we already miss barcelona we spent nights in the city at the theater auditori hotel at the recommendation of a friend the staff was welcoming and friendly the hotel is positioned relatively close to torre glories and sagrada familia from torre glories you can easily reach anywhere in barcelona with various means of transport buses trams and the hotel reception you can buy tickets for different tourist rut have been very attentive and friendly with good recommendations on tourist routes bedding changed daily and breakfast beach is about minutes walk hope to return to the city in the future,1
651,i am a premier platinum rewards member and the service was awful our hotel room was over degrees despite having them fix it once and requesting a switch to another room after paying k points and in cash for nights the breakfast was good but after multiple attempts i gave up on getting a cool room i spoke with the director of engineering and he said it was fixed not i received no platinum welcome gift and the front desk staff seemed almost bothered at each encounter for change information etc overall i would probably not go back,0
653,this hotel is very central in barcelona in the old town near las ramblas it has comfortable air conditioned rooms a roof top pool and a good selection of buffet breakfast ggod palce for a weekend in barcelona,1
655,then this is the place for you get ready to wait in the lobby sitting on your luggage while rude condescending staff lie to you about how long it will take for your room to be ready and you waste your day in barcelona enjoy watching other frustrated tourists be offered no water or refreshments while the lobby plants get watered and you wait for hours with misinformation and are held hostage because you must wait with your luggage and no porter is offered so you can enjoy the city i been treated with more grace and respect trying to get my friend out of jail there are at least other guests in the same situation in the lobby so thought i give everyone the that this hotel is managed with less courtesy and honesty than i have ever experienced as a guest stay away not matter how good the points deal is save yourselves dear reader,0
656,we booked this hotel last minute at a very reasonable price and were pleased with the location it is very close less than minutes walk to the food market where we walked for breakfast each day it is also less than minutes from las rambla and a short walk from the waterfront the nearest metro station is also very close and allowed us to get to park guell very quickly with no train changes and also to several other main sites everything else was walkable the rooms were clean a decent size and had excellent air conditioning facilities the pool on the roof is small but is just what is needed if you fancy a lazy afternoon on a sun lounger staff dealt with a leak in our room which was the fault of those staying about us calmly and quickly so that it did impact on our stay at all would definitely stay here again if i return to barcelona,1
657,hi we just checked in at leonardo and the hotel location is so good the lobby and personal is great our room is big and well designed with comfortable beds the thing that we do not like is dust in the do not feel good at all,1
658,we really enjoyed our stay here staff were very friendly our room was clean and tidy loved the little terrace pool and bar marco was excellent really made us feel welcome and made a great sangria i work for the holiday inn in southampton and have been in the leisure industry for many years thanks to all the staff expecly marcos,1
659,we stayed at hotel curious for nights the staff were welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble our room was very small but your in barcelona so we were hardly in it it was furnished well and clean the breakfast had enough choice for us and we even had the choice of an early breakfast on the day of our hotel is in a great location being just off les rambles i would recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to barcelona,1
660,hotel curious is located just west of la rambla lots of people walking the main north to south touristy thoroughfare in barcelona the hotel offers a great breakfast with lots of juices and coffee options the balcony we had overlooked the street the hotel sits on and noise was not a problem at night the balcony doors were nice and kept the sound on the outside the room was nice and modern my only complaint is that we could feel the springs in the bed despite this we had a surprisingly good night sleep each night i especially liked the light switches by each side of the bed that could turn the whole room lighting and also would control a table side lamp very nice and thoughtful the staff was helpful and friendly,1
661,as mentioned this hotel has a great location next to the market gothic quarter la rambla st great dining options and snack bars bus stop was min tops walk to and from airport price is fair and hotel is clean but it did wow me we didnt spend much time in the room so we didnt care about the wow factor staff was friendly but the breakfast was just okay nothing exciting,1
662,we stayed here for one night before joining our cruise and it suited our needs perfectly the location is fabulous right off las ramblas and close enough for us to be able to walk to everything we wanted to see the street it down caused us no problems noise wise the rooms themselves are small but we we were looking to spend a lot of time there so that caused no problems at all beds were comfortable and the hotel was spotlessly clean what really made the hotel was the kindness of the staff we were recommended an excellent restaurant by the man at reception he booked us a taxi to take us to the port and was always a friendly face even in just one day we got a real feel for the attentiveness of the staff at hotel curious we would hesitate to return to the hotel if we ever return to barcelona,1
663,stay of nights there as hhonors diamond you should be treated fairly unfortunately not at all no welcome for breakfast the hotel do a segregation of hhonors member on the underground with a limited food and untasteful moreover the staff is far to be professional and spend more time to chat and joke than take care of customer this hotel is not at all as hilton level and should be removed from hilton group,0
664,we stayed from the july at the alexandra it was a good week we love the hotel and it location just off passeig de gracia just over for the stay not bad value the staff are very helpful friendly and we got nice fresh warm cookies on arrival in the hotel the bar downstairs is a great spot for chilling relaxing and having a quite drink with some local food we had a nice view over the swimming pool it does get kind of busy but we managed to get sun loungers no problem only down side the cleaning ladies start early and they can be quite noisy and they feel like they are practically in the room with you,1
665,ideally located in the paseo de gracia in the examplair district this property was within walking distance to la sagrada famiglia casa battlo and the liceu theater as well as la pedrera it was a short taxi ride from park guel shops and restaurants all around staff was attentive especially elena on the concierge level during our trip to barcelona she became our concierge and suggested places to go and visit in addition she was very attentive to our need during breakfast only complains would be that the mini fridge was not very cold and that the parking was extremely tight sergio the was helpful as well and directed my husband in and out of the tight parking lot overall a nice stay in a basic but well appointed hotel will definitly recommend it,1
666,perfectly located just outside the old city section and just down the street from sagrada familia boutique hotel with friendly service where they answered all my questions and helped me get around barcelona the rooms were a combination classic and ultra modern,1
667,this hotel is in a great location less than a block from the metro and close to hundreds of shops and restaurants the breakfast was very inexpensive and had many great options the room was quite large with a balcony there was a minifridge perfect for storing cheese and jamon purchased at the market the room and hotel itself were very clean and quiet the wifi was very reliable,1
668,the hotel actual is unusual for this fashionable area for being a reasonably priced establishment as such it is a perfectly satisfactory place to stay if you do not mind eschewing extravagant and bathrooms are fine as is the hotel has no garage but there are many car parks nearby just be wary of the bars in the area often close quite early during the week at if you want a drink later catch a taxi to the passeig del born otherwise the location is excellent,1
670,the two of us plus our alarmingly tall year old checked into hotel actual last week and shared a room during our night stay in barcelona it kinda dinky and the welcome at reception is pretty cool but the beds were comfortable the room was clean and everything worked we not undecided about the modern trend to zip single beds into a double somehow we always on the seam which feels a bit precarious but as somewhere to sleep in between touristing it works,1
671,stayed nights for the last weekend of june as a couple the hotel is modern with a coral and the sea theme running throughout in furnishings etc the style is attractive and quirky upon entering reception is also in the communal area which is where breakfast is also served i found reception to be friendly and very accommodating we arrived very late and were assigned a ground floor room which i was told could not be changed that night unfortunately we slept very badly due to pavement noise and dustbin lorries etc asked at reception early the next morning and were given a floor room facing away from roads etc roomsthe room was comfortable with a large bed complete with a very thick mattress topper so sleep was excellent the room was fairly basic but modern with all that you need good power shower air con etc breakfastbreakfast was very busy but we chose to sit in the outside courtyard with sofas tables and was cool and quiet food was fairly standard with a nod to spain with tasty spanish tortilla and also tomato pulp to spread on your toast bikes we hired two bikes at a cost of per bike per day and a refundable deposit from the hotel it was a great way to pedal the cycle lanes along the coast and through the quieter parts of the city area the area is away from the city but fairly near mins walk to the hive of activity which,1
673,very welcoming and helpful staff lovely indoor and outdoor spaces to relax in small but well appointed rooms great breakfasts and good coffee at the bar if you need one to keep you away from the main tourist area was a bonus for me as was close enough to walk to most areas or catch transport and was not crowded having the beach so close was great too to go for a walk or swim and the big local park was lovely to wander around in the area felt fairly safe even later in the evening and would stay there again if came back to barcelona,1
674,very modern hotel at an extremely fair price the location is defiantly in a much more local then touristy area though which can make you trip a lot more fun depending on what you are looking for the beach is a quick jog away and fantastic cafes are on almost every corner for your more laid back travelers this is a perfect stay,1
675,the hotel was very nice i liked the location because it was close to downtown but you could hear the noise the restaurant was good it had a nice breakfast buffet i would totally recommend this hotel to people visiting barcelona,1
676,we stayed nights and loved the location great restaurants nearby and just a short taxi ride away from the gothic quarters and la rambla the hotel offers breakfast at a cost loved the quiet outdoor patio,1
677,location location location large clean updated rooms with excellent amenities very friendly and helpful staff small gym has limited exercise equipment but serves the purpose fine for vacationers excellent new spa and sauna facilities,1
678,excellent location friendly and helpful staff the room was luxurious and the afternoon chocolate was a lovely treat pool and roof terrace were hidden treasures that we thoroughly enjoyed would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning on my next visit to barcelona,1
680,thought quite expensive as did include breakfast view of a wall from our window room bit disappointing but we were not in room that much good location air conditioning good very clean and good amenities taxi rank just up from hotel so handy for airport mins away euros for four of us would recommend restaurant ca which we found through trip and it was only mins walk wonderful catalan food we also had the best ever burger at another restaurant mins walk in other direction called bacoa there is a little takeaway breakfast place over the road euros for a croissant each and a bottle of water but there are loads of cafes to eat a substantial continental breakfast in in every direction you turn we paid about euros for coffee juice and croissants for the four of us in a cafe whereas it would have cost euros at the hotel drinks by the pool were reasonable the hotel is very big that why i felt it impersonal would recommend though,1
681,we really enjoyed our stay here only regret was we did spend enough time relaxing by the pool as we were so busy exploring barcelona the room was very clean and comfortable great bed and it had a good size bathroom with excellent shower we caught the aerobus from the airport to the place de catalonia and then took a five minute walk across the square to the hotel the hotel is situated slightly away from the square so when you enter you escape the hustle and bustle of barcelona into a little oasis even the pool area feels quieter and calmer even when it busy personally i would have liked a bigger pool but it was fine for a gentle relaxing swim we had breakfast across the road at a great spanish cafe as we only wanted coffee and croissants so we did eat in the hotel overall a very enjoyable stay,1
682,no late check out even for an extra half an hour zero value for money bad location inefficient staff which was not helpful very poor overall i would definitely not visit the hotel or its chains in the future,0
683,last week we stayed for a couple of days for holidays and we could relax after a visits to barcelona museums and places this hotel is perfect if you want to make a break at your staying in this city we could enjoy its swimming pool which was perfect after a tired day staff was not only very helpful but also gave us advice where to go or what to visit room big and very comfortable specially its bed everything was clean and breakfast was very tasty we recommend it,1
684,the room was very clean great breakfast perfect location quiet close to the stores restaurants and the metro friendly staffs specially veronica always willing to help you they scheduled all our tours it made it easy to just enjoyed our time in barcelona,1
685,something went wrong with our booking through airtours but the staff at belmoral let us sleep over one night and have breakfast buffet before finding our booking the next morning strongly recommend the hotel really nice room and breakfast buffet on top of that,1
686,it a very good hotel staff are very accommodating veronica is very helpful the place is near the centre just min walked metro is also accessible as well as the bus the hotel is clean and the breakfast is very good i will stay here again when we go back to barcelona,1
687,very good location near to the diagonal avenue and near the best stores of barcelona rooms are very confortables and the attention was very good maybe the breakfast need more options very clean and all the people working in the hotel are very kindle,1
688,we had a great experience at hotel balmoral lovely spacious modern clean rooms no issues with anything great location in the city for us close to diagonal metro station hardly heard anything from other guests perhaps the roof terrace could benefit from allowing food drinks out there but honestly in a city with as much to do as barcelona it was no hardship would definitely stay here again,1
689,our family enjoyed a wonderful days in barcelona and we loved our stay at the sheraton four points the hotel was wonderfully situated and provided easy access to all the tourist sites while giving you a local experience in their emerging neighbourhood the surrounding restaurants were excellent and within a few minutes walk from your room while the rooms are modestly appointed they were clean and perfect for resting at night and parking suitcases during the day while you explore the city lastly the staff was excellent front desk waiters etc were all interested in making our experience positive i was very happy about our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time touring while visiting barcelona,1
690,ca say enough about the great team at this hotel they offer helpful advice and impeccable service as always the room was spotless and comfortable great value for starpoints too the location is outside of the main attractions but is an easy walk or taxi,1
691,the shore is only a few minutes away there is a great deal of food options down the road the staff was really great we really liked the bar the bartender was very nice i will stay here the next time i am in town,1
692,the front desk staff is so very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful experience they were lovely spoke english and helped with tours and information the hotel is a min walk to the beach close to great restaurants and public rooms were comfortable and very clean i would definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to others,1
693,i think this hotel made our stay in bacelona this was a splurge for us but might be pretty basic for others the staff was always outgoing and helpful the location was perfect i am of limited mobility and ca walk long distances this was our first trip abroad since i became thus so planning was a bit stressful i communicated via email with the staff in my also limited spanish several times before the trip they were very patient my english interpretation of their emails seemed to tell me that they were reserving two rooms for us when we arrived their room on the ground floor pisa was awaiting and by that time i was so fully aware of my travel limitations that i never even enquired about the regular room i was so glad the accessible room was great a bit dark perhaps but it had a small patio where we could sit with coffee and look up at the apartments of barcelonans very near above our heads the room was very quiet but there is absolutely no view this is a not a truly full service hotel one is supposed to take breakfast to the room and then leave dirty dishes outside the door awaiting for instance but when i did commit this faux pas the first morning the woman who ran breakfast explained the policy in spanish but then let me do it anyway i never did it again but her attitude bespoke my experience of,1
695,the location is fantastic quiet but still very very central min walk to catalonia square and la rambla staff is super helpful in whatever you need especially amazing was david but really all the others were great too we had the large room which was of great size the bed was comfortable we asked for two blankets and a queen size bed in advance and we got it air conditioner which is very important works perfectly and quietly i highly recommend it,1
696,the hotel is located in the area of montjuic just some minutes walking from the city center the views from the restaurant and the terrace are amazing the rooms are nice and well distributed they have a nice bathtub big king size beds and also have a lovely balcony to let the nice summer breeze in the service is fantastic the front desk staff is always on point and are willing to go above and beyond to solve any issue that you might have it was always a pleasure to be greeted by them and to see their smiling faces day to day overall a fantastic property top choice i could not recommend this hotel enough until next time,1
698,i choose three star hotels because i want to save money but i always concerned about quality and safety hotel denit worked great for me the room was relatively small but clean and well maintained the shower was fully updated the linens were crisp hotel and surrounding street felt perfectly safe hotel denit is on a narrow street just off the main square in old barcelona placa de catalunya and only a block from the wonderful la rambla street notably because it is on a narrow street across there is at least from the floor just the building across the street this was not a problem for us however as we spent our time either walking the city or sleeping in our think you can book hotel denit with confidence,1
699,this clean modern located hotel has a few quirks which were hardly noticeable the first few days but which did become troublesome with a longer the good stuff so many of barcelona treasures are within walking distance and the rest are reachable by bus or metro in the nearby square a wonderful department store a half block away was perfect for finding toiletries gourmet food and gifts a top notch vegetarian restaurant is just a short walk away the hotel staff members are kind and the stuff that may rankle over time the breakfast gets monotonous we supplemented with purchased items the street is narrow and very echoey and barca street life is lively so unless you can live with artificially chilled air sleep will be disturbed the sheets and towels are this hurt my skin and even though the very helpful senyora allowed me to select sheets by feel and smell one day when i mentioned this the next day it was back to the same i really hope the hotel can correct some of these things because it is otherwise such a fun and pleasant place and good value and if you stay or even nights you may not be bothered by them at all,1
700,me and my family including small kids enjoyed a lot staying in the hotel personal was very friendly and upgrated our room to the better one when they could fix quickly water dropping over our bathtub they have also presented us a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates from the house and made all depending on them to make us happy with our restaurant is not cheap but very good i recommend to book with breakfast included it was a really good only complain is the location we got a fake impression from the booking sites that the hotel is lying on the seaside and that it is close to the city centre none of these is true hotel is located on a high hill over the sea on the age of the city the sea is easy to see but there are just boats no beaches the distance to the centre is about min of quite fast walking,1
701,this was a great find by my wife great star hotel with extremely friendly staff rooms are clean and very nice i will come back again it is away from the beach but great location you can take a cable car to the beach for euros great buffet breakfast great restaurant and across from another great restaurant nice city and port view small indoor and outdoor pool,1
703,we stayed here last week it was amazing a great location as was out of the hustle and bussing of the city but close enough to walk to places took us half hour to walk to la sagrada familia right near the harbour lots of lovely bars and restaurants hotel was very clean staff very attentive and safe in the room if you happen to have your car there is secure underground parking breakfast was amazing so much choice could fault it if you looking for a place to stay i highly recommend would stay here again,1
704,just got back from a four day stay at marina i enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere found the staff to be friendly and helpful the room was very clean but a little small no tea or coffee facilities were available in the room as advertised with the breakfast was amazing so much variety the area is not very touristy more residential i travelled with my ten year old son and felt very safe and the locals where friendly lots of cafes and bars close by the roof top pool was very welcoming after a hot day sight seeing and the sky bar was lovely lit up of a niggtthe beach is a minute walk but it euro to hire a parasol and two loungers which is a rip off overall i would recommend this hotel it has a good vibe and was child friendly,1
705,i stayed here with my adult daughter and had a great time the hotel is ideally located we walked everywhere it is close to the beach but also close enough to walk into town the staff are very polite and helpful the room was clean and had everything except tea and coffee which i would have expected for stars the roof top bar was great and lovely to return back to after a day of exploring my only real complaint is that the bar could open earlier so you could get beach towels and a drink they missing a trick here as lots of people had obviously gone to a near by cafe also people had saved beds which is incredibly selfish in a hotel this big with such a small pool the hotel should be clear and strict about having a policy for this employ someone to keep an eye and remove towels when the person has not been there for half an hour some towels were there for well over an hour,1
706,back yesterday from a night stay at the marina my teenage daughter and i had a basic twin room on the floor i asked for a quiet room away from the bar and rooftop pool and away from the lift which i was given as in any hotel earplugs were useful the cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm the pool is on the floor it superb after sightseeing it was a quiet sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill it got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available even if there were any loungers left my only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool the itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful pillows comfy bed was clean so all good the staff were all lovely and helpful particularly the staff on the ground floor it a min walk to the beaches which again were superb la rambla and casa bastilo would be a bit too much to walk i think so we hopped in a taxi are taxis to the left of the and then walked back ish alternatively you could catch a rickshaw bike along the beach front part of the way and then walk the rest to the bottom of la rambla la sagrada familia is walkable about mins up a straight road with,1
708,i arrived at reception at am on ilary was great and very helpful to arrange very early check in when we went back to the hotel we were surprised to find very nice card bottle of champagne chocolate dipped strawberries this was arranged by the duty manager team on many thanks to ilary and the duty manger team that night,1
709,a fantastic hotel enjoyed every minute of our stay can not fault we booked online needing quality relaxing time due to a very long drive and still hours driving to go must say the next hour drive to our home very easy after a fantastic stay faultless in every way thank you to all staff each and everyone one of you david emma,1
710,fantastic trip to barcelona was made even better with our stay at the rey juan carlos fairmont beautiful hotel and very friendly staff the concierge staff was extremely helpful telling me places to explore loved my visit,1
711,this was my second stay at praktik garden and i will definitely be back the hotel is ideally located metro station within walking distance the hotel itself invites for lazy afternoons on the terrace staff is most helpful muchas gracias,1
712,i felt immediately at home in this hotel it was stylish but not pretentious the garden is a great addition to the hotel the only thing wrong is that my room did not have a full length mirror the place is perfect for a stay in barcelona,1
713,i have been staying at the fairmont hotel in barcelona for quite a long time now as i work close by quite often the hotel has been going through some well needed refurbishment and is now a excellent place to stay the beds in the refurbished section are super comfortable and the rooms are very tasteful breakfast choice is first class and most importantly the service is top rate as a frequent traveller sometimes you may have the occasional challenge special need or need to visit a doctor and the team at fairmont led by cesar alcobendas always go out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of to this day cesar and the team watch out for when your arriving and do a super job in making us feel welcome it is my first choice to stay at the fairmont when visiting the wonderful catalan city of barcelona thanks cesar p,1
714,we are returning customers time who love this charming place staff always nice and smiling impressive design very tasty perfect location to walk around barcelona few meters away from a cab station or an underground parking easy access to restaurants and a marketplace blocks away we will be back for sure we tried other hotels in barcelona and this one is the best,1
715,we stayed nights at praktik garden and we absolutely loved it the hotel itself was very uniquely decorated and chic and the reception staff were very helpful and approachable there was free coffee in the morning and even though there did seem to be a breakfast option we did ask there were plenty of little coffee shops in the area at very affordable prices so we had breakfast somewhere new every day the location was brilliant as there are at least metro stations at a walking distance from the hotel and we could get everywhere very easily the room was lovely and decorated in the same unique style as the rest of the hotel with a massive ensuite bathroom which also had a window which was perfect as it was very hot in june i do know if all rooms are the same but ours was quite small however as we were out and about all day anyway it did really matter we loved our stay and would definitely recommend,1
716,really nice night stay at praktik garden staff were friendly and check in was efficient nice decor and nice and clean most tourist attractions a walkable distance but super close to the metro for travelling a little further or if feeling too hot and lazy to walk the room was small but had all we needed the shower was good only thing was the door to the shower frosted glass with a small gap around the edges paired with the crome door frame i could see my partner sitting on the bed from the toilet and vice versa we found it funny but maybe not ideal for some,1
717,my wife and i stayed here for nights on a recent trip to barcelona we certainly could have asked for any better as centro sits right in the gothic quarter and is within walking distance to explore the lane ways and centre of barcelona our room was very comfortable and certainly neat and tidy whilst we were well looked after by the accommodating and friendly reception and staff in general a real treat is the buffet breakfast we would certainly stay here again,1
718,advertised as a star but it much more located min from la rambla but in a nice quiet street few mins from barcelona cathedral and also placa de catalunya short walk to the marina perfect location to be honest nicely furnished quiet rooms we were on the floor which had great views and our own wee terrace as well friendly helpful reception staff highly recommended and would definitely stay here again loved it a wee hidden treasure,1
719,the reception staff were very helpful and friendly they were very approachable and gave good advice regarding amenities in the area i enjoyed staying in the room decor which was modern and tasteful breakfast menu was extensive including gluten free rolls we spent most of our time walking around barcelona and taking in the sights however our room was a safe haven of peacefulness from the crowds outside,1
720,nh has always a standard comfort and excellent the rooms were modern good size clean and the lication of nh hotel is really walking distance to las ramblas and busy shopping hotel has a nice terrace outside its premise on the excellent to have a bit or a drink and watch tourists passing by i highly recommend nh hotel in central barcelona,1
721,great location in gothic neighborhood we had a room with a little balcony overlooking the street whilst quite noisy at night it was worth it to sit out and enjoy our balcony view of the street fantastic to have cold water bottles freely available at the end of the hallway lovely rooftop pool too we would definitely stay here again,1
722,i think this hotel is too pricey for what it offers it is placed in a very dirty and crowded zone the rooms look old and need updating the room assigned to me smelled like someone had smoke in and it is a was extremely noisy the hotel and outside super noisy all the time i do understand the prices we pay compared to the quality of the experience it speciallymakes me wonder who works there and if they can be trusted as they do not have respect for the comfort of guests the sheets had little wholes in many places the floor was scratched a lot i sensed a really bad smell in the halls one of the receptionists was cranky and moody when people requested things that do match what he wants but are normal people requests i sense some entitlement here that needs them to be reminded of who paying i mean if they ask for so much money they should care about people and listening to them i do need rudeness or crankiness if i paying for a service if you do like your job please change it i insist that the price is too high,0
723,see photos below i took a photo of the broken bathroom door handle upon arrival so i could show the reception being my first time in barcelona i forgot to tell them on the way out as i was keen to see the sights the next day the entire metal handle fell onto my toe causing considerable pain i hobbled to the reception with the broken handle and told them it fell in my foot and needed ice reception not only did apologise they asked me to get it myself from the bar next door the manager attempted to quell the matter with offers of room upgrades and a free taxi ride to the airport i took the latter a real mood dampener in otherwise a fairly decent hotel the beds are quite uncomfortable though like being in a bag of unforgiving springs,0
724,we had a lovely time here the hotel is clean and modern in a fantastic location near great bars and restaurants it just a short minute walk to la rambla and the metro is even closer the roof terrace is a delightful bolt hole with excellent cocktails pool is small but good for a quick dip free chilled bottled water on every floor is a nice touch would definitely stay here again,1
725,you get what you pay for in a good way here its good value rooms are basic but exactly what you need clean and nice staff the rooftop was excellent not too busy great bar and nice bar staff to spend the afternoon relaxing and having a few drinks free bottled water throughout is an excellent bonus good hotel and would def come back,1
726,i stayed at cram hotel with my wife and we had a really great experience location was great you have a lot of restaurants and bars nearby and you also blocks away from passeig de gracia the hotel is nice clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful the room is not huge but it clean and comfortable the bathroom is great as recommendable,1
727,wanted a central city hotel with a pool and were disappointed right on the heart of the gothic old city area round the corner from the picasso museum santa maria del mar mercator el born and the franca railway station with great links to sitges rooftop pool area had comfy seating and a very welcome bar with a great barman pool was small but met some really friendly people and enjoyed our time up there a needed oasis in the city heat breakfast was plentiful and varied served in a looking restaurant staff here are all very helpful and cheerful highly recommended,1
728,a modern and comfortable hotel within easy walking distance of the main city bed was the best hotel i had staff were very friendly and catalonian restaurant across the street good value and a good hotel,1
729,its a great hotel so close to the city center lots of light a very nice terrace to have a cup of coffee great staff great coffee shops around it has it all i cant say that is pricey is not you pay a good amount of money and you receive great quality and location i can assure that is a great place to enjoy barcelona,1
730,nice hotel very accommodating clean and fair price staff are friendly and know english do bring an adapter for outlet the pool is a small size but it makes up for it with the bar on deck check in time is they allowed us to leave our cases behind locked doors for early arrival,1
732,we first got a wrong room but the staff was very friendly and helped us out the location was nice with short distance to several metro stations and restaurants the beds were really good as well but there were quite a bit of noise from the hallway,1
733,we arrived to a friendly welcome and sat down with a glass of something bubbly as one of the ladies on reception gave us a quick run through of the hotel meal times room key location and nearby attractions our room and bathroom were clean and plenty big enough and we had a little fridge stocked with drinks and snacks at reasonable prices and safe for the hotel staff were really friendly and helpful and really made our stay so wonderful the reception staff were always willing to answer any questions we had be they about how best to get to a particular destination whether we do x y and z things in a day or were expecting too much where to eat we visited three of the suggested local restaurants all good but strongly recommend la taperia at el national great fun and great tapas and casa al fonso you can also pass tickets for park guell camp was plentiful with a great selection of hot and cold food fruit meats cheeses breads yoghurts you can order crepes or omelettes too and all the you can drink there are even a few tables outside on the patio for breakfast al fresco again the staff ca do enough for you and likewise at the small bar by the loved the city but favourites were strolling through parc de la ciuadella on sunday early evening out spending quality time together and youngsters enjoying dancing to time music in the bandstand in,1
734,staff was quite helpful in getting us tickets beforehand and helping us get around on metro breakfast pretty good except scrambled eggs a little to salty for my taste great room big bed and bathroom would stay again,1
735,we received very good service we asked for quiet rooms and were very pleased the rooms were comfortable and despite the heat outside very pleasant the hotel is well positioned for the metro and most local sights just what we needed,1
736,great hotel super friendly staff always at reception greeted on arrival with a glass of cava and then when we returned to our room that night a bottle had been left for us which was very nice room was clean and very nice small but as expected cleaned very well everyday pool was small but this was stated never tried the breakfast hotel location is fantastic easy to get everywhere via metro barcelona itself has so much to do city and beach what more could you ask for,1
737,all great clean and tidy and helpful staff breakfast goodtube not far away for park guell in particular can walk to sagrada familia in about mins and into la ramblas definitely recommend hotel area is great and quirky and out of major tourist traps,1
738,we just leaving after a two night stay in this great hotel very friendly reception staff on arrival we were offered a comfy seat and given a welcome drink whilst the lovely receptionist explained the finer details and volunteered lots of information about barcelona our room was smallish but was emaculately clean and had everything we could possibly need for our stay we were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which had plenty of choice with lovely hot milky coffee and staff who were on it always replenishing food our days out in the city were finished off by a drink or two in the bar where the staff were just as friendly and efficient all staff from chambermaids waiting staff concierge to receptionists were super friendly i would definitely recommend,1
739,great location and very easy to get around the city with a metro pass diagonal station is less than minutes walk away in general the hotel had no the rooms looked good and the beds were comfortable the staff at reception were also very welcoming and knowledgeable with any help we needed,1
740,we liked the hotel it not very big but cosy and comfortable the location is ce we could walk to the coast zoo aquivarium the cuisine is nice the personnel is polite the rooms have all necesessary things,1
743,i been to a lot of hotels so far this hotel was the best so far the best location with very welcoming helpful and friendly staff it well renovated the rooms and services are nice and clean i booked most of my tour there and they were the best choices for me on a solo trip it was safer to to be close to most iconic places the price is very reasonable overall i will be pleased to book this hotel for my next trip to lovely barcelona in future guys for your service,1
744,i really do understand the greediness of hotels trying to get as much money as they can from people why do they change prices daily and why are they allowed for price segmentation to different customers that supposed to be ilegal so this receptionist gives me a way higher price than internet and changes it radically every single day i wanted to book he took a loooong time very inefficient to deal with just one couple of customers and then to find a room for me and tell me his price craziness prices are way high for the horrible dirty place where this hotel is and what it offers specially the quality of human being that works there they do not care about people just about their cards and image pretending they are something better than the crap they offer specially in service and experience,0
745,fabulous hotel staff were very helpful we misplaced our tickets for the sagrada familia and they kindy reprinted them for us they slso liased with our airport taxi ensuring efficient collection at the end of our stay rooms were immaculate and the terrace bar was a lovely addition to our visit very central location we walked to camp nou magic fountain sagrada parc guell the beach and other areas easily although public transport is easily accessible room size was fine we only wanted to sleep there then explore the city air con and complimentary bottles of water were a bonus we would definitely stay there again,1
746,lovely hotel with helpful staff good selection at breakfast room was almost perfect and fully stocked just on the minute side ask for a room with an outside window the rooftop bar was a great retreat after plodding the streets and also cheaper than local bars,1
747,very handy for eating and transport in the area very close to catalunya square hotel very boutique and minimal shower probably best i have ever experienced in a hotel clean and practical rooftop terrace gives great view of the area and port overall a great experience in a large city would recommend and would come back,1
748,my mom and i stayed in a twin bed room for nights in barcelona the location was very convenient no more than minutes from everything we wanted to do with transportation very accessible near by when we arrived the staff was very kind and welcoming they offered us drinks right at the front desk we went up to our room and were not disappointed everything was clean and neat complimentary waters daily the beds are very comfortable but right away we noticed that they were very slippery if you sit up against the headboard the bed will slide away from the wall easily and you left with a big gap it was a little annoying but not a deal breaker by any stretch in the morning they have a very extensive free breakfast eggs bacon etc as well as pastries and such my only real complaint is the temperature of the room and it has to do more with personal preference it was adequately cold for most people i sure and perhaps it just what i used to but i like the ac to be blasting or to at least feel that it working like with a fan i would have enjoyed that being an option on the controls but again i picky with my preferences all in all very good stay would recommend,1
749,just returned from nights at hotel and could not be happierreception staff were very helpful with maps directions and staff were lovely and breakfast was good ate dinner night and had tapas which was lovely and drink measures were very adjoining rooms and our family room was huge with loads of wardrobe space and good showers never used cleaned daily and my son loved the pool yes it is small but it is a city centre hotel so small pool to be expected but lovely for a quick dip after hot walk round with child aged and two grandparents in late took us mins to walk to las rambles and to funicular location was ideal,1
750,fantastic service amazing friendly and helpful staff fabulous rooms pool and spa will definitely go back we have expend very good time uin barcelona everything very clean close and well connected with all atractions in the city,1

753,very friendly and profesional staff nice swiming pool and terrace everything modern clean and nice spa is so qute very well decorated massage is excelent rooms are very confortable wifi is ok everything clean,1
755,my wife and i stayed here for three nights after spending nights in milan we enjoyed our standard room although a bit small the carpet could use some attention however overall the room was clean and well maintained by the housekeeping staff bed linen was clean and hand and bath towels were changed daily the reception staff was very helpful and conversed in english our spanish is not so good they checked us in quickly and provided useful information about the metro and restaurants in the area also a shopping mall with restaurants is nearby however getting to the metro from the hotel may be a challenge we had to walk about minutes to the nearest metro station on the day we were to depart for the airport all of the taxi drivers in barcelona went on strike fortunately the hotel provided a very comfortable bus to the airport for euros per person,1
756,stayed here at the beginning of the summer holidays and we were more than happy with our room floor the king size bed was an actual king size rather than two single beds pushed together and the bed linen was so soft the bathroom was sizeable and had a jacuzzi bath which we did use no locks on the door though which may bother some people the rooms had blackout curtains and the control for the air con was right by the bed and it worked really well the wifi in the room worked but was the best and we did use the tv although it was a big flat screen lg the rooms were really clean and cleaned everyday to a good standard other reviews i read prior to going said you could hear noise from other rooms but we only heard doors slam once our entire stay the reception staff were helpful and spoke good english they gave us a city map and recommended the best metro ticket to buy as well as letting us keep our bags there until we needed to leave hospital clinic metro was about a walk and they gave us good directions the negatives i am going to write about are a bit picky and do have anything to do with the the hotel restaurant is actually a restaurant it a bar so when we were tired from a day exploring and hungry during the hours restaurants were shut we could have a,1
757,i came to melia for a corporate event the was smooth and i was in my room about minutes after arrival first thing i requested was iron and ironing board it arrived quite quickly however the ironing board was about to fall apart and it was hard to iron on it corporate event rooms were for our arrival and were clean however there was not enough water provided lunchtime rather poor poor selection meals not tasty no tea provided just coffee toilets were dirty and unattended no toilet paper no soap i informed the reception about the problem it was later solved which i good selection as a tea drinker however i found that there was no hot water provided i had to ask staff separately that proved quite a challenge as some of the staff pretended not to hear me calling them and walked not impressed i would go back i would recommend,0
758,i was very pleased with this hotel the cost is worth the room location and hospitality the rooms are very spacious and air conditioned the staff was very polite and happy to help i did not dine in the hotel because it near a ton of great restaurants and i was only here for a short period of time the room was very comfortable the hotel is located in a great tourist area with lots of shops restaurants etc nearby,1
759,beautiful boutique hotel located in the heart of the action off la service very nicely decorated rooms high ceilings very practical service of mobile highly recommend to all,1
762,great location courteous and knowledgeable staff room well appointed and all utilities worked well the hotel dining and public areas were also enjoyable and provided a comfortable and soothing santuary from the crowded city streets,1
763,i was here with my family after our tour from france the bookings i made through got messed up and when we arrived here tired the hotel was fully booked and we had to roam around looking for hotels spending a night in a hotel we did not sign for started our spain tour lil low but the nights we spent in this hotel paid off we booked an apartment and had a good dining and kitchen area the timesaver was the bathrooms the bunkbeds can be little uncomfortable for teens though high on price but makes sense as it is centrally located and the busiest tourist area the fact that despite the hotel is located in the congested area they have managed to have a beautiful garden area where you can spend a quiet time with a book and a drink if you want to save lots of time travelling this is the hotel you wud want to check in to,1
764,clean good breakfast friendly people excellent and free wifi just steps from the train station good restaurants around the hotel if you like to walk and explore this hotel is for you cause is min walk to the vittorio emanuel and cathedral milan is the fashion district of italy so is perfect for the ones who love shopping,1
765,located in a beautiful neighbourhood with many high end shops hugo boss store is just next door top of the very farthest part of las ramblas had a suite which was very comfortable for a family of four two adults two kids two tv shower is wonderful windows opened very wide almost like a terrace in your accommodating recommend this hotel,1
766,this hotel meets the expectations one can have from a star hotel in barcelona rooms were a decent size clean and functional location of the hotel is very good as most of the hotels in this city they somewhat overpriced,1
767,nh hesperia is a great choice while in good service and friendly staff with clean and standard is not great but walking distance from main tourist destinations,1
768,room stayed here for two days following a cruise if you looking for a hotel with excellent customer service this is the place esmeralda did many things for us during our stay she suggested and made dinner reservations at a local restaurant an excellent experience she also helped us with setting up on our phones finally she checked us in and printed our boarding passes for our trip home although we felt safe with the hotel location the hotel is far from major attractions from a walking perspective it took about minutes to get to the plaza de catalunya and to the sagrada familia the only negative we had with the room was that the bathtub began to fill up with water whenever we took a shower overall we were very satisfied with our stay at the hesperia barcelona presidente,1
769,i would recommend sercotel amister to anyone looking to stay in barcelona for a short break we stayed there for three nights it was perfect for a short getaway it about minutes from various different metro stops and you can get to the quite easily the staff are friendly and the hotel is modern i liked the upstairs bar area although it could benefit from some more sunloungers we were treated to a little bottle of prosecco on arrival which really made us welcome,1
770,this was a surprise trip for me i turned and my husband and children surprised with a five day trip to barcelona we stayed at this luxury hotel just outside the absolute center of barcelona the staff was wonderful and helpful with big hearts the breakfast was lovely and the family room was spotless the whole family really loved the stay if we go back to barcelona we probably stay at the same hotel,1
771,we came here as a treat for my birthday for nights entry to the hotel was clean smells of lemons every member of staff from reception to bar staff were pleasant professional multilingual and helpful hotel is quirky lots of artwork and would appeal to many it about a minute walk to las ramblas hotel also hire out bicycles i believe for free for guests i did go into the gymmy partner booked us a standard room and we were put into room there was an ice bucket with a small bottle of cava there which was a nice touchthe itself was quite small facing a busy road but the glazed windows seem to block out most of the traffic noise the room had everything we needed tv not many british channels kettle with tea and coffee bathrobes and slippers minibar and safe it did have any drawers so we are limited with space for underwear etc the bathroom had everything we needed including hairdryer and they also supplied the usual the only negative criticism is that both carpets in the hallway and bedroom were looking very tired and the paintwork in the bathroom was pretty bad and needed attention and not what you would have expected in a hotel on our last night at am the failed and started leaking we had to switch it off as the water was coming from the ceiling and my partner was sure whether this was anywhere near electrics we reported it in,1
772,we where here a short week in the end of july two adults and one tiny baby the staff was very friendly and helpful super clean rooms and nice cleaning staff too a few negative things though our room was very tiny and with no view at all and it was pretty thin walls between the rooms so we could very well hear other people in the other rooms on top of the hotel there is an area with a very small swimming pool and some sunbeds and a bar nice place to relax in the afternoon sun astoria is located a little distance away from la rambla it in a walking distance but easier to take the metro a couple of stops all in all we are very happy with our stay,1
773,in a great location friendly staff modern lovely rooms however was a little noisy from other guests gorgeous white company toiletries ca tell you how many hotels i stay in with terrible toiletries did have the breakfast but all in all lovely hotel,1
774,the apartment was very roomy and comfortable all members of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful convenient location market restaurants and la sagrada familia all nearby a great place to stay in barcelona,1
775,very nice hotel and the pool on the top of the building was very nice on a hot summerday everything was superb if i had to say anything negative it was the service at the breakfirst nobody came and taken ordets for egg bacon and sussage we had to call and then it tolk a long time to be served,1
776,we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel is in a good location about a minute walk to city center found a couple of great restaurants and cafe in the immediate area and close to shopping as well hotel has a rooftop pool and bar that we did use but nice option to have rooms were very quiet we had a second floor room above the and barely heard the traffic,1
777,had the pleasure of spending nights in the astoria excellent hotel in a very convenient location minute walk to the metro did dine at the hotel so ca comment the rooms were very clean beds extremely comfortable the feel of the hotel is high end so it represents excellent value the rooftop pool area is an added bonus all in all an excellent base for a barcelona stay,1
779,i will recommend to all my relatives and friends convenient to all high end shops and tour buses and safe place to stay even you walk at night staff are all friendly and easy to approach,1
780,we traveled in july as a family of adults kids so the set up of this apartment was pretty great it had bedrooms with queen bed with twin beds and a pull out couch in the living room our room was top floor i believe and had an obstructed view of the sagrada familia but a view nonetheless loved our view and having drinks on the staff was not very warm we never once were greeted with a smile or offered assistance proactively though to be fair they were happy to help when asked we travel a lot so really appreciate courteous front desk day of days we decided to do laundry only to find out the washing machine was broken would have been the end of the world if the machine had partially filled up with water so at pm we had to insist that they find another place to wash our clothes since we could pack wet clothes it was a bit of a drama and the lady at the front desk helped but it was a less than ideal way to end our i would still recommend this place had the washing machine been functioning properly we could have lived with the rest of it the location is fab walking distance to many little grocery stores more authentic restaurants and of course the sagrada familia no matter what you heard otherwise book tix in advance another tip we never had a chance to eat at the restaurant,1
781,great rooms for families our room for four had two separate bedrooms two bathrooms dishwasher clothes tv etc super helpful front desk balconies out to street are cute although it is a bit noisy with the street traffic easy walk to the familia and there lots of restaurants and bakeries in the area,1
782,bad noise isolation of the room was hard to sleep due to noise from the corridor and to a loud air conditioning system horrible pillows with no optional choice the staff proposed me as alternative decorative cushions from a couch from the hotel and aged bad experience,0
783,beautiful building in a fantastic location the hotel is a great base for exploring the city staff are incredibly helpful and due to me staying there before i was given a free upgrade on arrival will continue to stay here on visits to barcelona,1
784,we had a two night stay in barcelona with two boys aged and and this apartment worked well for us we were able to do a load of washing and there was washing machine capsule and dishwasher capsule in the apartment on arrival apartment was serviced and there is a large well priced supermarket just around the corner there are nice bakeries nearby the apartment is extremely convenient for a visit to the sagrada and we booked our morning visit for the first tour of the day which is at whilst the apartment is a way from some other attractions there are plenty of transport options park guell is also relatively nearby the choice of a supper venue takes a little bit of research as at first glance there do not seem to be too many restaurants overall the apartment was clean and spacious and works well if you would like to be able to have light meals or snacks in the apartment there is a fridge and microwave there is some street noise but not too bad the concierge booked a taxi for our early morning trip to the airport,1
785,this hotel is really very great with a fantastic location just next to plaza catalunya it has a high standard with a very nice pool area the staff is very friendly and helpful everything works is clean and problems are sorted out i highly recommend this hotel,1
787,my friend and i stayed here for two nights at the end of june and really enjoyed our stay we booked the junior suite for a good price but would call it a suite it a nice room with two single beds pushed together and a separate sofa bed there is a lovely balcony with plenty of chairs and a table the room was that spacious but the wardrobe and storage space made up for it there was a safe mini fridge and good air con but unfortunately no kettle bathroom was a good size with a nice shower which proved vital as it was so hot while we were there the hotel was in a good location with plenty of shops and restaurants within metres of the hotel we were able to walk to the beach within or a taxi for only a few euros it only took to get to the airport in a taxi all the staff at the hotel were friendly and approachable i would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again,1
788,my wife i went to barcelona to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite the hotel is so well appointed and the rooftop bar is the perfect place to spend an staff were ever so helpful and accommodating i can not thank them enough it perfectly located on la rambla only a few minutes walk from the amazing la boqueria market indeed most of the interesting sights in barcelona were within walkable would give this hotel stars if i could,1
789,my wife and i always prefer the smaller boutique hotels when we travel and this one did not let us down most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional though small they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure the staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat shop and when to do what i believe there are only rooms at this hotel we had a floor room with a small balcony overlooking la ramblas the room was probably entry level thus very small but we have been in smaller you can hear the metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms we heard it on the floor but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep maybe because we were so exhausted every evening the floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites the roof top bar is very quiet as it is primarily hotel guest the pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails nice place for a drink before you head out for the hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area you are in the center of la ramblas and in the heart of the gothic quarter so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the la boqueria market which is almost next door you are also a very short walk from the,1
790,we loved this hotel the staff super friendly the location just perfect in the centre of barcelona the room was perfect king size bed with comfy pillows and crisp linen plus sizeable bathroom the breakfast menu is both continental and hot menu the roof top bar and swimming pool offers great views of the city they also offer a shower facility post check out in the downstairs gym great hotel definitely recommend,1
791,this was a beautiful hotel the employees were all very helpful the breakfast and restaurant was very good the location of the hotel was a perfect location we walked everywhere and when it was too far a bus or taxi was extremely easy to catch the night life can get loud so request to not face the street,1
792,after disembarking from our oceania cruise we spent eventful days in barcelona to cap off our vacation the hotel bagues located on la rambla was a perfect location for walking around the front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the restaurant staff was excellent as was the food we were supposed to have a car pick us up at the hotel to take us to the airport and we asked the front desk staff to please confirm it for us turns out that our flight was moved up an hour so they had to call the driver and ask him to get there earlier i think everyone at the front desk got involved in this task from finding the number to waiting on hold they were terrific i sure i may have missed some names here but thanks go to avelino jorge anastasia fabio nicolas soungalo the friendly doorman and eder and marco the restaurant staff heartily recommend this fine establishment,1
794,we had a great stay at the hotel location is perfect nearly everywhere there is silence at the same time rooms clean if someone shakes a quiet room ask for peace from the were serviced daily we will recommend this zamawialismy co prawda dea oddzielne lozka a dostalismy jedno podwojne ale bylo duze i wysypialismy sie bez problemu,1
797,my family and i arrived at hotel after completing a wonderful stay in athens and a day cruise we checked our bags in at and then had a very full day in barcelona hotel was clean and modern and staff very kind we were located one level about street and our room was next to a very busy area noise was insane people party in barcelona that what was not ok was that room people yelling screaming and laughing until am i went down to the desk at and asked for a different room for the following night they said yes and i took my migraine and sleep deprived self to breakfast very nice breakfast be warned if it a weekend ask for a room away from the noise they should have asked me before sticking us in that room worst hotel experience in my many years of travel,0
798,our junior suite at floor with amazing wiew was great also lowed the tower club lounge nice place to relax after hot day in the sun overall the hotel was very good atmosphere was excellent it really looks that the staff were there for you great service breakfast was great good selection of everything just ask and you get special coffee or omelette location is out of the centre but we knew that advance easy access to metro or using hotel shuttle bus and centre can be reached in minutes ask the higher floor rooms and city view side,1
799,fantastic location room excellent staff nice but not overly which we like on holiday roof terrace lovely drinks pricey with only choices of wine and do think can buy a bottle roof terrace pool opens at but was for some reason did make a fuss though,1
800,lovely hotel with very helpful staff especially xavia on front of desk bed was comfy and room was spotless only draw back no tea making facilities in hotel arrived at pm and had to pay euro for tea and each time i wanted a cuppa except when i had a paid breakfast so take a travel kettle if you like tea after days out and early morning,1
801,stayed at this hotel for four days in may for a conference min by taxi from the airport there is also a shuttle service but running hours are not always convenient very professional staff friendly and hotel has large rooms and all commodities you expect from this type of hotel great breakfast buffet rooms are spacious clean and the bathroom is a good size i am not sure if this hotel is ideal for a tourist who wants to visit the city as its location is outside the city centre nevertheless i can recommend the hotel and would probably stay here again,1
802,the hotel is a typical ibis with no surprises the staff are extremely helpful and friendly facing rooms are exceptionally quiet an absolute safe in the room seems to be a standard ibis failing come guys get it right in addition no tea or coffee in room or available after breakfast times except at a fee this is not good in th e hotel of wifi is good strong and return as it is so convenient,1
803,location one block over from sagrada quiet supermarkets restaurants and pharmacy design of hotel limits noise outside rooms center space separates sides of corridors small bistro offering food until late staff staff staff amazing cons not suprising for ibis hotel though no kettle in the no safe in the room,1
804,we arrived at this hotel after staying at a campsite for a music festival and thank goodness we did what a feeling it was to arrive at such a beautiful immaculate place we arrived earlier than check in at around and expected to just spend the day at the for some snacks waiting around for our room but the receptionist informed us our room was ready already which was fantastic news i had made my booking for two nights separately as i could find the two nights online anywhere and was anxious we would be able to stay in the same room for the two nights but the gent at reception tall blonde male accommodated us perfectly and had it all sorted out within minutes we had our friends with us who were due to travel back to scotland that evening on a later flight and when we asked if we could have them spend the day at the pool with us this was a problem totally accommodating with them even when they were guests at the hotel they did have to pay the extra each for this but the spa is definitely worth that the hotel also allowed them to get the free transfer to the airport as long as there was space after guests had gotten in it which is totally understandable and this just made their last day so much easier they were so grateful for all of the receptionists help my boyfriend and i had room,1
805,a very good combination of moderate price and quality very clean quiet outstanding breakfast buffet safe area minutes from metro we searched for a hotel that has consistently positive reviews and offers a reasonable price and this is the only hotel in barcelona that matched we greatly enjoyed our stay the staff is highly professional and friendly,1
806,stayed here three nights used the garage for car parking underneath the hotel stayed in room at the end of the corridor rooms were well lit basic but comfortable with plenty of hanging space and shelves for clothes bed was comfortable room was quiet and we slept well hotel is well situated to visit many tourist venues especially sagrada familia many good restaurants are within walking distance breakfast was a buffet which included cereals fresh fruit salad yoghurt breads croissants pastries cakes cold meats cheese fruit juice and hot drinks staff are friendly and very helpful,1
807,we are currently staying at ofelias having just left the hotel catalonia barcelona around the corner where we had been for several days prior we made the switch to join friends staying at ofelias big mistake when we checked in yesterday we were given a small room with twin beds totally unromantic i immediately asked the front desk person tanya for a room with a king bed and she said that all the rooms have the same beds we discovered this morning that our friends had been given a much nicer room with a king bed desk view and balcony for the same price tanya had lied to us i hate being lied to we are very unhappy and wished we had continued our stay at hotel catalonia barcelona that hotel had beautiful large rooms with king bed extraordinary view much nicer breakfast large rooftop pool with a a bar and amazing views of the city,0
808,in a very nice small street in placa espanya this boutique hotel very well decorated with minimal style is exactly what i needed for my visit in barcelona a metro station just in the corner and very close to montjuic arenas mall just outside with nice stores,1
809,accessible on foot from the airport bus and a little longer but possible from sants railway station close to hop on and off bus stop check in staff when we arrived was very friendly and helpful we had a courtyard room not that we really used it as we were out and about a lot large room very comfortable beds breakfast excellent restaurants across the road on the top floor of the arena for tapas or absolutely delicious tapas restaurant called bodega monumental a min walk away would stay here again because it was a little out of the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas in a quiet street the pool although small is a bonus,1
810,centrally located close to every sightseeing spot sagarada parc guell las ramblas very clean staff very friendly available highly recommende for either families or couples and even a group of friends,1
812,the ofelias hotel is great for a quick trip to barcelona it is in a lovely area and it about a minute walk to the gothic quarter there is a lovely roof top pool with really comfortable sunbeds but you need to get there early because space is limited the reason i did give it an excellent was because we paid to have the breakfast day thank goodness we did pay upfront for the whole week it was disgusting the coffee is from a machine and they have cold eggs on a plate with a bit of cheese and some salami there is also no bar here which was fine as there are so many to choose from in the area the beds are uncomfortable and gave me a bad back because they were so hard but we managed a good night sleep we would definitely stay here again without the breakfast it a very stylish boutique hotel,1
813,this hotel is stunning and i loved the location it situated very close to the metro and many tourist attractions are a short walk from the hotel the rooms were clean and the customer service was a all the employees were very helpful,1
814,great hotel within walking distance of the centre of barcleona and really close to metro station staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was lovely and clean with good size rooms and free wifi would def recommend,1
815,stayed here for a long weekend break breakfast and restaurant staff are the only saving grace of the hotel inexperienced and poorly trained staff no concierge service no maintenance staff over the weekend and we were told no senior staff over the weekend if something was to go wrong like it did in our case i am not sure how they assessed this hotel to be star there are better places to stay in barcelona for the price we paid i would not recommend this hotel,0
816,when we first arrived we were offered a dark room on the first floor with only one window facing the lobby fortunately we were able to switch to a much better room on the floor the room was very fresh and clean and the bed was very comfortable the only thing missing was a wardrobe to put cloths in nice roof top terrace although the pool is tiny we never tried the breakfast instead instead we chose to eat at some cafes just around the corner great location in the old gothic quarters and very friendly staff,1
817,i would recommend this hotel the rooms are clean dark at night and comfortable beds the staff is very helpful and friendly the only negative is that the rooftop pool is very small and cold but i would stay here again,1
818,nice hotel right in the heart of the gothic quarter comfortable rooms with decent sized bathroom staff are excellent and always willing to help convenient cafe in the foyer with very reasonable prices would stay here again if i visit barcelona,1
819,we arrived at the hotel this afternoon a little frustrated with things not related to hotel after having a few issues with the airline missing bags delayed flights etc xavi hope that the spelling turned the mood of our trip around by being super on getting my partners bags back from the airport and arranging delivery and finding several awesome little ways to make our trip more enjoyable and the experience exceptional very impressive customer service and the room is really nice opted for upgraded room for euro well worth it loving it and looking forward to a couple of nights exploring barce,1
820,stayed at this property for a business meeting good comfortable rooms and a good location great views of the city including sagrada famillia and casa mila the restauant staff was very helpful in customizing the food menu pleasant stay,1
821,i went for a drink in the middle of the afternoon on the weekend excellent service great space in the top of the hotel and a really original menu in that white box the prices a bit expensive however the view is great and really nice if you have a good weather i go back,1
822,we stay here nights and i must the location is great the rooftop pool and bar great the pool is small but cosy with great rooms while they were big they were very tired in need of an update we had and executive room and yes it was big but with atrocious views to the back of buildings and construction works mixmatch furniture one small round table with one very dirty chair and one wall desk with a small desk chair all this in a big room the bathroom was big and guess we were unlucky with our selection so choose carefully and inspect the room before check lobby is great skip the downstairs restaurant go out for eating and drinking as u a r surrounded by great restaurants and tapas with caution,1
823,having looked at this hotel as a potential wedding venue some years back it was a nice surprise to see it pop up when searching for a hotel for our trip this year albeit now with two kids in tow the location is fantastic and the buzz of paseig de gracia and neighbouring streets made it an easy selection for to a last minute flight change we added an additional night at the start of the booking for which we had to book a suite this was located on the floor underneath the restaurant the room i have to say was dated no bigger than a normal room in most cities and aside from the terrace area was just on the fact that the next nights would be in a standard room i was worried what we would find in fact the standard room had been renovated and was more comfortable clean and welcoming than the suite it did have a smaller bathroom and obviously no terrace but the room itself was far more to our liking than the suite our only moan about the room was that the fridge is actually a vending machine with a touch screen meaning a our young daughter kept ordering items that on check out they did refund even though they were still in the fridge and more importantly we were not able to store any milk fruits etc in the fridge for the kids not at all practical for anyone let alone families,1
824,hotel is ok kind of location is not bad but not a walking distance from attractions rooms are quite small and breakfast is very basic i would explore another hotel if i go again to barcelona it has elevators one was down during my entire days stay staff are quite helpful with good english communication,0
825,all we can say is very good service very good location excellent service from the staff we will come back again sometime but the bar closes way to early that is the only negative thing i have to say,1
827,we spent a week here and had a lovely time the staff were all so kind and helpful and the breakfast buffet really great the swimming pool is small but still very pleasant in a quiet courtyard the hotel is ideally located for local attractions and near the metro really good value for money and a lovely place to stay,1
828,excellent location walking distance to many attractions shopping restaurants transportation in a very safe neighborhood friendly staff always willing to help beautiful rooms with luxurious bedding and toiletries attention to details and decor,1
829,i stayed from july till august the reception staff and all of them there at hotel balmes are really very friendly and professional big thumbs up to everyone i love the chocolates that you leave in my room everyday after you cleaned the hotel is actually min walk to the metro station provenca which serves lines if you love walking this hotel is walking distance to most of the landmarks you can actually google them only complain is you can literally hear everything in the hallway and the rooms next to your room also if you are booking a single room be ready that it really small but bathroom is amazingly big loved my stay hope to stay here again next time i visit,1
830,location location location and the best mojito in town close to the best barcelona has to offer next door to el born recommend hiring a as the cycle tracks are awesome and the quickest way to get around town though the clime to park guell is a bit steep,1
831,the hotel is in a great location just a short walk away from a metro stop and surrounded by bars and restaurants the rooms were quirky and clean loved the lights everywhere are the stairs felt very grand the biscuits and coffee were an excellent addition and overall the hotel is excellent value for money would really recommend staying here,1
832,we have just returned from a great weekend in barcelona to celebrate our wedding anniversary the hotel is in a great position on la rambla we got a free upgrade on arrival and our room was specially decorated with balloons and heart shapes on the bed a very nice touch the room was good on the third floor with a small balcony looking out on to the main strip the staff at the hotel were excellent extremely helpful and very friendly would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in barcelona and would book again on a return visit,1
833,an amazing hotel there was nothing basic about it chic and basic have absolutely nailed location is brilliant and i loved just sitting on the balcony watching barcelona the tapas bar below was very good and the hotel is exactly where you need to decor and style are breathtaking and the touches like free water coffee and open areas are very generous and building itself was very special in the room the furniture bed shower and all the things in the room made for an excellent stay ut was almost a shame to leave the hotel to venture to barcelona although we loved barcelona visit we looked forward to going back to this stayed in the bar late onto the evening where the staff were very friendly helpful and really would not even consider anywhere else in barcelona straight back here and i do hope i can go again,1
834,arrived at the hotel only to find out i had lost my passport on the way the receptionist was very good to me and gave me directions to the local police station to get a statement so that i would be able to fly back home at the end of my stay the room was lovely and clean and the bathroom was amazingly big room on my last day i arrived at the airport and they would not accept the police report so missed my flight was very distressed and decided to go back to the hotel they were very kind to me and managed to book me in to another room gave me the address for the british consulate and was very helpful i would like to say thank you to all the staff and i hoping to come back in september but will hold on tight to my passport next time,1
835,super hotel everything on your doorstep its ideal for a weekend city break spotlessly clean efficient friendly staff and very relaxed staff are wonderful at giving directions and advice highly recommend,1
836,my husband and i were on our honeymoon and the staff at arc la rambla made it an incredible experience they upgraded us to a suite as soon as we checked in they truly made it an unforgettable experience any time we had a question or needed advice on site seeing tour or even as simple as restaurant recommendation they were so friendly and always happy to help we would definitely stay there again when we return to barcelona,1
838,an absolute pleasure to stay at spacious luxurious and very comfortable could not fault this hotel professional and friendly staff and exceptionally helpful clean and tidy very modern with large bathroom,1
839,very good hotel in great location reception quick and effective room clean and spacious big bed and well layed out minute walk to la ramblas and gothic quarter roof top bar spectacular views breakfast was adequate had better had worse would stay again a pleasant experience,1
840,daniel and joesp were helpful whenever we had a question or needed service and always pointed us in the right direction when we needed to know something they always showed an interest in our needs they made traveling so much easier which is a big bonus when traveling in a country where you may have a language barrier the staff at the ayre hotel gran via is the best i have dealt with in a long time and i have gone every other year since to europe the hotel also has a great locaction for airport transportation on the aero bus,1
841,the best hotel in this way near the underground great position for everything near there are the arena with inside a lot of attraction and restaurant also the magic fountain the stuff really kind available for everything time also the breakfast so generous and there are a lot of type and differently food the room really comfortable biggest and really clean every mornings the stuff getting the room so cleaner i very pleased to this experience in this hotel i will come back in the next time sure,1
842,traveling with family including kids we reserved a junior suite in the ayre gran via the room was great lots of space and clean breakfast was quite good and totally worth it we will definitely try to book this hotel for the next time,1
843,great stay at a cool hotel good location close to las ramblas and minutes from port vell clean hotel with friendly staff comfortable room made into a triple the lighting could be improved in the bedroom area superb view from level,1
844,hotel less than mins from ramblas not really a swimming pool more like a paddling pool taxi rank outside so easy to get to beach helpful staff except at buffett breakfast would definitely class hotel as star,1
845,hotel situated mins walk from la rambla and metro room clean comfortable although lacking drawer space need mat for shower roof terrace has spectacular view but plunge pool and sundeck area nowhere near adequate for number of guests more info needed in room on how to operate equipment eg lights,1
846,the rooms in this hotel are very luxurious and the staff are really friendly and helpful the roof terrace bar is a great place to sit and have a cocktail and gives great views over the city the location is great for the town centre and las ramblas you can also walk to the beach in half an hour which is fantastic and has plenty of places to eat and drink,1
847,stayed nights with my daughter the hotel is impeccably clean modern with all the amenities we needed the staff were always helpful and spoke fluently in english the location is just perfect for exploring the gothic quarter and the beach and local metro underground stops were within a short walk of the hotel locally there are some great places to eat i would recommend momo just round the corner from the hotel and benedict to the rear of the hotel does an awesome brunch as with any hotel in a major city there was some street noise but just people not traffic there is graffiti all over barcelona and this includes the streets near the hotel but at no point did myself or my daughter feel unsafe even returning to the hotel at night i fully intend to return to this hotel it is an absolute gem,1
848,booking hotel websitetravel type family travel with teenagerslocation gothic quarterroom type triple double and single roomstaff very friendlybreakfast it cheaper to get a breakfast from bakeries that are very close to the hotel accommodations free wificonclusion will stay again,1
849,very convenient for transport to from the airport from bus stop nice modern clean hotel very quiet considering it is just off a main road city bus tour pick up point only some attractions on the tour within walking distance of the hotel staff were very friendly helpful good breakfast buffet lite bite cafe although it is from the centre we walked in each night taxi back approx euro room was spacious with excellent bathroom facilities shower no bath good wardrobe tea coffee facilities in room,1
850,this is a very comfortable boutique hotel in the gothic quarter a seven minute walk to the metro in either direction lots of good restaurants steps from the hotel great for exploring the gothic quarter on foot comfortable beds but only twins professionally run the buffet breakfast is pricey but you wo be disappointed by it if you prefer something less elaborate there are bakeries within a few steps of the hotel i read the reviews that complained of a sewer smell on the first floor there is a slight smell i only noticed in passing through the lobby and sometimes in the elevator it did really bother me excellent ac balconies the street below can be noisy at night because the street is lively and the block is narrow the hotel is owned by the nh chain but the name on the front of the hotel is hesperia so you do confuse the cab driver,1
851,location is perfect in the heart of barri gotic rooms are super clean we stayed there for five nights towels were changed every day and they even changed the sheets staff is very friendly and helpful would recommend and definitely come back,1
852,i called in the evening before to ask for more pillow as they are really uncomfortable the staff suhil blamed me for not calling earlier and told me she can not give me pillows because she is the only staff in the hotel i was upset by being blamed by such unfriendly hotel staff and asked if i could and she could understand english at all and started yelling on the phone how much worse can hotel service be,0
853,we stayed in july at this hotel this is a modern hotel that is centrally located in barcelona with quick and cheap access to all important places the neighborhood is great bustling with activity all the time the views from the hotel were great montjuic with a friendly staff and a great ambience star wars theme this is a place i highly recommend,1
855,we arrived by train from granada so the hotel was basically in the station precinct we used the metro to go into the city of barcelona you just walk next door the room was large bed comfortable breakfast is included in the booking the dining room is large and food excellent,1
856,accommodation was great bed very comfortable the room itself was clean we have had a good start to our holiday it was right next to the station which was invaluable to us especially as we were taking the first train out of barcelona,1
857,stayed at smart rooms for a long weekend to see the city very happy with the service rooms and friendly reception giving were basic but clean and beds were cupboards free for was in a residential place with a metro station at top of the road mins walk felt secure at hotel area after hearing all bad thing about crime in the i went back a i would stay again no if you go to top of road turn right walk mins down hill you will come to old bull ring which has been turned into shopping center a fantastic palace of the arts building and the old olympic stadium,1
858,if you need to catch a train or need access to the airport you ca beat this location it also has metro access to visit anywhere else in the city it has a space travel theme that is kind of fun and the rooms are modern and appointed very well with clever space saving concepts in mind the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel bar service was great with the bartender going over and above to look up a special drink my husband ordered the one and only downside was the noise between floors are wood which make them clean and look nice but it sounded like the people upstairs were moving furniture round all night and we could hear every door opening from the hallway outside as well,1
859,when you are in barcelona for or more days and you need a decent place which does break the bank smart barcelona is your must choice staff is super friendly beds are very clean and comfortable everything is new and tidy breakfast is a must really all you can ask for a eu bfast really great place glad we found it,1
861,i am baffled at the star reviews of this hotel i only stayed here one night because my airbnb place was not ready until the next day i was shocked when i opened the door and saw a room that only fitted the bed i felt like i was in a cage window opened to the wall on the other side there was nothing in the room they take minimalistic to a whole other level i was thrilled to leave the next morning i think i would cry if i had to spend my whole barcelona stay in that cage of a room,0
862,you get what you pay for here although money doesn t go very far in central barcelona as a rule the family room and hotel in general appears recently refurbished and is clean comfortable and modern if and functional rather than inspirational the hotel location is reasonable it s a minute walk to the local metro station which is a relatively short ride to the more trendy and touristy parts of town and is very well located close to overground train station it s also a walk to the camp nou stadium for the breakfast is not included an extra per person i wouldn t return here for the experience but this is about as pleasant as cheap and cheerful gets,1
863,having been to the w hotel on a number of occasions in london i was expecting a about this fantastic rooftop bar and pool area things where looking good how wrong i could be as you walk into the hotel it looks fantastic although a little busy with year olds running about taking photos but that was as good as it cheap blue lighting making the place look more like a grotto than a up market bar floor worn out grey concrete bar relatively little atmosphere with large areas roped off with nobody in the bar music dull and when you do have a full bar i would probably go for something a little more up beatdownstairs there was a massive party at the pool which looked great and i can imagine it to be an ace day out around the pool perhaps a bad evening for them but just not what was expected,0
864,i stayed at this hotel nights after week at a hotel in central barcelona it was like a second vacation the views from the rooms are amazing the rooms are very fresh and spacious i had rooms wonderful and fabulous rooms they were exactly the same expect one fabulous had a view of the beaches north and the other wonderful had a view of the harbour the breakfast is average and i expected more of live was many children under that filled the pool it was funny to see the pools as deep as for an adult targeted hotel pool service is very good the food is good and there is a good selection of restaurants below the pool terrace you will have short access to the sea and the towels will be handed to choices of dining and night life eclipse is the place to meet others and drink,1
865,this place just has it all great rooms super friendly staff awesome breakfast amazing pools best spa in the area right at the beach it is really one of my favorite w hotels ever they also really know how to pamper an spg platinum member and all very reasonably priced compared to other luxury hotels in the area just book,1
866,i had a great pleasure to visit my favourite european city during nye celebrations more so by staying one of the nights at wonderful w barcelona this is undoubtedly a landmark of the city a place to be note that w is a bit different and it does have to fit everyone needs and desires as long as you know what to expect from this quirky brand you enjoy every single second at w barcelona everything was a highlight for me thus i not going to describe all the stunning services but i like to mention two of the best moments during our stay waking up in the bed while watching the open sea and sunrise views service quality of the food and beverages at the rooftop bar a bit of a pleasant walk from the closest metro station or las ramblas but taxis are also a great option very reasonably priced in comparison with other european cities if you are more of an explorer check the schedule of the public bus which stops wait to savour w barcelona and its services again during the summer season which is definitely the best time to enjoy everything what this stunning hotel has to offer,1
867,i enjoy it the staying in this hotel was very good front desk are very helpful and very there always there to help you any highly recommend it to any body who is not looking for fancy hotel but some clean hotel in barcelona,1
868,i visited during the mwc confrence but even taking that into account chatging the price the hotel charged was than the nice location near the segrada familia and the truly pleasent staff the hotel is not a reccomended are tiny built in a way that makes them extra uncomfortable lacking in some basic elements you expact not even a looks feels and is old as if time froze in the early and breakfast tastes as if it was made bad nice team and in hotel that leaves much to br only reccomend if the price was very low and in mwc it was not,0
869,we enjoyed it to the fullest breakfast was delicious with many options and cava rooms tidy terrace excellent with great views of sagrada familia the hotel is few steps from the subway we recommend it wholeheartedly,1
870,loved this hotel room was clean and functional with a nice bathroom our room was on the front second floor but was very quiet and had good air conditioning much appreciated during the hot weather very walkable area about minutes to placa catalunya and minutes to sagrada familia,1
871,loved my stay here the beds were super comfy and the breakfast was devine loved the espresso machine in the morning rooftop bar with a fabulous view of sagrada and the staff were excellent recommend if you want somewhere centrally based and well air conditioned,1
872,awesome location comfortable king size bed amazing selection for breakfast very good service from staff highly recommend reasonable rates second visit to barcelona with family no tea coffee facilities free wifi no swimming pool but could use the gym pool next door,1
873,great food beer and friendly service staff wonderful location and always comfortable sleep every night truly wonderful hotel several restaurants are nearby as well as great views of sagrada familia,1
874,good hotel would recommend this to anyone as has got good links via metro into main centre of city but is much quieter we got free upgrade to a room with view of sagrada famillia by lovely receptionist for our honeymoon great views,1
875,absolutely loved every minute we spent at this resort the location is perfect close to the beach and also to the city the hotel is separated into two sections they have the melia which is downstairs lounge and the lower levels the level is the stars hotel with an amazing floor view and a fine dining restaurant do not miss the breakfast i wish i could have that breakfast forever the breathtaking taking view the personal chef and the huge selection of are also have a swimming pool located on the rooftop it is not heated they also have a really modern gym and spa if you book this hotel you will never want to leave,1
876,can not fault this hotel in anyway my wife is very particular and she loves this hotel she wont hear of going to any other and we have been to a few but this one stands out i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience from check in to check out the customer service and the staff the facilities the room breakfast the merkado the views from the level overlooking the city and sea were all well worth it definetly looking forward to our next visit keep up the good work,1
877,i travel for a living and i promise you a great time too hotel is not in the middle of the city but close by metro service and staff awesome cristina is the best by far she goes above and beyond to help you with everything many thanks cristina,1
878,the is great location in the gothic quarter hotel is clean and comfortable breakfasts fine and friendly staff many tapas bars can be found within a few minutes walk la rambla is about mins walk ocean is an easy walk through the gothic quarter streets,1
879,perfect night weekend in barcelona stayed at the level floor with a city view which was absolutely stunning it overlooked most of barcelona and you could see montjuic castle which lit up at night as well as a beautiful sunset every day amazing service from the moment we arrived from all the hotel staff as well as the level staff a special shoutout to paramjot from the level for his outstanding and efficient service a very warm friendly and helpful person if you are stuck on where to go for the day or night he has excellent recommendations and advice the hotel is in a perfect location if you are and want to make the most of your time in barcelona closest metro station is poblenou which is a minute walk away and tram line is right outside which takes you straight to cuitadella park behind the main beach area the metro station takes you straight into the main areas of barcelona too very easy to navigate similar to tfl lots of small bars and good tapas restaurants around the hotel a short minute walk to one of barcelonas nicer beaches gives you a chance to look at local shops on the way less touristy the hotel facilities are high standard spa is quiet and peaceful perfect after a long day of exploring pool is a beautiful relaxing area always plenty of loungers and helpful staff around and good back ground music the level has free snacks and drinks alcohol,1
880,my wife and i had planned a four day visit to barcelona and chose the raco del pi on the basis of its central location we were a little wary of being able to sleep at night knowing the spanish and catalan love of late nights and being in the city centre however the hotel turned out to be a real gem clean and comfortable with modern decor our room was very quiet and we had no disturbance at all despite being only a few minutes walk from the cathedral la rambla and myriad bars and restaurants being able to walk to many sights was a great advantage and when we traveled further afield the sagrada familia and the fc barcelona camp nou experience the metro ride was only minutes the only downside is that being in a pedestrian zone taxi access can be difficult our taxi driver dropped us off at the nearest main road and we had a five minute walk with our bags to the hotel the staff were attentive and friendly and check in and check out was no hassle the welcome glass of prosecco was a nice touch we have stayed in many hotels around the world and whilst this was certainly not the most luxurious it rates as one of the best value for money options we have found on our next visit to barcelona we will definitely be staying here again,1
881,a last minute booking and a flight delay saw us arrive at stylish and contemporary level melia sky at about on a wednesday morning so unfortunately missed the opportunity of checking in at the bespoke level reception desk albeit the standard melia sky reception on the ground floor was perfectly agreeable and the reception team we were allocated a room on the lowest of level floors with a bed comfortable enough to accommodate a great night sleep beyond the curtains was a lovely morning view with a distant sea outlook and an urban landscape below the room was of average floor space with a rarely used sofa and occasional table taking up useful space but looking good on the room spec room cleanliness was good but on two of the three full days housekeeping omitted to clear used coffee cups milk cartons and to me replenish the nespresso coffee capsules which was disappointing calling to ask for some in my boxers was on the agenda the location of the melia sky was debatable having previously stayed in the heart of les ramblas hotel bagues it is in a far more remote residential location meaning if you looking for sightseeing this is a good bet but for a great selection of local bars and restaurants and a adventure it fits the bill nicely a taxi rank is outside the door and gets you to les ramblas in minutes a taxi from the airport at to melia sky and a midday return,1
883,we stayed for nights in july big mistake really underwhelming and full of teenagers and early trust fund the entire hotel works around the teenagers and their party schedules it is literally just like a big glass youth club disco if you are a grown up and get up before midday and expect any staff to be doing anything you will be seriously disappointed during the morning the staff relax and have a break because the trust fund kids are still in bed we went to the pool at on the first morning the advertised pool opening time and found clubbers sitting there surrounded by empty champagne bottles smoking cigarettes there were cigarette ends in the pool we decided to go to the decor is cheap and nasty and the rooms are tacky i hope you dont mind going to the toilet in full sight and sound of your we had a corner suite tacky name for a tacky room and at per night faced a dirty old shipyard and the toilet was just a glass box about metres from the bed my wife was incidents occured during our stay which made us really question the running of the place the manager you will see his very defensive replies on trip advisor in fact he is known locally around barca as conor is never to be seen he is probably in his office writing defensive trip advisor place unless you are here to spend the trust fund on very expensive,0
884,another very nice experience at the raco del pi hotel we arrived several hours before check in and we had a short wait before our room was ready the room and bathroom were very clean and a good size the front desk and the ladies in the breakfast room were very friendly and always accommodating the buffet was more than sufficient to get the day started i ca wait to return to barcelona and the raco del pi,1
885,cons old and smelly towelsa bit expensive for what it offers but that was still the cheapest i could find matching my budget and in the of cigarette smoke from the adjacent room in our bathroomthere were sometimes cut offs in the wifi connectionpros clean quiet near the public transportation metro clot helpful staff the receptionist provided us with new clean towels because the towels in our room were old and a bit room has got coffee and tea facilities there was a large glass bottle of mineral water in the room for free,1
886,stayed nights rooms positively surprised even after reading positive reviews on ta rooms were extremely clean bathroom was great service was good comfort rooms are smallish but okay the deluxe room with nespresso machine is great though and does cost much more location is nice and cozy and minutes away is the clot metro at eur per ride anywhere in the city i would much rather stay in a quiet and affordable location sagrada familia and the glories mall are easy walking distance and there also a bus we took to parc guell and the science museum to the you can get from the airport to el clot arrago railway station for euro using the train and walk to the hotel which we did on arrival and return was super fast the breakfast was okay when we tried it but most days we got some croissants and pastries from the several bakeries up mallorca a couple of good dinners at the glow bar a few steps from the hotel certainly stay here again on a next visit to lovely barcelona,1
888,excellent hotel very good attention rooms centrally located with possibilities to use the metro and bus i recommend the hotel for its services location comfort attention the metro that can be used is the red line and the bus also take you to plaza catalunya,1
890,very nice hotel breakfast was great sparkling wine with you breakfast more of a buisness hotel than couples but we had a great time as a couple it in a great area near football stadium and near to tube station and nice bars near only a few stops from the strip it worth a try,1
891,hotel is nicely located in the middle of la ramblas you within walking distance less than mins from all the touristic sites for those wanting to take a taxi access to and from the hotel is very convenient you have everything you can think of within walking distance from the hotel including a supermarket pharmacy coffee shops gift stores etc hotel staff were super nice concierge desk was great in getting tickets for the different activities,1
895,we spent nights here and it was one of the best hotels i been too fresh bedding and towels everyday rooftop pool with bar spa and gym min walk from the metro min walk to the bus stop min walk to the shopping centre and min walk to the beach all straightforward to get too i recommend this hotel to anyone who fancied exploring the city but also relaxing by the beach i ca wait to come back here,1
896,wonderful hotel perfectly situated in the heart of the action walking distance to all that is great clean and light rooms delightful and attentive service particular kudos to monica who was of great assistance to us ca recommend this hotel enough,1
897,le meridien is right along la rambla the popular strip in barcelona it practically beside la boqueria a market with delicious eaterie and cheese and jamon shops it also right beside a supermarket carrefour it walking distance to plaza cataluna and passeig de gracia where major shops are located you can also walk around barrio gotica where you have small alleys with endless shops and restaurants despite being right smack in one of barcelona busiest sections the noise did reach our room even if we were only on the floor my only complaint was we got a triple room and it was a bit too small a king sized bed and a pull out bed we hardly had space to open our luggages when we checked in check in time was supposedly at but the room was ready at the third bed was not made yet and concierge told us it would be ready by when we got back at the bed was not yet made and i had to call reception again it took housekeeping mins to sort this out sadly the pull out bed had only a thin mattress and was not comfortable at all for the price we expected proper from this service at le meridien is excellent check in and check out were seamless and the staff is always at your service even the porters made sure your bags were attended to and kept safe during check in and check was delicious and had decent selections,1
898,our family enjoyed a relaxing time at this very clean hotel the roof top splash pool and bar were a lovely touch good points very staff happy to talk in english min walk to metro min walk to sandy beach safe and mini bar in room very useful towels for plunge pool nice touch liked the toiletries mainly residential area so more relaxed than centre of barcelona which suited us as a family easy to walk to diagonal mar which is a large shopping mall where there are lots of options to we will be back,1
899,located by diagonal mar barcelona mins walk from the beach close to diagonal mar shopping centre mins walk mins walk to metro station where you can get a metro into barcelona central plenty of restaurants located at diagonal art deco throughout staff helpful reception cleaning rooms modern and clean large shower cubicle roof terrace with bar and pool did use this but looked very good free safe mini tv limited on english speaking channels no problems highly recommended,1
900,location is good about minutes walk to the beach and close to metro taxi cost us between euros into the city center depending on time of also the hop on hop off tour bus stops minutes down the road which is great to get for sightseeing and costs euros for day tour first impressions of the hotel were good the reception area is large and brightly decorated and very modern reception staff were always very happy and helpful very informative about the local area and transport links we stayed in room no faults really comfy beds air con worked without a hitch plenty of towels available room cleaned every day the only thing i would add would be for more lighting in the room as there is only a few spotlights which was ideal when we were getting ready but we managed okay breakfast was really good so much variety for continental english breakfast choices was average but i was happy to eat croissants and fruit the best thing about this hotel is the decoration make sure you visit every floor to have a look at the different artists it really is fabulous the roof top bar is great too nice food and cocktails with a friendly service the pool is small but okay for a quick dip and plenty of beds to relax and sunbathe on we went thursday sunday and managed to get a bed every day i really enjoyed this hotel and would definitely be returning if,1
901,stayed there from thursday to sunday very good service close to beach and all facilities of port olimpic good price for quality better than the w and much if you want to go city center go here when i am in barcelona,1
903,i have had the most excelllent customer service experience and from a trainee too mario guijarro he was extremely polite and helpful when something got messed up with my reservation and got back to me very shortly while exchanging emails i am very satisfied whit him and how he represented the company,1
904,our experience staying here from start to finish was really good the check in process was pretty seamless and staff were friendly helpful and professional the room were stayed in was well presented overall we enjoyed our time staying here thanks,1
905,i have stayed here a few times with work but first time for pleasure after a poor experience with another hotel in rome the week before this hotel delivered the complete opposite with excellence all round from the warm welcome on reception to the attentive bar and restaurant staff the hotel could not do enough for us we had a lovely room with view of the sea and high quality bathroom we enjoyed the city but also quiet time by the pool shame it rained one day but we enjoyed ping pong instead outside getting a bit wet but it was fun food is great lots of choice at breakfast and eggs cooked to order when requested love the food at lunch and dinner always an option to choose from everyone always has a smile and is helpful not one member of staff disappointed can not wait for an excuse to come back a really great hotel,1
906,my husband and i went to barcelona for the weekend arrived at our hotel at approx in smooth drinks in bar close to promenade and very well organised plenty of choice and service pool area clean and plenty of space pool a little cool even when it was degrees fine temperature after a of pillows on a pillow shower and separate bath double to bus stops to get you to centre take for sagrada familia easy to walk around helpful reception staff nothing was too much trouble late check out arranged coutesy room available for freshening up booked at time to suit us reception staff and porter staff stowed and recollected our luggage could not fault this hotel except for miserable chamber maids not saying hello,1
908,stayed at the hotel espana for nights last week lovely hotel road just off la ramblas we had a deluxe room with street view balcony which was very spacious can be a bit noisy if you like to go to bed early but was a problem for us personally modern decor absolutely loved the rooftop bar chilled but good vibe bar staff up there very friendly and great service did have breakfast or eat in the restaurant there so ca comment rooms were lightly cleaned daily my only moan is the reception staff were very welcoming when we arrived did seem friendly at all and always seemed to rush you when you went to great stay at hotel espana,1
909,we booked this hotel and what a great choice we had a nice room with a balcony out onto the street it was a very quiet room despite opening the doors and being a minute from la rambles friendly helpful staff lovely rooftop bar comfy bed,1
910,the hotel is very nice the onsite tapas place on the floor terrace was excellent the staff at front desk were very it is a short walk to la rambla and la boqueria it felt safe for my family of with a young child,1
911,this is a sweet small unpretentious hotel in a great location it a short stroll to barceloneta beach and the historic neighborhoods great restaurants and bars nearby room and bathroom were spotlessly clean bed was extremely comfortable wifi worked staff was helpful and friendly we could not have asked for more,1
912,we booked the hotel for nights as a treat for our first anniversary we loved the location of the hotel just off a side street on la rambla the architecture inside and outside the hotel was modern yet had a feel of age aswell an interesting mix most of the reception staff were helpful the pool bar staff not so friendly the pool itself was very small and roof space was also minimal only room for sun beds the pool bar area was nice to sit and relax in the evening a bit pricey for food and drinks on the roof terrace the ground floor hotel bar never seemed to be open we had a look at the menu for dinner but did like what was being advertised and so never ate there our room rate which was cheap did not include breakfast either we ended up having breakfast locally for very little the hotel is in a central location for the busy la rambla harbour area and for bus or boat tours also for local markets plenty good bars and restaurants nearby cleanliness was a bit of an issue the floor never seemed to have been swept all the time we were there although our towels were changed when needed the room had a safe and hotel wifi was free a bit awkward getting transport right to the front door for as street has rising bollards,1
913,hotel easy to find good for transport and walking round of restaurants and supermarkets was quiet and comfortable if a bit small pool on a the roof food choice for vegans or vegetarians,1
914,myself and six friends stayed at this hotel for nights july the hotel is in a perfect location to explore the beautiful city of barcelona within walk from the beach las rambles the staff were very friendly and welcoming the rooms were cleaned daily and the beds were very comfortable had no issues what so ever will be returning next year,1
915,on our trip to bcn we had a fantastic experience here interesting how a hotel can have such wide ratings we never had a negative experience once there the location is fantastic steps away from what i believe are many of bcns best restaurants our room was modern sparkling clean and had a monster bathroom which is rare in europe the staff were helpful so many times and we stayed weeks with other friends who fully enjoyed it the restaurant was exceptional in the evening thou it hard to eat there more than once when there are so many options within min walk the breakfast was extensive the pool is small but has a great view of the city the pool area was always crowded so seats were had to get start with a in their tiny street patio before heading out each evening,1
916,after being in majorca without air con this was a very welcome place the relief of a very clean cool apartment was great we had a one bed apartment lovely decorated and clean cool spacious kids slept on the sofa bed hubby i had the king size bed in the bedroom huge shower in the big bathroom kitchen with micro sink fridge with very small freezer enough for bag of ice cleaned and made up every day very quiet definitely recommend close to metro supermarket,1
917,we stayed here for a night break with our grandchildren rooms are very very comfortable clean and tidy with loads of space beds were also very comfortable so we slept well we all had breakfasts for mornings during our stay a very wide selection of food on the staff were very polite and helpful only downside is no late check out on rooms so no where to shower if you have a late up,1
919,rooms were huge lovely soft bed with big pillows soft sheets bathroom also more than big enough for two with nice amenities soft big towels the area around was maybe not the prettiest but a min walk from the beach close to marina metro and from roomservice was good will try capri by fraser again if they have it at my next destination,1
920,we staying here on in our anniversary great modern and good facilities the staff are very attentive and polite good location for site seeing had a few drinks at the pool and the bar maid was really friendly and helpful would recommend this hotel for all visitors the pool is very shallow perfect for little ones however then you worry about them on the high terrace breakfast was good also has english breakfast items,1
921,we stayed here recently for nights and booked the suite we were delighted with the size it was huge we are members of and were spoiled by the staff that were constantly bringing us gifts slippers chocolates mints bottled water plus a cocktail for each adult not to mention the nice glass of cava as we checked in the suite was spotless and the room was superb with a huge walk in shower with rainfall shower head and additional shower head making facilities were in the room a television in each a busy day sight seeing the plunge pool and bar was a welcome sight all the staff are helpful and friendly and mrs torres was lovely working hard behind the was spot on because i think if we picked one of the other hotels they were either a bit far out or right in the middle of main busy streets well done casanova and it staff hope to see you in the future,1
922,the casanova lies within walking distance of most major barca places to not underground is meters away rooms are neat well furnished ask for twin the room is a little larger you lookat the inside patio offering silence at are spacious and is huge choice of large fresh juices vegan veggie glutenfree range or whole us staff is really rooftop plunge pool terrace is small but venue stadting point to enjoyyour barcelona prooven quality,1
923,trendy modern yet cozy and clean hotel which is relatively central located nice and helpful staff i asked for a room with a balcony and got a really nice room with cozy little balcony had two great nights of sleep at this hotel,1
924,we had a booking mixup but they still found us a room while chasing our booking agent in new zealand to resolve the problem the gave daily updates and solved the was that impressed i have joined their loyalty programme for my next trip to spain,1
925,we stayed nights in this comfortable and clean hotel we found the staff to be friendly and helpful we enjoyed the buffet breakfast the scrambled egg looked a little passed it best as it is kept heated under lamps sausage bacon and beans cheese meats and salad fresh fruit croissants pastries and muffins there was lovely fresh orange water pineapple juice tea and coffee cereals milk and soya milk there is also facility to print boarding passes or tour tickets also liked the convenience for transport,1
926,i stayed nights in the hotel with my sister everything was clean and we were sent to the room right away without waiting the hotel staff was very nice and very helpful all the time the noise can travel through walls so if you have noisy neighbors it will be a slight inconvenience the location of the hotel was not ideal a little too far from anything to walk the closest metro station was a min walk and if you take the bus from the station right in front of the hotel you will have to change the bus line at a few stops before getting to any major than that the hotel was fine,1
927,accessibility was foremost for me choosing this hotel it was my second time visiting barcelona and i would stay here again was quite happy that i did and was in no way disappointed everything that was shown and mentioned on the site was delivered and up to par exceptional front desk and dining room staff overall my expectations were met and petit palace museum will be hotel of choice keep up the good work hopefully in the near future i will be back,1
929,we stayed for nights in late july and i was very happy with our choice rooms are a decent size for what you pay and our bathroom was big by european standards very clean and the location of the hotel is in a great area a little bit away from the dense tourist spots though not too far away tons of great restaurants on adjacent streets as well also there a very small terrace on the roof that we did discover until the last night which was my fault because it was mentioned in the hotel welcome book in our room i recommend this hotel to family and friends,1
930,me and my family were not expecing that the hotell was so nice for a day trip in barcelona the hotell felt very nice the people behind the desk was friendly and helpfull the room se had was larger than expected from the pictures and the view for me was gorgeous would go the when i take a trip back,1
931,great location just min walk from placa catalunya great spot to arrive on aerobus lovely staff basic room was clean well lit and absolutely perfect as we really only slept there comfy bed did try breakfast at the hotel lots of local cafes stay here again no worries,1
932,i found the hotel to be beautiful and pretty and in a great location it was very clean and the room was quiet the staff were friendly and helpful i would definitely stay at the hotel again and highly recommend it,1
933,we stayed one night in this conveniently located hotel although very quiet surroundings and plenty of nice shops restaurants and cafes in the neighbourhood the hotel staff was very friendly the rooms clean and comfortable a large choice in the morning for breakfast nicely prepared and well organized,1
934,possibly one of my favourite hotels to date i could compare this to a boutique hotel only for the staff and knowledge of the concierge are second to none breakfast although for some was inadequate was for us perfect not over love the al a carte aspect of this and could not yes it but what you get for your money is justified in the area if you are willing to pay for a star hotel then expect nothing less than the service and facilities you receive for relatively new hotel the experience is seamless and well worth its star the rooms are beautiful the linen immaculate and cleanliness superb if you like the finer things in life please stay here location is fantastic and staff are helpful to say the least,1
935,the location was fantastic with cute little cafes nearby and shopping right at your door step the rooms were very well appointed and it was easily recognisable that there was a high level of sophistication and attention to detail i absolutely loved the decor and velvet that flooded the hotel it was amazing how the windows in your room opened up like a balcony the bed was super large and comfy the bathroom was all dark and glitzy with an excellent rainfall staff were incredible also i will definitely be returning xx,1
936,we spent three amazing nights at the one barcelona from the that was absolutely flawless to the food and the rooftop pool and bar we could not have asked for more the bellmen are absolutely great with a genuine hospitality oriented attitude and extraordinary professionalism the room was comfortable and classy beyond words the bathroom is gigantic with great amenities the bed is incredibly comfortable and they add a special touch by bringing you the number of bottles of water that you need which is always appreciated with a degree temperature the spa and the pool are great while the gym albeit small is well equipped the only minor dislike i had was with the restaurant staff as i felt they were not at par with the rest of the hotel the hotel is walking distance to la pedrera and casa batl√≤ my friend and i like to walk and we had no problem walking from the hotel to the port or la sagrada familia there are plenty of restaurants around and it a very safe neighborhood i would highly recommend to stay at this magnificent property you will not regret it as it is worth every penny,1
937,excellent hotel beautiful rooms and great service from all staff they even had little touches that made it extra special the location was fantastic and views on the rooftop were breathtaking free relaxing spa was another plus too,1
938,we stayed in the mirror barcelona from till of july we were people in total we were returning customers from a stay in took minutes and all informations were given upfront through a booking room service closed during so we able to order food when we asked the personnel at the reception about in barcelona the answer was no i still do not believe in rooms were nice in the morning we had a visit from a big cucaracha in the room at the the clerk at the reception asked us how the stay was i said we were hungry on arrival and the took too long we were not happy about the cleaning as there was a big cucaracha in the room a few days later we called in to ask for a leftover gadget however as it was charging in the bathroom easy visible it was not found by the cleaning normal compensation for a stay in a hip hotel like the mirror would be to offer a stay for free however it seems like this hotel has some management problem,0
939,the mirror hotel is very different it is not called the mirror for any other reason you are literally walking into mirrors from floor to ceiling it is quite bed was to die for one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in in a staff are very unique they are all dressed in black and white trousers waistcoat and hat very buffet breakfast with an egg man,1
940,this is a very nice hotel close to the metro the design is special the rooms are elegant and very clean the restaurant offers you many choices i was here twice and i will come back every time because i loved it,1
941,this hotel is a wonderful luxury hotel set in a great location it is quiet enough for you to feel distanced from the hustle of the city life yet close enough for you to get a great breakfast and even walk to the city we had a lovely stay here our room was perfect i have no complaints i would definitely stay here again,1
942,we really enjoyed our stay at the mirror hotel the location is great five minutes to the next metro station and the neighbourhood eixample is also very lovely the room was clean but not really comfortable because everything in the room is white the stuff was really friendly and helpful the best thing in the hotel is definitely the pool you have a great view to the skyline of barcelona,1
943,my husband and i have just returned from a week here the hotel is in a great location for shopping and walking to all attractions unfortunately we did get the best experience as my husband was poorly and spent days in hospital however we could not fault hotel indigo spotlessly clean lovely terrace lush gandts and fantastic staff especially isabella lovely place,1
944,we stayed for nights at hotel indigo it was a last minute choice to switch hotel because of advised from our friends to check other indigo is right at the center of the city a few minutes walk to great shopping at passeig de gracia and all the major shops a few minutes walk to la rambla and if you are up to walking sagrada familia is walking distance maybe minutes walk all the must see location are walking distance from the hotel there is a metro station nearby major upscale hotels but the area is less was excellent as platinum members we had water and juices complimentary provided everyday we got upgraded to a ground floor room with a terrace and big sofa area perfect to relax lie down and drink the morning coffee the front desk was awesome patient and always ready to help we requested for a connecting room but after seeing the ground floor room we did not mind and it did not make a difference since they gave us adjoining rooms,1
945,first off i love this hotel the staff is amazing and very helpful all around the common areas and the rooms are spacious clean bright and welcoming the bar and restaurant are great i would stay here again in the future there are a couple things that i think the hotel could change to make it a much more a star visit clean the pool area we wanted to use the pool but not two occasions there was either a large party hoarding the pool or the area surrounding it was dirty full of dishes and generally a mess from other guests which detracted from the experience and caused us to go elsewhere the ac in our room was it was hot while we were in so ac was key in picking a hotel the system in my room was lacking and could not keep even on high output also the strange setup of the room where you enter the room to two other doors one to the bathroom and one to the sleeping area while nice because of privacy was strange because the ac could not flow to the bathroom making it incredibly hot all the time other than those two things which can be corrected the hotel is great and i would recommend,1
946,went to spain on a family vacation overall had a fantastic time and a wonderful experience in the country everything was great except for this hotel it was the only negative experience of my entire trip were we not so exhausted from our international flight upon arrival we would certainly gone elsewhere we paid extra to have a triple room and there was nothing triple about it with the extra bed put in the room it was nearly impossible to open the closet door which was by the way the only place to put our clothes which was ridiculously insufficient the barely functioned blowing out almost no cold air when we complained about this they tried to convince us that it worked perfectly which was a terrible way to handle the situation and a total shame located a few feet from our room was a cart of cleaning supplies this made the entire hallway smell terrible which was disgusting for any hotel let alone one of this supposed caliber and for the icing on the cake our room was filled with construction noise from some construction project which they supposedly did not know the origin of nobody got a good nights sleep while we were there we wrote an email to management with no reply clearly they do not care there are plenty of other hotels in barcelona all of our friends who went to barcelona stayed at other hotels that were at the same price point and had completely,0
947,very helpful staff before and during visit knowledgeable concierge everyone understood our english comfortable room good food close to sites the minibar was large enough to store our leftovers the bus line and also the metro were close by,1
948,nights in this beautiful hotel staff very helpful and friendly spotless clean and very comfy parking on site and good breafast blocks from metro short walk to segrada familia would stay again,1
949,this hotel is very central and we love the area the staff are all very professional and have been visiting barcelona for the past years and are happy to say that hotel dante has become like a welcome home family from all the staff and management who always go out of their way to make our stay breakfast buffet is outstanding serving a wide and delicious choice to suit all tastes we would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in barcelona,1
950,the hotel itself is ok however for the room needs to be rennovated old fashion wood and no breakfast included for this price most important not helpful staff at all even if i am gold member of best western in conclusion i dont recommend this place you have another hotel in front of dante time better than that please note the incompetent staff is the most important thing,0
951,pros located just outside station so easy transportation clean friendly staff dining room on top floor with great views we only had wine and dessert nice friendly staff allowed early check in comfortable bedcons room a bit noisy facing train station but we were happy to be able to check in early hard to find concierge couldnt figure out the hours or location,1
952,great hotel central location nice staff cool rooftop terrace highly recommend it and very comfortable rooms we had a balcony which looked out to the square which was very nice rumbla is just a walk away which is also good,1
953,very good hotel in a fantastic location i liked the fact that we were given a few little extra as we had booked using the hotel website superior room was excellent if a little compact but was very clean and comfortable with everything required roof terrace was also excellent with a good vibe but very disappointing that on our second night it had been closed due to a private function as this was one of the reasons to book the hotel i did not give star because of this front of house staff very good and friendly,1
954,i was expecting more for what we paid very cheap soap shampoo was able to sleep from the horrible pillows too noisy can hear the people chatting on the room next to us you can always hear the sound of the water coming through the water pipes in the toilet throughout the day and nught worst experience ever,0
955,great location rooms at back clean cleaning staff seemed to take a genuine pride perhaps motivated by wall mural of cleaning staff air conditioning worked well shower was excellent breakfast was really good layout was great and variety of foods available serving staff were great attentive when needed but not in your face,1
957,casa camper barcelona really is the perfect place to stay when visiting barcelona not only is it in a great location but the staff is friendly efficient and knowledgeable the rooms are modern comfortable spacious and clean the breakfast is plentiful and delicious snacks and drinks are available all day and the price is reasonable there is also a roof deck a gym your own personal lounge including a hammock free reliable wifi and an outdoor wall garden if we make it back to barcelona this is where we will stay and i would recommend this property to anyone that will be traveling there,1
958,while arriving at the air bnb i was staying at this location was down the road and was reviewed positively for the brunch we arrived and the place was busy yet they were able to seat the table of the prices were reasonable and the bottle price for cava was great,1
959,the hotel is in a very good location for walking or metro the staff is friendly and there english is very good the hotel is very clean as is the room and the bath the cost of the stay is a great value for the money i give this hotel an excellent rating,1
960,we no why this lovely hotel only have stars we want to put at least stars to it good location minutes walk from rambla and pl cataloniavery good food in the restaurant we eat the duck good breakfast in the morning untill had a penthouse with a wonderful will book here next time in barca,1
961,loved this place great breakfast great room great location too great staff pool was nice too they provided us with lots of great tips for visiting and dining in barcelona don t miss tapas restaurant nearby platilleria,1
962,not cheap at nearly for the night i stayed but i loved the hotel it could be hard to find the sign discreetly hidden behind some trees but the staff are terrific and have perfect english the decor is imaginative the aircon was a blessing and there were ingenious touches like having the aircon in the bathroom set to a higher temperature and having a little light by the toilet so you do have to turn on the light if you have a call of nature in the middle of the night it had the most comfortable mattress i ever slept on it was so handy too to have the vending machine right outside my door i liked my private balcony and that the hotel had a the price for the room the price for breakfast and the fact that the crisps in the vending machine are heavy enough to activate the release mechanism of the machine so you have to get someone from reception to rescue them oh and the free wifi was so weak that i turned it off and used my own data,1
963,stayed here for one night pity before going back home the most expensive one i paid for accommodation in my whole trip but really worth every cent spacious room proper bath room and quiet terrace the hotel was just steps to metro and very close to main tourist attractions it also only takes minutes walk to placa catalunya for aerobus if i would come to barcelona again i will certainly stay with vincci gala,1
964,comport rooms welcoming hospitality great was at place the hotel is really to a metro station plaza catalonia and the rambla there is a marketplace across the street most of the guests are so do expect lobby a hotel tax that is not part of the booking price it a small price anyways,1
965,stayed here for nights once we walked into reception we had a great feeling about this hotel we were too early to check in so on a recommendation of staff we went around the corner for lunch which was amazing the room was large with high ceilings massive bed and could be faulted i would definitely stay here again and will be recommending it to anyone that is thinking of staying in the location too,1
966,me and my husband stayed here july and we booked after reading others reviews hotel is great exactly as per the pictures on the website good location very closr to the metro which will take you to la ramblas in mins and you can walk to some other attractions within minutes theres a few supermarkets nearby and restaurants to choose from staff were very helpful at the hotel especially paula,1
967,we felt at home the minute we arrived we have never been treated so well in any hotel the staff are fabulous paula and cesar were great the rooms all have a personal theme that is fantastic and the breakfast was tasty ca recommend this hotel highly enough,1
968,the vincci gala hotel is perfect in many ways firstly the location in near urquinaona is between the old city with the restaurants monuments plazzas and shops and the new city with the beautiful buildings in paseig de gracia casa battlo and sagrada familia you will find yourself in walking distance to the barcelona catedral casa battlo and casa service is very good with very professional people a special thanks to cristina the day manager that helped us solve a problem with our rooms are very nice clean and tidy it really feels like home to open the room door and smell the fresh air with no dust beds are well made and the mattresses are hard but is a restaurant with a good offer in and i recommend the jamon iberico with tomato in all a great place to spend days in,1
969,well located clean very helpful and friendly staff only negative remark is related with window insulation to street noise during the night nice touch the free tea in the lobby area,1
971,we had the misfortune in encountering a taxi strike the day we left barcelona and would probably have missed our flights had paula not alerted us to the problem and arranged a solution this hotel is close to the gracia neighbourhood which is a great place to eat and explore and is only away from the metro which takes you to place catalunya which is central stayed at this hotel for a week and was totally rested,1
972,the hotel was simply beautiful from the building to the interior design our room was simply gorgeous with a wonderful small balcony observing the street free coffee and croissants every morning are a great way to start your wish the bed was of a better quality was the most comfortable but simply ok,1
973,it is a beautiful and cozy place in the central area everything is so thought of all the small and big details are so pleasant at some point we felt like staying in our room instead of sightseeing yes it that good staff are very friendly and helpful were nice to inform us about the taxi strike in kitchen is amazing but if you are up for a dinner better reserve a table in do expect it to be a quiet place on a friday night,1
974,stayed in this hotel for the first time chose this hotel for it history and character and that what i got friendly personel and lovely terrace where you can bring your own food and drinks the only one minus is the wifi even thou you get a transportable wifi device it is still weak and bad want to come back to this hotel when this would change,1
975,good location and services love it so much the bed is comfortable and the coffee is free every day there is a small garden you can have a rest with coffee and bread in the morning near from the mila batllo and metro station,1
976,we had a great time in barcelona recently staying at pratik rambla pros very nice and helpful staff great terrace area to enjoy location is incredible and perfect for exploring free croissants in the morning are actually excellent but make sure to get in by or they be gone cons small rooms very little space for luggage the washing subcontractor lost serveral items of my clothing still waiting to hear from hotel if they turned up overall decent for price fantastic tapas place across the road which is great for breakfast,1
977,this hotel is in a brilliany location for accessing and the main shopping square where you can easily pick up the tour bus and you be at the main sights in about mins the architecture of the hotel is beautiful and has a very gothic vibe but with a comfy modern bedroom the shower was heavenly and the little garden patio is incredibly peaceful and quaint i stayed for days and the staff were very friendly and efficient they organised my taxi to the airport which was about overall i would definitely stay here again just so convienient to everywhere but with a traditional barcelona vibe,1
978,we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,0
979,it is the time we stayed at the acta atrium palace we enjoyed the very central location close to shopping and many restaurants staff at the front desk as well as the housekeeping staff was always nice and of the beds and matrasses are a dream we slept like in heaven,1
980,excellent location and easy access for transport shopping and sightseeing very comfortable rooms and excellent friendly staff i have stayed here times due to the location you are close to plaza catalunya where you can get the bus tour aerob√∫s for airport transfer and the subway,1
981,was looking forward to finally visiting barcelona i expected it to be hot in august and it is but i never expected the air condition in the hotel to not work literally sitting in the room sweating while the air conditioner blows warm air went downstairs to reception to enquire and was told it would not be fixed until monday no concessions offered just i sorry making for a miserable first trip to barcelona do think i stay here again as a matter of fact i going to try and change hotels and request a refund not worth the money,0
983,royal ramblas is located at the end of las ramblas near pla√ßa de catalunya it is basically the times square nyc of barcelona the staff was amazing extremely helpful and friendly as soon as we arrived at the hotel we were able to check in they provided us with a map of barcelona in addition to popular sightseeing tours we can purchase as soon as you leave the hotel there are so many things to do shopping sightseeing eat there were many small cafes and restaurants nearby including la boqueria market so we did not have breakfast at the hotel we stayed in two connected rooms family of the decor is modern and the windows are soundproof the rooms and bathrooms were very clean i do wish the shower had a door instead of a curtain but that just me being picky the bathrooms can use an upgrade we were located on the floor so we had no complaints in terms of noise from the busy streets i would definitely stay at this hotel again highly recommended,1
984,we booked the hotel at the last moment after having an issue with our flight from barcelona we chose it for it location predominantly but also needed and an safe when we tried to enter a code for the safe it did not work we called reception and someone immediately came to the room he checked the safe and said it needed a new battery which they could not change that day we explained our need for a safe and asked for another room but were told they could not change the room i called reception again and they offered us another room after changing rooms that safe readout again stated batt the same as the first room that we had i went down to reception again and was told by a person there a blond female reception staffer who informed me that the safe was not working because our computer was too large i told her that the safe easily accommodated the computer at which time she repetitively insisted that i was wrong another reception person came to the room and he confirmed that there was no issue with the computer size he was able to get the safe to lock the attitude of the blonde woman was certainly not what i would expect from any customer service person especially at a star hotel generally felt worn with scratches on the walls and doors in the hallways the room was small and dark but had good closet space the,0
985,we stayed at royal ramblas for three days in july and were more than happy with our experience here first the location is excellent right at the center with walking distance to gothic eixample beach and placa da catalunya very happening place we got around and our room was ready we got a suite on the floor room there were three of us the extra bed was already made up room was very specious with two sinks and a specious bathroom as well the staff was very friendly and cooperative we did not have a view of the rambla but rooms were very quiet considering the hustle bustle on the ramblas we also had breakfast in the hotel and it was great to have coffee in the morning watching the action on ramblas we will definitely be staying here again,1
986,wonderful stay very experienced staff and it showed got there early after cruise and had to wait for room clerk was very sympathetic and even upgraded us due to the long wait it nice to have such staff,1
988,superb place to visit amazingly clean everything in place location is perfect customer service made me welcome price is affordable highly recommended for couples or families would consider going again,1
989,we stayed for nights it was a great location the staff were great room big enough for two people breakfast was good and convenient in the morning good that there was a laundry service to wash our clothes,1
990,our room was clean and appealing the bed was comfortable and the bathroom roomy for getting ready it was inconvenient to have to use your key in the elevator with all your bags and luggage but i guess that adds to the security of the hotel the location is close to the bus pick up point metro and on one of the most famous busy streets of barcelona we really did have any issues other than it would have been nice to have clean towels after a long day of exploring the city you could get them but you needed to trade your old ones in at the front desk on a daily basis,1
991,this was a very large room in an amazing location i would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone it was very clean and front desk was great i was here for days and they were extremely accommodating and nice,1
992,stayed at citadines ramblas for nights with another couple it is a great location right in the middle of la ramblas the rooms are good size and very clean the hotel also has a roof deck in the floor overlooking the city complete with lounge chairs it was great to take up some pre dinner drinks and nibblies after being out all day and just relax the hotel also has car parking at a day the staff on reception were very helpful the brekky is basic but we went to a cafe just a few doors down the road each morning we would definitely come back and stay again great value,1
993,the best location you ever dream everything is near by the hotel its make the vacation the evening its must to get to the pool that in the roof of the hotel there is a bar and with a cold beer with the view you can enjoy from a quality time,1
994,the room was terrible it was so small with no sunlight and ages old carpet the pictures on trip advisor and other party sites are deceptive there might be some rooms which are better but the room that was offered to me was not at all i would have booked if i had seen earlier me and my friend arrived here at around midnight and as soon as we saw the room we decided to leave the receptionist gave us another room to check out but it was no different so we asked him to cancel the reservation and give us our money back which was around he said due to their hours cancellation policy he could do the money back with all these back and forth by this time it was and since we paid so much already we stayed in the night we stayed in with a suffocating feeling the whole night and the old smell on top of this there was only a thin sheet to cover no comforter or anything and the bed was like a box spring so disappointed not how i wanted my vacation to start i would not recommend this hotel,0
995,wonderful hotel perfect location with access to great dining options and sights hotel was extremely clean the gentleman at the front desk was extremely friendly and approachable he made us feel welcomed from the moment we stepped into the hotel great value option,1
997,if i am back to barcelona i will visit this hotel again definitely i recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit barcelona but the noise of subway train was little bit annoying when i tried to sleep because i can feel and hear when the subway train comes near,1
998,you paying for the location here if you want five star luxury go somewhere else however if you looking for a clean comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff in the heart of the city at a very good price look no further the hotel is just off the ramblas right opposite the guell palace you ca get nearer to the beating heart of the city breakfast was indifferent but with good service the rooms are basic but very comfortable and despite us overlooking the main street surprisingly quiet this is a great hotel for exploring the finest that barcelona has to offer,1
999,stayed here for nights on first visit to barcelona situated just off the famous la ramblas promenade and close to subway not exactly inexpensive but rooms were excellent and hotel service good staff very friendly and helpful only downside was the breakfast which at is overpriced for what you get but that seems to be to trend in barcelona hotels rather do take the breakfast and instead go to a taverna or the great food market down the road,1
1000,the air conditioning was not working very well it is hot in barcelona in july someone had been smoking in the room and the air unit was just circulating the smoke we both woke up feeling ill the sheets had holes in them and we were sleeping on box springs not a mattress we were each allowed one were very disappointed and tried to book another hotel but there was noneavailability the hotel was clean and the sangria was very good but notgood enough for us to be able to sleep through the night we were exhausted,0
1001,the hotel is star and therefore relatively basic but there was nothing to complain about and the location is excellent our family room was very sizeable it was at the back of the hotel so the view was not great at all but it had the advantage of being amazingly quiet considering the proximity to the heaving busy la roof top terrace bar with glass fronted foot pool was a real treat there are views all around barcelona city and down to the port with the palau guell gaudi designed rooftop directly opposite personally i would have thought that this premier location could be turned into a much more expensive cocktail bar but it was certainly a very pleasant addition as it did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on that but would definitely stay here again if visiting barcelona,1
1002,great facilities love the roof terrace very accommodating breakfast was amazing so much choice and try everything cocktails outstanding would recommend to anyone that wants a relaxing break and has cash to burn,1
1004,i had booked a room at a hostel but that hostel was so loud and low quality that i immediately looked for a proper hotel to transfer to after quite some sleepless nights i found hotel via augusta and spent my last night there i found out it is a hotel but i give it one more star it felt like heaven after that horrbible hostel experience the room was very clean and mostly quiet and i slept wonderfully the location was fine as it is close to the fontana subway maybe the view was not the best as my room was an internal one but all i was looking for was some peace and i definitely slept like a might come back here,1
1005,we really enjoyed the mercer the rooms are but the staff is what makes this hotel unique and superb the breakfast was delicious and quite beautifully prepared each morning we had a couple of with the broken but overall a great location to wander around the gothic quarter from,1
1006,we stayed at this hotel for four nights as a family of four we stayed in a suite and had roll away beds added to the room and still had plenty of room the service was impeccable the linens were beautiful and the artwork in each room and in the corridors were inspiring most of all we loved how the hotel treated us and took care of our every need a few things to consider before staying there the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader the pool on the roof is very small so the photo is a bit misleading having said this our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city in addition it is much quieter to stay in the gothic quarter than in a hotel that faces a bustling street but this means that a taxi can barely squeeze through finally there is the price tag it is definitely luxury pricing but you are getting what you are paying for,1
1007,hotel villa emilia made our barcelona visit unforgettable we arrived to the hotel before time monica at the front desk was very accommodating and she arranged a room for us within minutes room was spacious clear and had a beautiful view of the neighborhood wifi was fast and signal was present in all areas of the building breakfast buffet offered a lot of variety and it was available until hotel offers complementary coffee tea and pastry on the rooftop between throughout our entire stay everyone at the hotel was very pleasant and accommodating pere fabregas himself who is the director of the hotel gave us useful sightseeing tips and helped us book our tickets to park guell in addition to great service hotel villa emilia is centrally located within min walking distance to most attractions that barcelona has to offer subway station is also available one block away this boutique hotel was a gem we will definitely be back,1
1008,days stay in barcelona is so short i would love to stay a little longer casa camper hotel barcelona is a wonderful place the hotel design is beautiful and very refreshing to the eyes our room was big and clean love the complimentary food and drinks that they offer we ll go back in this hotel for sure very awesome stay,1
1009,stylish hotel that always smells good friendly helpful staff very good breakfast with excellent ingredients yet a bit limited you feel that every detail in this hotel has been thought of i would surely go there again,1
1011,have just returned from a night stay friday to sunday doing my research before choosing this hotel really paid off what an absolute gem of a place fabulous location not a touristy area but so near to centre little delay on checking in but then given a great room on the floor a very spacious twin bedded room with curtains air con safe in wardrobe plenty of storage flat screen tv with many channels in different languages full length mirror and very comfy beds big bonus were the doors opening onto a sweet little balcony with table and chairs and views down the main road the room was very quiet at night slept really well free wifi worked fine good lift to all floors bathroom was also spacious with bath and shower good water temp and pressure windows opened which is always good when it hot nice toiletries served till what a spread selection of hot foods cold meats and cheeses fresh fruit cereals yogurts cakes and pastries rolls and toast huge selection of hot drinks and very nice fresh juices all fresh and replenished right up until all staff so friendly and helpful happy to advise on buses and metros fontana metro station mins walk handy supermarket and ice cream parlour on the way this line took us to nearly all the places we wanted to visit got to know it really well stops to centre of city had ordered bcn hola day card before leaving so just had,1
1013,we booked rooms for nights for various family members the hotel was everything we could wanted all of the staff were friendly and professional the breakfast was excellent plenty of choice the rooms were large and clean with plenty of facilities the hotel was in a quieter less touristy area of the city but the metro was at the end of the street and close links to all of the major attractions best bit was the rooftop bar which was a great place to have a late night drink,1
1015,hotel is beautiful location is perfect rooftop was great and changed rooms as initial room was tiny we changed to and was just enough bigger to make the difference no one would be happy in breakfast buffet was amazing staff great,1
1016,this hotel is amazing the staff are friendly the rooms are beautiful and the breakfast is delicious it was our favorite part of the time we spent in barcelona highly recommend for anyone wanting a luxury hotel in the city,1
1017,had a fabulous night break the hotel was spotless staff were very helpful really enjoyed the pool ca wait to come back very comfortable beds the shops and restaurants are on your doorstep lovely little caffe next to the hotel,1
1018,great hotel its located in the middle of the high end shopping distriict which is not my thing however there are some advantages you away from the hustle and bustle of things but yet a short walk from some gaudi building and nightlife staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel is well built highlight is rooftop which can get crowded quickly due to small size as well as an off the chain breakfast buffet would highly recommend,1
1019,was very impressed from the moment we pulled up in the shuttle they had someone that greeted us at the curb took our bags in and they checked us into a concierge type of check in room around the way from the main area from there a person explained our room and every detail and susanna made sure that everything worked out for us she made sure that our stay was special i was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful i was able to book this on expedia with my flight and so i believe i got a very good rate i been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and i would say this is been one of the best hotels i been to and it walking distance to everywhere and i especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub if there was just one tiny thing that i would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made real dark strong coffee instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere i would surely stay there again and it made barcelona even nicer oh there was a man at the rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender he was quite arrogant and unfriendly yet marissa was a hostess up there on,1
1020,we spent night at the majestic in june and booked one of the majestic residences directly across passieg de gracia from the hotel two bedrooms two full baths a ktichen room balconies laundry we had it all it would be hard to find better service or amenities than this the hotel is centrally located and we walked to many attractions restaurants including la sagrada familia la pedrera and las ramblas the hotel has a very nice spa and a rooftop lounge with a great view the full breakfast at the hotel is delicious and has choices for everyone but it is on the expensive side we did not include this in our visit but chose to eat there once for the experience we would surely stay here again on a future trip to barcelona,1
1021,excellent hotel very clean and modern and great location around the corner from the catedral although the staff were very helpful on the front desk and breakfast staff attentive and quick the bar was slow with the waiter servicing the pool on the floor room service and the bar after waiting minutes for a drink i gave up there is a need for dedicated bar staff and other services not just the one guy,1
1022,amazing breakfast i am gluten intolerant and the hotel had special bread for me which just made my vacation much easier the location of the hotel was right in the middle of the city which means everything was close to the hotel shopping centre was only a walk away and the rambla was almost beside the hotel i would definetly recomend this hotel to everyone,1
1023,great location right in the heart of the city zoo is a min walk so is the picasso museum the room was modern the was good free wifi room service they have a rooftop pool area although it could be better as it would be great to have a bar up gym is a bit of a let down one treadmill and one bike small room no water as it was always empty and the bike did operate nice touch is they do free cheese and wine at every day for guests however you get a very small glass of wine and no seconds and they do put out a huge amount of cheese which means by all the other guests have had it and they dont refill the plates and as i got abruptly told when its finished its finished overall a great little hotel right in the heart of the city would definitely stay again,1
1024,lovely modern and clean hotel the location is spot on and you can access everything you need it is a five minute walk from the place catalyuna where the airport bus drops off the hotel pool is fab very relaxing and comfortable the staff were extremely helpful and friendly our room was small but it was lovely i would absolutely stay here again,1
1025,this was an small hotel in colon ave in front of the bay i just sleep and enjoy the terraza bar the hotel personnel was very professional i would go back again free wifi if someone ask me for a fine hotel this would be one,1
1026,where do i even begin we loved our stay the hotel and the staff we thought the hotel was beautiful the room where breakfast is served is really nice the rooms were large and the bathrooms are amazing the rooftop terrace views are ridiculous it the view of the ports and it gorgeous yes the pool is small but we were there for that the beach is across the street there are plenty of tables if you like to sit but only about lounge chairs we would go up for a cocktail everyday otherwise we were running around the city if we had more time we may have lounged near the pool it did bother us really the location is everything you are close to the port barceloneta las ramblas and in the gothic quarter the only reason why it would be bad is because it hard to pull yourself out of the area to visit outlying neighborhoods really we were able to walk everywhere this was our favorite area of was incredible the spread was perfect and food fresh you are also able to pick how you like your eggs made that right there was a home run for my husband and i wish i remembered the woman name that handled the breakfast but either way she was great very friendly and very efficient and she maintained the breakfast area wonderfully the bellboy was super friendly as well i think his name was ruben he was always smiling and,1
1027,arrived hours early for check in to be told no worries your rooms will be ready in hour cava for you and your husband water for your children you are more than welcome to go to the rooftop terrace and wait fantastic the rooftop terrace is amazing fabulous view over the marina small pool great seating good food served speak to the jamon man he wonderful room was spacious enormous size bed and singles lots of space air conditioning silent sound proofing excellent children slept in until staff fantastic very forgiving of terrible spanish close to las ramblas and the port parking day loved it back in october,1
1028,the location of this hotel is perfect directly across from the port and right on the front step of the gothic quarter in addition to this though the hotel is beautifully presented and elegant we had a small room but it had lovely decor comfortable beds and a very spacious bathroom with bath and shower the hotel has an excellent rooftop bar and plunge pool to enjoy views of the port and barcelona waterfront we were also very impressed with the service particularly the friendly and professional staff and the complimentary bottle of cava that we received upon arrival it was a perfect stay in barcelona and we definitely return to duquesa again,1
1029,spent nights in this lovely boutique hotel the room had a much needed king size bed night tables with close by plugs for all your electronics bathrooms were large and modern with everything you could possibly need slippers bathrobes etc staff was amazing location ca be beat did not indulge in the breakfast but went to the bakery around the corner for chocolate croissants would definitely return,1
1030,this hotel is just a couple of minutes away from casa mila and casa battlo which is terrific the staff is very friendly the price however is higher than we have paid in other neighborhoods so i doubt we would stay here again if we were just visiting to start a cruise the breakfast buffet is very nice,1
1031,this hotel is a real gem in an amazing location it a few minute walk away from the nearest metro stop a twenty minute walk to sagrada familia upon arrival as my boyfriend had written that it was a surprise trip for my birthday we got told we got the best room in the hotel room on the top floor they really were lying amazing terrace with a table and sunbeds a huge bed and bathroom with a big bath was wonderful a day into our trip we also came home to a cold bottle of cava sat on the side with their good wishes we also went to hotel majestic the sister hotel which is a five minute walk away being able to use the top floor to sunbathe enjoy the views and swim in the pool was great if not the drinks were a little pricey just beware the staff at the hotel were very accommodating booking us a taxi back to the airport keeping our bags so we did have to lug them around the city nothing seemed too much thank you for making a trip to barcelona a great one will definitely be returning,1
1033,our daughter stayed here earlier in the month and recommended we would happily go back and would recommend this hotel to friends and family great location for the sights handy for the metro,1
1034,thank you for such a nice vacation the hotel is amazing the food is tasty i would love to come back the staff is very polite and helpful the hotel is clean and our room was very comfortable love it definitely will come back,1
1035,nice hotel good location the staff were outgoing the family suite was breakfast isnt worth the price you can do much better bar on the rooftop is fun but beware of its prices,1
1036,myself and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel in june for nights and we are so glad that we chose this hotel is in a perfect location it is within a minute walk of different metro stations urquinaona passeig de garcia and catalunya meaning that it is easy to get to from the airport or train stations and that it is a short walk or metro ride to anywhere in the city it is also only a minute walk from placa de catalunya and the top of la rambla and a short walk from the barri gotic and el born areas being located a short walk from all these areas also means that it is in a quieter area than some hotels in barcelona and we found it very peaceful each night and easy to get a good nights room itself was spacious enough for people and had a comfortable bed a nice bathroom with a very large shower shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer a safe and a lovely little area which had a couple of seats and was a lovely place to sit and have a snack and overlooked a quiet courtyard type area the room also had a minibar which was just a small fridge which we used to put our own in and was incredibly useful the air conditioning in the room worked perfectly making the room a lovely cool temperature to retreat in to when it was nearly degrees outside the staff at the,1
1037,we booked this hotel for nights in june as part of our month travelling round spain we chose this because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed this definitely feels more than a star check in was good with the receptionist spending a lot of time pointing out things on the map for us and answering our questions room was one of the best we stayed in with small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel the location was in a quiet area just off plaza de catalunya but within walking distance of la ramblas and shopping area we were minutes from el born a lovely area with good restaurants and bars we used the metro which was a handy way to see the city and very good value if you bought the ticket deal nearest met was urquinaona they have a roof top bar here which was lovely but underused which is a shame but on the plus side we always found a table,1
1038,we stayed in a tasteful clean functional room overlooking the harbor in a port view room fyi you can usually only get this type of room when you order online directly through the hotel website for our family visit of people it was a very functional we had a king size bed for the of us and a single bed for our teenage daughter there was another single daybed that we used to put our luggage the bathroom worked well for us we had a single shower in one area then there was a second having separate shower areas was great for getting ready more quickly in between both showering areas there was a fairly large area with a sink big mirror magnifying mirror and all of the various toiletry items as well as a blow dryer we had wonderful robes and thick towels they had champagne and chocolates waiting for us in the room they had many different pillow sizes and a card that allowed you could choose the fragrance of you room the room was quiet and the worked great we had troubles with the safe and had to call them separate times to get it resolved which they finally did by changing it out for a new one the room had a table desk coffee maker and mini refrigerator which was stocked with drinks and food though we did not buy any of their products instead we walked to a grocery store that was only a short,1
1039,we spend three nights in early july the room was very spacious comfortable and clean it has a nice balcony with comfortable chairs to enjoy the location walking distance to public transport amenities like la rambla plaza catalu√±aand more the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful nice area for shopping and eating out,1
1040,very nice hotel w friendly front desk staff hip and modern although the hallways may be a bit morbid dark and grey nice location although some of the surrounding streets were not exactly posh rooms were bright elevator kinda slow,1
1041,stayed for nights very clean and simply furnished hotel good location and excellent staff good breakfast excellent location and convenient for the ramblas metro felt very safe good tapas bar just up the street,1
1042,excellent great location and amenities rooftop pool is a huge bonus especially for the area would not hesitate to recommend and will return in the future service was better than other locations price was extremely competitive,1
1044,hotel is beautiful and in great location staff was amazing we were robbed at airport while leaving barcelona and they worked with me to get room since i had no id but had police report even called to check on us,1
1045,just returned from a night stay at this hotel and the best thing about this hotel is it central location which is close enough to walk to most of the main rooms are clean and whilst i understand it is an eco hotel a fridge or facilities in the rooms would really enhance the overall experience of staying at the hotel the breakfasts were great with an extensive for a star hotel which really set us up for the day there is a carrefour across the street with several shops cafes and eateries and souvenir shops all within a few mins walk la rambla is a min walk montjuic is min and the beach took us about mins the metro is at the end of the street and v easy to use you can buy the metro card for from recommended,1
1046,booked the hotel initially for being close to the train station as we were heading to madrid we directly got the feeling that we should have stayed more there as the room was so spacious and the staff very friendly breakfast was great with wide variety and a great view of this part of the city,1
1047,stayed here for nights on the floor our room was large and very spacious with the added bonus of corner windows which provided great views great toiletries were supplied and our room was cleaned each day our bathroom was enormous with a wet room and bath provided there was also plenty of wardrobe and drawer space had booked a taxi to collect us from the airport to the gran hotel but unfortunately the day we landed the whole of the barcelona taxi fleet were on a day strike we had to take the train how fortunate it was that the hotel was just across from the train station it made a big difference to on the floor was fantastic and spacious with the added bonus of panoramic views of barcelona it was lovely we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfasts here the food was tasty and the friendly staff provided a first class service other good points are the amount of lifts available if i recall there are which were quick and fast reception staff were also friendly polite and very helpful the reason i only gave stars was because of the noise of the air conditioning unit i am a very light sleeper and found it difficult to drop off with the noise but i have that same problem with any i stay here again definitely the gran hotel torre catalunya provided everything and is in a great location,1
1048,the location of this hotel is fantastic we walked most places but the metro was within a couple of blocks and when we did ride we could get everywhere we wanted to go easily the train station is right behind the hotel so trips outside of the city are convenient as well there is a bar onsite just for hotel guests and we had a lovely couple of hours there one night relaxing and drinking wonderful mojitos the room was maybe the largest hotel room i ever been in the shower could have fit four or five people and there was a separate tub as well the views were spectacular both during the day and at night,1
1049,we visited the terrace bar of the hotel for a drink and for a hotel this nice we were surprised at the aperol spritz specials although you ca see the sunset directly or the plaza catalu√±a the place is rusticly decorated with wood beams and lots of plants it provided for a nice there not much of a party scene although there is some music in the background at low volume it makes for a nice place to hang out with friends and chit chat over inexpensive drinks,1
1050,the hotel creates a fantastic atmosphere right after the entrance very good and attentive staff we enjoyed our stay immensely the room had everything needed and the bathroom was modern good and quiet ac the only disadvantage is that the room was not so quite street noise,1
1051,the location is great if you visiting for business but it a little ways out of the city center for restaurants bars etc we walked to the main shopping street which took about minutes and another minutes from there to the la rambla room was huge so was the bathroom air conditioning was nice they also had lemon water and snacks in the lobby which was nice because it was insanely hot and humid outside july the staff were very friendly and helpful and you get access to the rooftop pool at the adjacent hotel which was a really relaxing way to start your day each day,1
1052,a nice hotel perfectly located to visit barcelona and enjoy restaurants and shopping friendly staff absolutely need to check out the rooftop it is extremely nice and we had a great time every evening up there as it was never too busy,1
1053,we stayed here for nights and it was amazing the staff are so lovely and nothing is too much for them they are so helpful letting us know all the good places to visit and where to eat the hotel is beautiful very clean and modern breakfast was nice too,1
1054,i would like to comment on this plus room hotel in orense is nice and clean change the linen daily bathroom is well stock with toiletries like shampoo shower gel tooth brush and paste they also have a cafeteria and restaurant where you can eat very good food at economic price staff are great happy and very here days and very happy,1
1056,we stayed for four nights great breakfast and nice rooms some noice from the rambla and also from adjacent rooms price to match the location but after all price was meters to liceau metro station and also bus to the beach,1
1059,great nice clean good service confortable bed and clean bathroom the location is perfect if you are looking for location this is perfect it does have breakfast included this is a hassle but you still have a few coffee houses nearby,1
1060,we had a superb day stay at the jazz hotel the situation is perfect for being at the heart of things to see and do as it is so had breakfast in our rate and it was very good with a multitude of choice on what to eat and staff were all very polite and helpful and quick to clear also made use of the rooftop pool most days which was great and the bar was nice is a very vibrant and busy city but it was great to come back here just to chill we would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again if hopefully we return to barcelona,1
1061,this hotel was located in a great area everything is within walking distance las rambles and the airport shuttle were only a few blocks away as well as the university the hop bus is nearby too the breakfast opens at but we had to depart to the airport shuttle by so they packed a good breakfast for us to take with us the room was large with a king size bed and it was very clean the flat screen tv was large the room was very clean our room over looked the street and their was very little noise the hotel staff was friendly we were in town for one night but will definitely stay here again,1
1062,great hotel excellent staff and service hotel situated perfectly for all the mainattractions of barcelona and i would without hesitation recommend it to anyone planning a trip to barcelona everything you would want is within a three minute walk las ramblas metro stations airport bus station and more the hotel also has a good free wifi service,1
1063,good location and easy to find after using the aerobus into town clean modern roomy and comfortable no recognisable english channels on tv but reception did offer help to change language settings for some other channels good facility on the roof terrace although those staff were a weakness thought it was a good overall and pleased with the outcome overall on quality and value for money known worse and always hope fo r better,1
1064,we stayed here for nights for a city break my son and daughter were upgraded to a deluxe room which had brilliant air conditioning but was on the la rambla side of the hotel so got a little street noise we were on the quiet side but our air conditioning was not adjustable and so the room felt quite warm the breakfast offered a good choice of hot and cold food the rooms were basic but clean and the location of the hotel was excellent for seeing all the sights the metro station was a couple of minutes walk and we bought three day passes which made travelling very easy we went on a free walking tour which was really informative besides going to parc guell sagrada familia and the beach load of shops so lots of reatail therapy and so many restaurants with tapas and other great food,1
1065,this is definitely a boutique hotel with very high standards on customer care from the beginning the reception is different than any hotel you know the policy in this hotel is give you the best possible personalized attention the room is big enough for everything you need and you always will find a little surprise after your room is cleaned in the summer is a must a visit to the pool on the roof,1
1066,stayed at the hotel ohla for nights july and would definitely stay here again check in was nice and easy they also gave us some cava and a refill while checking in room was spacious and clean we were on the second floor right over the wine bar the street via laietana was right outside our window and we were not bothered by any street noise nice touch having a free bottle of water for both of us every night breakfast was nice pastries scrambled eggs delicious cured meats and little sandwiches you can ask for fried or poached eggs and cave is top bar and pool is beautiful great place to grab a cocktail and take in the views of the city the pool closes at so no late night favorite place to grab a drink in barcelona was at the hotels bar vistro there were three couples in our group and every night we would meet at the bar before heading out and then end the night there with a nightcap our bartender was amazing she is studying mixology so we had fun trying her different location was perfect for our stay easy to walk to the cathedral las ramblas placa de catalunya and many restaurants or just ask the concierge and they will call you a advantage of the concierge they pointed us to some of our favorite meals in the will recommend this hotel and next time in barcelona will book again,1
1067,the hotel is a boutique hotel so it does have all the bells and whistles of a large hotel however the roof top swimming pool is spectacular the rooms were very modern with a large comfortable bed location is close to everything beach gothic quarter and service was excellent too but like i said the roof top is the selling spent the end of our travel days chilling in the swimming pool perfect way to end tapas bar also had very creative and delicious dishes,1
1068,i had a wonderful time here roof top pool and bar was amazing the breakfast which was included was great roi and service second to none this will be my first choice when i return to beautiful barcelona,1
1069,we went to eat at plasshola the food was terrific then we had a drink at the rooftop bar the view from there is spectacular and the ambiance and service is great we found that luis the former head bartender of the delano in miami now lives in barcelona and works at this beautiful place i strongly recommended to anyone that comes to barcelona,1
1070,great time at this hotel brilliant location to visit all parts of the city so close to the metro buses trains easy walking distance to las ramblas staff were really friendly and helpful and loved our duplex room,1
1071,we stayed here for nights on a weekend break the hotel itself is really nice i was very surprised it was so cheap the location is great with lots of great restaurants around try cu cut across the road some of the best tapas i ever had you are in walking distance of las ramblas minutes if that where you looking to go very close to tube stations etc the hotel room itself was so so nice all done in very high quality bed was very comfy and the decor in the room was just very nice our room was quiet very relaxing air con good and high quality towels and sheets etc the reception area was also very nice staff were attentive and friendly but not they would say hello when you walked in but were then asking lots of questions etc we saw the roof terrace very small with a small pool but it looked very nice we did go up there in the evening but i imagine it nice for a drink and open until but could get crowded we did actually go down to the restaurant but heard music from there as we were heading out one night it sounded good event would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back,1
1072,fantastic hotel in a great location comfortable room very friendly and helpful staff plus a fantastic rooftop bar and pool we spent three nights there in july and would go back in an instant ca recommend it enough,1
1073,i do see barcelona as one of the nicest city and keep coming time i chose granados and stayed i really love being in water i decided to take the duplex room with a privat pool on the terrace of the second meter long and only have to share it with your direct i loved that the beds were very good too and it was just like having a second the roof there a real nice bar with another pool aswell and it a nice cozy place especially in the early entire hotel had a real nice feeling very warm and area where the hotel is you find some small restaurants and shop and the metro is about min staff was very friendly and helpfull and i definitely recommend this hotel in beautiful barcelona,1
1074,this is a great hotel with a great location beautiful neiborhood close to many attractions metro very close by rooms are medium size with spacious bathroom and confortable bedding the hotel has a very nice restaurant and the staff is professional and friendly if i have the chance to return to barcelona i will choose this hotel again,1
1075,great place to stay professional friendly great location close to cathedrals and shops plus it was only a couple stops via train to the beach restaurants around the hotel are also very good however the breakfast plus free buffet in the afternoon was amazing,1
1076,we stayed a catalonia born for nights and had a very good time the hotel went above and beyond any expectations we location the hotel is located close to the arc de triumf and you find delicious restaurants like casa lolea within min walk from the hotel the staff was super friendly and the rooms were in very good condition the same goes for the pool and sundeck at the rooftop which came in handy after a long day of walking through the city the breakfast at catalonia born was the best breakfast i ever had at a hotel it had everything you could think of and more all in all a hotel that completely exceeded our expectations and i sincerely recommend it to anyone planning to visit barcelona,1
1077,catalonia born is the ideal place to stay in comfort and style in the funky el born area super comfortable beds spacious bathrooms clean and well decorated it does the adage good things come in small packages proud the rooftop pool is tiny but offers respite from the heat and crowds our balcony could fit two people standing but overlooked the glorious street below the courtesy buffet daily has a small range of fresh and healthy food salads sandwiches something hot a soup yoghurt milk drinks good coffee snacks to recharge the batteries a lovely touch we could find an airbnb we liked in this super location the extra we paid for this quiet hotel was worth it as we found barcelona an exhausting city highly recommend if it fits your budget,1
1078,catalonia born was our first experience in barcelona cab driver had a hard time finding the hotel upon entering we were greeted with big smiles that made us feel very welcomed the rooms were very nice and we loved our little balcony looking out were could see how the people live and we love that we had happy hour at hotel and they have free food all afternoon into the night the cava was great close to everything including great restaurants hop on off and pretty much everything you wanted to do in the city i recommend not just for the price but the location was thanks hope and rick from florida,1
1079,recent visit from hotel reception is very modern and check in was painless the rooms were nice and had safe included the bathrooms were big and came complete with bath shower along with douse shower as separate pool area on the roof was nice of an evening although do expect to swim as very hotel between offers complimentary soft drinks pastries and coffee which is a really good touch there is a bar which serves reasonably priced is really good as recommend the hotel,1
1080,we added a day to our celebrity equinox cruise and spent the night at this wonderful hotel in barcelona this was the first time we stayed at a crowne plaza property and were amazed at the size of the room and the extensive included breakfast buffet highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in barcelona the location is outside the city center but a reasonable taxi ride,1
1081,would recommend not too far from nearest metro our room came with a beautiful view which could also be found on their gorgeous rooftop bar breakfast was lovely and staff were very helpful the complementary hat and fan was a great touch all around brilliant base for your barcelona trip,1
1082,we stayed in a suite and paid extra for the club room it was worth the extra expense because we had a full breakfast buffet in the morning free drinks for most of the day and snacks in the evening the club room also had a concierge who was very knowledgable and helpful the fitness room was great for a hotel this was the perfect hotel for the three of us,1
1083,from start to finish it was brilliant a good location close to the metro and a reasonable walk to the main areas the car park is great as well the staff took care of our case as we arrived early and set off for our exploration of the city we came back later to check in and were taken to the club lounge as we had booked club rooms the staff were fantastic and we enjoyed a drink there with our children and checked in our case was taken to our room while we were there breakfast was great exactly what we needed and was also served in the club lounge there is a new roof top pool which is small but enjoyable with a great view the bar is also nice with a good selection of food we had a late check out so returned here after a trip to camp nou for a drink and some nibbles i would not hesitate to stay here again brilliant,1
1084,iÃáts in the center of the city iÃáts very closed to airport buses also if you like to use smart moving system hop off buses are extremelly closed to the hotel in addition design of the room is perfect i am sure that you will like this lovelly hotel,1
1086,i booked rooms for year olds checked in handed in passports and credit cards i then receive a call saying they ca stay in the hotel as there is not anyone over i said ok if that is the case no information about this on website i will have to move them to another hotel they then said they would not give us a refund terrible unreasonable service expected to keep money and not allow the rooms to be used,0
1088,we had stayed in barcelona before in an apartment and were very disappointed so we searched for a hotel in a quiet location but still within walking distance to most attractions musik boutique hotel was that and so much more our room was quiet clean nicely appointed with great nice bathroom toiletries the front desk staff was helpful and friendly we were so close to everything we wanted to revisit during our second trip to barcelona walked to each of them i will reserve here again if i ever return just a note i booked through expedia we had a bad experience going through,1
1089,as the other comments say its a perfect oasis in the gothic quarter in between the famous narrow streets rooms new and very comfortable bed great shower and small reception compact bar breakfast very respectable at eur small outside seating for breakfast very much recommended,1
1090,if you want to be in the heart of the old city but do want to pay for a four star option musik boutique is the hotel for you you a very short walk from the cathedral and tons of places to order tapas we were also able to make the minute walk to the beach one day the hotel will let you use its beach towels so no need to pack those overall it a rather clean hotel the turn down service was we checked in we found a puddle of yellow liquid in our shower the next day there was a leak in the ceiling above the shower which better explained it i told the gentlemen at the front desk after both occurrences that was the only real unpleasant part of the if you book with an ota that has you pay up front make sure the representative at the front desk does charge you again when checking in this happened for my stay and the situation was rectified when i pointed it out,1
1091,stayed here for days july in barcelona we alighted at metro station arc de triomph and walked towards the direction of hotel and initially found the location to be bit weird in between narrow lanes was bit skeptical whether chose the right one but all our concerns were cleared once we entered the hotel and checked into our room really cosy room and neat clean bathroom very comfortable bed and good air conditioning later during the day we realized that our stay was indeed very close to the gothic area of the city which was amazing with its architecture and narrow alleys apart from that the most famous area las rambla was also walkable from our location breakfast spread was really good manager at the reception was more than happy to serve the breakfast half an earlier when we requested that we have to go for an early sight seeing trip late nights you might feel the place to be slightly deserted but we never felt any safety issues overall a very good place to stay in barcelona room rates are slightly on the higher side though but not complaints,1
1092,just stayed at this hotel for my partners birthday they left a bottle of sparkling wine and lovely letter welcoming us what a lovely touch good location for lots of places reception knowledge very good staff here definitely go the extra mile room was very clean and modern with lovely touches,1
1093,great location friendly staff and very nice rooms stayed nights and enjoyed a great trip due to the central location and great access to the transit system nearby only complaints the first being that the room was far too hot when we first arrived and although the ac works it takes a day or two to really get the temperature down and keep it down second being the gym is a bit small and the available weights are anything challenging for a regular gym goer,1
1094,the hotel was amazing in a perfect location not too close to the busy city centre but also not too far with everything you need around it staff were amazing and very helpful the rooms were spotless and beautiful food was stunning,1
1096,we visited barcelona for the atp barcelona open and chose this ultra modern hotel purely for its location close to the tennis club turned out to be a very good many other has a very good restaurant pleasant and helpful staff and is a short walk from the maria cristina metro el corte ingles department store and other definitely be staying here for next year tournament,1
1097,arrived in a very hot barcelona on july for a weeks stay lovely reception area and one of the most helpful receptionist we ever come across did get his name but gentleman with glasses and grey hair booking in was easy and we were directed to our room really nice room with a balcony which over looked the road which did get busy at times but did really bother us the bed was huge and very comfortable the bathroom was tasteful with black marble shower over the bath toilet and sink with plenty of storage around it talking of storage the wardrobe was fine but not so many hangers but drawer space very limited we had bed and breakfast which was nice again the continental choices were better than the cooked items but plenty of fruit yoghurt cakes juices etc and the coffee was really good location of the hotel is good with metro only a couple of minutes stroll away buy a ticket very good value rides and people can use it it costs euros but we like walking so walked to places like sagrada familia mins and la rambla mins all in all a really good hotel would definitely return,1
1098,everything about this stay was spot on perfect location just outside really busy areas but within easy reach of all tourist sites the staff were pleasant and really helpful with directions recommendations and even phone calls for us to chase up our airport room was large clean and comfortable with mini bar tea coffee making facilities as well as a small terrace to sit on in the did try the gym or roof terrace but a lovely addition fault the hospitality standard of hotel bar service or happily recommend and if in barcelona again would stay anywhere else,1
1099,we had a great experience in we stayed days during our holidays in barcelona the rooms are large and very clean we take a triple room and we discovered that it had bathrooms reception very friendly and very close to the subway station mero stop hospital clinic location because also in the surroundings there are many bars pubs and restaurantvery recommended,1
1100,time in this beautiful hotel nice rooms nice people nice everything is perfect great atmosphere and great furnitures perfect place to stay when in barcelona eixample is one of the nicest neighborhood,1
1101,my partner and i enjoyed an excellent night stay at this hotel it is well located in close proximity to the metro and gothic quarter and a minute walk to place de catalunya which is a central hub of activity in room was not ready upon arrival however hugo was most helpful in letting us drop our bags in to go exploring the room was lovely and spacious with a bathroom and separate dressing room there were complimentary chocolates on arrival to the room and each late afternoon at approx our room was left with more chocolates and neatened up separate from the main clean during the day the hotel is clean and has a lovely terrace bar with a swimming pool with ample space to sunbathe eat and only downside was that their were noisy roadworks going on opposite which started early morning however this was no fault of the,1
1102,we had a fabulous days here with our two teenagers the rooms were spotless cleaned daily and the air conditioning unit was so quiet and functioned perfectly the staff were helpful and courteous especially the pool side bar men and ladies breakfast was plentiful with so many choices to suit all needs the hotel was in a lovely area taxis were cheap approx euros including tip to park guell and sagrada famillia the taxi rank was right outside the hotel we visited the picasso museum and la rambla which were great and the gothic quarter was amazing to walk around we also walked to the beach which was quite hard in the heat but an experience worth having,1
1103,we were two couples stayed nights at nh podium in july the hotels is lovely inside and outside spacious and clean rooms separate area super quite ac quality bed sheets the staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions the location is excellent although at first it seemed a bit more tucked in away from the major sites than we expected but it actually proved to be a very convenient and quite there are two subway stations nearby but we did not use them as for four of us taxi was really cheap and we walked to the most of the attractions also bought a sightseeing hop off bus tickets which we used as transportation as well especially for the more remote attractions placa catalunya is a min walk along ronda de sant pere very pleasant street lined up with mature trees and we would go through el born quarter to get to the gothic quarter via passeig de lluis companys just east of the hotel and then take one of the many streets that cut diagonally into the el born we did not opt to have breakfast at the hotel as it was unreasonably expensive about euros per person per day instead we enjoyed breakfast at many nearby restaurants especially on passeig de sant joan street just east of the roof top bar and pool is a huge bonus for us it was a meeting point in the morning and the place to have last drink before,1
1104,booked this hotel for our honeymoon after a long search for the perfect hotel i think it safe to say we found it i contacted hugo and mentioned it was our honeymoon and he could have been more helpful nothing was too much hassle and he always had a smile on his face the hotel is very well situated and is within walking distance everything is no more than a minute walk away or minute taxi ride of some incredible restaurants and all the of the usual sightseeing destinations associated with the city the streets around the hotel are nice to walk through and it is a two minute stroll to the arc de triomf the rooms were excellent really well maintained and very fashionable the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a nice shower and bath last but not least was the rooftop pool the views towards the beach were perfect and being able to relax and swim away the days was lovely i could imagine us spending our honeymoon in a different hotel it was a perfect getaway and i sure we will return before long,1
1105,eight of us went to barca for my daughter birthday and my sister in laws birthday the staff were very friendly and welcoming the hotel was modern and clean rooms were spacious and beds very comfotable special mention should be made to hugo who organised a birthday treat in our rooms for both the birthday girls this was very much appreciated a really nice touch to the overall experience location wise the hotel is only a walk from the beach and la rambla would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again when we return,1
1106,nice staffnice pool super nice pool view but small so better go in the morning instead of afternoon room is big i choose the city view one shower room is big with rain shower but half space blocked by the grab bars maybe my room specific for handicap person shower room need to be improved as all wet after shower mini bar is free in the room location is good,1
1107,wonderful hotel excellent staff terrific amenities made the trip w would go back to barcelona just for the hotel terrific views very helpful staff and excellent highly recommend staying at negresco princess hotel,1
1108,excellent and modern hotel in the centre of barcelona and has the the amenities required and more the superior rooms are spacious and worth the extra cost shower is amazing my main complaints are that the air conditioning is set wayyyy too cold and the housekeeping stayed there for days and housekeeping were not on top of changing towels or the bed sheets or vacuuming had to request towels to be delivered regularly was a very poor experience in this regard compared to other hotels we have stayed in across europe house keeping needs to lift its performance,1
1109,stayed here for four or five nights in found after checking out so many hotels around lexiemple that this one was perfect architecturally great roof top pool was roof top bar has great views and great drinks service patrons to look at location was great reservations were easy over email and check desk staff were ca say this is my in barcelona,1
1110,this modern hotel is in a great location only a few blocks from passeig de gracia and placa de catalunya the gothic quarter el born la rambla were all within walking distance all staff were very friendly and helpful from to i had a room with a terrace and the terrace was huge a great place to have drinks in the evening or enjoy the sunshine during the day the top floor has a terrace bar and pool area a nice place to relax with views over the city there was a wide selection at the breakfast great location great staff and an enjoyable stay,1
1111,the magnificent white staircase and giant black and white photos gave the feeling you were in a movie loved the delicious free afternoon teas and the terrace was great for a drink room was small but excellent edurne on reception could not have been more helpful loved the location and will be back,1
1112,this was the second time my husband and i stayed at the hotel granvia nights in july and nights july we liked the hotel very much in but our time in barcelona was too short this year we decided to end our two week trip in northern spain and france at hotel granvia because it was our favorite hotel during our previous trip to spain hotel staff members were generally pleasant and professional i especially appreciated the young gentleman at the front desk who helped me get my laptop to connect with the hotel internet i will long remember the warm smiles of karen one of the staff at the breakfast and afternoon tea buffets she was very attentive to guests and i enjoyed talking with her briefly a couple of times when she was not too busy we enjoyed everything about this hotel very comfortable bed and room excellent breakfasts in a very nice area the terrace the computer and library area and the neighborhood the decor was very interesting and appropriate to the hotel history the location was ideal for us we could easily walk to many of the places we visited but the subway and airport bus were nearby when we needed them,1
1113,stayed for nights in june with my partner and hotel granvia did not disappoint we got a free room upgrade and bottle of champagne as this trip was for my so this was a lovely surprise upon is simply amazing very central and right next to a metro station which we used to get to the was not huge however there was a built walk in wardrobe which was ideal for placing clothes and suitcase in order to avoid clutter in the was simple yet very classy and elegant again bathroom was not huge i have experienced bigger bathroom in barcelona but it was not an issue shower was provided in large bottles which is ideal if travelling for a short trip and only have small hand luggage allowance on plane we did not have breakfast included as was cheaper for us to go to a nearby cafe an amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around if i remember rightly and it was delicious sandwiches cakes etc and all homemade additionally there is a lovely terrace outside at the back of the property where you can sit and relax and make use of the bar menu the nachos and potatoes were not the best would definitely recommend and stay again,1
1114,the moment you walk into this hotel you feel like you in a high end boutique hotel and the lady at the front desk was lovely and helpful with a quick check in the location is super convenient mins walk from where the aerobus stop in placa catalunya and tons of restaurants and bars are nearby our room was large and super comfortable and clean after a long overnight flight from toronto the shower with excellent water pressure and lots of hot water was a nice welcome after walking the streets of barcelona in the summer heat the powerful ac was always nice to come home to the lobby has a beautiful white staircase with some cool art that is instagram worthy overall a great stay,1
1115,excellent professional and friendly quality service food and terrace with swimming pool and wide variety of food to eat any would definitely stay there next time visiting barcelona,1
1116,i highly recommend hotel omm with its prime location that you can basically walk to most places restaurants and shops with great services very clean and with the most friendliest staff we have ever met the front desk staff were very friendly and informative and the rest of the hotel staff from waiters to housekeeping were very very nice helpful snd welcoming bellmen worked hard to serve us to the extend that they will be running the streets to find the best taxi for us since we are a big family also the food was tasty and eclectic and each maincourse we ordered at roca bar was tasty and yummy especially the chicken tendoori with modern twist ca say enough good things we will be back again thank you,1
1117,excellent small bijoux hotel you could walk past on grand via it within easy walking distance to the regular bus routes and the bus touristique red and blue lots of local restaurants to try out and big shopping areas all around the hotel is clean and the room is quiet spacious with a great powerful shower and excellent air con required at the moment with these extreme temperatures staff are really helpful and friendly a special mention to karen in the restaurant who every morning has charmed us with her friendliness and kindness highly recommended,1
1118,this was truly an outstanding experience from the beatuiful facilities to the gracious and accommodating staff we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in barcelona dining and a fun and vibrant rooftop bar experience i only wish we could have stayed longer staying at hotel omm is a must when you in barcelona,1
1119,i highly recommend hotel omm with its prime centralized location that you can basically walk to most places restaurants and shops with great services very clean and with the most friendliest staff we have ever met the front desk staff were very friendly and informative and the rest of the hotel staff from waiters to housekeeping were very very nice helpful snd welcoming we were greeted daily by each hotel staff member with nice big smile all the time we were the hotel the bellmen worked hard to serve us to the extend that they will be running the streets to find us the best taxi since we are a big family of food was tasty and eclectic and each maincourse we ordered at roca bar was tasty and yummy especially the chicken tendoori with modern twist ca say enough good things we will be back again thank you you have a winning hotel team,1
1120,our travel agent suggest omm since she had herself stayed there and was impressed by the staff and the hotel the location for us was perfect since we have friends that actually live near by we enjoyed heading out and walking all over the area and the metro was right there if we needed it the rooms were very good we had a standard and a the superior being a bigger size and that was nice the front desk and all the staff were very friendly and helpful the morning breakfast was very good an excellent mix of local treats and foods as well as the ability to have eggs made as you wish the only thing we found odd and not in a bad way were the hallways to the they were darkened and lit by glowing florescent floor lights cool looking but very dark and kind of futuristic in a weird an excellent stay and a top notch staff,1
1121,one of the greatest hotel in barcelona spain and europe i recommend it for your journey in barcelona leisure or business as long as you can afford it good services great people and great city do miss the arola restaurant ask anything at the front desk and they can almost provide anything requested neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci velit,1
1122,we stayed here on several occasions whilst visiting my favourite city in spain amenities were perfect excellent service and friendly polite and respectful staff everywhere we went from the gym to the swimming pool breakfast etc handy to the beach and niteclubs are within walking distance magnificent night vista over the city highly recommended,1
1123,the hotel arts was meant to be one of the best hotels in barcelona but it does not live up to this hype at those reading this you will probably see all the other star reviews and think this guy is talking nonsense but the truth is that this hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre with no soul or atmosphere if you are a family do go here stay at the there was a queue for the lifts and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a paying customers should get priority i think the swimming pool was as small as a fish tank the water was as cold as the atmosphere for a hotel with floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area furthermore there were no changing rooms on the pool level disappointing for a five star hotel on the contrary when we visited the w hotel which was cheaper saw it had multiple panoramic pools large and spacious enough for a luxury food was another problem our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of euros for a family of the pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed euros at max to make but was sold at over euros just because this is,0
1124,we had three rooms for a one week stay and each rooms occupants had a wonderful experience rooms were impeccably clean and spacious room service and laundry were well done location is very close to the beach and night life,1
1125,i was taking my daughter and two granddaughters on their first trip to europe cruise on mediterranean to italy decided to spend days in lovely barcelona first chose and reserved two rooms beds bathrooms and sea view a year in advance all confirmed and then reconfirmed upon arrival one room ready exactly what i wanted adjoining room was then given away while we waited for luggage offered apologies and then a suite suite had no sea view only beds only full bathroom i was supposed to sleep on a sofa bed and rollaway we let my granddaughters use the suite i went back to original room offered free cocktails with dinner and that was it by the way is near hospital so sirens all night service at meals was excellent but would never use hotel again,0
1126,we stayed here for nights in july and everything was great it is a small atmospheric hotel with great facilities and a great location breakfast buffet each day was plentiful and reception staff were very helpful very easy to get around from the hotel and walking distance to a lot of shopping and metro station very close rooftop terrace and pool was a great bonus to relax after out explorinfg would definitely stay here again if in barcelona,1
1127,nice small hotel small swimming pool top of the floors nice present free beverage in rooms clean comfirmtable stay little balcony our room was open view to barcelona towndown streets happy stay,1
1128,hotel is very well located on a quite neighborhood walking distance to la sagrada familia or la batllo the service is impeccable staff is friendly and committed room is big clean and charming food is good would definitely go back,1
1129,a great hotel and neighborhood comfortable bed accommodating and friendly staff and lovely pool area we made the mistake of booking a place near las ramblas our first night and are so glad we moved to well and come after that close enough to everything we wanted to see and much more touristy great restaurants around safe to walk late at night the hotel offered a lot of little extras which were nice touches like a complimentary drink afternoon tea chocolates on the pillows water and other beverages etc very reasonable rates for the quality we have already recommended this hotel to a friend going to visit next month,1
1130,i had only one night in barcelona my daughter recommended to stay in gr√†cia a hip artsy neighborhood with great restaurants and bars the hotel location was perfect the price was very good and the staff wonderful my room had a rooftop terrace with kitchenette and plenty of space,1
1131,i love everything about the hotel a very nice customer services really appreciated a night sift customer service a man who barely speak english but go the extra miles to help us definitely recommended a very clean and good located hotel,1
1132,really helpful staff cleaning every day fully equeipped kitchen you even find a sponge liquid detergent olive oil salt pepper clean room and bathroom comfy beds with two types of pillows free in rooms with good speed free safe box supermarkets just minutes away one of the most significant advantages the tube station fontana minutes away as well one more fact every day you delivered fresh news in your own language if you stay in a room with windows overlook the so called well it a benefit it quiet cool no scorching sun actually it the best hotel we ever stayed for the last years,1
1133,a very clean hotel rooms not over big and no view but it is in the middle of a city the staff were exceptional easy to get to as it near the metro the continental breakfast set us up for the busy day ahead we even had a foot massager in our room great after a days walking free wi if came in very handy definatley worth considering and yes i would go again,1
1134,the hotel is extremely professionally run and modern staff are very attentive and we loved the fact it not a chain or a huge hotel the pool is on the rooftop and quite large in comparison to other barcelona hotels we thoroughly enjoyed our time here the only down side would be it a tiny bit further out this may not be ideal for those who like to be central,1
1135,i stayed here with a friend for nights this summer i have previously stayed at the serras which is also an exceptional hotel nearer the marina but i would say the ohla in eixample is very much in the same league the property service and location are all the hotel is modern clean and the room design excellent the pool on the top floor is also a great never feeling too crowded and again attentive service the concierge assisted us with etc with ease the location is great far enough away from the bottom end of las ramblas but instead situated at the top of the more chic shopping district i would recommend this hotel without exception,1
1136,vam tastar el men√∫ desgustaci√≥ a la terrassa de i va ser una experi√®ncia magn√≠fica el cambrers van ser motl simp√†tics i atents el menjar bon√≠ssim i les vistes espectaculars segur que repetirem aquesta experi√®ncia a la nostra ciutat we tasted several tapas on the hotel terrace and it was a great experience the waiters were friendly and attentive great food and spectacular view of barcelona surely we will repeat this experience in our city,1
1137,my friend and i stayed here from july and found the hotel staff very helpful our room was just a comfort one but was very clean and adequate for a base for our sightseeing around another mirror full length would be helpful in the bedroom especially for two ladies trying to put on their makeup the breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed sitting outside on the sunny terrace every roof top terrace bar is great for a relaxing drink in the evening so all in all i we were impressed,1
1138,our stay at ohla eixample was an absolute delight spacious rooms and bathrooms with all essential amenities great service as well with an extremely helpful concierge that helped us with reservations tapas recommendations ticket bookings et all the hotel is brilliantly located with plenty of nearby shopping and eating options highly recommended and will definitely stay here again,1
1139,we spent nights in barcelona stayed in ohla exiample hotel it starts with a perfect opening by offering cava to us when we walked in on a hot day the staff were really helpful and friendly rooms are service was multiple times a day to keep it very clean this is the perfect place to stay short or long in barcelona surrounded by multiple shops cafe closer to many place of interests the roof swimming pool was really great i enjoyed quiet and sunny morning swimming a lot,1
1140,we went for a birthday weekend away last weekend the hotel is fantastic decor size of rooms location and to top it all off the staff and service was exceptional they made sure we were well looked after we hired their bikes they booked restaurants for us they surprised us with birthday cake the breakfast was good they have on tap snacks and drinks all day long we had intended to go to the gym but did have enough time and there was too much equipment in the gym but it way more fun to cycle all round the city down to the can not say enough good things about this hotel highly recommend staying here,1
1141,location is perfect breakfast so satisfied clean helpfull staff just next to la pedrera el nacional and plaza catalunya is so touristic and business so good it own garden so big and at the top there is a terrace bar which is popular for local people too,1
1142,we stayed nights at gallery hotel spending vacation the hotel is located one block from passeig the gracia which is the main avenue of bcn all the stores and of main gaud√≠ museums are if you have good mobility you can explore everything walking we could get to la sagrada fam√≠lia casa battl√≥ parque g√ºell this is kinda far and casa mil√° great restaurants and stores are just by as well a place to stay in bcn,1
1143,i went to barcelona in a business trip and stayed at the hotel due to the great location i was very pleased with the room and friendliness of the personnel in particular i have to mention javier and ricardo at the reception for their help and suggestions and bianca at the swimming pool she is a treasure i managed to get a full operating office under the sun overlooking the city from the pool at the top of the what a treat after that i reserved the same table every afternoon until my departure i got my ideal office there,1
1144,lovely hotel great location slightly away from the main tourist parts but easy to get everywhere staff were extremely helpful and friendly great breakfast selection and we had a wonderful evening meal as well barcelona is a fantastic city and i would definitely recommend the gallery hotel,1
1145,a very nice hotel in a great location staff were very friendly and helpful best of all is the roof terrace cocktail bar do not miss out on a late evening drink and check out the views they also have a great range of tapas and other bar snacks at competitive prices although barcelona is not a cheap place,1
1146,i spent one at the gallery hotel before getting on a cruise i found the hotel to be quite comfortable and staff to be friendly and helpful when i went down to late in the day to catch the cruise line rep to ask about the next day transfer the guy at the desk had all the answers i needed room economy roomthings i loved comfy free breakfast great toiletry kit though i would have loved the addition of a lots of outlet decently priced room service free slippers free welcome bottle of for putting your own drinkswhat could have been better a box of tissues was not in the the room i was in had no hotel info so i did know what was available to me ie restaurants spa services etc the location is ok not the best but not bad either main tourist sites are not as close as the brochure says though you can still walk to more than a few including sagrada no view at all at least not for my room in fact when i looked out my window i could see directly into other people rooms which of course means they could see into mine,1
1147,very good value stay in a lovely part of barcelona the recent addition of the rooftop bar and pool made our stay all the more enjoyable we stayed with family and friends and had a very enjoyable time service is good and reception staff very friendly and helpful,1
1148,higher rooms have great views all have a view of the plaza i think they upgraded us two room categories to the top floor for our honeymoon it was so nice and they also gave us a bottle of cava our first and last nights and we only stayed three nights there is an easy bus to and from the airport that is right outside the hotel the tour buses also pick up right outside and you can walk to many sights and endless bars and restaurants the doorman was so kind to us and even said a final goodbye to us a few hours early because he knew he would be working when returned to get our bags to leave for the airport they all really made a point to remember us and say hello and goodbye every time we entered and left the hotel it was by far the best service we had out of the three hotels we stayed in during our honeymoon,1
1149,i booked for two nights here to rest up before starting our tour of spain and portugal we were scheduled to arrive on sunday afternoon but unfortunately due to weather conditions our flight into chicago was delayed and we missed our connector flight to barcelona thus we ended up arriving monday morning i did email the hotel the night before to notify them of our situation and they promptly replied that they would hold the room for us once we arrived at the hotel one of the hotel staff walked up and greeted us by our name even before we introduced ourselves she told us that she had a surprise for us which ended up being an upgrade to a much room with a terrace overlooking plaza cantalunya having just experienced an unplanned sleepover in chicago without our luggage getting rerouted to new york before flying out to barcelona and then to top it off american airlines lost one of our bags we were very appreciative of this little surprise the room was exceptional and the view from the terrace was beautiful this hotel had everything excellent customer service perfect location to see downtown barcelona and great rooms with delicious breakfast i especially loved walking through the gothic quarters and las ramblas which was just steps away there was also a department store just around the corner where you could get just about everything including food in the lower level which they had the food court and only had time,1
1150,positives unbeatable location absolutely fantastic very friendly helpful staff excellent facilities we were lucky enough to have a big room with a lovely balcony on the floor we had a view right over plaza del catalunya we loved it and will go back there if we ever return to barcelona wifi was excellent signal in our room possibly not fast enough to stream hd video but it was great for normal browsing lovely breakfast if a bit expensive negatives they very minor and would not deter us from staying there again it a very minor issue our room had a nice rain shower which worked very well but the shower base was a bit slippery and was too flat to effectively drain the water away fast enough water tended to flow under the shower door onto the floor in the area of the toilet the bathroom is sort of and is right in front of you as soon as you enter the room this did bother us at all but it is a somewhat strange layout,1
1151,pros in my opinion this hotel has the best location in barcelona right in center of placa catalunya which is where many of the public transportation lines converge can easily get on different buses and metro trains right outside the hotel also right next to la rambla which is the main lively street in the city all of the staff were super friendly especially laura who checked us in and out rain shower was amazing one of the best i used in a hotel anywhere aerobus from bcn airport comes right outside the hotel for euros one way just under min ride computer station with free printing available cons wifi was very slow took a while to load websites and pictures toilet area is really small and the door was malfunctioning would get stuck hard to the sliding door also a bit inconvenient that rooms did not include iron and ironing board fridge was a small but this seems standard in europe,1
1152,nice hotel overall in a great location modern and clean rooms and good service although some noise from the lobby would stay again although somewhat pricey nice rooftop terrace with a small pool,1
1153,i chose this hotel on my trip to barcelona primarily for its location there are more luxurious options in other areas but the olivia plaza is so centrally situated that it is easy to walk to both the older parts of town barrio gotic ramblas picasso museum etc as well as the more modern parts eixample gaudi houses we arrived by train at the passeig de garcia station easy minute walk to the hotel and departed by the aerobus which leaves every minutes across the street from the hotel there is a metro stop right outside the hotel and we used it to get to the sagrada familia and park guell there is a huge el corte de ingles across the street checkout the foodcourt on the top floor for an amazing view the hotel itself is well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful if you are traveling you are not totally comfortable with check the room pictures on the website and be aware that some rooms incorporate the bathroom into the actual room this makes the room feel more spacious but compromises privacy somewhat overall i felt that the positives of this hotel outweighed any negatives though and would stay here again if i return to barcelona,1
1154,the hotel is situated in the heart of barcelona near to the catalunya plaza la ramblas toristvstreet and the gotic district close to many shopping centers and variety hotel is very clean new furniture wuite ambience and the staff are only drawback it is pricey and not suitable for budget travelers,1
1155,stayed in the hotel from july fantastic fresh with superb staff welcomed with a glass of cava on arrival waited mins for the room to be ready retrieved our bags and greeted with another glass of cava the room was beautiful we stayed in a junior suite with a hot tub the balcony had sun loungers and was very peaceful the water was slightly too warm so that evening someone came up to rectify this too much water was then splashing over the away they sorted this out nothing was too much trouble breakfast was excellent with plenty to eat covering all nationalities and menus the roof top bar was a relaxing place to have a drink and sunbathe during the day the bar prices for a centrally located hotel were competitive and not at all overpriced the staff throughout the whole hotel were helpful and as said before nothing was too much trouble i could recommend this hotel definitely stay again,1
1156,excellent location between the seaside and the city centre lovely envoiroment recently refurbished rooftop swimming pool is amazing with a great service during all day staff is professional and polite,1
1157,my son and i stayed for a weeks holiday and i can not understand why this is not a star hotel everything was perfect from the rooms to the very friendly staff who go out of their way to disabled i usually come across some problems but not here my accessible room really was just that i would stay here again a big thanks to everyone,1
1158,this hotel is located in a very desirable beautiful charming location in the city it is very convenient to the major tourist sites mostly by walking although we did take the metro at times the taxi were also a good value el prat and the port were only to minutes away you are surrounded by excellent restaurants in a quaint area of the city away from the hustle and bustle of other areas the hotel is very nice rooms beds cleanliness breakfast pool but what really influenced my rating was the customer service the entire staff was helpful and able to communicate very well in english and other languages they went above and beyond to help in anyway they could mario gave us a free bottle of cava to celebrate our wedding anniversary which was very much appreciated i ca say enough wonderful things about the hotel location and staff i would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this to anyone traveling to barcelona,1
1159,situated on the edge of the rejuvenated el born district on the quiet avenue picasso minutes from the picasso museum minutes from the metro and a minute walk to sagrada familia well away from the brashness of la sized rooms well appointed friendly efficient staff and excellent breakfast we enjoyed the rooftop bar area and pool,1

1161,we have enjoyed very much our stay in the a little bit disappointed by the quality of the breakfast in particular of the scrambled would recommend the hotel to acquaintances travelling to barcelona,1
1162,room was clean location is great front desk staff is very friendly and helpful maid staff was very loud and made it hard to sleep into the late morning the rooftop bar has a nice vibe i would probably return if the maids could not yell to each other and bang around in the morning then this would be an awesome hotel,1
1163,we did know what to expect arriving into barcelona spain let alone the hotel we chose on the moment we arrived the hotel was in the heart of the gothic quarters which was a place i really wanted to visit during our stay the fact that the hotel was in the thick of it all was awesome all the employees at the front desk were very friendly one person stood out was jean she worked in the restaurant and was very approachable and was very friendly she knew the moment i walked in that coffee was my go to drink overall if you want an experience a great hotel this is definitely one of my favorites places to stay and i definitely come back in years completion of sagrada familia thank you to all the staff and jean at catalonia catedral for making our visit an enjoyable one,1
1164,hotel was lovely it clean stylish modern perfect location and the staff are very helpful and friendly our room was constantly kept tidy with beds made even if we laid on them briefly from getting changed in the day for dinner beds turned down chocolates left with welcome notes and house keeping introducing themselves bathroom also kept tidy for example toilet paper etc in bathroom changed or made presentable with triangle at the ends very simple but nice touch also i had told the hotel it was my partners birthday but they either saw the birthday cards in our room and or his passport and provided room service of a bottle of champagne on the house to our room whilst we were getting ready for dinner such a nice surprise would highly recommend this hotel you walk out of this great hotel and you are in the city centre with attractions and restaurants a few minute walk away really enjoyed our stay,1
1165,we visited barcelona in june and spent four nights at this great hotel it is located in walking distance to all major tourist sites the customer service was outstanding and the rooms very comfortable i would definitively recommend it,1
1166,great hotel in a fabulous location but a little on the expensive side compared with other hotels nearby very small rooms but staff were very helpful and efficient pool area was lovely although a bit small,1
1167,this hotel is well located in barcelona within easy walking of most gaudi sights and la rambla the decor is really stylish and the bathrooms in particular were not only well designed but really attractive the rooms were a good size wifi was fine it has a small pool and patio area when the heat of barcelona becomes too much the hotel also introduced the concept of a time for wine with a happy hour which was lots of fun although often it was hard to find the staff who were promising to provide the wine,1
1168,super location with a really discreet service from the staff really relaxed and complete breakfast with a great selection fresh food we really enjoyed the few days we spent there and would highly recommend perfect city hotel,1
1169,friendly staff free drink and tapas in the evening room typically on the small side but very stylish and comfortable concierge very helpful and friendly great for couples or singles zara just on the corner casa battlo walk and probably just a walk to the gothic quarter great little italian up the road opposite side of street a couple of blocks full of locals good food and very reasonable,1
1170,love it one of the best hotels in barcelona from location rooms staff you ca go wrong with monument classy neighborhood rolex and hermes are direct next to the the atmosphere not noisy and not crowded in the hotel is so helpful and not waiting for the tip this with be my hotel when i back to barcelona,1
1171,from the moment you stop your car in front of the hotel you sense the luxury of a carefully hidden treasure behind a beautiful old building for business or pleasure the location is superior the staff is well trained and ready to help you with whatever you like to be arranged the rooms are not big but the interior designer made the best out of the nicely decorated suites everything is up to the latest standards from the little reading lights next to bed to the gorgeous bath and practical shower beds are great breakfast is served at the table at the cost of pp some can find it expensive but we found it worth every cent nothing was too much to ask for and everything is of a high quality if you looking for special culinary experiences hotel has also place is a hidden gem when in barcelona we come back hasta la vista,1
1172,this one of my favorite hotel in barcelona my room is quiet ac is good which i needed the most for summer arrival we were greeted by warm and friendly staff the staff was extremely helpful and friendly they will guide you were to visit the nice places in barcelona plus the location is awesome close proximity to lots of restaurants awesome because we love good food,1
1174,the monument hotel in barcelona is situated in a fantastic part of barcelona away from the hustle of la rambla yet walking distance to many major attractions of gaudi buildings are a block away and the bus stops a block away the hotel itself is well equiped with excellent jo malone amenities and a generous mini bar which should get replenished everyday as part of the offering of complimentary soft drinks juice water and snacks unfortunately this didnt happen with many items not being replenished each day in either of our families rooms its these little details that can let them down breakfast at the hotel while service is slow is excellent the quality of the food is high and the variety is large having breakfast cooked fresh for you is a nice touch along with the platter that is provided when you arrive which includes fresh ham cheese and pastries the room configuration we had was a little unusual as there is small lounge attached to the bedroom which is dark and something you would struggle to utilise room another issue with this room is that the metro train service runs directly under the hotel and every minutes you can hear and feel the vibrations in the room very difficult to sleep as the metro runs from to approx but to give the hotel credit they moved us to another room on a higher floor which was superior to our original room and thus very generous of them its,1
1175,the room was clean comfortable and tastefully decorated everything you needed was available the staff are very helpful providing maps and good advice the hotel has a lovely area to make sit and relax the location is walking distance to the major shops there is a convenience store across the road and heaps of cafes and restaurants to eat at nearby the bus and metro is also within easy walking distance,1
1176,great central hotel small but perfectly formed rooms great air con wifi fridge in room comfy bed handy hotel terrace where you can always catch a nice coffee and use the wifi before hitting the city hr supermarket on door step metro mins walk lovely helpful staff,1
1177,good little boutique hotel set away from hustle of main streets very clean rooms and lovely bathrooms nice touch with free coffee on first floor would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends,1
1178,we spend great nights in june on arrival we were upgraded from junior suite room to suit monument thank you are not big but that expected in city center location hotel center location is one of its biggest advantages you can get by foot or by taxi to everywhere in about minutes for just eur sometimes it takes longer to go to nearby metro station than to get to destination by taxi hotel staff is very helpful with catching taxi i tried to do this myself times but never succeeded they did it very are stylish very clean only very minor issue was leaking water from shower flor to bathroom and even room spend days for sightseeing and sunbathing hotel on our request provided us with beach are served carte i prefer buffet way but they are tasty restaurant staff also accommodated our special needs due to multiple food allergies they had everything prepared in highly recommend this hotel we will be back there if we visit barcelona again,1
1179,i stayed at the hotel for nights the room was not ready when we arrived but they held our luggage directed us to a cafe up the street when we returned the room was ready we had a room that faced the street of the front of the hotel the room was clean the beds were comfortable the room was small but we were only in there to sleep so it was a major issue i loved the location of the hotel it was accessible to major metro stations restaurants shopping we took a bus from bcn airport to the hotel that was only euros per person the hotel is within minutes walking from the bus hotel staff spoke very good english worked with us when we tried to speak spanish with them they were all friendly helped us with the map routes to our many excursions overall it was an enjoyable stay a solid choice for our needs while in beautiful barcelona,1
1180,great location a few mins away from the major trains and metro station very friendly and helpful staff rooms are clean and modern facing the main road but quiet we will definitely stay this hotel again,1
1181,located near to the main saints train station easy five minutes walking distance train journey to and from airport easy at a cost of just over euros tickets available on the day from the machines metro line in the station was that brings you near to all central meeting points in the centre of barcelona bought a ten journey ticket that worked brilliantly very helpful reception staff always spot on with answers clean comfortable room rather small cramped bathroom but adequate great plunge pool just right after a full day sight seeing towels provided excellent sangria from the bar and only a few euros more than elsewhere food menu could be a bit more exciting ok for a snack but main courses not brilliant went in search of staff on a couple of occasions service can be slow on the terrace the kiddies park at the rear does go quiet after ca be heard inside the hotel would recommend this hotel as a clean quiet place in a very very busy city,1
1182,hotel situated only a few minutes from sants estacio with great transport links and very easy to find arrived at the hotel and was offered a welcome drink of fresh fruit juices or cava which was a lovely surprise we were also upgraded to a deluxe twin room which was excellent very spacious and the bathroom was clean both the room and the decor in the hotel were very modern too although the pool area is rather small in terms of number of beds we never found it a problem to get a bed no queuing at and the pool in general was quiet and we went mid july the breakfast every morning was great with selection of cereals cooked breakfast and pastries to name but a few the hotel itself was excellent but the staff make it what it is very friendly always smiling and nothing is ever too much trouble would definitely return to this hotel in the future,1
1183,when arriving to the hotel we were greeted with a free glass of champagne hotel staff very friendly and helpful at night we never seen the restaurant open but outside there is plenty of room to eat which most people did and ordered food at the bar hotel was close to the nou camp and the magic fountains but was a walk to the beach and other site seeing areas but barcelona is a huge city so this did bother us as we got taxis which were reasonably cheap but being not so close to the beach at night it was quite so you could get a decent sleep rooms very clean and had a fridge which next door is a supermarket which is so cheap so we stocked up i would really recommend this hotel again and i will be staying in more of the hotels,1
1184,the hotel is located in the area of montjuic just some minutes walking from the city center the views from the restaurant and the terrace are amazing the rooms are nice and well distributed they have a nice bathtub big king size beds and also have a lovely balcony to let the nice summer breeze in the service is fantastic the front desk staff is always on point and are willing to go above and beyond to solve any issue that you might have it was always a pleasure to be greeted by them and to see their smiling faces day to day overall a fantastic property top choice i could not recommend this hotel enough until next time,1
1185,great hotel very comfortable clean friendly staff good location walked up to mins to various attractions et room was modern tv tad small for size of room and remote did not work great but ok the channel guide was not working and there was limited channel selection especially for the tourist,1
1186,booked through qantas hotels and not dissapointed very good position for this hotel great and helpful staff at the reception clean nice big bathroom all amenities as you expect and cosy very close to everything interesting we even walked from plaza espana after a nice evening watching the magic fountain there walking distance to the best shopping in barcelona lots of restaurants and also your hop on hop off tour bus across the hotel is el corte ingles big shopping centre for your everyday needs if neccessary public transport as enjoyed breakfast but could have more options located on top floor with nice views and small pool when hot and nothing better to do great for evening drinks to relax after long day room has flat screen tv but no english speaking channels coffee and tea making facilities water included overall good choice for holiday as well business trip,1
1187,a short break of two nights was all we had time for but in this short stay the staff hotel amenities and services were at it best the jr suite is perfect for a family of four breakfast is great and location is perfect with the metro min away i highly recommend this hotel,1
1188,great place to stay room was always clean staff were helpful and friendly hotel location seemed to be classy and few meters from bus and tram stations around meters from subway station all day long there were taxis in front of the hotel on the other side of the street there a nice mall bed was nice bathroom also nice specially shower room i asked for iron and they provided me at oncelobby odor was always pleasantin general i loved my stay in this hotelthanks novotel management team,1
1190,only good things to say about our stay here good location with fabulous view of sagrada familia less than five minutes walk to metro and tram stations room was big by city standards food was good and lively bar on top floor the gym was well equipped with stunning views will definitely be back,1
1191,visited for my birthday requested early had to wait kids running about jumping in the pool charged me room tax twice staff are useless breakfast is awful went back to room day there was a man in our room most of the gym equipment did work,0
1192,we are a couple with two boys and stayed at the novotel barcelona city for nights in july very good not in the heart of barcelona but on a nice and quiet and less touristy area which was nice many buses and metro around the hotel minutes walk we had a shopping mall across the street and blocks form the hotel there is a street called rambla de plobenou with lots of restaurants a taxi or a cabify to ls ramblas was around eurosroom good size for european standards the kids slept on a sofa bed that was comfortable the rooms and bathrooms are very modern they all have a safe and enough closet for you to organize your stuffbreakfastvery good we are glad we got the package that had breakfast included it goes until amrooftop off of the main reasons why we stayed here we thought it was a great idea to have a place to hang and also a good pool for the kids to chill out after a busy summer day we loved it and went there almost every day they also had music or nights and kids entertainment a bar with refreshments and appetizers was also availableservice very good staff was friendly and we did have any troubles others restaurant at the main level we did go but it was always busy at night we went to a place across the street and had a great menu del dia for are a couple of rental car,1
1193,i was positively surprised with this hotel it not near the touristic attractions but there a subway station two blocks away it an efficient mean of transportation except for the stairs inside the stations a big advantage is the existence of a mall with stores like fnac carrefour h m etc the room had adequate space for a couple with a child wifi was good too there were not many options of tv channels a nice restaurant with activities for the children at diinner the terrace had a pool and fitness center during several evenings there were a musical programming for the guests,1
1194,a few minutes walk to glories station here are some from the airport take the metro zona university line to torrassa station then take the train to glories to picasso museum take metro llacuna to jaume walk about to park guell from glories take to catalunya then take green to vallcarca,1
1195,do waste your money coming here i not a complainer at all but i would come back or recommend this hotel breakfast is rubbish poor selection of food reception staff cant be bothered helping out site seeing all day and just wanted a cup of tea when we landed back but they do serve drinks on the ground floor in summer so you have to go upto the floor if you want a if you do like lifts rooms are basic and nothing special right next door to the hotel is some kind of outdoor disco which goes on all day till about really loud and does your head in location not that great with a lack of decent restaurants close defo not not come back,0
1196,the novotel barcelona city was surprisingly easy to get to by car it has a very good underground car park with large parking spaces this costs but is worth it i think for arrived in the city by so parked up and explored until the evening when we checked in the room was a good size and had a big walk in shower in the bathroom rather than a bath breakfast was a let down it felt like eating in a conference room the choice of food wasn t great so we didn t get great value for the only other comment was that the lift to the underground car park and the car park itself smelt of bad drains and was quite unpleasant,1
1198,a lovely modern hotel staff friendly and helpful room was a standard double with sofa bed for two teen boys clean enough room for nights breakfast great lots of choice pool terrace on roof great for afternoon cool offs liked glories as an area as close to metro teams and taxi tank outside hotel best thing was the shopping mall which was under construction across road huge carrefour supermarket to get drinks and food for the day selection of restaurants for at night with a lot of variety if you did want to go too far the only downside was check in which was a bit of a lengthy process,1
1199,chose this as an accor member and based on location and reviews just wonderful experience we had a free upgrade some gifts for my toddler discounted breakfast buffet and wonderful staff room modern comfy was upgraded for free with a magnificent view of downtown barcelona sagrada etc breakfast was outstanding,1
1200,as i often say in my reviews i am an accors hotel member and particularly like the novotel my experience around the world has been extremely reliable and barcelona was no different the way their rooms are designed is especially a favourite for me very practical well thought out and stylish best of all they are well from the outside as well as the foyers and we were near the lifts it was whisper facilities comparative to the size of the hotel was the biggest con for me the bar combined is spectacular on first glimpse the gym is right next to this on the same floor but it was completely overrun by children not complaining i had a year old but there were too many people all of the time and not enough division between each area gym vs bar to get a noticeable reprieve there were never enough seats locations to set your things down and we were over it pretty quick the gym is also overrun by children who want to out the equipment not sure where parents were and surprised children were allowed into this location was a min walk to segrada familia but we had an yo and yo in our party so was perhaps a bit out of the way the local underground we struggled to find until the last day yet it is very close stupid on our part perhaps and the tram line is a nice trip into the are also only,1
1201,hotel gaudi was perfect for our first visit to barcelona it literally located steps from las ramblas a main street in the center of the city with lots of shops and restaurants the hotel staff was very accommodating for my brother food allergies which we greatly appreciated they were always available to answer questions and show us places to go on a map the rooms were clean and nice the best part was the rooftop it has comfortable couches a small pool and great views of one of gaudi works and the rest of the city skyline it a great place to watch the sunset and enjoy a glass of sangria,1
1202,stayed here for nights on first visit to barcelona situated just off the famous la ramblas promenade and close to subway not exactly inexpensive but rooms were excellent and hotel service good staff very friendly and helpful only downside was the breakfast which at is overpriced for what you get but that seems to be to trend in barcelona hotels rather do take the breakfast and instead go to a taverna or the great food market down the road,1
1203,we stayed here a few days after our cruise and thought the location could not have been better our room was spacious and had great views of barcelona we were in the center of everything we were right on the ramblas and loved the night life there lots of places to eat outside and people watch we were close to the hop on hop off bus which is a wonderful way to see barcelona you could also see a lot of things on foot we also did a lot of shopping we loved barcelona the architecture is so different,1
1204,you paying for the location here if you want five star luxury go somewhere else however if you looking for a clean comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff in the heart of the city at a very good price look no further the hotel is just off the ramblas right opposite the guell palace you ca get nearer to the beating heart of the city breakfast was indifferent but with good service the rooms are basic but very comfortable and despite us overlooking the main street surprisingly quiet this is a great hotel for exploring the finest that barcelona has to offer,1
1205,the air conditioning was not working very well it is hot in barcelona in july someone had been smoking in the room and the air unit was just circulating the smoke we both woke up feeling ill the sheets had holes in them and we were sleeping on box springs not a mattress we were each allowed one were very disappointed and tried to book another hotel but there was noneavailability the hotel was clean and the sangria was very good but notgood enough for us to be able to sleep through the night we were exhausted,0
1206,the hotel is star and therefore relatively basic but there was nothing to complain about and the location is excellent our family room was very sizeable it was at the back of the hotel so the view was not great at all but it had the advantage of being amazingly quiet considering the proximity to the heaving busy la roof top terrace bar with glass fronted foot pool was a real treat there are views all around barcelona city and down to the port with the palau guell gaudi designed rooftop directly opposite personally i would have thought that this premier location could be turned into a much more expensive cocktail bar but it was certainly a very pleasant addition as it did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on that but would definitely stay here again if visiting barcelona,1
1209,hotel staff was amazingly welcoming and helpful the rooms arnt overly big however in such a beautiful city you do want to spend much time inside the breakfast is reasonably priced and has a great selection room service is also fast and attentive we were lucky enough to have a massive balcony with city views rooms were clean and tidy and staff were very professional when cleaning our rooms location if perfect i suggest going to g√ºell tapas on the same street as the hotel amazing food and beautiful staff the combination made our time in barcelona so memorable,1
1210,lovely hotel although it little bit further away from the main scene the marina and the rambles the rooms were very clean and the beds were comfy the staff were very friendly and helpful there were a few restaurants close by and a shopping centre not too far either and it was also a stones throw away from the beach i would definitely stay here again ca fault it in anyway,1
1212,i recently stayed here for a couple of nights on a business trip i enjoyed the quietness and the view from the room it was a relaxing stay with a well presented breakfast selection the staff were very helpful and friendly and most spoke enough english for me to get by the hotel had free wifi but i was unable to get this to work but as i was only there for a short while it was a problem for me,1
1213,good hotel with roof pool and bar great breakfast location by the beach an easy min walk to port olimpic restaurants and bars right next to green route tour bus stop that can be used as a hop on hop off taxi service good clean rooms,1
1215,very nice hotel in outstanding location with great staff the breakfast was exceptional and the pool area that overlooks the ocean was breathtaking the rooms are nice especially those overlooking the ocean the hotel is a little far from city center,1
1216,it is close to the see and offices in that area however far from city center i could not set properly the room air condition it was too coold or warm i didn ot find description about room thermostat settings the area is quiet but i do not recommend to get room on the street side on to floors too much traffic noise,1
1217,out of the heat and hubbub of the city center the accommodations friendliness of staff and access to the beach provided a very relaxing venue to a business conference with an easy ten minute walk to the convention center the food at the cafe was very good i highly recommend the artichoke salad with romescu sauce,1
1218,had a most enjoyable weekend clean and tidy all staff were very helpful and hotel is well situated with good access to both tube stations and bus routes with a good selection of bars and restraunts in the local downside of us this hotel was the sewage smell outside the hotel the poor quality of the cooked breakfast and the extortionate cost of the poster sun lounger per day or a basic sun lounger per day,1
1219,i am staying in this hotel with my wife for our honeymoon the moment we arrived we were welcomed with great hospitality and the very nice and helpful nice ladies at the reception upgraded us to a deluxe room with a partial sea view the moment they knew we were on our honey the tourist help guide is a fantastically helpful person who highlighted the sights the transportation and the moment we entered the room we were greeted by complimentary hotel is a bit far from the city center but we prefer this to the crowded areas as the rooms are very calm although facing a main street and the room excellent service very highly recommended the staff really make this place more special thank you guys for making our honeymoon a better experience,1
1220,i stayed here for business and came back two years later with family because of the great location friendly and helpful staff and overall nice experience i was not disappointed and loved my second stay,1
1221,excellent service food pool facilities and location for the beach wifi air conditioning worked perfectly from anywhere in the hotel and very helpful and welcoming staff this hotel exceeded our expectations,1
1223,very comfortable hotel and location nice and tiny swimming pool area the only inconvenient is if you want a sunbed you have to pay an extra otherwise you can comfortably accomodate on a sofa chair i have experienced a very good service the hotel is next to the seaside and only five minutes walking from the beach whatever you want you just ask and you will have it if you want to surprise your partner with a present to be found directly in the room you have many choices proposed by the hotel management is attentive and accurate good vibes,1
1224,we did not get the room we pay for it was clean but very small that is about all bad we have to say nice staf little pool and not enaugh space to go into pool since we close to beach it was no problem with that so we go there to bus and metro but dont eat at the restaurant they need to improve a lot go to restaurant close to hotel instead many many to chose from at the beach and like around there with tapas and other no stars but ok if you want to fill your little belly any way i would go there again the weather is fantastic and walk at the beach nighttime warm is worth the trip and place itself,1
1225,had been here in june and the place was a nice cosy place in the heart of barcelona near la ramblas street the place has an interesting decor and looks really good the rooms are a little small but are quiet cosy only con is that they dont allow you to take the keys but there is someone at the reception had a great time there,1
1226,good hotel very central location barcelona is dirty very dirty the smell of sewerage hangs in the air constantly beggars and people defecating in the streets are fairly common hotel leonardo was a good heaven to return to after walking the streets of the city the standard rooms are very small concider an upgrade if you are staying longer than a day or room has aircon bit noisy but it works making facility in room bathroom very good breakfast excellent and worth booking when you make your reservation unless you want to eat in the stinky streets worth visiting el callejo excellent service and very good food pintor extremely good food little more pricey but worth it,1
1227,the location of this hotel is fantastic great restaurants shopping and walking distance to public transportation the roof top pool is small but nice the rooms were clean and beds were comfortable check in was very slow but the stay there was worth it i would join their rewards club as the benefits are worth it all of the sites of barcelona are accessible from this hotel via taxi or public transportation if you like good food and shopping would suggest staying in this part of town and the leonardo is a great option,1
1228,we booked this hotel last minute at a very reasonable price and were pleased with the location it is very close less than minutes walk to the food market where we walked for breakfast each day it is also less than minutes from las rambla and a short walk from the waterfront the nearest metro station is also very close and allowed us to get to park guell very quickly with no train changes and also to several other main sites everything else was walkable the rooms were clean a decent size and had excellent air conditioning facilities the pool on the roof is small but is just what is needed if you fancy a lazy afternoon on a sun lounger staff dealt with a leak in our room which was the fault of those staying about us calmly and quickly so that it did impact on our stay at all would definitely stay here again if i return to barcelona,1
1229,this hotel is very central in barcelona in the old town near las ramblas it has comfortable air conditioned rooms a roof top pool and a good selection of buffet breakfast ggod palce for a weekend in barcelona,1
1232,we recently stayed nights in this hotel prior to a cruise followed by a further night post cruise we had booked a deluxe room for the night stay which we found to be very spacious and furnished to a high standard very pleasant on the eye very comfortable bed and tv both in the sitting area and bed area the bathroom was also spacious and nicely finished also pleasantly surprised to find complimentary wine water and snacks in the deluxe room on arrival the breakfast buffet was also excellent nice food and more than enough choice small pool and terrace on the roof bars in both the ground floor and rooftop at the pool but generally only bar open depending on the weather which is fine no restaurant facilities other than breakfast hotel is not in the most attractive street in barcelona but only streets off la rambla so overall a great location and good value for money min walk from metro station and many bars and restaurants approx euros by taxi to the airport and euros to the cruise port staff are very friendly especially ali on the front desk at night full of helpful advice i see from other reviews that some rooms are less spacious but we really could not fault the deluxe room we would definitely look to use this hotel if we visit barcelona again,1
1233,great location near las ramblas the street it was on was scruffy but do let this put you off room was an adequate size for with air conditioning to etc clean well decorated roof top pool area a bonus for relaxing after a busy sightseeing day pool is small but what do you expect i would scored it stars if breakfast was included i would recommend this hotel to friends,1
1234,we stayed nights in this hotel the hotel is just a few minutes walks from las ramblas the hotel room was quite small but clean and had a large bathroom the view from the window was another buildings wall but that did bother much as we did spend much time in the hotel room the rooftop was great with a small pool to dip into the sangria at the bar was excellent the staff was very friendly and helpful overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,1
1235,we recently stayed at this hotel for nights at the start of our europe adults and teenage children in a deluxe family room june it was fantastic reception staff cant be more helpful and friendly our room was a good size for europe it had single beds and a double futon sort of enough space for large bags not large enough to comfortably spend the day in the room but we never planned on doing that large bathroom hotel is located minute walk to las you could find a better location minute walk to a train station and buses the breakfast was wasnt fantastic but good enough to start your day scrambled eggs bacon cereal yoghurt dry meats plenty of options for toast croissants mediterranean options clean dining room with plenty of space we used the pool daily it is quite small but my kids found it better than nothing after a long day of touring it isnt about hip height but enough to refresh and cool down on a hot day they provide towels for a small deposit which you get back when you return the towels there is also a bar service by the pool which is nice at the end of the day wifi worked well for people on devices whilst in the room all the time no noise at will definitely be recommending this hotel to friends and family,1
1236,we have just come back from our vacation and we already miss barcelona we spent nights in the city at the theater auditori hotel at the recommendation of a friend the staff was welcoming and friendly the hotel is positioned relatively close to torre glories and sagrada familia from torre glories you can easily reach anywhere in barcelona with various means of transport buses trams and the hotel reception you can buy tickets for different tourist rut have been very attentive and friendly with good recommendations on tourist routes bedding changed daily and breakfast beach is about minutes walk hope to return to the city in the future,1
1237,nothing to is good central lot of eat possibilities in the near topstaff are very well speaks a lot of languages help in every can recommended espescially you one more by this way,1
1238,good clean and friendly hotel conveniently located to the world trade center in barcelona friendly staff and good breakfast simple but clean rooms hour security at the door reception very helpful,1
1239,this is a modern well run hotel the room was modern air conditioned and clean with a comfortable bed the wifi wrks well and the hotel is only a short walk from the harbour and las rambla the only downside is that it does not have a bar but i would certainly stay again,1
1240,we stayed here nights before a cruise floor room very nice very friendly helpful staff gave directions maps ideas for eats transportation arranged tours trevor jordi young woman sorry cant remember name good water pressure in showers careful with spray to not flood bathroom bed very comfy daily service good did not eat there ate nearby for helpful exchange of emails before we arrived helped figure out metro short walk to blain st eats short taxi ride to port good stay,1
1242,this hotel was terrible i requested a quiet room but i was given a room opposite where a music concert was playing until about so i got no sleep on my first night the windows are useless so you can hear everything outside i moved to another room after a lot of discussion for my second night in this room the aircon did work as the window was broken i had to push a chair up against the window to keep it closed so the aircon would work in this room you could hear chairs dragging across the floor in other rooms one of the worst hotel experiences i had,0
1243,rhe front desk service was exelent room was great breakfast had everything i recomend this hotel anyday small but really nice located very close to the city center only a few minutes walk to the beach,1
1245,we had a one night stay here before our cruise out of the barcelona port and we were so very pleased with our stay we booked a club level room and were more than satisfied with how large our room was and how quiet it was even though we were close to the elevators we really enjoyed the extra amenities that came with the club level room and would recommend the upgrade to anyone who stays here we stayed at a different hotel on our return from our cruise but were much more satisfied with the value of the crowne plaza hotel and will return to this hotel next year when we come back thank you for the best hotel experience of our trip crowne plaza barcelona,1
1246,we added a day to our celebrity equinox cruise and spent the night at this wonderful hotel in barcelona this was the first time we stayed at a crowne plaza property and were amazed at the size of the room and the extensive included breakfast buffet highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in barcelona the location is outside the city center but a reasonable taxi ride,1
1247,we stayed in a suite and paid extra for the club room it was worth the extra expense because we had a full breakfast buffet in the morning free drinks for most of the day and snacks in the evening the club room also had a concierge who was very knowledgable and helpful the fitness room was great for a hotel this was the perfect hotel for the three of us,1
1248,would recommend not too far from nearest metro our room came with a beautiful view which could also be found on their gorgeous rooftop bar breakfast was lovely and staff were very helpful the complementary hat and fan was a great touch all around brilliant base for your barcelona trip,1
1249,we stayed for nights in the club level as you walk into the holel there is a nice airy spacious lobby with a bar and restaurant large comfortable rooms have a decor was that was soothing and neutral room air conditioning was great with your own thermostat which kept the room cool day and night the room was serviced staff were very pleasant and helpful the club room served tasty food and wine the kind and patient concercierge staff were knowledgeable there were always taxis outside the location is in a quiet section near the museum of art and magic fountain we were very pleased with our stay there,1
1250,from start to finish it was brilliant a good location close to the metro and a reasonable walk to the main areas the car park is great as well the staff took care of our case as we arrived early and set off for our exploration of the city we came back later to check in and were taken to the club lounge as we had booked club rooms the staff were fantastic and we enjoyed a drink there with our children and checked in our case was taken to our room while we were there breakfast was great exactly what we needed and was also served in the club lounge there is a new roof top pool which is small but enjoyable with a great view the bar is also nice with a good selection of food we had a late check out so returned here after a trip to camp nou for a drink and some nibbles i would not hesitate to stay here again brilliant,1
1251,the rooms were very clean and the decor was modern the staff was quick to accommodate our last minute needs and allowed early the hotel is near the magic fountain art museum and arenas which is an old bull fighting ring turned into a shopping mall which are all in walking distance,1
1252,i had a great stay at this recently rennovated hotel next to the exhibition friendly stuff great restaurant outstanding rooftop poolbar which is a highlight are spacious and i even had nespresso coffee maker in my room guess it was a club room or so plaza de espana metro station is away aerobus from the airport is going all minutes as well good for return taxi is about ramblas are away by great experience and i would choose this again but i guess a busy place if there is a exhibition,1
1253,we booked this at the last minute but our normal preferred location is near the barcelonetta beach ramblas this hotel is out of the way of those but only about a mins taxi ride away it is near the magic fountain on the same road a min walk away which was lovely as we enjoyed the fountain show a shopping mall is nearby too again walking lobby is large clean and very relaxing with plenty of seating the rooms are designed really well and are well maintained the air con is effective the bathroom is very contemporary and overall the rooms are really comfortable the beds and the recliner chair are all comfortable for their purpose loved the usb charging points by the desk and the bed for phone ipad charging every hotel needs those free fast wifi too was great the breakfast was tasty and plentiful loved the omelette station very tasty fresh omelettes the only criticism is the spa the treatments are overpriced for what they are the therapists need more training to give more effective massage treatments and really disappointed that you had to pay euros to use the spa pool and gym having spent so much on the hotel rooms this needs to change no wonder it was empty total rip walls of the rooms were thin and you could hear everything next door the windows are pretty thin too and we were kept awake at night by an alarm from a nearby building car outside,1
1255,top notch hotel with very good service rooms business centre and breakfast a little out of town but no issue if your not afraid of walking or taking tubedecent gym and spalarge selection of continental food at breakfast including chinese breakfast options,1
1256,stayed at hotel recently in july high season in a club level room with king sized bed hotel located in safe area with great access to public transportation and many of the local tourist attractions for a reasonable cost the room was large and comfortable with good ac the bed was very comfortable and the best sleep we had while in greece montenegro italy and spain bathroom was good sized also with separate and toilet both of us were easily able to get ready without bumping into each other room had a safe that fit a laptop along with all our other valuables desk was spacious although chair not super comfy and a large flat screen tv the club had nice sitting area snacks drinks etc during the day they also had a good breakfast included each day with our room staying at the club level provided private check and concierge service in the club dangxia was very helpful and provided a wealth of info that made our time in barcelona the best possible have already recommended the hotel to a couple of colleagues who are traveling in oct and nov,1
1257,we stayed one night here and it is in a good location very quiet just next to the old fira congress center the rooms are good nothing special but the beds are nice the aircon works and the bathroom is really nice the breakfast is very good with excellent orange juice pastries eggs cooked for you and a nespresso machine definitely worth having a good hotel but for what we paid would not stay again for that price,1
1258,stayed here for night with friends ideal location for airport and also centre of town very clean excellent rooms just done up i think a short stay but could fault it and will definitely use again if visiting barcelona,1
1259,returned to barcelona for days to catch up with family who were visiting here as well excellent hotel breakfast amazing best omelettes ever the hotel is busy but you would never known that it so quite clean and friendly staff ca think of anything that was right about it,1
1260,just spent nights with my extended family at the gallery location is fantastic perfect for walking everywhere the staff could not have been more helpful from our arrival to chasing down a stray taxi on departure the breakfasts were outstanding and the were well designed and comfortable infact the beds are probably the most comfortable i have ever slept in would thoroughly,1
1261,we really enjoyed our stay in gallery hotel it is a clean and comfortable hotel in a convinient location staff is helpful and our room was very nice and clean the rooftop terrace was good to relax before or after sightseeing,1
1262,classical and stylish hotel with very good facilities including kettle in the room and attentive service very nice bar with a garden and a good restaurant both open to close to passeig de gracia for both sightseeing and convenient transportation links busy area for shopping and nightlife,1
1263,just returned from a weekend break at gallery hotel and well what a find having not been to barcelona before i had no idea where anything was and this hotel was exactly as described minutes stroll to la ramblas this hotel is located in a great area a little bit away from hustle and bustle and so nice to return to after a day had room which was a lovely size well equipped with toiletries tea n coffee and minibar hairdryer dressing gowns and slippers to the bed was very comfortable and although at the front no noise from the road pool at the top is small but enough to just cool off and chill in at the end of the day the lady in the bar up here was great and never seemed to stop her cocktails were to die gallery cafe to side of hotel was a bit hit and miss i dont think they had the attention to detail as the rest of the staff we had an evening meal with the music night and the food and service was good we had pre and after dinner drinks most night from the bar sitting outside which was delightful matias mustafa served us very wel over the course of our stay but bashir stood out from the crowd he was always so welcoming remembered our drinks made pleasant conversation and made us all laugh he really was first class and genuinely seemed pleased to greet was lacking a,1
1264,our friends in barcelona told us that gallery hotel was the best place for us to stay on this our first visit to barcelona the desk staff was always ready with big smiles and lots of suggestions of what to see and do,1
1265,great location well appointed and quiet room with the most comfortable bed friendly and attentive reception staff who gave us a personal tour of the hotel facilities and our room the only not so good point here was our evening meal in the hotel restaurant was terrible,1
1266,nice option for central barcelona with an easy location to reach shops touristic spots and public transportation breakfast is varied and complete personnel is friendly swimming pool is very small though i found a little bit expensive at the end but considering other prices around for high season it finally worth,1
1267,comfortable stay with all nearby walking distance on request the check out time was extended you will receive and free welcome drink during your stay the family rooms are very spacious and the sofa bed is perfect for kids,1
1268,we stayed nights at gallery hotel spending vacation the hotel is located one block from passeig the gracia which is the main avenue of bcn all the stores and of main gaud√≠ museums are if you have good mobility you can explore everything walking we could get to la sagrada fam√≠lia casa battl√≥ parque g√ºell this is kinda far and casa mil√° great restaurants and stores are just by as well a place to stay in bcn,1
1269,stayed at the gallery for two nights end of july reception staff aaron and ricardo were welcoming and attentive on our arrival and throughout our stay always happy to help and advise us on directions to places and transport around the city room was quiet modern and clean everything was supplied from toiletries even a toothbrush to slippers a fluffy dressing gown and a powerful effective hairdryer the bed was sssoooo comfortable breakfast was buffet style lots of choice and food was replenished frequently we sat out in the courtyard each morning which was delightful there are lots of local places to eat around the hotel if you walk out the back of the hotel through the park and turn left they are in roof top bar is a very pleasant relaxing space especially at the end of a long hot day sight seeing however we did feel the prices of the cocktails drinks were a little on the expensive would absolutely recommend this hotel as a fab place to stay if i find myself back in barcelona i would definitely book the gallery,1
1270,spent one night here the staff were all very friendly and helpful they happily accommodated a late checkout the room was very nice clean beds comfortable good breakfast and coffee indoor and outdoor seating only positive things to say,1
1271,we stayed at the gallery hotel for our first few nights in spain this july traveling with my son daughter in law and three teenaged grandsons the location gave us easy access to the spots we wanted to visit for those places that were not walkable for me taxis were available and reasonable my room was small but cozy there was no view but the bedding was lovely and there was literally no noise the breakfast was fine and we loved the oppportunity to sit outside the staff was friendly and attentive,1
1272,lovely hotel great location slightly away from the main tourist parts but easy to get everywhere staff were extremely helpful and friendly great breakfast selection and we had a wonderful evening meal as well barcelona is a fantastic city and i would definitely recommend the gallery hotel,1
1273,excellent service location staff and room would recommend staying here when visiting barcelona all staff were courteous and helpful at all times we were upgraded and given a portable wifi to take around the city with us perfect location for shopping dining and sightseeing axel was always paying attention and provided exceptional service beyond expectations,1
1274,very good value stay in a lovely part of barcelona the recent addition of the rooftop bar and pool made our stay all the more enjoyable we stayed with family and friends and had a very enjoyable time service is good and reception staff very friendly and helpful,1
1275,gallery hotel was conveniently located right by diagonal station and a few minutes walk from the casa mila there are a lot of restaurants cafes and supermarkets close by the staff are very welcoming and i especially loved the bed they have at the hotel very soft and comfortable by far the best bed i was on during my one month in europe rooms are not enormous but the bathroom was very spacious the pool i must say was even smaller than the photo looks definitely more for soaking than swimming there are no pool chairs either and just normal seating for the which makes it hard for guests to for a long period of time breakfast was euros so i just opted for the nearby cafes,1
1276,i spent one at the gallery hotel before getting on a cruise i found the hotel to be quite comfortable and staff to be friendly and helpful when i went down to late in the day to catch the cruise line rep to ask about the next day transfer the guy at the desk had all the answers i needed room economy roomthings i loved comfy free breakfast great toiletry kit though i would have loved the addition of a lots of outlet decently priced room service free slippers free welcome bottle of for putting your own drinkswhat could have been better a box of tissues was not in the the room i was in had no hotel info so i did know what was available to me ie restaurants spa services etc the location is ok not the best but not bad either main tourist sites are not as close as the brochure says though you can still walk to more than a few including sagrada no view at all at least not for my room in fact when i looked out my window i could see directly into other people rooms which of course means they could see into mine,1
1277,my wife and i stayed at the gallery hotel in barcelona and were blown away by the accommodation and the friendliest of the staff the bed in our room was so comfortable the service especially by falcon and juanna was excellent the staff could not do enough to make our stay a highlight of our holiday in barcelona the location was central to the metro and all the major designer shops it is located just off passeig de garcia and nearby to gadi la pedrera which is a minute walk this place is the best and we will be back bob and jan from australia,1
1278,went there on my way home from my cruise of mediterranean the staff were very pleasant the location is fabulous the breakfast the next day was amazing lots of variety the room was great with lots do little extras included like toothbrushes very friendly staff that spoke english that made it a lot easier they recommended some nice restaurants sorry i did have longer and only had one night here,1
1279,very conveniently located close to all cool restaurants subway and cool hotel staff is simply the the cool part of the hotel is there is actual key not a key the rooms are very upscale and breakfast is always the i am not able to think of anything negative about this highly recommend this place for traveler on business or,1
1280,excellent staff beautiful rooms great location close to hop on bus stops buy your ticket at the hotel at a better rate we ate dinner one evening in the restaurant hermes our waiter was the best would definitely stay here again,1
1281,when we first checked into the gallery hotel i was skeptical of its location because of the route we took to get there i could not have been more wrong one of the best things about this hotel is the location one block to the left is passeig de garcia where one of the famed goude houses is located it is also a major shopping avenue to the right one block is another great shopping street there are also many restaurants and cafes nearby the location is definitely great for walking if you want to take a tour the stops for both hop hop off tours is also about a block away as hotel itself is very nice the lobby and dining areas are comfortable and accommodating the dining room offers a morning european breakfast there is also a rooftop pool and bar it is a great place to relax after a day of shopping the pool is not very big and isn t really for kids but for adults to take a quick dip it would be room i stayed in was of ample size with a queen bed and nightstands a desk and lounging chair the bathroom was very nice and again a very good size the staff was also very lovely sara at the front desk and axel the bellman were especially would recommend this hotel if you are going to barcelona it is more american than european but if you don t mind you are good,1
1282,i have had the pleasure of staying at the gallery hotel twice before my current stay and the quality of service is always the best the staff at reception the porters and the housekeeping staff are friendly and very efficient in the the service is welcoming and excellent thanks to nuria andres and their compa√±eros i hope i will return soon,1
1283,i went to barcelona in a business trip and stayed at the hotel due to the great location i was very pleased with the room and friendliness of the personnel in particular i have to mention javier and ricardo at the reception for their help and suggestions and bianca at the swimming pool she is a treasure i managed to get a full operating office under the sun overlooking the city from the pool at the top of the what a treat after that i reserved the same table every afternoon until my departure i got my ideal office there,1
1284,we stayed at this hotel as part of a group trip that was arranged through my place of work the hotel has a very nice exclusive feel to it owing to the lower number of rooms that you find in more tourist centric hotels this works out great as the hotel never felt crowded while we were there save for one night where the rooftop bar was packed owing to an event timing on our part in no way the fault of the hotel hotel breakfast was very good though they would run out of bacon before i got my shot at it again this was probably more due to bad timing on my part more than a couple of late nights beforehand the only minor gripe i would have is the duration of the pool hours just felt that pm was a bit early to close the pool off especially given the summer heat in barcelona that said a minor issue and in no way did it affect the experience for the rest of the were great and our concierge eri went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of special thanks to him hotel location makes it very well placed for shopping eating drinking or just simply exploring the beautiful city that is barcelona highly recommended to anyone considering visiting barcelona and especially anyone looking for somewhere that wo always be swarmed by tourists,1
1285,stayed here with a friend and we had a superior room which was nice because we each had a single bed the room was well stocked and included an nespresso machine which was great in the morning there was a lovely rooftop pool and bar as well as a gym staff was super helpful with any question we had location is also close to the diagonal metro station which connects to and lines easy to get anywhere in the city there was also a gallery market next door to the hotel on weekends,1
1286,the staff at this hotel are so kind and helpful the rooms are clean and amazing the rooftop terrace is a wonderful spot to relax in the evening and the bartenders are just amazing with great entertainment the location in barcelona is perfect for shopping just down the block i would recommend this to anyone traveling to barcelona,1
1287,it caters well for all needs the reception team were extremely helpful and friendly the rooms have all the you need and everywhere is clean great to have breakfast in the the courtyard would stay here again,1
1288,great location and price for our trip close to restaurants shops and tour stops rooms were clean and well stocked staff was friendly and helpful nice and modern but still felt cozy would recommend highly,1
1289,great hotel all round very ideal location around a minute walk to the harbour but with very easy access to the local metro stop within a minutes walking attentive and friendly staff who went out of their way to help the room was excellent decent size with smart furnishing but topped off with a great bathroom and an unbelievably comfortable bed the breakfast comes at an extra cost but is worth it to avoid any hassle trying to find other food locally the rooftop pool and bar is an added bonus which makes a great change from other city centre hotels i stayed in before its a great place to spend an hour or so in late afternoon to relax after a day of wandering around the city great choice of cocktails but underwhelmed by the overpriced grill menu of small bar snacks overall though a great hotel to stay would thoroughly recommend for whatever the occasion as ideally located for a comfortable stay in a great city,1
1292,location is perfect just minutes by bus or stops by metro room was nice with balcony hotel staff friendly and helpful really recommended for everyone the barcelona beach was near only minutes by bus,1
1293,this hotel is located in a very good position for las ramblas and all central areas excellent service staff were very helpful check in very swift and efficient hotel clean with modern facilities the breakfast was very good catering for all needs fantastic room on high floor at front of hotel good and free to use would recommend to all visiting barcelona,1
1296,the different people at the reception were cut and dry did not like to give information not pleasant at all almost rude we arrived at pm extremely tired and were not welcomed by the person the hotel is old neglected walls and a horrible bathroom with a dirty white curtain in the shower breakfast with no bacon the safe did not work the pillows are hard i felt really bad there the only good thing was the location,0
1297,we liked this hotel in barcelona as it was very central and the breakfast was good we got a room facing the square with a balcony which we loved and surprisingly it was very quiet good for families the checkin process was super quick it is a block from the ramba and mercardo,1
1298,i had sat down on the plane to barcelona when i received an email saying my night stay had been cancelled i was about to board the flight so was unable to call the hotel as soon as i arrived at barcelona i called the hotel who said because i had not prepaid my booking had been cancelled with out any warning and the staff were very rude towards me they had not tried to contact me and ask for payment they then said they had given my room away this left me in sheer panic as i had no where to stay for the trip i also had arranged an airport transfer to take us to the property,0
1300,room rspecially the receptionist he was rude and not at all friendly just for him i would not recommend this place to anyone,0
1301,great hotel with fantastic staff recently refurbished cab rank on the corner not central air con not great so ask for additional card to leave the running whilst you out very comfortable and inexpensive bar prices,1
1302,visited barcelona and was looking for a hotel which looked nice as well as not being too expensive when we arrived was pleasantly surprised by the decor as well as the friendliness of the staff when we got into our room we were scared to touch anything in case we were charged but enjoyed every night that we were there we also received hour in the spa which as a group we all enjoyed apart from having to purchase a swimming cap at there were many different facilities making it both friendly for adults and children the breakfast every morning was amazing with a variety of different foods to satisfy every need with many going back for more food the only disappointing factor was the location as it did smell the nicest as well as being minutes from the beach and very far from the city centre but close to the metro meaning it made it easier to get around,1
1303,if you request a standard deluxe room newly updated you will love the balcony hotel pere iv has no bellman to assist with luggage and taxi it is very hard catching a taxi at this location especially with no staff assistance yes of course free wifi but the connection is extremely front desk staff is nice but they are not trained correctly especially planning reservations for brunch dinner etc with the wifi hardly working the front desk staff wifi works just as slow beware,0
1304,i had a very bad experience with this hotel staying days most of the worst customer services you will ever get especially senior managers of the hotel are not helpful and rude they look tired and they totally dont want to work it looks like if they are making favours to the customers by replying if you booked this hotel just cancel it as it will ruin your holidays which you have worked so hard for they make your stay stressful and without any services at all and its not that close to the centre you still have to get a taxi to the centre by walk it will take you at least min there is no such balcony as on the all you get is one small window looking outside so do even rely on their pictures on the website basically you will flush your money for no service not great room not great view breakfasts has no choice at all very poor prices are too high for such place absolutely waste of money,0
1305,what a lovely hotel so close to all the tapas bars restuarants metro bus and beach all the staff reception to dining room to cleaning staff were so helpful polite the hotel room was lovely we were on the floor at the back of the hotel but this meant it was quiet air con was a god send and the small fridge was brilliant even if we were late getting up and leaving the room the cleaning staff would work around us and our room was cleaned everyday and the breakfast was fantastic so fresh everything very clean and no one rushed you reception were very knowledgeable for the area trips you could take and best ways to get any place you wanted to will definitely be going back to barcelona and staying at this hotel would recommend for families as well as couples thank you hotel gotico,1
1306,this is difenitely the hotel to base oneself in for a visit to barcelona situtated in the shadow of the city ancient cathederal the hotel is an integral part of the gotic quarter step out the door and one is immiedately into the maze narrow streets and alleys some not even wide enough for a vehicle that make up the barcelona of old these medieval streets mostly pedestrianised are lined with cafes taverns resturants and of course tapas bars and often lead into unexpected squares where have room for outdoor tables or on to the ramblas barcelona most famous street itself which is only a short distance from the hotel is very modern inside i suspect recent refurbishment and the staff are very friendly and helpful and the room is compact but boasts a decent bathroom with a very good shower our room had a large balcony complete with table and chairs and even a despite being right beside the cathederal we were never disturbed by a single bell and the was argueably the quietest i ever encountered in a hotel room the only tiny we encountered was that the room balcony was accessed by a very steep portable step this might pose a challange to anyone with mobility issues but the rest of the hotel was well provided with ramps lifts etc and only the top floor rooms have balconys buffet breakfast was excellent and included in the quite reasonable price absolutely recommend hotel gotico,1
1307,the room was quite fine two of the beds were alright and the third was quite uncomfortable the location was wondrful in a middle of a beautiful street next to la rambla you can enjoy all the special littl stores minute walk from different train stations the hotel staff was quite lovely and helpful overall recommended,1
1308,its a nice hotel with clean and modern rooms we were on the first floor overlooking the street and it was still quite it is close to the water front and in easy walking distance of a lot of the attractions parking is about meters away there are many nice restaurants and bars close by,1
1309,the stars mean something different in the old world good location no area to leave baggages middle of the street incredibly small rooms even for european city standards the staff was nice but most are not in condition to help you with the usual tourist questions they know nothing about restaurants tours etc if you a couple below and no kids i guess it ok otherwise i would recommend it,0
1311,room was excellent cleaners were meticulous and reception staff spoke excellent english and had great local knowledge restaurant food was ok but rather bland however excellent and cheap local tapas bars just around the corner i am a nice bloke and normally give i am easily pleased so why halfway through our holiday we were attacked in our hotel room by a huge muscly naked man who was off his face on drugs we went and got security who manged to get him out of our room and back to his room when we went back in the room there was blood and water all over the floor we had to throw away our towels toothbrushes cosmetics and shower stuff as they were covered in his blood reception moved us to a different room for obvious reasons we had a great room overlooking the pool and with a view of the famous familia cathedral our new room was next to the main road looking at the hotel bins nice reception staff were nice and said sorry and that the following day management would speech to us and offer compensation nothing was ever said did they call the police we were just left in the dark i got the feeling this had happened before and the hotel wanted to hush it up was the naked man a manager we spent the rest of the holiday wondering if we would be sat next to him at breakfast not a nice feeling,0
1312,after a long trip it was nice to have this hotel to such a close distance to las ramblas it was very easy to get to it also was a great base to explore the city as the medinaceli is situated right at the start of the barrio soon as you get in you are welcomed by very friendly staff that make the check in process very easy we then took the lift to our room and everything we asked for we traveled as a family with a baby in tow was set up it even had a little balcony where you could see the narrow street and people walking not the best of views and at the start it did concern me about the noise but all was great no noise at all in terms of facilities the hotel has all you would expect the rooms get a bit stuffy but there is air con and that is always a pro the only thing we would have wanted because of the small baby would be a kettle to clean her bottles but unfortunately they do have any they asked us to ask the kitchen for hot water was pretty clean apart from the floor which was pretty did really try the breakfast hotel breakfasts are usually a rip off this was per person so we adventured outside and just went for a local the building is beautiful on the inside with a hanging circular staircase and some hidden rooms,1
1313,we stayed here for nights and although the hotel was modern quaint and clean we had a really bad experience with the customer service first we could even communicate with the concierge at the desk as they could barely understand english we were told a certain price for some of the services but then another price was charged to us eventually while we were not even aware of this we ended up being scammed into paying way too much euro for laundry services also because of the language barrier we ended running into problems with hotel booking sites and this put a major damper on our trip as we could not get the information we needed and were stuck confused and misinformed hotel customer service was unwilling to help us out not willing to make sure we had the best experience possible the hotel cleaning services were great as our room was cleaned every day,0
1314,we stayed here for days in july staff was friendly room was clean this hotel is near to city attraction this is easily accessible from metro as well as airport aero bus we really enjoyed our stay,1
1316,we had awasome stay we had an eight flour junior suite bigger than our permanent place with a huge bathroom and an excellent beth and clean hotel in a nice neighbourhood and parking lot included in the room price staff helpful,1
1317,lovely hotel it was rather hot when we stayed there but the air conditioning in the room was marvellous unusually it could be left on even when the keycard was taken out the room was spacious with very comfortable beds the bathroom was also of generous size if a little dated the shower was over the bath so anyone of reduced mobility would need to check accessibility we were on the third floor with a stunning view of pl espanya and the national museum complete with fountains and monuments the traffic noise was apparent and the road outside quite busy all nightthe room had a safe and minibar although the safe was being upgraded so any valuables were kept by reception breakfast was haphazard there was an extensive variety of fruit smoothies pastries cereals made to order omelettes and pancakes cooked breakfast etc however no matter what time we went for breakfast several options were not available the replenishment did not keep up with demand the staff were lovely the roof terrace bar and pool very good with a panoramic airport bus stops literally outside the door and there is a very convenient metro stop too the and were very slow overall a good place to staythe attached photo is the view from our room,1
1318,we were a group of friends in barcelona for the weekend and the hotel was ideal for what we needed the nearest metro station was around a minute walk and taxis also frequently passed the front of the hotel on the main road we used the rooftop pool late saturday morning and it was really chilled with some nice views of the surrounding areas the hotel allowed us to use the iron and ironing board on the saturday although we could on the friday as it was already is we got back to the uk we realised we left a pair of shorts in the bathroom and after emailing the hotel they helped us arrange delivery of the item to the uk if we return to barcelona we would definitely stay at the hotel again,1
1319,it is a lovely hotel with a stunning elevator witch is my favorite company the service is so nice and my room was on the floor the top floor my room number was the food on the floor is nicethank you and this was my review,1
1321,hotel is nice and is clean bathroom is great good location but im purely giving start for service it is appalling and disgraceful i rang for new towels and a iron the receptionist said they would bring it to my room after minutes of waiting i went down to the reception to see where it was she rudely told me she has no more iron left to borrow and she did not even apologise i am usually a easy going guy and do not expect everything to be perfect but when you pay for a four star hotel you expect good friendly service and manners also for a four star hotel there is a kettle but no tea or coffee there should be a iron in each room or at least a sufficent amount of irons you customers can borrowshame on hotel catalonia you should get your staff to learn hospitality,0
1322,we stayed for two days in the month of july rooms were comfortable very close to city center we could be able to get good restaurants shopping and reachable to hop on hop buses all were near by coffee was available in the reception all the time was very goodstaff were helpful friendly and hospitable esp mrs mireia and mr marc thanks dr shivananda bangalore india,1
1324,hotel is beautiful location is perfect rooftop was great and changed rooms as initial room was tiny we changed to and was just enough bigger to make the difference no one would be happy in breakfast buffet was amazing staff great,1
1325,this hotel is amazing the staff are friendly the rooms are beautiful and the breakfast is delicious it was our favorite part of the time we spent in barcelona highly recommend for anyone wanting a luxury hotel in the city,1
1326,we spent night at the majestic in june and booked one of the majestic residences directly across passieg de gracia from the hotel two bedrooms two full baths a ktichen room balconies laundry we had it all it would be hard to find better service or amenities than this the hotel is centrally located and we walked to many attractions restaurants including la sagrada familia la pedrera and las ramblas the hotel has a very nice spa and a rooftop lounge with a great view the full breakfast at the hotel is delicious and has choices for everyone but it is on the expensive side we did not include this in our visit but chose to eat there once for the experience we would surely stay here again on a future trip to barcelona,1
1327,was very impressed from the moment we pulled up in the shuttle they had someone that greeted us at the curb took our bags in and they checked us into a concierge type of check in room around the way from the main area from there a person explained our room and every detail and susanna made sure that everything worked out for us she made sure that our stay was special i was very impressed with the rooftop deck and the pool area and it was very busy at midnight and just wonderful i was able to book this on expedia with my flight and so i believe i got a very good rate i been to a lot of hotels and traveled often and i would say this is been one of the best hotels i been to and it walking distance to everywhere and i especially love the marble bathroom with the deep tub if there was just one tiny thing that i would have preferred it might have been an expresso machine in the room that made real dark strong coffee instead of the automatic one that they have in there but that seems to be a typical thing everywhere i would surely stay there again and it made barcelona even nicer oh there was a man at the rooftop area that allowed people in and out and very tall and slender he was quite arrogant and unfriendly yet marissa was a hostess up there on,1
1328,great hotel its located in the middle of the high end shopping distriict which is not my thing however there are some advantages you away from the hustle and bustle of things but yet a short walk from some gaudi building and nightlife staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel is well built highlight is rooftop which can get crowded quickly due to small size as well as an off the chain breakfast buffet would highly recommend,1
1329,this is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in we thought we would treat ourselves to a hotel for the last couple of nights of our honey moon and it was fantastic they treated us so well gave us champagne when we arrived to celebrate our honeymoon the room was lovely and the bed was the comfiest the staff were really friendly and liked to make sure we were very happy the views from the roof top pool are just incredible the spa therapists were very friendly and great at what they do we had a fantastic treatment from them followed by prosecco and chocolates thank you for a fantastic honeymoon,1
1332,recently stayed at the hotel for nights absolutely great location the hotel feels like a business hotel although it seemed just the opposite by the guests we observed the hotel is very lovely but you feel like you could be anywhere the and concierge area is very confusing when we arrived we were shuttled around to the side for additional area the concierge and other check in area are together but they wear different colored jackets some of the people do both jobs the hallways on the floors were beautiful and well decorated our room was very large but uninteresting the long narrow drain in the shower was blocked and water went all over the floor it was hard to understand how it had just become blocked they did sent maintenance up right away to fix the swimming pool bar area was great but very hard to get a seat beautiful views of city breakfast was very mediocre the area to choose your buffet food was very congested and staff rushing around to refill most of the pastries i saw at nearby places looked much better fruit was constantly empty the only time i observed a good selection was the morning we were leaving at,1
1333,we stayed at the mitsis majestic hotel for a week in our second visit the hotel is on the main passeig de gracia a bustling colourful street opposite gaudi casa batlo though in the midst of an area full of sites shops and restaurants the hotel is a comfortable quiet haven in a wonderful always easy to return to in the middle of the day or in the roof garden is outstanding with breathtaking views restful seating and tasty snacky menu and bar with background music and lovely the hotel is exquisitely and tastefully furnished rooms and bathrooms very spacious and comfortable with all amenities one can think of for a luxurious stay room is charming and food really excellent as is the rooms are spotlessly clean no trays left in the corridors and chambermaids clean room as soon as you leave it for breakfast and disappear when you return is well worth taking a room with a view on a high the staff in this hotel are specially friendly and professional and there is a lovely atmosphere which is managed by pascal billard who personally checked on us every day and made sure everything was fine during our stay a very nice have to mention lucia a kind and smiling guest relations manager who was very attentive and caring throughout our stay as were the concierge and all the staff at the hotel is perfect in every way we shall definitely return on our next visit to barcelona,1
1334,the majestic hotel has a luxury feel and the location is spot on where you can hop on public transporation and be at your destination within minutes we were greeted warmly by the staff that offered warm towels and a cold libation later at the top floor restaurant we ate some of the finest cuisine that europe has to offer a must stay hotel,1
1335,my wife and i spent four nights at the majestic in our first trip to barcelona it is a wonderful hotel with a great location our room was clean and spacious and the service was very attentive we looked forward to each morning breakfast as it was fantastic i highly recommend the majestic,1
1336,a fantastic hotel with really great staff especially the maids and staff in the breakfast room the lobby area smells so nice and is the same scent of the shower gel in your room rooms are spacious and my room on the second floor had the most powerful shower i have ever used it was the best plenty of plugs however none next to your very close to passeig de gracia for transport around the city and also for trains out to the coast plenty of high end shopping in the area chanel is just next door a brisk minute walk to the sagrada familia you should definitely head up to the floor and see the view,1
1338,we stayed for nights and celebrated a big birthday which the hotel honored meaningfully and delightfully our junior suite was elegant plush and quiet on the floor we had a light dinner on the rooftop and the ham carved tableside was fabulous along with a bottle of ros√© cava we have stayed at other supposedly good hotels in barcelona including the nearby claris and the modernist fuster and they do not even come close to the elegance comfort spaciousness and service of the majestic breakfasts were delicious and the buffet had many interesting items reflecting the tastes of the international clientele we have found our new favorite hotel in barcelona and will recommend it to family and friends,1
1339,great location european size rooms but what stood out was the extremely good and friendly service be it at breakfast or on the roof top bar the level of service was truly an established hotel rooms were fresh and pleasantly decorated a good balance between modern facilities and charming environment,1
1340,great location beautiful hotel from the minute you are greeted at the front door to the minute you check out service is top terrace and pool are beautiful the view is rooms are a nice bathrooms are large and the heated towel racks are a soap and hair products are very nice and smell good doorman greets you in his top hatand tails and has a cab waiting for you is a great hotel to book and its proximity to surrounding shops and places of interest makes it very easy to walk if you choose,1
1341,wonderful service and lovely rooms recommend upgrading since standard rooms run quite small staff is is excellent walking distance to most attractions beautiful view from the rooftop,1
1342,we checked into the travelodge as a large group coming in from canada the reception team in the hotel greeted us warmly and their attention to service was excellent from start to finish front desk is very friendly and professional attending to needs and even helping with spanish translation as needed great accommodations and a wonderful breakfast buffet each morning with hot and cold selections and rooms very clean and well kept the location is only minutes walk to the beach and not far from port olympic very efficient metro system in barcelona made this location a great base to return to as the metro stop is a few blocks away and so easy to get to the centre of town gothic quarter la ramblas and shopping around catalunya square well done travelodge,1
1343,stayed here for a long weekend hotel itself was clean and staff were very friendly even had security a short walk from the beach minutes lots of lovely shops and cafes on the way to the beach however central to the bars restaurants beaches and on buses absolutely no concerns and would return to this hotel,1
1344,location is excellent for both the beach and the city use the metro which is only about mins walk away to explore the city the beach is approx mins walk away on the doorstep to the hotel is a street full of restaurants and shops which leads down towards the beach the staff were excellent when helping us with directions etc breakfast was included in our stay and this was great would recommend and stay here again,1
1345,i think that this place offered good value nice location close to beach and restaurants and bars also close to metro station i would stay here again thanks to the staff at the hotel enjoyed my stay here,1
1346,we spent nights in this hotel the staff was friendly and helpful the room was quite small however comfortable we enjoyed the location of the hotel it is near the la rambla de poblenou the street where many shops and restaurants are located plus it is near the metro station,1
1347,asked for a double bed or twin beds with double sheets got confirmation prior to arrival but once at the hotel we were given twin beds with single sheets which were still not changed to double sheets in spite of asking reception staff as well as the cleaning staff,1
1348,have just checked out and will be back staff very obliging and helpful manager jos√© mingles with guests each morning and always has time to talk and offer help special mention for irene in mornings very pleasant and helpful in fact all staff lovely room basic but fine location beside la ramble poblenue so loads of restaurants metro min walk and barcelona centre min away only small negative booked rooms and not ready for hours after arrival wifi great and given complimentary on held bags in safe location on our departure while we spent last afternoon shopping no price basic but great,1
1349,the front desk personnel was very friendly and accommodating that the only plus the wifi in the room was very slow it only works in the lobby and lobby is small and crowded the room is very very basic with no cabinets the mattress is thin and not comfy furnitures in the room are basic looks new but flimsy looking there no free breakfast as it says in it about per person but the food is good and considering it expensive to eat anyway outside we loved the coconut yogurt outside the hotel is a nice park that stretches couple of miles with nice restaurants and shops with lots of nice folks just hanging out not too crowded nice ambiance,0
1350,service and facilities were excellent the staff made us feel at home the front desk staff who checked us in did get his name unfortunately saw that my sister and i were so tired from our travels and did his best to get us a room asap beds were comfy hot and cold shower available basic amenities were provided excellent location as well just a few minutes from restaurants bars and cafe and the beach there is a bus stop right outside and the metro station is just a few minutes walk away we loved our stay here,1
1351,very clean very good and helpfull staff good location best hotel manager jose who makes sure that the hotel guests are happy and comfortable by asking them daily about there satisfaction and their comments if any simply the best hotel manager i ever met,1
1352,i spent days here last year room was clean and comfortable staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was fantastic good location about from the beach and nearest metro station couple of live streets nearby so plenty to do at night loved my stay here,1
1353,i have found that any big company are only as good as the staff as the service they supply reflects on that company i have to say that i was so impressed from the moment we walked into the reception and was warmly greeted by adrian that straight away i knew that i was going to be satisfied with our stay my wife has a mobility problem and his help and understanding was exemplary after parking the car we were booked in by wheed and again can not praise her enough for her help the room was spotless and the beds very comfortable although we were above a busy street the windows kept out any noise and the air conditioning was effective enough to keep them closed even on the hottest days in barcelona breakfast was a buffet of hot or cold and was regularly kept fresh by the efficient waiting staff as stated earlier everyone was more than helpful and on our departure day we even had the duty manager talk to us over breakfast he advised us that this particular hotel was in the group on current form all i can say is the above him have to be outstanding when we left we felt like royalty with the staff almost lining up to wish us a happy onward you travelodge barcelona and if we ever return to barcelona we will not hesitate to stay with you again,1
1354,this was a really bad hotel double room is tiny and so uncomfortable that gives you the impression that someone tried to make your life difficult on attach the related photos there was a thing instead of a wardrobe i can not even describe it look the photo and remember that this is for persons was no bedside table instead they had tiny recesses on the bed wood where you can put a glass maximum nothing shower had such a topology that it impossible to control the temperature without being under the water yourself photo hairdryer rubbing broken knob is unworthy to mention what about a team of ants walking on the wall above your breakfast photo charge you even for photocopies photo the room price can not excuse any of the above i was not expecting a luxurious stay i was expecting something just basic this was not basic at i asked frontdesk if all the doubles are same as mine and they said yes do hope for better luck just do go,0
1355,i satisfied of this hotel it an honnest price and the staff is very kind breakfast basic but to beach and metro are perfect good bed and bathroom with bath staff very helpfull,1
1356,just returned from a three night stay hotel is situated in a area which makes it quite nice as it out of the busy tourist area still offers a lot around with great restaurants supermarkets and a market within min walk the metro in min walk and only stops from the main station the hotel itself is small but adequate staff are a real asset to the business on i discovered that my safe was not working and the receptionist on duty tried to fix it was unable to so called out the maintenance man who arrived an hour later to resolve the issue daily housekeeping was good cleaned the room thoroughly room had an air con which was definitely needed only let down was breakfast service was great and breakfast was neatly presented however the quality of ingredients was not that great which is a shame maybe we were spoiled by eating at one of the nearby bakeries two of the days but i think that this is one area that can be improved upon i would rather pay more charged at pp and have freshly squeezed juice better quality yoghurt etc having said all this it would not stop me staying again overall a great little hotel in a great area,1
1357,the manager toni was rude and not accommodating at all the night before we arrived on i mistakenly booked rooms instead of one clicked book now twice by mistake i only realized it when we arrived at the hotel when i was informed that i had booked rooms and i would be charged explained to toni the manager that this was a mistake and asked very nicely and politely that the transaction be called spoke in spanish and gave me the operator told me that toni refused to confirmed this saying it is not their policy and i had to forfeit the extra room charge he had the authority to do the refund but refused to do so he said it was my fault and he could not care lessnice customer relations tonii hope you enjoyed the free money you got out of me not a nice area bit of a seedy part of town the view from our bedroom window was old run down buildings behind the hotelpool on the roof top was small run down and crowded took look and leftthe breakfast was ok but expensive with friendly staffnever again,0
1358,we stayed for a week in july for a part business holiday the hotel is located in eixample which is a great district for eating out and pottering around in or sitting and in the various bars cafes and restaurants as well as being central so easy to get to the beach airport and tourist stuff the hotel is very well presented contemporary very clean and comfortable there a roof top pool which is small but perfectly sized for a quick dip after a busy day sightseeing or working i think the best thing about the hotel is the awesome staff everyone working on the reception desk was super friendly and helpful they totally made our stay,1
1359,i stayed for a week during a family wedding the staff was very helpful the hotel is lovely the breakfast and tea opportunities delicious an ambient peaceful oasis in a busy city i would definitely recommend and return,1
1360,stayed for nights in june with my partner and hotel granvia did not disappoint we got a free room upgrade and bottle of champagne as this trip was for my so this was a lovely surprise upon is simply amazing very central and right next to a metro station which we used to get to the was not huge however there was a built walk in wardrobe which was ideal for placing clothes and suitcase in order to avoid clutter in the was simple yet very classy and elegant again bathroom was not huge i have experienced bigger bathroom in barcelona but it was not an issue shower was provided in large bottles which is ideal if travelling for a short trip and only have small hand luggage allowance on plane we did not have breakfast included as was cheaper for us to go to a nearby cafe an amazing extra the hotel provided was free afternoon snacks from around if i remember rightly and it was delicious sandwiches cakes etc and all homemade additionally there is a lovely terrace outside at the back of the property where you can sit and relax and make use of the bar menu the nachos and potatoes were not the best would definitely recommend and stay again,1
1361,the magnificent white staircase and giant black and white photos gave the feeling you were in a movie loved the delicious free afternoon teas and the terrace was great for a drink room was small but excellent edurne on reception could not have been more helpful loved the location and will be back,1
1362,excellent small bijoux hotel you could walk past on grand via it within easy walking distance to the regular bus routes and the bus touristique red and blue lots of local restaurants to try out and big shopping areas all around the hotel is clean and the room is quiet spacious with a great powerful shower and excellent air con required at the moment with these extreme temperatures staff are really helpful and friendly a special mention to karen in the restaurant who every morning has charmed us with her friendliness and kindness highly recommended,1
1363,a really nice clean hotel with friendly staff location is great and breakfast and karen working with the breakfast was a big plus i would definitely recommend to stay for a great stay,1
1364,the moment you walk into this hotel you feel like you in a high end boutique hotel and the lady at the front desk was lovely and helpful with a quick check in the location is super convenient mins walk from where the aerobus stop in placa catalunya and tons of restaurants and bars are nearby our room was large and super comfortable and clean after a long overnight flight from toronto the shower with excellent water pressure and lots of hot water was a nice welcome after walking the streets of barcelona in the summer heat the powerful ac was always nice to come home to the lobby has a beautiful white staircase with some cool art that is instagram worthy overall a great stay,1
1365,this hotel is beautiful and the quad room is quite spacious we arrived really early after getting off of the cruise ship and they held all of our luggage while we went out for a day of sightseeing the front desk gave us a map and helped me navigate how to get to the picasso museum and take public transit to montjuic there is a lovely afternoon tea reception with cookies and little sandwiches we were also surprised to be invited to an hour long rose wine tasting on the patio in the evening we had some great conversation with the other hotel guests and enjoyed two glasses of rose and a cava fun free wifi but our ac was very well though the breakfast is quite nice i like the cured meats and churros with chocolate,1
1366,located in the fashionable eixample district it is extremely convenient to all the major sites and attractions it is very close to the ramblas and within easy walking distance of the barri gothic and el born regions and tons of great restaurants in the eixample and those districts there is a metro stop a half block away so there is easy train access to anyplace in the city by our choice by price our room was small but not by european standards it was clean the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern with a great shower the staff extremely helpful making restaurant reservations before we arrived and reserving and printing out our reservations for the sagruda famili and the predera the rate was comparable or better than similar and lesser hotels so a reasonably good value we can think of no reason to look any place else but the hotel granvia when booking a room for barcelona,1
1367,would highly recommend hotel granvia for a stay in barcelona the hotel itself is beautiful and very well maintained they have a very nice patio area where we sat one evening and had tapas and a beer the rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are great the shower is amazing and having traveled a lot of places in europe that is always the case the only tiny complaint i have is the ac did work great we were still pretty warm in our room during our visit in july the wifi works great was very pleasantly surprised by that the hotel seemed to be very centrally located and we had no problems getting around would highly recommend to stay there and we will be back thank you,1
1368,fashionable hotel in a good location excellent breakfast with a very relaxing terrace will come back to this hotel again only minutes walk to las ramblas and next to a metro station front desk got us checked in earlier than usual,1
1369,this was the second time my husband and i stayed at the hotel granvia nights in july and nights july we liked the hotel very much in but our time in barcelona was too short this year we decided to end our two week trip in northern spain and france at hotel granvia because it was our favorite hotel during our previous trip to spain hotel staff members were generally pleasant and professional i especially appreciated the young gentleman at the front desk who helped me get my laptop to connect with the hotel internet i will long remember the warm smiles of karen one of the staff at the breakfast and afternoon tea buffets she was very attentive to guests and i enjoyed talking with her briefly a couple of times when she was not too busy we enjoyed everything about this hotel very comfortable bed and room excellent breakfasts in a very nice area the terrace the computer and library area and the neighborhood the decor was very interesting and appropriate to the hotel history the location was ideal for us we could easily walk to many of the places we visited but the subway and airport bus were nearby when we needed them,1
1370,hotel granvia is an excellent hotel to stay if you are at barcelona good location clean and room is big it is easy to access all of major attractions shopping dining and tourist services the staffs were friendly and really helpful they helped us to book the hop on hop off tours online and called the taxi for us on the day we left we got there on sunday and there was a free hours walking tour that helped us a lot for the first time that we visited barcelona the tour guide was so helpful nice and have a great knowledge to all of the historic sights that she took us around highly recommend to all if you visit this beautiful city,1
1371,we were given a large room on the third floor beautiful room with high ceilings nice bedding comfortable chair it overlooked gran via de les corts which is a busy street but is also central so we had a little noise at night but at the same time the location is great for walking to the gothic quarter bathroom was very small though looked great but toilet was wedged in a corner which made it difficult to use and the shower door did close properly so we had to keep the shower pressure low so we did flood the bathroom we reported this to reception and they said they would have the facilities person check it out sink was also narrow so could put razor shaving cream and toothbrush on sink inconvenient but the niceness of the room the lovely terrace with afternoon tea delicious mini sandwiches and pastries made up for it,1
1372,great central location you walk into the lobby and modern barcelona disappears unique boutique ambiance exterior terrace was an added bonus one of the best part of our trip to barcelona was finding and booking this,1
1373,my family of recently had a wonderful stay at the hotel granvia hg hg was a very short walk from plaza de cataluyna metro stop which was nice for our cadre of weary travelers we booked superior rooms and for an extra euros a night they brought in an extra bed for each room the value was fantastic we found the pictures on the website to be very representative of the room and terrace they were all very nice and the facilities were kept perfectly clean also from pm pm each night there is a wonderful afternoon tea with complimentary pastries teas and coffees which are all wonderful one evening the hotel even hosted a jazz performance on the terrace we also found the location to be very good it is only a minute walk to a large number of attractions and is right in the heart of barcelona shopping district,1
1374,i have needs many times at this wonderful hotel yet i like the good position to get everywhere quick with metro or by walk very comfy the only minus is that at the moment there are some reconstructions but anyway i would high recommend,1
1375,although they are remodeling the hotel they managed to give us an excellent service my youngest daughter is on a wheelchair and they made things easier for her and the family appreciate all the help and care by everyone at the hotel the location is close to las ramblas and other important points of the city but the surroundings are not the best at night,1
1376,not impressed with the condition of the hotel we checked in with and had rooms reserved the lobby is misleading in making you believe that the rooms are updated and nice upon arriving to our room we found that the room was stuffy as if the air was not working we tried to turn the ac up but it was operating at full blast our beds are rock hard and in the floor as if were kids camping in the wilderness the bathrooms are old outdated and have cracked tiles and mold in the grout this was only in one room and it didnt get any better for the other rooms some of our party has already tried to switch rooms only to get placed in rooms that are worst i would never refer this hotel to anyone and i shocked that its a wyndham hotel it definitely like a motel,0
1377,we stayed at this property one night before our may cruise belated thanks to miguel at the front desk who was welcoming kind and courteous he recommended and reserved for us an outstanding nearby seafood restaurant we dined at on the same street avenida del parallel as the hotel where we enjoyed the best meal of our trip at a very reasonable price,1
1378,long overdue for a revamp and overpriced chrome plating on the taps wearing off with age walls in the room could do with a new coat of paint and replace carpets this should hotel is more like a two star with four star prices,0
1379,opted for this hotel as it appeared to offer very good services for the price and was well located on the metro system was not disappointed as this hotel is lovely and provided all that we needed the rooftop pool was a nice bonus as was the free spa entry albeit with restricted times the reception staff all spoke good english and were very friendly and helpful the rooms were large and clean and were serviced daily the bar area with snacks available was clean and well run and the prices were not expensive the metro was a minute walk from the hotel and very easy to use we used it every day to get about the only possible issue could be that you are not in the centre of the city but this was not a problem for us,1
1380,my family and i had a fantastic time in this hotel yes it is a ways from the main attractions but we bought the hola barcelona card that let us use the tube station and the bus this hotel had a great spa with different pools and jacuzzis the staff was helpful and the rooms were clean definitely recommend,1
1381,stayed here for nights with my mum for my birthday honestly this place has hardly any faults we were greeted by a friendly security guard by the doors and a helpful polite multi language speaking lady who checked us in with a whole hotel smells lovely probably as a result of the spa in the room had a inch tv in it although we only had english speaking channel room service was excellent and our room was tidied up every day electric beds and air con with black out honestly me and mum felt like we were posh enough to be there the rooftop pool and decking made us feel relaxed and secluded towards the end of the holiday it did become noisy and rife with what seemed like a school trip but ca fault the hotel on that did notice no life guard or staff on the roof though which may have been spa is mainly a water experience with all kinds of different pools this was peaceful and free for guests in the mornings which was a great way for us both to start each day the buffet restaurant always seemed to be closed however we may have just missed opening hours as we were exploring the city every major fault is location me and mum love a good time and it was a while away from most lovely bars very close to the football stadium definitely visit to all staff who were extremely helpful especially our friendly,1
1382,i booked through a wowcher for a flight and hotel deal to the senator it was a surprise trip my friend who turned i had some issues with the travel agent and was also disappointed that as we arrived late on the saturday night we only had the free use of the spa facilities on the sunday as it is shut on a monday and we were returning home early morning on the tuesday however we very much enjoyed the spa the staff were friendly and helpful i had emailed in advance that it was my friend birthday and they supplied us with a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a lovely touch the roof top pool was a nice touch but a bar up there and cushions on the sun loungers the are solid hard wood would have improved it the breakfast was wonderful with an abundance of choice the room was nice and we traveled into barcelona on the bus which was cheap air conditioned and took about mins both my friend and i agreed that we will most definitely come back and stay at the senator again,1
1383,located next to the famous nou camp metro nearby many food shops around they are open until about easy to a catch a taxi but we used public transport barcelona center is really nice a must at night time not to mention other stuff i mean lot to see in barcelona anyway hotel was nice and would stay here again,1
1385,we arrived after nine and there was a queue at reception which seemed to take a while to go down there were comfortable chairs available to wait in the entrance to the hotel is beautiful outside there are fountains and inside the floors are marble throughout when we opened our room we were very pleased at what we saw for a standard room we had been offered an up grade for a night which we turned down the room was just as the photos on the website marble floors ceiling fan air con safe the bathroom was spacious with vanity unit with full length mirror toilet and bedit with a phone next to it the rest of the room consisted of built in wardrobes with iron and ironing board into the main room which was a standard twin room were two queen size electric beds which were made up with crisp white sheets duvets were in the wardrobe if required either side of the beds were bedside tables with wall lamps and spot lights there was a wall mounted tv the mini fridge was supplied with mini bottles of water each not to worry as there are several supermarkets within five minute walk there was an easy chair and table by the window to be honest look at the hotel photos they accurate in the lobby there are two massage chairs very good in the basement there is a spa which if you book through certain companies gives you hours,1
1387,just back from nights at your hotel we had a fantastic time seeing the sights of barcelona nou camp which is a minute walk from the hotel we found the room to be comfortable and the bathroom was a good size and both very clean and was kept that way during our stay breakfast was fantastic such a variety of foods on offer staff where very helpful and friendly during our stay and were happy to answer our questions particularly would like to say a you to goretti who works in the bar so pleasant and friendly always so helpful to us during our stay she is a credit to your hotel we look forward to coming back soon and also in trying one of your sister hotels,1
1390,the very clean and spacious close to the port of barcelona perfect for beginning of cruise the food was location is not the best seems to be an industrial location was too far from airport and the city it made touring difficult and euros i ca stress this enough dollars not widely accepted and if they do accept prepare to be ripped off with the exchange rate not just at hotel overall good clean and decent hotel perfect for short stays nights max and business trips,1
1391,the staff was very friendly and the breakfast choices were great that where it ends the rooms were run down with stains on the carpets cracked tiles in the bathroom old and stained sink and beds absolutely disgusting the price per night was crazy at per night we shortened our stay from to night and checked into a local marriott hotel instead at half the cost,0
1392,it is a shame as the staff work so hard to assist and make your stay enjoyable but the constant construction works and noise is off putting from early in the morning into the evening hammering drilling workmen shouting and banging of doors it is near impossible even to take a restful hour in your room during the day as it is located on a very busy main street with bars and clubs and an outdoor concert venue just down the street people party literally to the crack of dawn so expect to not have a decent of the works the rooms was too warm as the ac is not functioning all making for an exhausting stay on a good note the breakfast is plentiful and fresh,0
1394,we came with a large group staying here and then boarding a mediterranean cruise the hotel suited us just fine centrally located which was so convenient to tour barcelona and very close to las ramblas,1
1395,we decided to stay at this hotel at the end of our trip because our flight was at in the hotel was very clean we booked the quadruple room because we have two room was very spacious for european staff brought our kids complementary writing block and crayons which was dinner in the restaurant was nothing to write home about but this hotel is a very good choice for one night to catch an early free airport shuttle was good and got us to terminal in good staff was courteous and all in all a good experience,1
1398,although this hotel has been updated since we stayed here last about years are in and a make over is underway not to our inconvenience in reason for the review is down to the customer service given by all employees of the done they are indeed an asset for this forward to visiting when the refurb has been finished as the location is excellent,1
1399,we stayed here one night before embarking on a cruise the carpets were filthy in the hallways and in our room when we went to our room the door was open and we could see why the carpet was very wet by the bathroom they must have been trying to dry it we did want to walk barefoot on the carpet and we are not usually fussy when we told the desk clerk on checkout he basically ignored us the only good thing was the hotel is easy access to the cruise terminal,0
1401,internet a bit slow and room was ok but a good value excellent breakfast good location very good service and many good local restaurant options nearby abt a min walk to the many touristy areas very doable neighborhood safe very close to metro stop,1
1402,this hotel is superb great room and very friendly and helpful staff the breakfast is fantastic and the location is perfect for getting around the city for sightseeing highly recommend this hotel fantastic beds and will definitely be returning,1
1403,arrived late but to a very warm welcome reception could not have been more was spacious and cool weather outside was in the barman in foyer gave us great service all in all a short but pleasant stay,1
1406,this hotel is worn out the tile in the bathroom is cracked and mold is growing in the corners the faucets are so worn the chrome is worn off in places and carpets were thread bare and stained our first night we had a first floor room facing the street yards away to our surprise was a disco the is open until am the sound proofing is non existent so sleep was hard to come by the staff was great and we were able to relocate to a top floor room in the back for the second night this only reduced the noise by dinner was above average and breakfast was good,0
1407,no shower amenities not good service the hotel in general was definitely not a star the only good thing is the location which is very central the room had a balcony that overlooks the street overpriced,0
1408,as part of the beach week organised by my parent and to enjoy with my daughter i though was good to show to her other great cities in the plan was to get a week end in barcelona and then drive to the beach after looking for hotels the petit palace barcelona was a great choice centric well situated and with a great price check in was speedy and very efficient the staff were friendly and their suggestion of restaurant was excellent with a very helpful booking done by room well equipped and spacious with confortable beds and a great airconn needed on a hot breakfast times were more than acceptable and the offer wide and well stocked,1
1409,been there for nights with my wife we also stayed at the petit palace in malaga and madrid the one in barcelona is by far the worst in terms of facilities quite dirty and hotel is currently under renovation and there is dust around the reception area and other communal parts the path to the lift is poorly lit also reception the personnel is quite unfriendly albeit polite they distil relevant information slowly including on how to access the hotel with your hotel card compared to the other two petit palace they have a long way to connection simply embarrassing slow choppy and unreliable breakfast very expensive turn right and walk down one block then cross the street and keep walking down on your left you will find el fornet high quality breakfast for a very reasonable were also unlucky as the other guests were quite noisy and impolite our sleep was interrupted by abrupt noise in the middle of the obliged please stay away analysis very poor,0
1410,the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,0
1412,great did not have a street view this time around but rooms are room has a wonderful lobby with refreshement drinks cheaper than outside is a seating area around the lobby where you can view the people outside which is great to do in the late was great you,1
1413,although the location is good this hotel is not any good for those who need sleep there is a bar downstairs that has music until late and the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything when people walk past the room the obvious drug dealing that happens right outside the hotel entrance just makes you feel unsafe not a pleasant place to stay and relax,0
1414,we stayed here nights the hotel is very minimalist we were on the floor there is a lift the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom was fab with a large shower the air con kept us cool on very hot nights the hotel has free wifi which works best in the lounge area on the floor it was not so reliable there was a buffet breakfast for euros there were lots of restaurants nearby,1
1415,down a side street off the la rambla this hotel is in the middle of everything the port is min walk away the gothic quarter another minutes in the opposite direction lots of restaurants around it is noisy at night but that the price you pay for staying in such a central area the staff were quite brusque we were not told about needing to use the room key to activate the lift or about needing to show your room card with the room number on at breakfast in the morning but we did discover a sign in the lift telling us about it half way through our stay the hotel itself is clean the room was a decent size with a balcony air conditioning safe the bed was comfortable the only thing was there was one very thin pillow for each person the bathroom was another matter again very clean but there is no door to the shower which means the floor gets soaking wet each time and you end up using the towels to soak up the water breakfast selection was average cold ham and cheese bacon and frankfurter sausages the usual pastries,1
1416,we had a lovely big room with excellent bathroom and separate toilet the only problem was there was much space to put your clothes very small wardrobe and no drawers or shelves to put underwear or tops in we had to live out of our suitcases which is very pleasant however this is our only complaint the hotel is situated in the old city and very near to all attractions i will definitely stay there again we did bother with breakfast as there are little coffee shops and restaurants just a few minutes walk away which serve lovely coffee and rolls etc,1
1417,i have always wanted to go to barcelona this hotel was the perfect location in the gothic quarter which is so beautiful with it tiny streets lovely shops and wonderful restaurants and bars the hotel was very modern clean and near to everything the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was really clean with a great breakfast was great but a good start to the day when you are busy visiting all that there is to see in the fantastic city,1
1418,courteous staff ideal for a short visit reasonable rates with breakfast at the bottom end of ramplas so ideal for local bars and resturants nearby and handy for transfer from airport,1
1420,i stayed with a group of teenagers with a travel company and i was surprised how calm the atmosphere was in the hotel the reception wanted us to fill out paperwork to figure out the tourist tax when we were trying to get our group settled and organized in their rooms but they let us come back later and figure out the bill the rooms were always cleaned well and the reception put in a call for me and called a taxi for me when i needed to go to the thought that there would be more craziness since it close to la rambla but it was quite the opposite i ca say that i felt unsafe at any point but there were some weird people outside i feel like that is almost everywhere near the city center but i think it important to note if you stay there i never felt unsafe but the people were strange also please note that the download and upload speeds are very slow if you need to upload download or transfer files on business then you might want to consider another hotel i had to try uploading pictures through dropbox and it would take an hour instead of which is the typical time for the amount of files i was working with at the time,1
1421,hotel was perfectly situated and staff helpful and friendly rooms are just dated and do match condition of lobby pool is the perfect roof top terrace with a full service bar for the most part pool and area are nice and clean,1
1422,we stayed for days at the silken ramblas from monday the to friday the staying in room can only say what a delightful stay we had whole staff without exception were brilliant plus the hotel was spotless breakfasts were really good plenty of everything with a great selection and all areas spotlessly clean and the staff were excellent in particularly the waitresses who did breakfast and the hotfooted up to do the pool bar they were both kind and very ramblas area was also very good seemingly in the heart of everything worth seeing shopping of which there were many and very varied going to barcelona be advised and see the flamenco with dinner and also go to luki a brilliant eatery bit out of the tourist area but a visit is a must love to go back to barcelona and would definitely return to the hotel silken ramblas and thoroughly recommend it,1
1423,the location of this hotel is great and i could fault the staff they were very friendly and helpful the main issue was that the room themselves are very tired and extremely noisy whilst we stayed we did manage to sleep the good due to being kept awake or woken up by people walking or talking in any room adjoining or even above us due to the laminate flooring and thin walls this was extremely disappointing considering it is meant to be a hotel,0
1424,my girlfriend and i stayed at silken ramblas barcelona for three nights from july the hotel was a short taxi journey approx euros from the airport and when we arrived we were amazed at how well the hotel is located there is a metro station catalunya less than a minute walk away and it is a very short tube ride from the main tourist attractions of the city the hotel is right outside la rambla street which is full of high quality restaurants markets and high street shops it is also a short walk from the gothic quarter the hotel itself was very smart and clean with very friendly staff who were happy to answer questions the bedrooms were well designed although we were given two adjacent single beds which seemed very light and moved when sat on the bathroom was very smart although of all things we found it strange that there was no soap holder for the bar they provided the rooftop bar decking area was nice to relax by although it did get very busy the photos online being deceiving as the pool was very small all in all a fair stars the best factor being the location,1
1425,the hotel was located near restaurants and close to the metro rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff were all accommodating and so nice i would stay here again and recommend to friends,1
1426,we enjoyed our stay here was good location and very clean located min walk from sagrada church ehich is awesime church site breakfast was great too the staff was helpful and pleasant would not hesitate to recommend to others,1
1427,perfect hotel close to sagrada familia plenty of restaurants and bars around for various dietary needs minutes to el clot metro station giving you access to the city clean tidy and well presented the rooms were a good size and comfortable would definitely return and would recommend,1
1428,all excellent good location good air con cleaness staff facilities just did have time to enjoy the swimming pool my sister tried but it was full she went back to the room lovely balcony very comfortable bed,1
1430,great hotel for the price right in the middle of las ramblas gentleman at reception really friendly made us feel really welcome we booked a twin room and there was a mistake so they upgraded us to a one bed appartment at no extra cost spotlessly clean would definitely recommend thank you for a lovely stay,1
1431,the hotel was in a prime spot and was close to everything and faced la ramblas room was small but expected for europe staff was very nice other restaurants are close by would stay again hope to visit again,1
1432,this hotel was funky and modern room was nice big and clean the public areas were nice and the staff were really nice the rooftop pool was nice and funky the location is great right beside the design museum min walk to the beach and a nice little shopping centre across the road stations were handy too,1
1433,i found the gates hotel very nice and fancy but it lacks all the important details for a hotel to become confortable i arrived at in hotel and actually had to wait hour for room cleaning acceptable but not good after a couple of hours travelling as soon as i entered the room i found a chewing gum in the window shades that is really disgusting and disappointing almost a night just to find an old chewing gum in the room i could look at it anymore i could not believe that room service did not noticed it i have also noticed that the room lacks soom privacy it tall buildings next to it it is easy to see through the big windows unless you put the blackout all the way down the bathroom was good but a bit warm because of the window and lack of air conditioning there i have also found a roll of duct tape under the bed really this hotel has all it takes to be an amazing hotel but it fails in the smallest details,0
1434,room was amazing electric blinds aircon very good space and the bathroom was grate i went with friends stayed in the room with my boyfriend it deffenitly a place to remember loved it room cleaners super aswell everything was spotless,1
1435,parking problems couldnt get in after it was blocked by a transporter car he said we had to wait hour ridiculous cleaning people got in to the room but we put the red card outside no good service when we came back h√© threw away the shampooing we wanted to get a shower when we told it at the r√©ception he just said and didnt even excuse for them or help us,0
1436,very excellent we enjoyed and all was good we were happy to be upgraded to suite instead of guest room i will recommend this hotel to all the people that i know the staff were nice and helpful the hotel is located at good area easy for shopping and transportation,1
1437,hotel itself is very neat and clean with friendly staff just steps to the glories metro stop we never worried about transportation to all the things we wanted to do while in town the roof top offers great views of all the major landmarks of barcelona including the tower directly next door and overall our stay was perfect i would stay here again if i returned to barcelona just because i know what i getting at a reasonable to the wise do not eat any of the food at the rooftop bar we would go to the local grocery store and pick up cheap wine to drink on the roof each night just to soak up the evening but the one time we got food it was disgusting let me also point out that i easy to please but i thought i vomit after eating about half of the roast beef sandwich i bought,1
1438,very good i did not know what to expect from the hotel but overall it was a pleasant experience for a first timer i recommend it to anyone who would like to be close to all sightseeing places and more,1
1439,modern hotel in an excellent location friendly staff and wonderful roof top terrace we used the metro although it was only euros from las rambla amazing definitely stop again mr mrs young,1
1440,extremely dirty bathrooms terrible staff that do not care for the customer they seemed annoyed when asked for questions when they made a mistake the just said oh well too bad and we were stuck with the wrong parking bill they know people come to visit batcelona once in their lifetimes therefore they do not care of a returning customer,0
1443,myself and my boyfirend stayed here for my birthday the transfer was great as we got to see the surrounding city before arriving at the hotel we arrived before check in but we were able to leave our luggage in a locked room and were able to explore the area and then check in was easy and rooftop pool and bar area is nice and has some really amazing views of the city there are a few sun loungers which means it doesnt get too busy however the pool is freezing and i could only manage a few room was amazing the bed was nice and big so theres plenty of room if you struggle with heat on holiday but we had the aircon on i loved the bathroom with the glass window the blinds are also an added bonus as you can block out the light the only downside was our view of a construction site and another room service was the best but was very prompt if you have booked without breakfast and need something quick and convenient i would avoid the breakfast buffet at the hotel as it was so expensive for what it was however there are two little cafes right next door which are breat have and some good food,1
1444,room not ready on arrival staff rude charged twice for the room when i told them they said of course we preauthorized the card and refunded it they sent me a ticket that is not even mine so i finaly paid for a room like this ridiculous,0
1445,the overall hotel was really good very friendly staff an courteous everything went well an would recommend this hotel to anyone location for transport is very good an was easily accessible with a short walk,1
1446,this hotel is a modern styled multistory property located conveniently close to the local shopping centre and just a short tram trip to the beach or walk rooms are clean and well equipped with essential air conditioning the bathroom is modern and features bath x shower heads basin wc and a bidet a sliding screen seperates the bedroom from the bathroom for thoses who prefer to retain a bit of modesty see images is important and this hotel offers a fully cooked quality breakfast along side the usual continental selection the breakfast area is large and at no time was there any need to queue staff are very friendly and accommodating and very knowledgable with the local area they have plenty of time for you and can offer maps showing you the local to the hotel from the airport will cost around by taxi or just over by train the train can be embarked on at the airport and will take you to within a minute walk of the hotel you may want to remember this in case the taxis are on strike as they were when i visited any negatives well no not really around midnight it can get a little noisy in the corridors due to guests returning to their rooms but there again this is barcelona so this will surely be the case in all hotels as commented by others the rooftop is a really pleasant area to relax and wind down a pint of pisners will,1
1447,this hotel it very recommended who want to have nice hotel in barcelona the location of this hotel it very great u can go to the beach only by walking and what i like from this hotel because the staff are friendy,1
1448,beautiful hotel lovely location nice breakfast great buffet the hotel was not cleaning service in the room is not we had days no shower gel the other day we had no towels for two you can walk in and out nobody was talking,0
1449,fantastic staff and clean comfortable rooms location is great as well if you want to shop there is a mall across the street see the city the best way to get around the is city is by bus and there is a bus stop across the street in front of the hotel,1
1450,the hotel is ideal for using the metro we found it very easy to get around one complaint was a stain on the carpet which was a little off putting but i am very fussy and the rest of the hotel was immaculate the staff are so friendly we arrived at the hotel over hours before check in but they allowed us into our room early which literally made my day i would hesitate to stay again,1
1451,this is a nice hotel the staff is friendly they offer free that works quite well the rooms are spacious however sometimes it can be noisy the breakfast is very good and the breakfast staff are very friendly however i think it is a little bit to expensive euros the rooftop swimming pool is minuscule it more like a oversized jacuzzi the location is excellent it is possible to walk to the sagrada familia cathedral the tram and the subway station are just minute away,1
1452,great location in the city center with a lovely view on sagrada familia and a big shopping center nearby very friendly staff clean room and the breakfast was also very nice defenitely worth the money,1
1453,very friendly staff and service room was very clean and comfortable excellent buffet style breakfast and a wide choice of dishes rooftop pool was smaller than it looks in the pictures and the bar snacks a little pricey although the view from the roof was fantastic,1
1454,good hotel with large breakfast buffet furniture carpet somewhat outdated well located to metro and tram in between downtown and congress center overall good experience for business and excursions,1
1455,good hotel great location with good tram links to the beach and marina cracking rooftop views from the roof area comfortable room friendly and knowlegeable staff the only real downsides were an event on the roof terrace on the sunday that restricted our access to this part of the hotel on our last day and a sticky toilet sliding door that did close properly,1
1456,train station only minutes centre directly over road with plenty of food staff friendly and was lovely on clean and was great experience and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in barcelona,1
1457,great family trip away rooms with view of torres loved rooftop bar and pool great lunches only issue is beds have sharp corners that stick out and on day this caused an injury to my mum bed frsmes not suitable for anyone with fesility or mobility issues saying that would love to come again as location great and next to metro,1
1460,it was not a good expensive and the pool is top room for all the view from the suite were to a construction they were so kind to check us out before that was positive thing and the man in the reception were,0
1461,stayed in this hotel for nights over the weekend for a star in barcelona this was great value for money a lot of the other ones were coming up a lot more i have stayed in numerous hotels in barcelona and this was one of the nicest on site parking which was great as barcelona can be a nightmare to find parking pool on roof was one of the smallest i have ever seen resembled a bath the pool bar was also very over priced for a vodka crazy room was nice could really fault that except wires to the open and shut blinds hanging around i hear a lot of people moaning about the location but barcelona is so huge to do the sights your not going to be near some and closer to others the tubes are the easiest to use in the world so easy to read and just pop on and off in minutes tube station is next door to hotel,1
1463,we stayed there for nights while exploring barcelona the first time we especially loved the roof terrace near the torre agbar this was a perfect location for our trip we walked a lot or used the hotel bikes for sight seeing ca say anything about the breakfast,1
1464,wonderful welcoming hotel in a beautiful and vibrant city the hotel staff was amazing the location of the hotel was perfect for us the neighborhood was fairly quiet at night which we love and everything in the city was easy to walk to and if we could walk the metro and taxis were a half block to get anywhere in the city,1
1465,the entrance is very nice but the rooms are so dirty i even took some pictures i was shocked there was hair all over the bath and the curtain in the bedroom was ripped and disgusting it a shame because the hotel looks nice and the bed was comfortable but i was uneasy about sleeping in such dirty conditions i wo be staying here again or recommend it i come to barcelona often and i disappointed by my experience,0
1467,noisy bad bed and cover ridiculous bathroom and smelled of sewage not accessible cleaning staff and left garbage on the floor bed linen ripped and torn no bed sheets overall a bad experience not to repeat,0
1468,i expected much more from this hotel having seen the photos and in light of the price i paid the room is ok size but beds very uncomfortable the hotel seem to have no proper walls between the rooms and awful sound insulation you can hear the person next door sneezing the blinds made such noise that each evening and morning it was disturbing as guests would put them up or down the roof terrace is nice but the pool is expect to have a proper swim although it does serve the purpose to cool down in a hot weather all in all disappointing experience having said this the staff is really nice welcoming and friendly,0
1469,i just returned from a lovely stay of five nights in barcelona and all in all i very happy with my decision to stay at the gates diagonal hotel the design of the hotel is modern and minimalistic which is very appealing to me and even though there are signs of wear and tear in the rooms the overall cleanliness and state of the hotel is perfectly adequate my room was clean and very bright with windows offering magificent views of torre gl√≥ries agbar the air conditioning worked perfectly and a window could be opened for fresh air a most welcome but everso uncommon feature in hotels nowadays the design is very contemporary and attractive but certain details ie the shower are designed poorly without taking function into account it was impossible to use the shower without soaking the entire bathroom the hotel has a nice roof terrace with magnificent views of the surrounding area and also a small pool and i did not have any drinks food at the hotel checking in and out was quick efficient and friendly and all in all the stay was very the lifts however were somewhat dirty and extremely slow so i preferred using the stairs during my stay the location is in my opinion excellent gl√≥ries metrostation is just down the street which means that all parts of barcelona are easily accessed the area itself is somewhat lacking in character and charm but is safe and clean with good transportation options and,1
1470,excellent facilities and friendly helpful staff in a fantastic location within walking distance to main tourist areas the hotel did everything they could for us when we needed an extra room at short notice nothing was too much trouble would definitely recommend,1
1471,great hotel great location very helpful staff that helped me with my train tickets when i had friendly and fluent in english and spanish breakfast was great i would certainly stay here again taxi stand right outside beautiful rooftop patio,1
1472,we were at the america hotel for daysthe hotel is perfect we traveled adult and children we have got rooms with conecting door it was great very clean comfortable bedsthe roof is very nice the best thing was the service very kind and helpfull we will come back,1
1473,almost everything was good the desk and the room service was excellent i think the breakfast was over priced unless you wanted to gorge yourself we had breakfast at a little bar mar i the cetre ville plaza ham omelette toast coffee jam euro each salads were great deserts not so good tirimisu nothing like came out of freezer still frozen in not comment on the pool or fitness centre as we travelled from canada and we do not want to lounge next to a pool when the beach is mins away,1
1476,they do understand the difference of freezer and refregerater when i was check in at midnight i asked the staff to freezed the icepack that i brout form my home because to make it cool to carry my sons eye medicine but after four days when i checked out and asked them to bring it back they give me a unfrozened icepack when i complained they just said sorry but now i really worry about the medicine if you are travelling with a child who need special care this hotel is not the right place the staff of this hotel are lack of professionalism,0
1477,the hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants it also quite close to the zoo a bit further than the nearest metro station there is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the aquarium nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty large room for the rest of town we had to use the metro which means x to walk the line close by is not really well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere the view well if you see the sea it ok the sunrise was quite orange some of the buldings nearby look however depressing,1
1478,very comfortable hotel with all amenities food in restaurant and breakfasts excellent reception staff polite and knowledgeable particularly about local transport pool very clean and quiet stops on metro into barcelona or a bus stops outside hotel big enough to accommodate groups without affecting couples and families,1
1479,we were staing in the hotel we like hitel very much good location near the beach we like the waiter marycarmen from the restaurant she gave us good service and she is very policethank you very much sergey,1
1480,very nice hotel with a full breakfast the location is within walking distance form the gothic district del born marina plenty of great restaurants close by our room was very quiet on the courtyard side our daughters were on the street side which was a little loud,1
1482,super expensive hotel and inflexiblenon smoking room smelling smokehalf a soap in the roomparking too far awayno breakfast before am without breakfast basketi do recommend this hotel it is abusing of its location,0
1483,pricey by us standards but i loved the location of this hotel my room was typical but clean there was free wifi and the breakfast was included we had dinner on the plaza diagonally from the hotel entrance and the food was very good it had the added ambiance of a street performer singing opera note the taxis were on strike the day we arrived apparently they do this once a month as a protest against uber we had arranged for a transfer from the airport to our hotel in advance but our friends that we were meeting had not they spent hours dealing with this and the hotel was not equipped to offer any assistance,1
1484,great hotel with great location close to everything and the ramblas is just minutes walk close to the sea and port and the mall the room is a little bit small then other hotels i have been but it was very beautiful and had everything we needed the staff was very polite and answered every question we had,1
1485,this hotel was located in a perfect place on the main street of laietana near the waterfront one block and you are in the heart of the gothic district and across the street is the area for best restaurants where local dine the front desk staff were particularly helpful for a first time visitor to barcelona the room was quiet with comfortable beds,1
1487,can not fault this hotel clean great location and staff were very friendly and helpful rooms are small as in all european cities but the location made up for this would definitely recommend for short city break,1
1488,stayed for nights excellent central location on main street for access to metro hop on hop off tours airport bus that came with downside of noise at night which did affect my sleep room was clean bathroom was very tight on space and i could see difficulties emerging for customers who may be obese as hard to close the door pass by the toilet to get into the shower breakfast room was clean also fresh fruit of bananas apples and oranges fruit juice water of cereals croissants and bread for toasting were available for guests never met staff members in breakfast room but staff on front desk were friendly and have no hesitation recommending this hotel for a city break just try and reserve a quieter room,1
1489,i visited this hotel right now i was searching for a modern hotel close to the beach and not so far from the city in a quiet district not so noise than in downtown of barcelona which also has a roof top swimming pool itself it is a really reasonable hotel with good service the only issue is the swimming pool it is much smaller that i expected the breakfast was excellent and to walk to the sandy beach took about minutes to go the the city by taxi costs about eur only,1
1490,we enjoyed our days stay at ilunion barcelona in the heart of poblenou the streets around the hotel have a quiet provincial atmosphere as the whole area its location is very convenient a minutes walk took us to the popular playa del bogatell on one side and to the lively rambla del poblenou on the other and it only blocks to llacuna metro station where we could easily reach the city centre we also found a taxi stand just opposite of the hotel to go to the is modern clean relatively recent with a design decor lobby is spacious and stylish amenities and services were suitable staff was efficient we used the business center but neither the gym nor the pool we ran away from the breakfast hall looking like a shopping mall cafeteria our room was large bright functional silent with comfy beds including the extra much it costs has varied from day to day one night was quite expensive,1
1491,stayed with husband and son for a long weekend location is fab very close to beach and fab restaurants cafes and bars a stones throw from the hotel due to recent surgery i have mobility issues so this was just perfect we walked to beach and picked up tour bus which allowed us to see barcelona without much walking pool is small but sufficient for our needs no pool bar but plenty of supermarkets round about to buy your own drinks etc that you can have at pool no towels either so most people used towels from their room did have breakfast in the hotel as plenty of places round about to try rooms are a good size and very clean air conditioning very effective perfect location for us and we will definitely return,1
1492,we stayed there nights days a mint walk from the beach there a ling street right on the corner mint walk filled with bars and resturants even halal food is available there are also small spas nail and facial a couple of supermarkets location i cant say mint walk from metro station everything you need is there also you serrounded by bike shops used the taxi to city center because my grandma could walk you oau around one way mints away by are not comfy and if you book a triplet room they give you a roll on extra bed they dont have rooms with main beds and yes the rollon beds are even worse than thier main beds if you have a back problem or care much about your sleep i dont recommend it but there are many positives that makes me overlook the bed cleaning staff arent very dedicated tou have to tell them specifically to clean around the sink and to change tour bed covers even i saw the cleaning lady taking the bed civer from the room facing our and putting in our room instead of getting a new have little staff if you want something you need to go down get it youself most of the time even the bags we mived them by ourselves they do keep your bags after checkout for friendly staff i must say always smiling they do have a tourists office but they try to help as much as offered,1
1493,nice hotel with spacious rooms much larger than usually found in barcelona location is great to go to the beach while still quiet because it is not too close to the hectic city center we checked in late and ariel was great in fact all front desk staff was super friendly and helpful we also enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the morning and the rooftop pool which is a bit small but so cool definitely recommend,1
1494,great stay with hotel ilunion in barcelona if you like swimming you can use the pool or you can go to nice beach only from hotel you can also visit a well equiped gym for free and there is a possibillity to borrow a bike for or have a breakfast for eur i think unfortunately we did not used this service but i can reccommend you the clean modern with wifi free water and nice view hotel staff is always ready to help you the distance from the city centre is not small but you can always take a bus which goes every minutes,1
1495,the hotel is top nodge big rooms excellent location near the beach their computers run slow though i made a reservation online and it took mode than minutes for my order to be processed stuff is nice you can keep your luggage for free if you want to go places before your plane flies u back as a downside it would be the view from some rooms you see some unused ruined old constructions but who has time to look over the window when in barcelona also the room has one of the nicest bathrooms from any hotel that i visited,1
1497,great hotel good location lovely friendly staff and fab buffet breakfast thank you for making it a pleasant and happy experience the pool was a little small but the cleanliness and maintenance was excellent the room service was excellent with daily cleaning and towels changed,1
1498,very good all staff were most approachable and friendly at all times the property was always clean and tidy in a prime position to get any were either in taxi or bus or private transportation all of our party of couples enjoyed every thing about our stay at catalonia la pedrera and all the iland had to dhdue dhtie dhfbneolm cjsuioner jstekri fgey tur totmno fhdb tdhid fbdfhdi fkfkf dkthw jdndg jfheo uehbw ehed vndkgp dkewys fndo shwo fdg dyddwuo eu iuef,1
1499,everything was lovely really nice room overlooking the street reception staff were excellent in their tapas bar across the road transport system excellent and only euros for a trip card we were there to celebrate my husbands birthday and had trips arranged to go to new camp and an exhibition in a museum the staff were excellent at guiding us to the right transport system,1
1500,nice hotel friendly staff i would come back to stay here the pool and the views where very good the location also was perfect the hotel bar was very expensive and even with a taxi rank it was hard to get a taxi at times,1
1501,central to everywhere easy to catch taxis which is our preferred choice to get from a to b but also close to the underground metro and buses lots of cafes around and close to good restaurants walking down la rambla is a block or so away excellent shopping as well as wonderful architecture everywhere to see and enjoy casa battlo a few streets away the sightseeing bus a good way to orient yourself with the city my tip visiting barcelona is to book all the sightseeing places in advance as they can get booked up sigrid familia the picasso museum and also the park guell,1
1502,the location was perfect for me as it was a walk to barceloneta beach the room was clean staff were nice and efficient and the room was spacious enough the gym and pool was also a bonus i would stay in this hotel again,1
1503,the hotel was absolutely fantastic the hotel was very clean although slightly dark i really enjoyed my stay and it was perfect throughout the hotel pool area was also lovely and more than expected,1
1504,great location and very near to all prime attractions within minutes of walking facilities very good and rooms are really nicely smell of drainage in our room for the duration of our stay tarnished our enjoyment,1
1505,the room was quite small and bathroom even smaller the was traffic noise but it to be expected in the middle of a busy city the hotel is modern and very clean this is a about to minute walk to the centre but a nice stroll and it is safe there are bars and cafe near by the roof top pool is lovely too most hotels have roof top pools in barcelona,1
1506,could not find a fault with this hotel the rooms were comfortable and clean the breakfasts were very good with a wide selection of both continental and cooked the restaurant in the evening was excellent although it appeared under used by the majority of the guests,1
1507,the hotel location was very convenient for us as we had a meeting on our return with our car to barcelona and the car parking was a big plus easy to access car space for a day in central barcelona seemed reasonable the hotel twin room was very comfortable with good beds and linen and so was the bathroom too a relief as we paying over for the room and parking and no breakfast there are plenty of very good cafes and bakeries nearby so no problem especially as the check out time is there is a roof top pool which seemed to be very popular judging by the number of people in swimsuits going up to the roof probably a real bonus on a hot summers day in barcelona all the reception staff are very helpful and made for a pleasant one stay,1
1508,yes the location is quite good walking distance to nice restaurants a nice shopping area and even the metro is close by the rooms are decently sized and clean and the morning breakfast was good the only reason the review gets two stars and not one is because the first couple of nights my stay was actually pleasant but from the third it all went downhill extremely from the third day i stayed nights i had a group of boys staying on the same floor as me their rooms were spaced out on the floor one or two at the side of me and another down the hall they used to get ready to head out i guessing to party around in the night so for a good hours i could just hear them walking in and out of each others rooms doors slamming loud talking in the corridor the sound proofing is appalling they even used to open the back windows and talk and move stuff around in the room this used to go on till about and restart when they got back in around called the reception the first night this happened the person at the desk visily said he would look into it and the noise did get toned down but the group also did head out for the night so i manged to get some second night the same issue continued and this time it was louder so i went down to the reception the person,0
1509,i stayed here on my own and was made to feel very welcome and looked after the staff helped me with maps and the best things to see and were generally very polite and helpful the hotel and rooms are modern and very clean and the rooftop terrace is lovely,1
1510,we had a room with terrace and it was awesome the terrace was huge with table chairs and even with two sun bathing chairs room was nicely equiped and minibar and complimentary coffee products were refilled daily only negative was the aircon that blowed directly to other side of the bed even the restaurant was good only tried for dinner pool was as small as expected the location is just perfect close to everything and the area is full of lovely restaurants and coffee shops,1
1511,hotel is right there in the busy part of town everything you need is in walking distance transportation food heart of sol is just a few blocks away enough things to see and do to keep you,1
1512,stayed here for me son birthday we asked for rooms close to each other prior to our visit and the hotel were true to their word and gave us rooms opposite each other the rooms were big enough and very comfortable we had a street facing room and heard no noise at at night due to the double doors over the roof area is great with a small pool and bar very comfortable for a relaxing great with plenty recommend the nespresso bar at front of hotel snack food was great and good value for walk into the town centre is about mins and the harbour a little further we walked in and got the metro back which we found very safe even late at very enjoyable stay and would recommend hotel without hesitation,1
1513,convenient location friendly staff adequate sleeping rooms good food what more can anyone ask for this hotel is located within easy walking distance of practically anything a tourist would want to do and see and is convenient to reach other major destinations around the city by bus or taxi the hotel staff is very helpful as well as knowledgeable and their cheerful attitude makes a hotel stay comfortable and pleasant,1
1514,stayed in this hotel at the end of july for nights the hotel was clean bed was extremely comfortable and staff were very accommodating everything we asked the staff for we got breakfast was included in our stay and was very tasty and suited all dietary needs,1
1515,just home from a weeks stay at this hotel it was my wife and i first trip to barcelona and the hotel was perfect clean tidy and in a great location we were a minute walk from the placa de catalunya from here you can walk onto the tourists buses the rambla gothic quarter as well as stroll around all the shops along the passeig de hotel has a small gym but perfect for a brief session to keep on top of the tapas diet we adopted for the week however the best asset the hotel has is the rooftop terrace with loungers dip pool and bar that serves snacks and a great stay highly recommend,1
1516,positively impressed by this hotel even if the catalonia are always good room absolutely central and quite at only minutes walking from placa catalunya pool and bar on the roof could give you relaxing moment before dinner i paid in july nothing for barca,1
1517,staff was friendly fasting and check out specially the accommodation they did for us as my wife and i were celebrating our anniversary hotel was clean and location was near attractions and transportation the only bad thing that the room service is not hours,1
1518,just got back stayed from travelled with other girls for a girly weekend away could not fault the hotel clean and tidy and very comfy beds ideal hotel for the city sights takes about mins to walk from the hotel to the bottom of la rambla and mins to the beach at port olympic if you do fancy the walk its less than euro in a taxi there were a couple of stags doo but they were fine just lads having a laugh the roof top bar and pool was a very big plus especially as it was reaching degrees we loved our time and did want to come home wish we booked for a few days longer,1
1519,my partner and i stayed nights in july both in our twenties from the exterior the hotel is great but disappoints slightly once inside see pictures we arrived in our room to find a used condom on the bathroom floor the women on reception morning shift was insincere and simply told me that the cleaner would move it no genuine apology we did make a fuss complain or ask to speak to management out all the things you do want to find on your bathroom floor a used condom would be up there if we were an elderly couple or made more of a fuss i think we would have been taken more seriously rather than brushed aside the hotel pool area is lovely however the pool itself looks very unclean the hotel seems to be a popular place for large stag groups if a group is in the pool you have not got a chance of relaxing in it they can also be quite intimidating a couple of times i witnessed two groups of females leaving the pool area after being pestered by groups of drunk men the room is lined with wooden panels all of which are chipped and worn the shower curtain is inadequate water leaks all over the floor and wooden door frame making it rot the temp is good cold and we understand that aircon units are loud but this one was the loudest we have ever experienced and rattles the two main roads at,0
1520,i use this hotel for more than years and it was always a pleasure to stay there excellent location in the center of barcelona close to two metro stations nice and clean rooms good service excellent breakfast,1
1521,the hotel is in a great location close to lots of amenities restaurants bars and plenty if shops the staff were always friendly and very room was really nice i would stay here again and definatly recommend it,1
1522,excellent location clean room good service was excellent and friendly would definitely recommend close to market and many sights i from us and found this hotel one of our best on our vacation overseas,1
1523,we booked our stay with and somewhere the information got lost we booked standard room with breakfast i need my coffee in the morning but the lady in the reception was telling us no she looked down at us the breakfast is keep that in mind even if you book it may not register and off course that not her fault but there is no need to make costumers feel ridiculous really what is when you pay a night so it not about the price but the way they carrying themself the room is clean but definitely not the room was well made and good condition but if the staff can not understand basic communication with customers then you are in great loss,0
1524,really great is a big market just across the is big and very is perfect minutes walking from placa catalunya and from la buqariya are very nice,1
1526,rooms are tiny no privacy glass doors on en suite rooms very noisy can hear everything from room next door waited mins to be served at bar gave up went down the street to a supermarket bought our own drinks great restaurant next to hotel,0
1528,if you are looking for somewhere clean modern and in the center of all the action this is the place to go it is a very nice walk to a lot of restaurants and a lot of the nightlife in barcelona as well as there are a few subway stations very close the rooms are very clean a decent size we had a beautiful view of the courtyard employees are very nice and want to help you with anything,1
1529,location was the best thing about the hotel the rooms could and should have been cleaner i personally told them multiple times that there was a bad smell in the room which they totally ignored the hotel manager was extremely corteous though not the rest of the staff,0
1530,overall this is a correct place to stay the location is perfect at about minutes walk to the rambla and the surronding is nice the night live is plaisant with many small palces to stop sit and enjoy a refresment peoples living there are nice to speak with and happy to help when required as i stated in my comments about the hotel rooms are small clean and the personel is excellent,1
1532,with my son and a friend we were in barcelona to attend a football match at camp nou we spent one night at el jardi this little hotel is ideally located in barri gotic area its charming facade is overlooking typical pla√ßa sant josep a drink at the tiny bar del pi we came into the historic building we were kindly welcomed and proposed a cozy functional simple bedroom view from the balcony on the famous catalan gothic church santa maria del pi was really a short but quiet night we came down to eat something and have coffee as the breakfast room was a bit gloomy we went outside and took our caf√© and bu√±uelos at a nearby terrace looking at the city coming to life around the pine planted in the middle of pla√ßa del pi all in all we had a pleasant stay at el jardi,1
1536,we have just returned from a whirlwind stay in barcelona thoroughly enjoyed ourselves we stayed for nights and though we did spend much time in the hotel we were more than satisfied the hotel is modern with a small but pleasant reception area the young man who booked us in was very cheerful helpful our room was modern relatively spacious with a walk in shower in the bathroom open double wardrobe in the main bedroom area the hotel is about mins walk from laccuna metro station about a min walk to the beach if you turn right out of the hotel and walk for mins until you get to a cross roads there is a tree lined avenue full of bars cafes restaurants with lots of people milling around lovely to see lots of choice if you want to stay near the beach but still within easy striking distance of the centre than hotel is a good shout,1
1537,great hotel great room it clean and roomy in a great location where you can connect easily to all parts of the city service is friendly and lots of things to do nearby recommended for a tourist stay in barcelona,1
1538,i had a great time here the hotel is very nice super clean good service and it in the perfect location the area is great with tasty bakeries nice bars and restaurants and a metro station right across the street from the hotel,1
1541,this is a pleasant clean hotel with a great location we always choose our hotels for location and this delivered although just a star hotel we could not have asked for a better location it was perfect clean had a swimming pool and served a reasonable breakfast included in our rate all staff were friendly and extremely helpful we emailed ahead with some and they came back immediately helping in every way possible our room was great we had the top floor with a large balcony comprising sun loungers tables and chairs all with a roof top view could not have asked for more the room and bathroom was modern with a huge bed and exceptionally clean we would advise anyone to read the blurb on the hotel as tea and coffe was not supplied in the room however this was not a problem for my coffee addict husband we took a travel kettle with us water was not supplied in the room however a supermarket close by sold bottles reasonably priced there is no concierge however the reception staff are on hand to answer any questions about this city we purchased the open top bus tour through the hotel saving us a couple of euros there is no entertainment here just a bar with little atmosphere buy hey you are in the heart of barcelona go out into this beautiful city and embrace it it right on your door step we enjoyed our stay here and would not hesitate,1
1542,granted this place is clean and in a good location however this is where the positives walls are paper thin so we can at this moment hear the couple on one side of us having a conversation and the cleaner vigorously cleaning the room and possibly rearranging the furniture on the other every time our neighbours take a morning shower at or this morning at it sounds like a waterfall is running down the wall beside our bed we can hear lights being switched on plugs being put in and out conversations tvs hangers being battered in the cupboards and people walking on the laminated flooring the hotel has a pool which attracted us in the first place but do let that entice you since it only gets sun in the morning and the loungers and swiftly taken by people who do leave them all day so no chance of using it until the sun goes down avoid at all costs if you want a good nights sleep in preparation for your busy trek around the city,0
1543,can not rate this hotel highly enough we arrived earlier than expected and was greeted with such warmth and professionalism and unexpectedly they checked us in early and with room far exceeded our expectation for comfort and space considering it a star hotel boasting large beds excellent bathroom facilities storage and dressing table we had views spanning from the sea gothic quarter placa de catalunya to montj√Øc the pool terrace was in the sun all day and the bar has the best sangria we had in our visit called us to barcelona on my business the location of the hotel and the pool facilities enabled me my wife and i to both enjoy some time together so nice to be able to use the pool and sunbathe on a break location wise it could not get any better as it is central to shops cultural attractions our favourite restaurants and bars and just one minute from the metro station whose line services all of the beach stations we will certainly stay at the hotel again if i had been checked into a room that was noisy as other reviews suggest i would have asked to move as our room was very facilities in room but the hotel is flanked by excellent coffee shops which we frequented for breakfast,1
1544,not valuable complimentary water is free only first day of stay despite you stay here for take you key card from your room despite you not allow they do clean your bed and change bed cover only pretend to do it terrible marriot experience here,0
1545,we stayed here nights in an ocean side room on the floor of those nights two were disturbed by an extremely loud concert nearby which made it impossible to sleep the first went on until am the second is still going on but it is am as i write this and the music is still playing whee if you value your rest this is not the hotel for you,0
1546,i stayed this past week at the ac hotel barcelona forum while in barcelona on business this is a great hotel the room was spacious and very clean with a great ocean view the outdoor pool and bar were great and the service was unbelievably great clio rousomoustakaki and her colleagues in guest services were incredible clio arranged great tours found tickets to visit segrada familia when there were none to be found and made several dinner reservations at the most fantastic restaurants five stars and thumbs up for this hotel i will definitely stay here again while visiting barcelona,1
1547,stayed there twice for nights on our european vacation found it very comfortable and the staff were helpful and pleasant i would really have liked to have tea and coffee facilities in the room swimming pool was lovely but was difficult to get a chair,1
1548,my wife and i arrived here around on a friday in was very got up to our room and was really impressed with what we had a standard was very bath and the best power had a city view which was beautiful at night and the hills in the could see segrada familia from our window was a lovely perfume fragrance in the reception bar was good with stunning views over both the city and the area was diagonal mar shopping were local small about min walk metro station was reached with in a fdw nice touch was the carafe of fruit and water drink and marshmellows which refreshed us on our return from being out and will most definitely stay here the beach was about walk away,1
1549,we crossed path with emirates crew members at the ac marriott forum barcelona we asked them how their stay was they said that their stay was good worth we assume that our stay was good worth as long as they stay with us at same hotel emirates has good taste and right choice where crew members can enjoy and get good value we loved swimming pool and quiet bar on the rooftop of the hotel the hotel is located next to marbella beach and forum shopping mall including grocery store of course the hotel is ideal for families big minus is not reliable computer center where business center is located on ground floor at ac marriott forum barcelona there is forever problem with computers and internet however our stay was good worth anyway,1
1550,stayed with family for a recent conference hotel is perfect for a business traveler to barcelona with a family it ok if this were our first visit to barcelona we would be disappointed with the location as it is far outside the center however the links to public transport are excellent staff was very good,1
1551,this hotel is good for price and near all kinds of shopping and stores and a big mall loved the staff and they were so helpfull and friendly not the closst to city center but buses and metros are easy to you,1
1552,we arrived on a sunday to a very busy lobby but irene and silvia at the front desk never lost their smile they helped us throughout our whole stay and were knowledgeable friendly and efficient they truly made our stay that much more memorable thank you the hotel is clean and modern with fast elevators comfy beds and a great pool a bit small but really cool the only negative is that the location is a bit far from the rest of the city but at least you are across the street from a mall and the tram also not far from the beach,1
1553,as a very seasoned global traveler i would highly recommend the ac hotel barcelona forum marriott hotel because of the excellent service attentive staff perfect location and comfortable traveled to barcelona for business and found an absolute jewel in the ac hotel barcelona forum the location was exceptionally convenient we had a professional conference at the convention center which is next to the ac hotel barcelona easy walking distance to the metro the metro underground subway is very easy to navigate very clean air conditioned and staff are available to assist if you need help passengers are also a great source for help the people of barcelona are so helpful buy a multiday pass at the barcelona airport or at the metro rooms are clean clean clean the hotel staff are friendly and incredibly efficient we appreciate the staff for their pride in keeping the rooms at the end of a long or hot day take a quick dip in the pool there are poolside loungers tables and more tables inside the restaurant the hotel can provide pool towels and the staff are very attentive enjoy a drink poolside the view is absolutely beautiful across the street is the diagonal mall lots of shopping food choices and good restaurants asian italian spanish we enjoyed an evening of tapas and paella which were very tasty and reasonably priced a grocery story is located inside the diagonal mall get some bread wine cheese a bit of prosciutto and fruit for your hotel,1
1554,we were in barcelona the first time for a family vacation and stayed the first part of our trip in a very nice airb b in the city and had always planned to stay in a hotel for a couple of days we also had planned to use our marriott reward points by the time we got around to booking at the last minute the available marriotts in the area we limited and the points required for the ac forum seem reasonable i called them directly and the staff was very friendly and accommodating in the phone and we book two references for rooms the booked them both on the seaside and because i a marriott gold rewards member i got upgraded to a junior executive suite both rooms were outstanding the view is spectacular right on the mediterranean the staff could not have been more helpful we spent time at a beach nearby and a subway stop is nearby so we were easily able to get to the center city and attractions we enjoyed it so much we stayed several days longer with a deal of paying half and redeeming half the points that would be required for a full point redemption stay i sure there are more highly appointed or centrally located marriott in barcelona but staying right on the beach coast with access to nice restaurants and close by train subway transport the spacious rooms and the helpful staff we will stay there if we ever are,1
1557,a nice hotel to stay in when on business trip amazing location close to diagonal mare mall rooms are clean comfortable bed u might hear a bit on street noise if you are at lower are very friendly and had the chance to dine at the hotel as i was enjoyed food outdoor in such beautiful city at the best weather,1
1559,this hotel is highly recommended by me we stayed for two nights and it was a perfect location for us we wanted to be close to the beach and we certainly were a short walk to the beach front with beach bars and restaurants when we wanted to explore more of the city we were spoilt for choice with transport trams metros and taxis all close by however we chose to use the barcelona city tour bus where a stop was just outside the hotel the rooms were clean and modern and the staff were very friendly and helpful thank you for a fantastic short trip ac hotel barcelona,1
1560,we stayed at this hotel back in april for nights we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here our room had a sea view the room was reasonably sized and spotless the staff were welcoming attentive and helpful the restaurant was ideal to grab a bite to eat or even just to enjoy a drink with quite a good view of the city the pool and terrace area were absolutely stunning a really peaceful place to unwind and relax my only quibble about this hotel would be that it a little way from the centre however the metro stop is only a five minute walk away and the route stops at key places in the city including barceloneta and passeig de garcia all in all we really enjoyed our stay here,1
1561,we went to this hotel to spend my nieces birthday which was on the august the receptionist was very friendly and nice also very rooms were very nice very comfortable with large single beds a well stocked mini bar bathroom had hair dryer very powerful shower and complimentary comb tissues and shoe shine clean towels every day also beds mad every day and rooms cleaned it had a large screen tv unfortunately there were no english speaking channels at all not that i stayed in purposely to watch tv area on the thirteenth floor was lovely very clean the bar closed at every night drinks at the hotel are expensive a word of warning to everyone and i can not stress enough that this has in no way shape or form got anything to do with the hotel please please be aware of pick pockets on the first night there my nieces and there friend just went outside of the hotel to have a cigarette and some low life actually grabbed my nieces watch from off her wrist so please all be very very careful in what jewellery you are wearing and please bags and wallets keep a very tight hold of hotel security was very good he was so very angry with what had in all an excellent stay at this hotel plus you know it a good hotel when to coach loads of airline cabin crew and the pilots stay at this hotel,1
1563,excellent hotel good facilities rooftop pool brilliant all staff polite and friendly no complaints only downside is hotel a little out of the city centre but metro stop across the road which we used constantly i would indicate location average which the markers below wont let me do,1
1564,the location is very good close to the subway clot always a taxi ariuns if you want to move around quicky good restaurants in the neighbourhood for breakfast you can go to glow bar small but delicious breakfast,1
1565,stayed here for nights july upon arrival check in was busy and slight trouble finding our booking think this was due to a name change we was given any information about the area or a map after checking into our room which was very nice we went out after asking at reception for a map they still failed to give any information or mark on the map where the hotel was which would have been very helpful we found the bus stop right outside and found that the bus number takes you to the shopping area and to the las ramblas last bus stop to get off at and it costs each it also easy to get a taxi and the metro stop is across the road from the hotel upon returning to the hotel in the evening we enjoyed a drink in the nice bar area then went to our room the guests staying opposite to our room were unfortunately very noisey slamming doors and screaming other guests were coming out to them and the hotel staff did tell them but this did continue for some time no consideration for the other guests staying in the hotel totally unacceptable behaviour the beds were comfortable the rooms were comfortable and clean there is free wifi housekeeping provided a good service the buffet breakfast provided a good choice on our last day we did have time to go out so we used the rooftop pool on the th floor there was,1
1566,stayed for two nights at the hotel it is close to all public transport which means you are only minutes from all tourist attractions and city centre hotel was very clean in all areas and had everything you need,1
1567,i was going to miss my breakfast as i had to check out early by however the kitchen and reception guys made a picnic basket which we had it at the airport very satisfying experience we will opt to return soon,1
1568,got a great deal for four nights at this hotel it is a little out of the way but the subway is just over the road and the main attractions really do take long to get to the rooms were spacious with amazing air con we used the gym a few times and it was great did eat at the hotel but the menu looked delicious reception staff were really friendly and helpful too i asked about the best way to get to the airport early and they booked a taxi for me would definitely stay here again,1
1569,fab hotel as you walk into reception you are struck by the cool air con a relief from the heat and a spa style aroma reception staff are friendly and professional the hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms spacious and the beds very comfortable we did book breakfast initially but were offered it for at checkin a saving of and the breakfasts were well worth it huge buffet style of hot and cold fruit cereal veg meats cheese eggs breads etc catering for special diets also the rooftop pool is small but big enough to cool off in and offers amazing degree views of the city the spa contains a pool with jacuzzi and a steam room there is also a small gym spa treatments are available if you want a little pampering a little expensive but what the hell it only money a great nearby restaurant for dinner is el clot,1
1570,stayed here in july on a city break to barcelona hotel is in a good location with train station from airport just opposite and metro also there for travelling around the city pleasant and helpful staff would highly recommend,1
1573,first it challenging to find a room for a family of this hotel provided a large size room with a large bathroom hotel was clean and for a bit more provided a really nice breakfast is provided and the location is wonderful it was a euro taxi ride from the airport and euros to the cruise port from this hotel you might think you can walk to your ship but trust you ca restaurants shops and a large open air market were within easy walking distance as was the flamenco cordobes in addition we were able to walk to our meeting spots for our tours some say it is noisy we had a room facing las ramblas i opened the windows stepped on the balcony and soaked in the exciting atmosphere staff let us store our luggage until our and even offered a if needed before there is a small elevator and helpful front desk staff i would definitely stay there again with my family,1
1574,this hotel has just about everything from a medium priced faultless location right on and restaurants everywhere you look and great buffet were relatively basic but very clean and adequate what more do you want when visiting barcelona as there is so much to see rather than sitting in your hotel room wifi was not very good and did not connect for us at all during our nights hey so what we had a ramblas room with balcony very small which opened directly onto the ramblas however rooms were quiet and after long days walking and a few drinks any low level noise did not keep us awake conditioning worked well in deg temperatures and friendly metro station just a minute walk awaybarcelona is such a wonderful place to visit our time and this hotel could not be faulted at all and would stay here should we visit we got the best deal by booking directly with the hotel,1
1575,we were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend this to anyone looking to stay right on la ramblas staff was polite and professional and the room was good we paid for the breakfast and it was an excellent value with good service and good booked a small interior room and got a small interior room the bathroom was relatively modern the furniture was in good shape the only minor complaints i have were there were too few electrical outlets available in the room one in the sleeping area and one in the bathroom the ac was a little weak but did function and cooled the room when given a long time i went out and bought a fan though,1
1578,great location rooms at back clean cleaning staff seemed to take a genuine pride perhaps motivated by wall mural of cleaning staff air conditioning worked well shower was excellent breakfast was really good layout was great and variety of foods available serving staff were great attentive when needed but not in your face,1
1579,this hotel was a great choice apparently taxi drivers frequently strike there so having a central location where i could walk everywhere was a life saver the view from my room of las ramblas was great if a bit noisy breakfast was terrific it a bit dated but overall a great hotel,1
1581,in a hotel waited two hours for my booked room got him and he was dirty not enough the reading lamp was destroyed and i feared an electric shock next thing i booked a comfort room and the porter said comfort is the same as standard lost money i think at least remember hours every porter want a copy of my credit card whats going on well i think therme is more to come,0
1582,spent a week in this hotel whilst attending a nearby conference it is a bit out from the main buzz of las ramblas but easily accessible by tram that stops outside the euros by hotel is outstanding rooms airy and very clean with good air conditioning the staff were all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was outstanding the beach is minutes walk away the rooftop pool ideal after a hard day and there were several good eating places a few minutes walk would definitely stay again,1
1583,stayed here to be close enough but not right in the city center as it was my gf bday they upgraded us to an exec room and suite access get this if you can free bar and food in there with private lounge and outside area which was a great start to the trip sea view room was nice and comfortable all in all pretty comfortable and as we were out and about so much was perfect for what we needed pool area is a little bit small but only here for days so we were there for long enough to be an issue also want to say thanks for the bottle of champagne that was delivered with a birthday card a real nice touch from the hotel would recommend and i am back in nov for business so will be trying to get booked in here again,1
1584,we had been looking forward to a short stay in barcelona and picked this hotel due to the modernist architecture which did not disappoint however it was missing the touches you would expect in a good three star hotel and decent four star service was slow from waiting to be seated at breakfast to replacing faulty swipe cards and failure to replace pool towels for afternoon arrivals the worst evidence of the complete lack of focus on the customer was that despite reporting a faulty lock which allowed us to have interconnecting rooms with our children this was not fixed and we spent an uncomfortable night listening out to ensure they were ok this could be a great hotel but sadly just scrapes into the mediocre category we stayed in far better barcelona hotels it a miss and spend your euros elsewhere,0
1585,this hotel is not at the centre of barcelona but if you are confident on the metro the stop is just across the road and is good value and easy to is the beach a short stroll away beautiful beach cafes with delicious food cocktails go down a were upgraded to use the floor which was very nice snacks and a drink late afternoon before heading out laterfor the evening looking out to sea was very did have the hotel buffet breakfast at we chose instead to use the small cafe just across the road great staff good of the staff at the hotel were exceptional the man who took our luggage to the cupboard until needed was so helpful as were the reception disappointment was the bar we decided to have an evening testing it out a great shame poor staff several disgruntled guests we waited so long for our drinks we got our money back and moved this would not deter me from returning to this hotel the room was excellent we had a superb break,1
1587,this hotel is a family oriented hotel close to public transportation and places to eat however it is not a five minute walking to the beach like they advertise the breakfast was ok the pool was beautiful but the water was beyond cold it felt like you were in a freezer,1
1589,night stay although not the closest to the city the metro line literally mins walk away meant getting around was easy as it was a great line to be on add to that you are so close to the beach a great shopping center and convenient for driving north if you have a car missing the city traffic check in was delayed by hour and because of that they gave us access to exec lounge and spa for entire stay which made up for it pool is great a little cold but refreshing rooms are large and very dark so easy to sleep bed is comfortable the breakfast buffet is one of the best i have ever had for quality and choice it costs euro each so if you can get it cheaper by including it in package when you book i would recommend there are too many other breakfast options around the area staff very helpful,1
1590,i passed nights in this hotel closed to the city centre and to the beaches this hotel is nice and well equipped the breakfast is continental and respond to my needs only remarks for the rooftop which could be privatised for a day and not accessible to the recommend,1
1592,we paid for the upgrade to include the executive lounge which was not very executive at all in fact pretty shocking throughout and very poorly managed it was clear there was no management oversight from an operations perspective and the hotel have clearly cut back on the staffing of this area at one point in the day there were no glasses to pour any drinks into no ice fridges were poorly stocked up and nothing was faced up or presented well and many of the plates were dirty the toilet door lock was broken the place was filthy inside and out with used glasses and food debris everywhere and children were just helping themselves with no supervision which surprised me as technically these children had unsupervised access to alcohol i thought this level was over there was little or no food available at the key walk in times like this was repeated in the afternoon this is the year staying at this hotel and the executive lounge facility was the reason i booked the hotel but over the last couple of years it seems to have gone downhill and has got progressively worse i thought last year poor service was a one off but it was poor for the two days i stayed there this year it is the last time i would consider upgrading for the executive lounge in future and may actually not book there at all next year i did complain to reception but there was no,0
1593,fantastic place fantastic people fantastic rooftop bartender all star place the theme and the deco is really fantastic live the room the headshower really cool rooftop chill place with really fantastic bartender doing super tasty food at great value just at the spot keep on the good work,1
1594,very good location only walk from ramblas but quiet reception staff always polite and helpful really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back huge variety of cafes bars and restaurants within easy walking distance,1
1595,stayed here for nights at end of july and were extremely happy with this hotel on arrival the receptionist was extremely friendly and gave us a map which she then proceeded to draw the bus stops best places to visit etc so that we knew where we were going the hotel rooms are basic but very nice the bathrooms are split with a curtain from the main bedroom but the toilet is separated by a proper door for privacy the beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms do have air con the roof bar is lovely and has space for sunbathing as well as drinks deals every evening bartender sofia was fantastic close to las ramblas and metro stations definitely visit again,1
1596,an old theatre converted for hotel accomodation in central barcelona was a real find on arrival we were offered an upgrade to one of their musical theatre themed roooms westside story lion king les miserable phantom of the opera or selected westside room was decorated with unique theatrical wall paper pictures murals and decor that matched the musical film was great enjoyed our stay the rooftop bar and breakfast room all of which were very good special call out to mohammed who looked after us with evening drinks at the rooftop bar excellent the staff were very welcoming and location of the hotel was excellent close to port vell restaurants and la rambla,1
1597,the hotel is ideally located near the quarters of the city making it a perfectly central location to most key tourist locations min walk from the metro min walk to la rambla and min bus ride to the beach myself and friends arrived for our first girls holiday to barcelona and were welcomed with a friendly reception as we entered the quirky hotel with little idea of how far we were from the tourist attractions we planned to visit the receptionist whipped out a map and gave a swift and detailed summary of our closest metro stations most accessible bus services and even the advised us on some of the attractions we planned to visit the rooms we booked two doubles were clean spacious and extremely comfortable we seen on the website that only a mesh curtain separated the bathroom from the bedroom and as we were sharing between friends we figured this would have been a bit intimate however there was also a white curtain which could be drawn for privacy the loo had its own private room as well thankfully i have to say the beds were absolutely incredible so comfortable which was a dream to come back to after our long out we spend a few afternoons and evenings on the spacious and modern rooftop area enjoying the fantastic cocktails and soaking up the sunshine when we were a bit too tired to head down to the beach overall i highly recommmend the hotel we received a,1
1598,a really nice hotel in a great spot the pool is the icing on the cake such a nice spot to relax with a beer the rooms are really clean and modern staff are extremely helpful too and have great local knowledge,1
1599,can not put into words how fantastic the service was the bar staff were so friendly and could do enough for you the reception staff are extremely helpful and informative the hotel itself is amazing lovely decor and spotlessly clean the rooftop pool is the best way to spend the afternoon after seeing the tourist hotspots this is truly one of the best hotels i have stayed in hopefully i will be returning next year,1
1600,as regular travelers to barca we had the b hotel on our radar for some time the rooftop infinity pool and bar the perfect location in plaza espana great if you are making your own way from the airport and the obvious funky vibe and great design well we were disappointed we stayed for my birthday at the end of june and we had a fabulous time the rooms are modern and cool with tea and coffee and nice modern bathrooms and great communal areas but above all the staff make the place extra special the reception staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the bar staff at the fantastic rooftop are brilliant fun i was very touched to find a lovely card and bottle of cava waiting for me in the room on my birthday and the fun continued by the pool with family and friends later ca recommend the b hotel enough and my daughter has booked to go there later on in august if you want a quality hotel great terrace pool food and a bar look no further,1
1601,i am writing this review to thank the staff for their outstanding service from the moment we arrived until we left the service was prompt thorough and the complimentary champagne to assisting in sorting out our trips around barcelona to the arrangements for a quick exit and taxi on the morning of our departure i would like to make special mention of marianne who did a brilliant job for my wife and i during our stay she and b hotel get a b for brilliant thank you dave and manuela dennis,1
1602,you made me feel very welcome and surprised me for my birthday the rooftop pool was amazing even though it was sunny all the time javier the bartender was very kind and made great cocktails hasta luego see you soon,1
1603,we really enjoyed our stay at the staff is really friendly and gave us directions where to find everything the room is modern clean and spacious nothing can top the rooftop though the infinity pool was bigger than expected the only downsides to our room were the shower which is nice but the bathroom is very open so it kind of flooded one time the plug connection which is on the other side of the night table small detail and the hotel is located to a big busy street so it can be a little bit rumourous at night but totally did disturb us those are small details though i would definitely stay here again as the room was clean every day and the staff was always in a good mood it also located well next to shopping centre arenas and of course plaza espanya where you can take the metro to basically anywhere,1
1604,lovely hotel staff the pool is perfect and the staff sent up a bottle of champs as it was my birthday during our stay very thoughtful would defiantly stay at on our next visit the location is perfect as in the middle of all the main attractions,1
1605,we had a very nice night stay earlier this month and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel the staff were helpful the subway stop was metres away and there were restaurants nearby if you did feel like making a track to somewhere new there was a minor error with the time that we wanted our room cleaned by but they made it up to us with a very nice note and a bottle of champagne very attentive and very concerned about their image of course the hotel was clean modern and the pool area was a great place to go after a long hot day trekking around barcelona my only complaint is one that is common in european hotels there just needs to be more places to plug equipment in today people travel with so many pieces of equipment that need to be recharged at the end of the day and with only one or two available receptacles and given the inconvenient european electrical receptacle design it just hard to get everything recharged for the next day for any traveler i suggest that you take a american plug to plug into your european receptacle converter this is not really a criticism of the hotel as this place was great,1
1606,we stayed in this hotel for nights in july the location was great right by the plasa de espania close to metro buses shopping barcelona city tour bus stops and many other attractions the design of the hotel is very modern and i would say urban our room was very spacious with multiple lighting options the view from the window was that great it looked at the back buildings but we did really care since we would come back late at night and go to sleep the bathroom was really stylish the best part of the hotel was the roof top infinity pool though the view is breathtaking you can see monjuic mountain and the whole plasa de espania the staff were very helpful and they all spoke very good english,1
1607,fantastic view from the rooftop great cocktails we had prices vary for what cocktails you have floor of great view of pool and plenty of loungers and tables great to see sunset from close to metro,1
1608,the room and facilities at the b hotel barcelona were excellent as were the staff in particular the bar staff and front of house staff all were friendly and helpful especially javier at the pool bar who always added a dash of fun to his cocktails,1
1609,we were recommended the hotel by an extremely fussy member of my family she was right to persuade us to room we had one of the upgraded rooms was large clean and comfortable a bonus was being able to open the and slide the external the staff from reception breakfast waiter bar staff and cleaners were all polite and was excellent not a wide range of cooked food but everything was extremely fresh loads of fruit hams and cheeses as well as cakes and other items i more used to seeing on a dessert for the roof top pool amazing well situated for buses and metro shopping centre with restaurants next to hotel make sure you walk up to the national museum of art and walk around the olympic park and criticism was the lighting system in the rooms which you almost need a degree to operate nothing wrong with a simple light switch especially in the place to stay great value,1
1610,i stayed here for a week with my girlfriend the pool bar is great and the pool even though small is a nice touch on the rooftop you not use it for swimming but it great to cool off rooms are but nothing special not much choice on the tv if you wanting english having said that who wants to spend time in the room location is pretty good there are plenty of cafes and restaurants close by it about a min walk to the main area but only a few minute walk to the us parking underground but be aware that any large wide car may have difficultly staff are really friendly and helpful i shall certainly be back next year when in barcelona,1
1611,great hotel clean and modern rooms excellent staff especially at the pool bar location is a little out of town but with excellent transport links this is a problem and there is plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep,1
1612,very pleased with our stay at the catalonia rigoletto hotel the staff were very helpful and took care of us throughout our stay the room was very nice and clean the breakfast had a good variation and everything was fresh located in a very safe area with the maria cristina metro being only a few hundred metres surely recommend should you be visiting barcelona,1
1613,it was great stay and really nice service the support at reception was great the room was agreable and what a great sleep quality it is great to be in this part of city and enjoy the entire barcelona,1
1614,it was a great experience service people location everything was my room was always clean every thing was replenished every day whenever i needed something i just had to call the servicedesk the room service was good too,1
1615,it was an amazing hotel comfortable beds and silent staff members were kind and highly recommend this hotel even if it is not central it s closer to the underground,1
1616,the hotel is in a good position some minute walk from the underground green line it reaches the main touristic area the room is clean with a big bathroom and a very big shower breakfast was very staff is very nice,1
1617,gustavo at the reception gave me a very beautiful room with a nice view and he was so kind and helpful i really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will recommend it to my friends as well this hotel is not located in the heart of the city but there are lots of public transportation systems near the property like metro and bus which you can use to reach every district you were some problems with the cold water in the bathroom but this issue did affect my good experience at this hotel,1
1618,the rooms were very nice the staff were really kind and professional good cleaningservice and nice pool only improvement would be the gym we would preferably some free weights there will definately return,1
1619,the value price balance was so poor room was too small the problem with cold water could be solved in short notice there was no sense of urgency for solving the problem the location of the hotel was quite good,0
1620,stayed here with my girlfriend for our birthdays days apart i had emailed the hotel a week before we arrived to ask to put some decorations up for her birthday the day we arrived the hotel were more than happy to do this and they had arranged for balloons chocolates and even some wine it was a brilliant touch the rooftop pool was a lovely area nice and quiet for when you wanted to chill staff were so friendly and they could do enough for you the rooms were spotless every day and the bed was the comfiest bed we ever slept in unbelievable very close to the nou camp just a short walk through a lovely park and public transport is easily accessible with a tram stop not far from the hotel and taxi parked right outside the hotel when checking out the staff at reception noticed it was my birthday and offered us a free breakfast unfortunately we had an early flight to catch but we appreciated the will definitely be returning soon this time we be visiting the camp nou for a game,1
1621,we booked our stay well before there were any reviews or pictures from guests on tripadvisor and felt we went out on short our stay was fantastic the room was cozy and equipped with anything one could hope for the breakfast buffet was very high quality and constantly kept fresh and was friendly and attentive a very special thanks to hector who upon our arrival took som extra time to mark locations of restaurants and landmarks on a map for gladly visit again some other time,1
1623,stayed nights enjoyed the quality facility it a limited service hotel that how they can get the rate lower with such a high quality facility just know that what you a paying for and be prepared to fetch your own ice no bar or restaurant staff was outstanding room was outstanding location is outstanding,1
1624,be aware this hotel has two small rooms on each floor which do not have windows to the outside they have small windows that look out into a very dark small open central lobby it is our first time staying in hotel with no windows to the outside we were unlucky enough to get one of these try to sell you on their buffet breakfast euros reduced to euros if you book breakfast for the entire stay bear in mind that you can get a baguette sandwich plus a coffee for about euros from any of the little pastry shops around the hotel we did bother with their breakfast option and were glad we front desk staff is especially this one lady who works nights the only helpful person we found was maria who was very gracious and helped us with check out,0
1625,a new modern hotel with an exquisite interior centrally located just a minute walk from the pla√ßa de catalunya the hotel is served by two metro stations with lots of local pastry and convenience stores nearby reception staff where helpful and friendly with check in very easy the deluxe room was spacious and cozy well equipped with a large tv and integrated bluetooth in the room and bathroom very clean and rooms serviced daily the breakfast buffet was simple but flavoursome with something for everyone best of all its open from to midday overall a lovely modern hotel centrally located and great value for money it must be noted if you book a specified room type or double via an external website contact the hotel direct to confirm your request to avoid disappointment,1
1626,two very tired teachers stayed here recently july as a quick break away to start of the summer holidays the hotel could not have been better fab location min walk to the main square with help from the very friendly hotel staff who were on hand everyday sorry to tell us the best places to visits and what to do in barcelona our room was cleaned everyday and was very modern and ideal for us we never wanted to leave thank you to all the staff for your help and guidance we had the best holiday love katie and priya x,1
1627,spent one night here before heading home friendly staff comfortable and spacious room great toiletries good shower gym could be better love the location close to plaza de catalu√±a which means easy airport transport i would definitely stay here again,1
1628,small and boutique hotel urban chic design mix of dark grey and exposed concrete walls subtle lighting modern furniture complete with a dummy of a tattooed woman in a yoga position in the reception to add to the boutique feel bedrooms are well equipped in the same dark wood urban style bathrooms are spacious with a good range of upmarket toiletries big walk in shower small gym in basement and a small pool not big enough for swimming and a few loungers on the roof terrace with bar facilities not manned excellent buffet breakfast good range and great quality highly recommended just a shame there are building works next door sound of drilling work me up though it was,1
1629,wow a great hotel if you are looking for somewhere smart but not in an ostentatious way then this is the hotel for you tucked away from the hustle and bustle but not too far to walk in what we would describe as a trendy up and coming area modern quirky and a great place to stay we loved the feel of the hotel right from stepping of the pavement friendly accommodating staff who spoke good english sorry our spanish was so bad just the type of place you would want to be seen in a lovely room with an amazing shower that i need in my life for days of the year not the we stayed a hand written note welcoming us on arrival the latest edition of a glossy fashion magazine to read on the desk bluetooth speakers comfortable beds controllable air conditioning great lighting a good choice of products for all those things you forgot to pack good quality towels and linen lots of considered touches that we enjoyed we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends we are now looking to stay at another hotel in the chain for our next break good value for money too we had a great stay thank you,1
1631,great hotel staff is very friendly and helpfull good breakfeast and beautiful rooms hotel is situated in raval away from the tourists and between the real people of barcelona located minutes from the rambla subway and drassanes,1
1632,lovely hotel in perfect location it was perfect for me for the weekend away the only thing was there was no bedside table which is nice to have but overall loved it it was clean and big enough for ppl,1
1633,we stayed at this hotel only night before catching a cruise we choose it because of its location near to the center so we can go out for dinner and walk along the rambles without having to go to the hotel by taxi ou metro anf the entrance to the cruise terminal a few steps away next to the statue of the colombo the hotel is very jovial and different but had everything we needed our room had no view but we did not mind the breakfast had the possibility of being taken in a pleasant open air area without a doubt if you need to stay in barcelona for a short stay i recomend to book this hotel,1
1635,we always stay here when in barcelona and love it the beds are extremely comfortable and the room spotless our only problem was on monday july when the breakfast service was not up to the usual excellent standard we went down at and already there was no bacon or sausages and hardly any cold milk the waitress seemed more keen on rearranging the food already there and came into the dining room to make a hot drink for herself then walked out again another diner asked for the hot food to be refilled and when our son went for sausages they were ice cold as if straight from the fridge and had not been heated but were put into the warming tray which is a food safety issue,1
1636,i was here only one night but it was perfect right off la rambla yet really quiet the room was squeaky clean and the staff very helpful the breakfast was definitely worth it a large variety of pastries and hot food bacon eggs i totally recommend it and will probably stay there again,1
1637,what a great old world style hotel we booked a room with a balcony and spent quite a bit of time watching the people pass below but when you closed the windows the sounds of the narrow street faded away we enjoyed the location easy walk to the beach with all of barrio gotic to explore in between the staff was perfectly helpful not necessary to get the included breakfast because there are so many options nearby we would love to return i hope we can someday,1
1638,has great character clean comfortable and great locationin barri gothic but not too is great feature for upper levelsbreakfast wad greati highly recommend this hotelwould be amazing if it had a bar,1
1640,any problem reported was resolved quickly and for that special thanks to cornelia the romanian lady at the reception which has been very professional smiling and kind great hotel very clean cool situated next door to shopping center supermercato restautants with good prices minutes walk away to metro and then you can go everywhere in barcelona very nice welcoming fresh water in the lobby with mint and ice note write by hand in the room classy,1
1641,great location accessible to major hubs buses metros as well walking distance to the heart of barcelona city centre hotel room was nice spacious and quiet front desk staffs were really cheerful knowledgeable and helpful restaurant menus breakfasts were adequately convenient an upgrade to coffee maker is recommended as our coffees cappuccino expresso tasted rather horrid we recommend overall,1
1643,this was a very nice hotel for our group of people our process was efficient and friendly the room and bed were both comfortable the room provides a counter with television and desk area and a small closet there was a refrigerator with four bottles of water no charge the bathroom has a basin on a small counter with a variety of provided amenities toothbrush comb the has a glass door that covers only half of the opening so it was hard to keep water from running onto the floor during a shower the shower drained very slowly but the water pressure was strong and the temperature stayed consistent the free wifi service in the room and the lobby was strong and reliable we found only one electrical outlet in the room and one in the bathroom for charging electronics but we carry our own plug strip so it was no problem we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would be glad to return in the future,1
1647,we have just returned from our day trip to barcelona had stayed here score however we will return we have stayed in other parts of the city previously found this place to feel safer more area is not really touristy yet there is a beautiful beach with nobody but us on it marina nearby the hotel is right next to the tourist bus stop tram station metro station the rooms are lovely clean the bed is massive the only thing is that when we checked out no one told us about the taxi strike that was happening that day lovely place will definitely return to this hotel,1
1648,i stayed here for nights it a really nice hotel just beside the diagonal mar shopping center and a walking distance to the beach many nice places to eat around and the tourist bus stop is just in front of the hotel the hotel also provides sales of the bus ticket the bus tour is a must do in barcelona it makes going to places a lot easier the hotel also has nice swimming pools although i did get to use it cause i had so a little time in barcelona i would definitely be back to this hotel,1
1649,for any negative comment i could find about this hotel there is a much bigger positive to overshadow it i am in a unique position for this review as i stayed in the basic double room and the master room spacious clean and floods with natural sunlight the blackout and privacy blinds are fantastic allowing you at have a good sleep in a comfy bed the free minibar is limited but it is free after all the shower is fantastic great water pressure and has therapeutic jets for a refreshing feel we did have a flooding issue but within of reporting it it had been fixated cleaned and they had brought us champagne and chocolates as an apology fantastic customer suite we decided as we were having such a good stay and it was our anniversary we would upgrade to the master suite for one night it was a bit odd that the first time i asked about this i was told it would be when i went to book it was actually the suite is lovely loads of space and a confy sofa to relax on the views are phenomenal both during the days and in the evening you can see over the the hotel showed their customer service by bringing us complementary champagne and strawberries for our anniversary the hot tub is also a great addition to your private terrace and sun loungers the only gripe is that whilst we were in the hot tub approximately two cleaners,1
1650,put simply this is a great hotel the rooms are very well decorated and clean and the bathroom etc is very well kitted was the comfiest and biggest bed i ever slept on and the free mini bar in the room is an added bonus would definitely stay there again if i ever visit barcelona again,1
1651,recently stayed at the hotel for nights could not fault the hotel great modern rooms equipped nice gift of toiletries loads facilities bars limited menus but sufficient for snacks only downside for us was a music event on nights at the forum behind the hotel this led to sleepless nights as could hear music from hotel otherwise good stay breakfast was great,1
1652,stayed here on a day break for my bday lovely hotel clean and friendly staff stayed on floor with stunning views over the city hotel surprised me with champagne and cake which was a nice treat hotel is a good distance from ramblas and will cost between in a taxi which will get expensive if you use it a lot metro and public transport is right outside so good to get into places only downside was we had a leak from upstairs toilet blockage leaking through our ceiling which was dealt with asap by hotel staff the lifts in hotel are painfully slow when its busy but apart from that it a lovely place i would visit again ps from airport to hotel,1
1653,i really loved that hotel the service was great in all parts of the hotel really friendly staff the hotel itself is nice an modern rooms are spacious with sexy bathrooms the blinds were great and made the room dark included mini bar was great as well location is great besides a mall and the beach easy to walk around and find great food as well great hotel,1
1655,excellent service attentive and friendly staff spacious modern rooms and delicious breakfast we came as a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend i received an excellent assistance in preparation of the bday extras we received a free upgrade to a room on a higher floor with a view over the whole city where everything was perfectly arranged upon our hotel is located towards the northern end of the city next to a big shopping centre and perfectly connected with the city centre bus and metro stops are just around the corner taxi from el prat airport was less than eur on a saturday evening personally did not experience any noise and sleep disruption on the contrary but there were no events at forum during our rooms are spacious the beds gigantic and comfortable there is a free mini bar refilled daily and bathrobes and slippers are buffet is rich and lifts indeed take ages sometimes if you are in a hurry on a business trip it might be an issue but for us spending a relaxed and fun weekend it was not really cumbersome with special thanks to marina we be back and will certainly recommend to others,1
1656,yes the hotel is a little outside central or gothic quarters but all we use it for is sleep and security it is also a cheap option to be close to the beach about a minute are limited food options around because they close the kitchens early it minibar is included which was nice however if you book the hotel via expedia or orbitz be careful to see if breakfast is included for us it was not which was a little also loan mifi out for the day at euros nice little extra if you are going to be out all day the hop on hop off bus stops at the hotel and the metro is a block out very coinvenieant,1
1657,i stayed at melia sky for one night and it was completely worth it the room was very spacious and comfortable with an amazing view over the city the service was impeccable from the front desk to the restaurant i am allergic to gluten and at the time that i wanted to eat the full menu was not available when the waiters learned about my allergy they made an exception and i was available to enjoy my grilled vegetables which were great the pool club is great with many sun chairs and cabanas it is the only place where the service was however as the ladies seem to be completely lost my only drawback and it quite a big one is that the room door is not and same goes with the walls meaning that housekeeping woke me up in the morning and above all i was woken up by my neighbors during their midnight tryst so not optimal the hotel is located away from the city centre close to the beach and close to public transport it is a new building and public areas are i would definitely come back but would ask for a quiet room,1
1658,personal tries its best to provide that bit extra that makes you feel welcome they succeeded bed and breakfast is awesome bar and restaurant are modern and personal gives honest advise when asked go there again,1
1659,i was taken to barcelona as a surprise for my birthday last year the hotel was good the bed was incredibly comfortable we had the level experience which was ok but i do think worth the additional the breakfast was not very exciting and we were informed of ordering additional dishes until our last very close to the main attractions but quiet location,1
1660,myself and my partner stayed for nights for my birthday on arrival the hotel looked amazing and the staff at the check in were so helpful showing us a map of the area and the best places to go we even got a room upgrade with it being my birthday which was a nice bonus the area is so beautiful and more authentic than the centre las ramblas min walk from the beach and about min walk from the harbour where you have all the bars clubs and restaurants you also have a street full of restaurants min walk from the hotel plenty of tapas and pool area is clean and modern when we were there they hosted a party around the pool with a resident dj which was brilliant we also used the spa facilities which has a jacuzzi steam room and sauna overall brilliant stay and would recommend,1
1661,everything about this hotel is amazing the staff are wonderful as are the rooms and pool facilities it is in an excellent location within walking distance to the beach we loved it here and would definitely return,1
1662,me and my family staying here for night we wish we could stay longer but the hotel is fully occupied we experienced very good service and at the same time very bad service during joana was very helpful she showed us our options in our first night we orders room service we were very disappointed with our room service our club sandwich was missing tomatoes bacon and very little lettuce it was basically only cheese and small meat in bread our pasta was missing parmesan it our chicken sandwich was good fausto was very helpful during this issue and made us feel like proper next day we had called at times to have our room serviced returning after the beach at to find our room still very dirty was the worst part of our after we called again it still took hours to have our room clean at that time is was already maria was very helpful with delivery our ice which we waited over minutes pool staff was always in the back room therefore it was hard for us and other guests to obtain towels and order we enjoyed this hotel we want to recommend this hotel although there are a lot of device to fix it seems like the ma agents and higher staff hide in the back while getting the interns and other lower staff to complete missed jobs,1
1663,amazing poolparty with a dj that choose the perfekt music between relax and party we was feeling like in heaven the manager bruno reads all ur wishes from your lips such a nice person that really care about everythink and of course that you feel more then comfortable a big plus to the manager we will come back soon,1
1664,i been in this hotel nights with my mom the hotel very beautiful and clean the service there is very helpful and friendly with every question we had not in the center of barcelona but in very nice neighborhood with lots of nice restaurants the stuff give as great recognitions about where to go and where to eat and even how to get there,1
1665,so i was here on a conference the hotel was usefully placed right on both the tram and underground metro lines and within walking distance of where i needed to be very comfortable high tech rooms lots of glass including glass from the bedroom area to the bathroom area fine for me on my own or couples but this was a twin room and if you do have that sort of relationship with your roommate it could be awkward breakfast was absolutely stunning good enough that i really felt no need to go for the brit standard cooked breakfast i was there for days and was able to try everything nice pool area with the pool just about big enough to allow proper exercise i was put off slightly by the cool crowd who were there being beautiful on saturday afternoon alongside a dj not my scene and i felt quite uncomfortable but at other times was really very pleasant expensive bar on the top floor probably standard for hotel prices definitely stay there again the rooms breakfast and pool outside peak times make this well worth it and being slightly outside the centre was a problem with the transport links,1
1666,i visited barcelona as a treat for my year old daughter melia sky was amazing arrived late at night and had minor leak in bathroom but were immediately moved and upgraded to the level which was amazing gorgeous views and pool area reception staff were really helpful we chose it because it was a little out of centre but metro was great and lovely restaurants and shops close by would definitely go again,1
1667,room was very nice comfortable bed nice amenities like most european hotels the and power are only on if your key card is in the dock so the rooms would get extremely hot while out during the day on business and took longer than my usual liking to get back to a comfortable level for practiced business travelers no the put the business card in the dock trick does not work bar and bar staff were excellent food was very good including the breakfast buffet every morning hallways a bit dark but otherwise very nice d√©cor in the hotel beautiful views from the top floor restaurant,1
1668,this hotel is just amazing you ca fault it the pool area on a saturday has a free pool party which is good busy but a good atmosphere even the standard room is lovely they went out of their way for my boyfriends birthday food is so good and taxis from hotel are easy to come by as they have a rank outside the hotel checked in at due to flight delays and even at that time staff are so helpful and friendly no other option of hotel in barcelona this wins hands down and will be back,1
1669,lovely hotel at the marina which is an easy walk to las rambla the room was spacious clean and comfortable with great views over barcelona the hotel was quiet and has a nice rooftop bar there is also a rooftop pool however no so quite hot in the sun the hotel did lose our reservation however they handled it well and have an upgrade the only downside is there is sometimes a wait for a taxi great place to stay and would definitely return,1
1670,fully enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the euro gm hotel the location is a real asset with easy walking to la rambla or the maremagnum dazs and a short cab ride anywhere else in town both of the hop off bus options have stops right outside hotel and we took a two day pass to explore the various parts of greeted warmly at by manager and staff and our request for early had been noted we arrived in the morning and final preparations to our room were quickly done while we had a cup coffee room was fabulous with beautiful views of the marina mediterranean on one side and city on other hotel was quiet and we enjoyed restful sleep while not bearing touches the room was smartly laid out with a fabulous bathroom and was a nice size by european standards considering the price it was a fantastic value and far superior to the chain hotel options in barcelona which each have property is nicely maintained and we enjoyed the rooftop pool with additional nice views of the city and montjuic very pleased with our choice and look forward to returning to the grand marina,1
1671,we stayed here for a conference being held at adjoining convention center extremely convention center located behind the was very impressed with the hotel rooms differ in size and layout and was fortunate to have a larger room with a fabulous view to the south west looking over a harbour and a cruise ship was included in my room what a fabulous best i have seen lots of hot and cold food cheeses hams salmon eggs cakes and pastries it about a minute walk to the ramblos same to adjoining shopping center and harbor rooms were fabulously appointed and well i loved the shower with vertical streams of water as well as conventional shower a great for soaking my hot aching feet yes i do know how a bidet is meant to be used i never used the pool but it was surprisingly small according to my co is a large hotel but service friendly and helpful it conveniently located for conferences and to the city center,1
1672,returned to this hotel again and it was even better than the last time brilliant location and facilities the hotel staff are very friendly and yet not intrusive room was lovely and spacious with great views of the port,1
1673,we had a great experience here the location is near las ramblas but not right in the middle of the city chaos the city is very walkable and this was a great place to stay the first night we arrived there were food trucks that lined the promenade and we found the most delicious food there the hotel has a great bar and the breakfast had everything you could want the rooftop deck was nice but the pool is kinda small the rooms were comfortable and clean just what we wanted,1
1674,we visited barcelona for a business trip and we stayed at grand marina hotel for nights the location is perfect due that it is near the city center rambla colom barceloneta the staff has been kind and welcoming among them the director has been also very willing and,1
1675,one night after our cruise three rooms they gave us of the rooms at the morning when we arrived from the cruise ship no extra charge great service lovely lovely breakfast expensive but worth every rooms very modern but nice clean look hotel seems a bit dark inside maybe that is the look they hop on hop off bus stops directly outside the hotel by discounted tickets from reception friendly staff,1
1676,judit parera made our trip to barcelona fantastic she was our concierge at the eurostar grand hotel marina having never traveled to europe as an adult she listened to what type of vacation we enjoyed and then made recommendations that matched our interests we visited fantastic beach villages and beautiful old medieval villages with quaint shops and amazing bistros pals was our favorite judit parera truly made our visit to your hotel very memorable we stayed nights and loved the facility it was very comfortable clean and roomy the buffett breakfast was also fantastic,1
1677,stayed at this modern lovely hotel for had level rooms with breakfast at the michelin star restaurant on the hotel ever extremely friendly staff always helpful and pool area was our favored area during the day actually we leave the hotel in days due to the lovely lounge music the hotel played in the pool are as well as in the breakfast will definitely return to this hotel,1
1678,everything about our stay was perfect i did read a couple of reviews previous to visiting that were making reference to staff letting them down etc etc where they staying at the same place as me my experience of the staff from the word go was brilliant friendly helpful discreet maybe as this is my first hotel experience in europe i have the blinkers on but the hotel is so clean quiet the level lounge was always clean well stocked and a joy to be in the pool is lovely and as on the floor had a lovely breeze keeping us cool whilst baking in c heat the gratis drinks for level guests only was fantastic barca is a great city and we will definetley go back we both loved this hotel and have already recommended to work colleagues well done melia bareclona,1
1679,i have stayed in the hotel melia at regents park london and was so impressed with that i felt a spanish version would be even better i was not wrong this spanish version is the absolute most modern concept of hotel i have stayed in the rooms were superbly designed with no loss of detail in the total concept extreme modernity with extreme comfort the dinning area was superbly spacious with an unbelievable lighting design that i have never seen before the roof terrace and swimming pool were large with large open sunbathing and dinning areas and the bar there accommodated itself to all one desires a super bonus point was the underground parking all the staff we encountered were very helpful this hotel is certainly worth another visit,1
1681,our rooms were ready when we arrived the front desk staff was warm welcoming and thankfully spoke english beautifully the rooms were very comfortable and the beds were great lush towels bath robes and slippers pamper hotel itself is very beautiful the pool area looked like the place to be if you were young and in really good shape however i would not say it was very family was a great location and i would recommend this hotel and stay there again,1
1682,very nice hotel good location upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who received us very well and decided to upgrade us to a seaview the hotel claims it is star i think it deserves only stars for the following reasons furniture is run down and it needs renovation and the breakfast is really of average quality the staff were pleasant the hotel is located on a pier where many luxury cruise liners berth there is a bus line very close by that serves all the touristic main sites the nicest part of our trip was visiting barcelona its old town beaches restaurants camp nou barcelona is really one of the nicest cities in europe both for business and pleasure,1
1683,amazing hotel over looking the marina great distance to everywhere and there is also a hop on hop off bus tour that stops outside would highly recommend rooms are fabulous with amazing little tiny details that make the room staff are very friendly also,1
1684,very nice hotel good location we stayed nights before and after a cruise located very close to the embarkation deck very nice large rooms high level equipped with nice large bathroom lovely vieu to city and port very helpful nice and welcoming reception team answered guided and gave recommendations for any question delicious varied breakfast with large solutions for sugar and gluten free needs dining room staff was very helpful and generous,1
1686,great hotel with very helpful staff we had a great view on port from the enjoyed the complimentary drinks and chocolates in the room nice greatest selection of breakfast i have ever seen however the service was disappointing we had to wait for a table then tea and coffee on several occasions for longer than minutes and we ended up helping ourselves the prices in the restaurant were quite high but we have ordered the room service once and the food was really nice,1
1687,just returned from a fabulous stay at hilton diagonal mar junior suite allowed access to executive lounge where we got more than enough free food drink every evening staff especially amelia fab,1
1688,ok hotel we had the junior suite the furnitures were worn out and unfortunately quite boring room in general pool area was great but quite expensive good drinks music and personnel with top notch service the exclusive at the floor was good with free drinks and snacks all together would we come back again,1
1689,brief description spacious rooms although the beds were extremely hard i would stay here again because of its location away from the crowded city center if i were traveling with children i would choose hilton diagonal mar over barcelona hilton because of its location near the beach two playgrounds the mall across the street with a food court for fussy eaters and larger hotel description of room spacious room with partial waterfront view twin beds black out curtains safe fridge with small space for personal items electric kettle with tea two bottles of water provided per stay ice cubes near elevators no slippers no robes no usb ports marble bathroom with bathtub with detachable showerhead shower stall telephone hairdryer with outlet in bathroom space for personal toiletries next to sink peterthomasroth lounge on floor amazing views of beach and barcelona pleasant variety of food items very friendly staff five minute walk to beach to taxi fare to most attractions small pool with music on weekends everyone even hilton guests must pay for sunbeds couches and suspended lounge chairs can be enjoyed for free however great cabana massage by get a business card with the hotel address there are two hiltons in barcelona both on diagonal avenue this hilton is closer to the beach buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue disappointment buy a ticket for the hop on hop off bus to get an overview of barcelona do one route take,1
1691,since we have been to barcelona a few times in the past we decided to have just a stay prior to our cruise departure the hilton diagonal is a great hotel for such an occasion aside from the standard amenities their staff were very friendly helpful and accommodating and the breakfast food is a filler seriously if you came to barcelona go out and eat the pool area is very miami beach chic and run by an outside company of hilton so watch out for hidden fees on food and added bonus was having the diagonal galleria mall just across the street for those forgotten items that were missed in your luggage or anxious teenagers that needed some freedom the city itself was just a minute cab ride into town pending traffic or the subway system is located on the other side of the galleria mall again a good location as a,1
1692,location it is not convenient if you are interested in visiting the city center though there are taxis available just outside the hotel the cost of each trip to go to the city is between euros and euros to the airport it is close enough to a beach but the beach is very crowded and kind of dumpy its proximity to the beach should not be the reason to choose this it is close to a mall which has the advantage of a supermarket and some shops if thats your purpose staff variable service the breakfast staff was wonderful the front desk staff were not all great lilliana was pleasant but not empathetic cold and condescending she did not seem to care that much regarding the issues at hand and made no extra effort to accomodate us as guests not a people person and not someone who should be at the front desk in my opinion i came back after lilliana left maybe our issues were because it was the end of her shift and she didnt care i spoke with ettore what an absolute star he went way out of his way to accomodate us in a very full hotel trying to reorganize things to help get us into a better room though we ultimately stayed in our original room his efforts were much appreciated other staff were also extremely kind and apologized for our situation overall i generally only book with hilton for as i am a gold,0
1694,what to say this hilton is a great place to spend your time in barcelona the location is perfect well connected both to the beach and to the city centre as my stay was a work stay i enjoyed breakfast and lunch buffe with an incredible mix of choices for any taste and the well known spanish flavours the top roof is also amazing so relaxing and staff professional and kind in any occasion top rate,1
1695,it was always a great experience staff are effective and efficient well kept and maintained rooms we always wants to come back whenever we are in barcelona it perfect location close to anything you need,1
1696,this is a review for my stay with children aged and we had an excellent stay first i am a hilton member and was treated very well fantastic value for had no issue getting a complimentary roll away bed for children executive room was spacious and had great ocean views firm beds executive lounge was fantastic great out door terrace with plenty of in the main restaurant was good some servers were exceptional others could care was nice although during saturday and sunday full of trendy people but surprisingly there were two other families with was able to get complimentary pool side sun chairs with no issue menu was expensive so did not order anything i overheard service was poor odd since i saw dozens of is a public kids park next to hotel also the diagonal mall in front has a very popular play area plenty of restaurants for kids and adults plus a supermarket restaurants range from fast food to spanish and international i found them very well priced and excellent block from beach blocks from subway tram bus tourist bus i prepaid private car to airport each way taxi is depending on bags traffic is mix of business guests since it is next to convention center and plenty of tourists since it is close to beach location is not ideal for first time visit to bcn but for my family it was great due to pool parks beach mall short taxi ride to zoo the hotel is,1
1697,our stay did not match what we expected for the hilton brand at euros a night clogged shower drains that did not get fixed even after three days mold and mildew in shower stalls electrical outlets that can not hold a plug shower water gets hot and cold randomly lights go off randomly toilet leaks so flushes automatically through the night making noise toe nails clippings found on carpet did not vacuum room in between guests or ever at all,0
1698,the hotel is on the main route into the city centre and minutes away from the subway the area itself if you took a small walk heading away from the main road you will find small cafe bars and square and some quaint buildings its dusty but authentic and a lot cheaper than the city to eat the hotel had sufficient staff on the desk to help you and they spoke different languages the room was large enough and had the usual hilton facilities nice bathroom but and this is the only but i could hear my neighbours every move and it carried on until the early hours,1
1699,one of the best accommodations i have experienced good staff good food excellent view on the city from the room window pleasant stay and comfortable beds the position in the city could be better for this brand of hotel but it might be the only flaw which is not really big since it is approx euros and mins to city center,1
1700,we stayed here the night before our mediterranean cruise it a beautiful hotel great views and near restaurants and a huge mall we enjoyed the executive lounge level immensely for cocktails and snacks and breakfast easy to get a taxi from airport and also taxied to port rooms are huge clean and at the high end of hilton standard great lobby bar too with comfy seats to watch a soccer match on tvs,1
1701,the property is located in diagonal mar which is not very centrally located but everything is a bus ride away considering how small barcelona is very typical hilton stay in terms of the lobby room and facilities not feeling the beach club located in the hotel though as a hilton diamond member lounge chairs at the pool were free however the hotel could not reserve these chairs for us and we had to be present to reserve them ourselves considering how pack the club was on weekends this is nearly impossible unless of course you go down in the morning saw a couple of drunk in the hotel lobby and lift area as well certainly not something you would expect in a hilton but overall a pleasant stay,1
1704,my girlfiend and i stayed for weeks in this hotel and it was amazing we celebrares our honeymoon and the staff was so generous and breakfast zone its of very high quality the pool was clean and theres dj and music all day,1
1705,i have just checked out of the hotel and wanted to get my views about this hotel submitted before it becomes a distant of all the hiltons i have stayed at since i became a member i think this has been the worse experience things to note and out was painfully slow mins waiting each no complementary bottles of water i presume that is a hotel issue and more to do with membership levels disappointing since other hotels offer this for free to family members were staying in room and were not informed that there was going to be maintenance works going on around them resulting in them leaving the hotel to be able to relax in the family members had no fridge in their room so they could store the water they had purchase to keep hydrated again was informed by hotel staff that the fridge was going to be available my partner and i stayed in room i presume it was located next to the service room i kept being up in the middle of the night due to sounds of trolleys crashing and doors slamming this room is not sound proof and was not relaxing or a peaceful experience again hotel staff did not inform me of this i am usually an advocate of hilton hotels however i will not be recommending this hotel to anyone or reusing it in the future,0
1706,the only reason to stay at this hotel is its proximity to the conference center next door the hallway outside our hallway smelled of a dead rat housekeeping never came unless called and requested the swimming pool is a joke for a family it is more like a hip hangout with people smoking shisha and behaving poorly we were concerned an escort service was being run out of the pool area just avoid this hotel there are so many other hotels which are much nicer,0
1707,my family and i stayed at the hilton diagonal mar on a recent drive from southern spain back to switzerland even though the hotel itself is not in the centre of barcelona it is only a euro taxi ride to all the central attractions several barcelona tour buses pass the hotel the pick up spot is a minute walk away and there is a taxi rank next to the main hotel is luxurious and the rooms spacious the hotel is located just opposite the diagonal mar shopping complex which has a fabulous outdoor food court with a good selection of restaurants there is also a children play area i would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on our next visit to barcelona,1
1709,a nice hotel for a break it has an excellent location with access to the beach and shops and good access to public transport customer service was very good with polite and helpful staff throughout tv choice is quite limited for a hotel of this standard only downside to the place is the pool area at time of booking it looked as if the pool area was part of the hotel but it is run separately from the hotel as a sort of franchise music blasts out around the pool so it not the most restful of places,1
1710,a very nice hotel close to barcelona beach the pool area is nice but maybee to bysy during the weekends a special thanks to david the supervisor in the restaurant he make our stay very special from a diamond member,1
1711,we booked a short holiday for the weekend as a get away during the summer holidays from start to finish the hotel was absolutely amazing extremely good location with amazing staff and wonderful rooms the hotel staff were extremely friendly accommodating my venture at in the morning to the lobby by keeping the bigger lights on the staff at breakfast were extremely helpful and very fast the quality of the food at breakfast was satisfying breakfast almost everything you could think of the timing for breakfast was reasonable as some hotels have extremely early times for breakfast the room was a good size beds very comfortable there was plenty of storage space and the staff gave us a nice viewthe location of the hotel is prime there is a bus stop for the city bus tour outside of the hotel which costs less than euros opposite the hotel is a massive shopping mall with many places to eat accommodating halal needs the shops within the mall ranged from fashion to shops like primark a couple minutes walk away is the beach making it easy to go at any time of the day i never used the hotel pool as the beach was so close overall i would definitely stay again at this hotel staff were wonderful along with the location,1
1712,we stayed there for nights with two kids we had a junior suite which ideal for a family of four the hotel is really nice close to the beach and to a shopping mall there is huge playground in the mall where kids can play the executive lounge has a kids area for the children my kids preferred to have breakfast there because of that is very nice in all areas of the hotel we did try the definitely recommend this hotel to anyone teaseling with their family,1
1714,we enjoyed our stay at the hotel for a great location meters from the beach and almost the same to nearest metro station we had a very good care from the duty manager ms rocio fontelai would like personally to thank her for the great welcome and her effort to make our stay comfortable,1
1715,i stayed at this hotel for a convention it was great as it was right next door to the convention center my room corner unit was very large and so was the bathroom the bed was very comfortable and blinds kept out all light from the room even though i was very jetlaged got to enjoy good night sleeps the breakfast buffet was worthy of a hotel a lot of choice and very good quality the only thing that was unfortunate was the distance to city center however it was right next to the beach very nice beach would go for a walk every day around pm and could walk for miles you see a lot of people jogging along that boardwalk the gym is quite small hence why i went outside rather than to the gym,1
1716,nice comfortable hotel and really helpful and awesome staff only two issues the hotel tends to get very busy with cruise lines so if you are expecting upgrades based on your hhonors elite status then good luck i stayed here nights and every night the front desk staff asked me to check tomorrow for upgrade availability none was found it is a little far from airport so taxi is your best transportation option to and from airport metro is only minutes walk away but will need to change twice to get airport other than the above it is a great hotel next to the beach and a shopping mall and really helpful staff which makes a big difference,1
1717,friendly staffflexible for late check out attentive specially room servicegood location specially in front of the mall and restaurantsrooms were newnice viewtaxis are available on the cornernice lobby lounge serving snacks and sandwiches,1
1718,this hotel was a long way from the airport via the metro nearly at the end of the line it is relatively close to the station with the diagonal mar shopping mall in between there is a supermarket in the mall the beach is a few blocks away i enjoyed a smoothie and sun at purobeach the service on the pool deck was friendly and attentive the room was comfortable but the coffee was expected more from this property hilton allows guests to check in to rooms prior to arrival i used the app and was surprised upon check in that i was given a different room on a lower floor further from the ocean view also the honors breakfast amenity was not available and the promised points were not added to my account overall this property seemed to be more of a convention hotel and i was not their preferred clientele given so many wonderful hotels in barcelona i will not return,1
1719,beautiful property on diagonal mar next to diagonal mar mall large lobby with helpful front office staff rooms are very spacious and lot of them are sea facing elaborate breakfast with sitting even outside which is a welcome break although the hotel initially mixed up rooms for us and gave wrong beds however the same was quickly rectified by their side overall if you are in barcelona this is good property to stay and venture out in the city,1
1720,booked through cruise line disney as a place to stay and to see barcelona rooms are neat and clean location is very convenient to cruse terminal beach shopping and metro to popular tourist sites trying to book direct we could get rooms for people but via cruise booking it was no problem they set up a in one of the rooms for our son and it was very comfy the included breakfast is very good was long and there always seemed to be a line they should do more to prep to make the process speedier food at the bar in lobby was very good but quite pricey as were the drinks we did not use the pool but we did take the short walk to the beach metro station very easy to use and cheap was a few blocks away and hotel provided a nice map of tourist locations do know if i would stay for an extended vacation but it was great for a stay,1
1721,on our first day we went down to lie by the pool to be told we had to pay between euros per person depending on how close we wanted to be by the pool we thought this was a joke as we were residents of the hotel this was not a sick joke it is a beach club so the hilton make their money from hen and stag parties particularly at the weekend we felt like second class citizens as we felt that the hilton were more interested in making money from non residents using the beach club than residents of the hotel we complained so did not have to pay for our sunbed so follow our example complain on our last day which was a saturday the rave music started at noon and got louder as the afternoon went on so much so that the lady beside us had to go to her room with a headache you could only block out the boom boom for so long so we complained to the manager while i was complaining other residents also complained hilton hang your head in shame a hotel should never have a beach club attached to it and there should never be any charges for lying by a will never be back at this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone,0
1723,hilton diagonal mar barcelona is located in the northeast of barcelona forum el maresme which is a little bit far away from the downtown but on the positive side it has a spectacular view over barcelona skyline from the upper also have a nice gym and beach club in the second floor for which i unfortunately do have any time to use since i like to explore barcelona to my hh gold i got upgraded in the junior suite and was also given a complimentary access to their executive lounge the breakfast in the following morning was rich enough for me there are basically two options fo the breakfast in the lower floor with more options but could be a little bit crowded or in the executive lounge which is less crowded but with less choices as was satisfied with my stay and i would mind to stay there again,1
1724,overall we were pleased with our stay the room was comfortable and taxis line up at the street corner making it very convenient to get anywhere in the city we paid for our room with points but were also charged the full rate upon checkout despite showing my points receipt however we were refunded after making a phone call and some emails with hilton honors,1
1725,the hotel itself is wonderful top notch staff excellent rooms super executive lounge ocean views everything one would expect from a hilton but it is a minute taxi ride or metro ride from any major attraction which really takes a bite out of your day if going to montserrat the train station is on the other side of town about a minute journey by metro all in all if sightseeing is your main goal a hotel closer to city center should be considered it is a five minute walk to a lifeguarded beach if that is goal of your the hotel itself is wonderful the executive lounge concierge was particularly helpful to us and her recommendations were spot on,1
1726,in terms of hilton standards this is not one of the best the service was slow and sloppy the hotel amenities were very basic and even though use of the pool is free the sun beds are charged the hotel is clean and the breakfast is ok but the rest were below my expectations,1
1727,we stayed for a few days and were very impressed with the hotel the rooms the cleanliness the food and most importantly the very friendly and helpful staff they went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant and though expensive to stay there it was well worth it and we would return,1
1729,the accomadations were wonderful beautiful hotel comfortable beds the hotel was well sitiuated next to a shopping centre walking distance to beautiful beaches and dinning at the port nearby few blocks away from metro system with only a few stops to major attractions a very heartfelt thank you to the knowledgable staff and especially francesco at the front desk for superb service and making our stay even more enjoyable,1
1730,good hotel in a reasonable location close to metro and beach purobeach pool is available to hotel guests but sun dloungers are charged for an in my opinion are very expensive breakfast is very good although the queue can get very long at peak times,1
1731,well placed property shopping mall diagonal mar with great shopping restaurants located just across from the hotel taxis available right outside the hotel entrance is a great plus staff really professional helpful alba helena at the front desk are an asset to the hotel sylvia at the lobby bar is awesome she provided great friendly service and much needed guidance for the day before we ventured out to the city rooms are getting an upgrade ours was already done to modern scale but lacks soundproofing you can hear most activites of room neighbours purobeach club runs the hotel area really up scale to be prepared to spend some if you intend to use the club housekeeping always on point great stay so far,1
1732,hilton is never changing you know what you are getting and in many ways it like coming home not always perfect but always happy comfortable and satisfying they do not fail you too dare crisp and elegant maybe not massive but they are good the service is lovely people working here are lovely overall would always stay again this brand is iconic for a reason they work very hard to please in my opinion they mostly succeed,1
1733,stayed here for nights at the floor club executive this hotel my stay in between the last years it pretty close to the beaches of marbella and has good connections by train bus and staff in the executive lounge and at the main breakfast area was super attentive and you management,1
1734,while i was enjoying my vacation in barcelona a friend and i figured to go poolside for our last day we researched this location which is a little outside the city limits upon arrival the staff was very welcoming however we did get out sunbeds the wait staff we all very friendly accommodating and attentive the service time was a little slower yet was to be expected knowing how service is in barcelona the food was quite enjoyable however swallowing the price was less than enjoyable all in all a great day was had would definitely go back,1
1736,hotel is near the beach and not far from city center the line at check in was long but other than that my experience was great i let a review on the hilton website and the manager emailed me and apologized for the lines,1
1737,i had no idea the hotel would be so close to the beaches and public transit until we checked in and became familiar with our surroundings this hotel is perfect the staff guestrooms location and comfort are all exactly what you want when traveling we will definitely return to this hotel next year not necessary to shop around this is the place to stay,1
1739,i stayed here last week as part of my honeymoon the hotel staff were amazing our first contact was with alba at reception and she was amazing she provided tonnes of information about barcelona that helped us decide how to spend our time thank you alba breakfast was absolutely fantastic the selection was great continental and british the breakfast staff were all room was clean and comfortable we booked a room with a sea view and i glad we made that decision there were blackout curtains so we slept really well the location is a little ways from the city centre my husband and i like to walk to that did matter to us there are also tonnes of transit stops or tourist bus stops within a short decision the hotel is a minute walk from the beach it a nice and quiet part of the beach the only complaint i have is that i do feel as though it was made clear that the hotel does actually have a pool there is a pool at the location but it owned by a separate company and guests have to pay for a bed the rate is apparently reduced for hotel guests but i was still disappointed with this drinks and food at the pool are expensive just go to the beach,1
1740,lovely night stay at this hotel situated a bit further away from the city centre across the street to the diagonal mar shopping centre and a walk to llevant beach stayed in an executive level room with access to the lounge food beverages were good quality in the lounge and service there was excellent went to purobeach for a few hours to lounge on the pool deck but did not use the pool or spa drinks were very expensive euros each and just ok nothing spectacular the gym was being renovated and the temporary gym that was set up was very small not conducive to a good workout,1
1741,for being a hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high forgot our orderlazy in the barservice remote did worktook the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without askinggave us the wrong billthe staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service not worth the visit,0
1743,fantastic facilities and convenient location for the beach and tube into town the service on reception however was desperately slow and understaffed there was no que for hhonurs members which is unusual,0
1744,hilton diagonal mar is a great place to stay in barcelona only had a few days so the staff went out of there way to make it great they booked an excursion and followed up with us each day they took a personal interest in making sure we had a relaxing time,1
1745,i stayed at this hotel in early july and again in late july everything was fantastic hotel staff went above and beyond throughout the stay kudos to the front desk team executive lounge staff and the bar team in the lobby everyone was a delight ca wait to come back,1
1746,we stayed at the hilton for nights at the end of july the hotel downstairs is clean and the rooms are spacious puro beach is definitely the best part about the hotel on the whole we felt that the customer service and performance was pretty poor for a star hotel also considering the cost per night the bed sheets in our room were not changed once in nights we were missing basic amenities hair dryers bottle openers etc and it took multiple calls to reception to obtain the items we should have already had in the room on check out we were extremely suprised as frequent travellers that there was absolutely no facility for once you had checked out their solution was to use the shower in puro beach the one as you enter the pool or to go to the toilets which are cramped and very hot location is quieter and is further out of the city which we preferred but if we had wanted to be central this hotel is not the one the beach is close and the shopping mall being directly opposite was extremely handy as there are no other convinience shops and surprisingly for of water at the hotel was not so appealing great experience of barcelona however would think twice about returning to the hilton diagonal mar especially as you do not have to be a guest to go to puro beach also if this is your first visit to barcelona be advised that,0
1747,this hotel is not in the really busy gothic and las ramblas area but is a short cab ride away it is in a bit quieter section of the city the beach is a five minute walk away and there is a giant shopping mall and several restaurants across the street several other restaurants are near as us a beautiful city park our room and the bed were comfortable the pool area is nice but a bit pricey by the time you rent chairs buy food or drink etc the hotel overall is a good value relative to others in the busier areas we will stay here again when we return in september,1
1748,stayed for nights at the end of july just me and my yr old picked the hilton for its location to the beach and shopping in was a little slow but queuing is part of life staff were all friendly and helpful when needed the room was great with everything you might need on holiday it was also cleaned on a daily breakfast was excellent and as a brit abroad i enjoyed a full english every only went to the purobeach on one occasion as the beach is only mins away with great beach purobeach pool area has a great setting very chilled and relaxed however as mentioned in other posts it not what you call cheap loungers are charged at euro each with similar high prices for food and loungers nachos patas smoothies and cocktails came to around which is a problem but could get expensive over days in all i would definitely recommend this hotel yes it is cheap but remember your in an amazing spanish city and everything comes at a premium,1
1749,i am just back after a day stay and i must say i was very happy with our room which was roomy and clean with a very nice bathroom the front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful as were the staff at breakfast lounge breakfast was very nice with a large array of fresh fruit and juices not to mention an extensive warm buffet style english breakfast my gripe with the hotel is the puro beach pool area once you make your way to the pool area you are greeted by a sales pitch to the various packages available for your stay with varied from euros for a lounger to euros per person for the puro package which i still do not have a clue what it entailed having decided to take up the euro sun lounger for the family euros lighter i was soon wishing i had gone to the beach which we did for the rest of our stay as we were constantly being asked if we wanted cocktail above the thumping music from the loudspeakers dotted around the whole pool area i decided to go for a dip in the very small busy pool to be greeted by a layer of sun lotion scum in the water clearly too small a pool to accommodate so many people and my other observation was that the toilets were located a floor down i will leave the rest for your imagination needless to say i did not dip my,0
1750,nice hotel completely ruined by a pretentious and overly noisy music pool area so bad we left the hotel during the day for peace and quiet at the public beach as the music was clearly heard in room great location and apart from noise the rooms were good as well,0
1752,we stayed in the hotel during the end of july for entrance lounge was very nice with some jars of lemon water for the guests who come back from the long day at the city there are about floors and we were at the and the view was astonishing there were a few things missing in our room when we got in we didnt have shower blankets took us a while to get them only after we asked for the time and no trash can only a small one in the bathroom the room was very cozy and there was an alarm clock was good it had all the things most people eat eggs sausages bacon salad yogurt cornflakes pastry bread and more and the staff was very friednly and the front of the hotel there is the diagonal mar shopping mall which has everything literally from water to we liked our stay in the hotel and we had a great experience there,1
1753,well let me start by saying that this is the first time that i am writing a review when i have checked out of the hotel i a hilton honors member and one of the reasons i picked this hotel is because of the benefits that come with it let me just say that if this is the reason you are coming stay away this has to be the worst service that i have ever experienced in any of the hilton hotels poor management me highlight some of the negatives no bellman to help you with your luggage stayed for nights and i think i saw just one randomly check in time is at i came in at and was told that my room was ready to come back in an hour came back at really annoyed to learn that it still was ready did get the room till they must have called housekeeping or times to ask if it was still cleaned check in was poor never got keys so had to make the line awful i travel a lot this has to be the worst i had a family suite sofa bed that my son slept in was horrible you can feel the bar complained spoke to a supervisor and stated all my complaints said he was going to have management call me i never received the call i asked him for a power adaptor and never received room was not adequately cleaned no complimentary concierge service leon,0
1754,we have stayed at hilton before but this hilton d m barcelona does not reach the hilton standard that we usually get pool area does not suit for the kids family as they around half naked topless drunk lady dancing with a very very loud music around the pool and inside the pool with champagne i took this with the hotel but said it was ok here in barcelona to go topless but what to go topless is find but get drunk and dancing topless when there were so some kids around that a disgusting behavior and it a joke that hotel stuffs did allow about the hotel is that stuffs in executive floor are polite and friendly not all of them but many of them and they stuffs at pool area also polite and friendly but the guest service when you dial from the room are not that friendly do know if it how they talk like this in spain or she sound just unhappy or impolite to me the girl i talked to at pm on back to the room housekeeping were polite but the forgot to put towels for us we went for swimming and got to shower direct when we came in and found out we had no towels at all in the shower and another thing that bothering me was one of the housekeeping knocked on the door at and asked if wanted him to clean the room that was very very sweet but i,0
1755,excellent place to stay in barcelona beautiful hotel close to the beach nice mall purobeach on the property is amazing pool with sun beds food drinks reservations ahead would definitely go back,1
1756,i was there for a business conference the hotel is just mins away from the beach it was so close i could wake up to watch the sunrise and had a swim before breakfast a large shopping mall is located opposite the hotel if you want good authentic restaurants you will have to take a short mins taxi ride out taxis are easily accessible outside the hotel breakfast buffet range is good hotel is very clean good amenities although the gym is very small smaller than a single bedroom service is above average and seem lacking especially at all in all good stay and would return,1
1757,we were spoilt with the presidential suite on the top floor which was bigger square footage than the rented apartment for our main holiday my kids loved the extra space the wonderful views great whirlpool bath dining room and a couple of lounges to relax in we also made good use of the exec club on floor which needs special key access in the elevator tapas were served room service was very responsive later in the evening congrats to the gm here and their team on site a experience,1
1758,i stayed in the hotel during a business trip good rooms with a required facilities and good connectivity to the airport bcn it made the burden of business travel just a little lighter the location is also close to the business center making it an easy connection,1
1759,perfect location for exploring barcelona and enjoying the gay nightlife staff were at every interaction room was clean and modern and there was a fabulous rooftop bar and pool the price was surprisingly fair for the experience our only complaint was too few electrical outlets in our room and none by the bed for phone charging,1
1760,my husband and i live in phoenix arizona usa and frequently have massages here while staying at two by alex this hotels sister facility we took advantage of the urban spa to have relaxing and deep tissue massage we where able to have the massage together and we both agree the massage was the best we ever had any were richardo and william made us feel very comfortable and did an outstanding job we would both give the experience our highest recommendation,1
1761,the hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the best places it has an amazing gym and spa i got a massage while there from martin it was an amazing massage from a very hot and handsome guy i be booking him again next time i stay there the rooftop bar and pool is also a great setting after a day spent seeing the amazing city,1
1762,friendly staff with a great atmosphere the roof bar and dj on friday and saturday night were brilliant with an electro atmosphere rooms were spacious and modern and clean defiantly recommend it especially if you are gay there is a massage and beautiful day sauna also,1
1763,location location and location ca be better rooms are nice and clean staff the greatest best ambience with rooftop always busy spa and gym are also a plus both excelent with good staff i worked out every day and used a personal trainer who was very competent and professional too excellent massages at the spa,1
1764,the main point of my review is yes you should think about staying here if you thinking about it there not a better location in barcelona for gay or that out of the way i going to say some negatives and positives about the booked online months in advance with a prepay rate when confirmation came through it said we had no right to cancel without losing the full amount i went back and pretended to book again up to the final moment this was disclosed i immediately wrote to the office and said please give me a higher rate with some cancellation option they refused this is pretty bad customer service and a misleading website from my point of view either way it was a big trip we were getting travel insurance we probably wanted to stay there so i went forward with i like a lot of space and so we booked one of the suites it was lots of space but not mostly functional space my hunch is all the suites are kind of custom laid out i would book one again without getting the layout of the room first our room had an exceptionally tiny sitting area you never invite someone in to sit down unless you escorted them right to the outside balcony the hallway and closet area were unusually narrow we both thin and we could even pass each other in these areas also the whole room had a lack of horizontal surfaces for,1
1765,this review is to cover both the two hotel and axel in barcelona i spent the weekend june july at the two hotel the urban spa on sundaythis the third time i have stayed there this year and the team make you completely welcome as a single traveller it can be difficult to feel at home in particular when you in such a beautiful romantic city the two hotel team make you feel completely at home and provide answers to any questions that you may have with a friendly the sunday i treated myself to a massage at the axel urban spa the treatment can only be described as outstanding as the two masseurs ricardo y martin not only provided a perfect treatment but worked as one seamless team in terms of rhythm pressure and completely professional complements to a great duo and also to the entire team for a fantastic weekend and i will be back soon,1
1766,booked as central for sightseeing beaches and nightlife unaware it was a gay hotel this turned out to be an added bonus as the atmosphere and ambience was one of great inclusiveness and acceptance for everyone in our mixed party super friendly and attentive staff especially sergi overseeing the great breakfast buffet the subterranean spa was scrupulously clean and quiet during the day when we used it facilities i recommend a massage from juan if you get chance very relaxing and a real were a good size by european standards beds are comfortable showers are large and powerful and room servicing and hygiene could be faulted we definitely return not least as the rooftop bar is open until and has themed entertainment most nights,1
1767,we love our axel the hotel is located in the middle of the gay part of the city in eixample and the skybar is the hotspot where the gay nightlife starts the place to go where an international crowd mingles before taking off to the clubs rooms are nice and the suites are spatious everything is very well maintained the spa is nice too and for a fee of you can use a dry sauna the steam bath and a heated pool with many different jets free when you book a massage martin gives great massages gym and spa are operated by a different company general manager of the axel marc does a great job of meeting the client needs security has improved too at the rooftop parties they make sure that everything is under control visitors have to check with the front front desk staff is always nice and makes us feel special namely john bartosz javier just to name a will come back in two weeks for another vacation and are already looking forward to see the guys again we highly recommend axel for your city feel free to ask if you want more info,1
1768,i stayed here whilst travelling for work the hotel was very friendly and the room had most of the expected amenities the room was a bit basic but very modern and very clean the roof bar was a nice bonus as i had realised it was there upon booking and i made excellent use of the spa and gym facilities during my stay,1
1769,this hotel was a great place to stay while visiting barcelona it centrally located and pretty much walkable to restaurants and shops the room was cozy clean and the cleaning service more than satisfactory the reception staff were friendly and helpful most especially bartosz he friendly and always took the time to help in any way he could i think he was the best thing at the hotel that made our stay pleasureable,1
1770,i loved anything and everything about this hotel i was travelling on my lonesome and the staff were beyond wonderful and accommodating in particular i would like to thank the awesome daniel who was not only an utter delight but also had a very good grasp of the english language i was very humbled and appreciative of daniel efforts to assist me wherever possible daniel kindly organised a most beautiful room with a balcony so it made my stay all the more wonderful the location of the hotel is brilliant and in walking distance to most of the main sites oh and the shops following this most recent experience i would more than willingly recommend this hotel to my friends and family i only wished i could have stayed at this hotel longer x,1
1771,on arrival we were immediately impressed with the hotel it is decorated beautifully at reception we were spoilt with a room upgrade the rooms are very comfortable with great views this is probably the most comfortable bed we had in any hotel the room top bar is great with a pool and jacuzzi at night time the roof top bar comes to life there really is no need to look for a night out when it already location is perfect just mins walk to las rambles and gaudi architecture the gothic quarter is also within walking distance too we will be coming back again also very impressed by the hotel asking if we did mind making a very small contribution to aids research what a wonderful policy they have here,1
1773,loved this hotel we felt like family and friends the staff were kind and very helpful sergi was extremely good to us each morning as he welcomed us to breakfast and custom made our coffee and it was a fantastic breakfast buffet at the front desk andr√© and alexandre were so helpful with directions calling cabs and obtaining things for us that we needed for example alexandre even went and got us a kitchen knife so we could peel some fruit that we also liked that this hotel was both and it was a wonderfully open environment and both kinds of couples were present at breakfast,1
1775,we booked it on booking without noticing that it is specifically for gay couples so we went there and we were a bit worried but everything turns out super super super fine we had the premium room which looks exactly the same as what we saw in the pictures on booking with two balconies the design of the room is mordern but not cold the service stuff there was really really friendly to us and they answer all of our questions about city sightseeing stuff the location is good too as we were not really far from wherever we wanted to go honestly i think it is a super nice hotel which i would like to go back there superb,1
1776,lovely clean hotel in a great location only a short can away from the hustle and bustle quiet in evening is a hotel for mostly gay couples but me and my friend were welcomed and felt very comfortable very good rooms,1
1777,i spent nights here in location beautiful hotel spotlessly clean and well room was large beautiful and had great balconies fantastic rain shower shower bathroom was really rooftop bar and hot tub the pool is small but all you really need unless you swimming laps great way to cool off after a long hot day in the bar was crowded every night i was there good variety of guys too clearly it a bar that barcelonans visit as well which is good not just hotel guests there so you meet a lot of people only cons no shelf or counter space in bathrooms and i had a premier room the elevators are slow and not very the toilet paper was like sandpaper just being loud club music at breakfast and in the lobby in the morning is a little much even for a gay service was horrid i had a morning appointment and wanted coffee in my room while i got ready i asked for a carafe of coffee in languages to make sure he understood he did speak any english and postponed getting ready so as not to miss room service coming to the door minutes later i called and asked where it was and he informed me he was downstairs alone and could bring it up i told him to cancel the coffee as i was now running late while in the shower a housekeeper brought up one cup of coffee she told me they do have carafes,1
1778,this is my second stay at the property in the last couple years the experience it is always the best upon arrival the welcome is a great smile from all the staff the common areas had been updated and the restaurant in property is just lovely with great service the skybar it is a highlight for every sunset to witness the beauty of the city the rooms were totally renovated and absolutely beautiful thank you everyone in particular andre to make me feel welcome at axel hotel barcelona,1
1779,the hotel is great clean beautiful modern and very well sited the box glass wall is cool staff s√≥ helpful and friendly daniel was superbe i met great guys from diferent countries the rooftop bar is bloody exciting,1
1780,returning for a multiple time and still satisfied once again i got a room with a balcony overlooking the street it was fantastic open the windows and feel the vibe of the neighborhood close them and total isolation the reception staff are doing a fantastic job andre was once again the one to check me in and out thanks andre john who desperately tried to find me a transport due to the taxi strike thanks for your sincere efforts javier and of cource alexandra who is exemplary the cleaning staff are doing a great job as well and a simple good morning to them is returned with a great smile also many thanks to marc the gm who is very friendly and accommodating and also a great professional the new restaurant nikkei is a great addition and there sky bar to enjoy the pool and sun during the day and great drinks and events at night the wellness club is a must to visit for a massage or training or just using the spa total bliss thanks sabrina for the great job and friendship this hotel is close to so many things like bars and restaurants casa batll√≥ casa mil√† also known as la pedrera the great shopping street of passeig de gr√†cia also known for its modernism buildings totally happy here,1
1781,great hotel in barcelona center in gay eixample where are based all premier room is amazing great service a bit small pool in top roof but enough to enjoy a perfect sunny day have a lovely spa and restaurant in same hotel well recommended to stay in solo or with partner,1
1782,close to bcn metro and university lots of restaurants near the metro pza glories stop you get what you pay in this ibis hotel when you are a visitor since you are out most of the day book hotel with breaskfast,1
1783,room was fine quite smart clean the good thing about ibis is that you know exactly what you get staff was really nice especially raquel efficient and practical breakfast correct available early recommended if you need to stay close to teatre nacional gl√≤ries auditori,1
1784,we booked this hotel for a overnight stay before we departed for our cruise at the port the hotel was reasonably priced under or which included breakfast in the price we paid we booked the room via their own website staff are great and friendly with a warm welcome when we arrived or returned when we went out so top marks for staff in this rooms are ok with wooden floors no luxury touches in the rooms but clean and the bed was nice and breakfast was good buffet style very busy thou bit disjointed on layout spread in different places not labelled well hence the chaos with guests trying to get their breakfast and pushing in location was out the way from the centre and late at night we did feel a little wary of the area and the drunks on the corners by the subway just down the for metro ticket for journeys so that came in handy to get you in the centre and back the ticket can be used by multiple persons at the same time but not to exceed the trips in total check out was good with email of invoice we asked the staff to order us a taxi to the port this cost us for the trip around,1
1785,only mins to llacuna station which will take you to the gothic quarter mins to glories to get anywhere else min walk to rambla de poblenou the family friendly las staff were friendly and always said hello the room was good there was a bit of noise from the neighbours but nothing too bad i experienced much worse all in all a great hotel do let the area put you off it as safe as the rest of barcelona stay attentive and you be fine,1
1786,this is a very nice hotel clean great service rooms and bathroom are little small like all the hotels in europe it is close to a metro station there a little mall around with restaurants and shops price is good breakfast also was good it was perfect for me and my family we definitely will go back,1
1787,i wo advice you to live there in july i was able to find air condition it ok for one night but its a shame for it location work on service is much needed the room was ok make sure to print your confirmation going the extra for the customer was not their thing i was asked what do you expect from hotel my reply everything on the web but then again it a and for me a star should ask customers such a crazy question barcelona is a city with endless of hotels and hostels make sure to have a look around so book one night and find that which suits you you might even like the place,0
1788,just came back from a days stay at this hotel with my husband and year old it was everything we were looking for and subway was less then min walk la rambla also rooms were clean and the daily service was excellent everyone at the front desk especially marc were not only very nice but very helpful with any questions we had only thing missing was a mini fridge but beside that we would definitely go back again,1
1789,an older style hotel fronting la rambla so very handy and the staff are room was contemporary with a spacious bathroom and being located nearer the rear it was also fairly a decent breakfast and overall i would use this hotel again,1
1790,ideally located hotel in central barcelona it is in walking distance to many sights and close to a couple of metro stations the hotel is basic but suits the needs of a weekend stay staff were very friendly and welcoming,1
1791,for a few days in barcelona it the perfect hotel the location is great centre and m from the metro the balcony and the view on the ramblas is lovely the room and bathroom are clean and you have enough space in the room,1
1792,the hotel is in a very central location and staff was very friendly and than that i would not stay again it had a strange smell in corridors and in the bedroom our bedroom had a small window facing the wall so it was very dark bed was extremely uncomfortable breakfast was of a low quality lacking any fresh produce barcelona has got fantastic restaurants and cafes so do waste your breakfast here,0
1793,i booked this hotel following the reviews on tripdvisor and it is really what i expected position in the rambla but quiet rooms simple but comfortable and clean the one where we stayed was refurbished and also bathroom was new i will sure recommend a stay here special thanks to the reception for their precious and punctual information,1
1794,lovely clean rooms with excellent and very quiet air conditioning unit greatly appreciated as temp this july was around degrees hot the staff are friendly and helpful with good humour breakfast gave good choices of both continental meats cheese and pastries along with some cooked items too we are three women and although the hotel is not ultra modern it is characterful with a lovely ambience we very much enjoyed our stay in this hotel located in the heart of la rambla one slight possible negative as across from the hotel is a nightclub that kicks out at if you a night bird this would be an issue,1
1795,my sister and i arrived late on saturday evening and were welcomed by senne i might not have remembered her name but the lovely dutch receptionist and directed to our newly decorated room on the floor the room was lovely and had the most fantastic view it has everything you need good shower nice towels changed daily lots of hanging space and really comfy day on the floor there are snacks and drinks overseen by the charming adriana nespresso coffee apples sweets and ham rolls we did eat much but it was a nice touch and great for a cold drink after an afternoon by the rooftop rooftop pool is gorgeous big comfortable beds and chairs for the daytime and a cocktail vibe in the evenings a fantastic addition to the staff at this bar were friendly and efficient in fact i would say that the staff are among the friendliest and most efficient i have encountered the pluses of this hotel if i were to choose great staff clean and beautifully laid out rooftop pool and bar amazing views lots of nice little luxury touches in the rooms and even the hallway and finally good value for money it euros in a cab to the ramblas cab stand outside and there is plenty to do and see around the hotel ca think of a single moan i already planning my return trip,1
1796,me friends stayed here for and we enjoyed our stay the staff are very friendly attentive especially the bar staff on the roof terrace the views from the hotel are amazing we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here i would most definitely stay again,1
1797,this modern hotel is big and inevitably somewhat so far so predictable what sets it apart is its superb location on plaza espanya which is a tremendous transport hub and h gets you almost anywhere with metro rail and bus including the superb airport bus right outside the door train to monnserrat starts underground just across the road add tho that the excellent shopping mall next door and the montjuic arts complex in walking distance and splendidly visible from the hotel and it a great centre from which to explore rooms are predictably well equipped breakfast a comprehensive buffet staff helpful and multilingual and the rooftop bar and pool are a great treat with super views,1
1799,the hotel was not worth the money building was old and requires major renovation electrical installation in the room was scary overcharged for breakfast and double room that i never location of the hotel was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful,0
1800,great experience with great team that was able to make the pleasure happened i will definitely come back to this hotel again also i will strongly recommend it to thise who are willing to visit this country,1
1801,lovely hotel in a wonderful location adjacent to the bullring and plaza espana room very spacious and well equipped with large comfortable bed bathroom a good size with separate toilet and shower over the bath beautiful pool and bar area on the rooftop with fantastic views to the light and fountain nightly show extensive breakfast would highly recommend this hotel,1
1802,we spent nights here pool area is nice but too small for the number of guests staff are very polite friendly and helpful and out was dreadful very long queues we had to wait for mins just to get to the desk i travel every week on business around europe worst i ever encountered the room was quite dated and the maintenance and cleanliness left a lot to be desired certainly not commensurate with see photos security was a bit worrying too door lock on room was faulty and did always work correctly and there was no requirement in the lifts to use your room key in this day and age very unusual for a hotel of this grade reception was busy and anyone could have walked in and gone up to accommodation floors or pool area one guy in reception area who i never saw stopping and checking anyone hotels in barcelona are notoriously expensive but this was not worth almost euros a night,0
1805,huge star hotel with a lovely rooftop bar and pool boating great views rooms are big and spacious however need refurbishing as the shower head was leaking and the bathroom products were low quality no iron or ironing board no making facilities in room and only power outlet,1
1806,the hotel was clean excellent for americans in july this is a huge bonus beautiful pool great view from our room looking out on the magic fountain show at night location ca be beat metro right downstairs decor could be updated the room smelled a little like smoke and there were no outlets on the nightstands otherwise this is a great hotel,1
1807,we spent six nights in this centrally placed hotel a good location for the fira conference centre and for walking around the city we paid a premium for a room with terrace only discovering on our arrival that it was positioned at the end of the rooftop swimming pool area screened from the pool users by some pot plants which were only knee high this meant that there was no privacy whatsoever people passing by to the bar could look straight in some yobs actually threw their lit cigarette ends over on to our sun beds burning the cover and one end was flanked by the back of the bar where the sound of empty bottles being thrown away was a regular feature this was very the management quickly replaced the sunbed covers for some stained ones which again was very nice and inappropriate for the standard of hotel the room itself was spacious and comfortable with kettle and fridge there was a large bathroom containing separate shower and what looked like a large round spa bath in a separate area but which turned out to be just a bath in an unlit space opening the window in this space was impossible as it overlooked the sunbeds on the pool terrace bottled water should have been supplied daily but we had to keep on asking for this breakfast was astonishing in its variety of food on offer the breakfast hall was huge so one had to walk a long way,1
1808,huge hotel by the plaza de espana perfect location metro station airport bus stop taxis stand very busy streets room with view on the fountain and the needed some lift up as well as the hallways fantastic pool on breakfast the gourmet cafe is serving delicious food not very pricy compare to the street restaurants nearby staff could be more nice stay,1
1809,the hotel boasts quality in everything from service to material room with good beds something characterized by hotel age but clean and well service both at the reception bar and restaurants restaurant filigrana is definitely worth a visit roof terrace is unique with its spectacular views and beautiful furniture from here you can see la fontena magica with its spectacular light wish for a bigger hotel gym but otherwise forward to my next visit,1
1810,easy to get to as the aerobus from the airport stops right outside and there are several metro lines at placa espanya so very convenient for getting around within easy walking distance of the national musuem of art and the magic fountain the pool bar on the roof gives excellent views of these montjuic is also close by large room with efficient and quiet air conditioning i kept this on all night as it was too warm without and too noisy to have the windows open no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which i would have liked breakfast is a buffet with a wide selection can get busy at times may be difficult to find a suitable table do use the water provided for tea as it not hot enough use the hot water function on the coffee dispensers several restaurants beware if you are vegetarian as eg the goat cheese pizza comes with ham even though the menu gives no hint of this i sent it back and it was promptly replaced but worth stating if you do eat meat service in the gourmet corner can be slow i did use the other retaurants so ca comment staff very helpful i stayed one night on my own account and thereafter on a group booking and the staff arranged it so i did have to move rooms other members of my group also found the staff helpful if issues arose the hotel looks awful from the outside,1
1811,great place to base yourself for a city break in barcelona we had a lovely time there and enjoyed the friendly relaxed attitude of the staff i so want to steal the pillows they are even more comfortable than mine at home,1
1812,the hotel is in a beautiful spot in barcelona next to the arena mall there are cafe and restaurants in the area but i totally recommend the hotel breakfast which is fantastic and varied the room i would advise you to stay in is you will thank me later the swimming pool is on the floor and it magnificent the hotel staff is wonderful and helpful especially alex we are here for nights but we will be back,1
1813,the rooftop was incredible with a great view of the city and of the magic fountain show very convienent location and good value for money a very busy hotel but even with so many people we still managed to get a day bed by the pool,1
1814,we had arrived in barcelona on the second leg of our daughter school orchestra tour we were a bit early for as we wanted to go up to parc g√ºell staff were happy for us to leave our baggage and later what a surprise on our return we had paid for a city view but found ourselves upgraded to a clock suite incredible view of pla√ßa espanya the av de la reina maria cristina and the museum nacional de the evening we made our way up to the roof terrace for drinks and to watch the spectacular font m√†gica de montju√Øc we watched the music and light display from up close but the view was truly found the staff friendly and accommodating room was immaculately clean and very special,1
1815,not what i expect from a star hotel the quality differences are in the little things such as not having sufficient safe deposit box locks for the room safe no complimentary bottled water or coffee machines at breakfast and polite but service at the front desk as can be seen from the other poor reviews management pattern seems to be polite apology followed by the scripted thanking for the feedback which offers an opportunity to improve however this appears to be little more than an empty response that results in no or very few real improvements would we stay here again no,0
1816,my ipad phone and aftershave were stolen from a supposedly locked room the hotel offered me no support other than to try to prove none of their staff had accessed my room with a keycard if you travel here keep valuables with you,0
1817,the hotel is located in plaze de can enjoy a wonderful view of barclona at the roof where the pool is located to the left of the hotel there is the arena shopping mall with food court and beside it located many restaurants and coffee shops to the right of the hotel there is shopping streets with also restaurants and coffee shops facing the hotel u can walk minutes to the magical fountain with the additional to the above the metro is far min from the entrance of the hotel the staff were friendly especially sabilla which gave us a specific details how to go and switch metros to sagrada familia breakfast was good the room was ok,1
1818,stayed for nights best location best staff excellent room best location location access to metro and all busses incl aero bus direct to airport from directly outside the main entrance to the hotel overall best stay ever in europe,1
1819,two thirds of the way through our fantastic holiday and we come to barcelona earlyish to check they ca get us in but offer to look after the bags so we head to further to again explore the wonders of this great cities upon our return we upgraded to a suite clearly everything about this hotel is magical the staff are excellent and the pool area is also fabulous with plenty of day beds and a great bar on the eighth floor the location whilst a little out of town minute walk is great for the magic fountain and not too far from tickets a fabulous local restaurant upgraded room was an absolute delight thanks to the team for making ours a wonderful stay,1
1820,so i have just returned from my second visit to the catalonia barcelona plaza having visited for a week last year this is an amazing hotel minutes from the airport cab or bus and with a fantastic location situated on the busy plaza espana it has the most wonderful views right down to the sea and is right beside a great shopping centre with a lovely hairdressers just inside the door the metro and has taxis outside the door this is a busy hotel with wonderful reception staff who very kindly upgraded us to the floor and made sure we got a lovely room with a view adriana is always on hand on this floor and is very helpful and kind the room is lovely and has everything we would have wanted but the view is so amazing that you spend most of the time looking out the window the rooftop pool and bar area is the nicest i have ever been too with the most amazing views wonderful staff both day and night time and beds always readily available had lunch here two days and it was lovely all in all this is the nicest hotel i have stayed in and am already planning my next trip as soon as i can get out there again barcelona is a beautiful and vibrant city in its own right but when you stay somewhere as nice as the catalonia plaza it just makes the trip more special,1
1821,i love this hotel i would definitely stay here again the next time i in barcelona the location was perfect with metro at the doorstep to easily get around the city i also liked the fact that the property is surrounded by many places to eat and shop i would also note that it is very easy to get to and from the airport from the hotel is very easy,1
1822,great style distance to beach and shopping very polite and efiicient staff good breakfast restaurant kids loved the pool stands a bit alone in the old workshop district overall out of,1
1823,this felt more like a business hotel but was perfect for my two nights three days of sightseeing the area is unusual in that it essentially residential and not that close to transport links there is a lot of graffiti around the area but it more street art than tagging and some was quite good my experience at reception was great the lady was very helpful and took the time to explain the best things to do in barcelona which i found very useful i upgraded to a junior suite at reception as it only an extra a night i did regret it as the room was large with separate sections a big spa style bath two tvs king size bed and most importantly a nespresso machine the only thing missing was a balcony being on the ninth floor it was very handy to the floor pool the view from the pool is stunning and goes right around so you can see sagrada familia in the distance i enjoyed sunbathing and reading my book there the pool was quite small however i got the breakfast which was if you book in advance but not great the meats were not high quality and scrambled eggs mushy although the parties were very fresh and there was a good selection of fruit for it ok the room was spacious and very clean plus you can turn the air con up and a great stay and i recommend upgrading to the junior suite,1
1824,nice hotel appears for business travellers but a lot of quiet couples and a few families stay here metro and centres walk away about on the metro to barcelona central and the metro runs till or a taxi is around euros back from the city breakfast was excellent the staff very friendly the pool was never very busy even though we stayed in july and the room was nice spacious and clean pay for the breakfast when you get there as its only euros per day not euros as advertised online i did like that it was directly near any restaurants or the metro although they were only a walk away so ca really complain and that we did have a room allocated to us when we arrived they offered us their last three rooms one of which would cost an extra euros we ended up staying in a smoking room although you never would noticed i had also emailed the hotel via and email prior to our stay and they never responded,1
1825,not happy as we were all bitten by mosquitos were in the room in the morning upon showering in the morning discovered that the bodywash dispenser was compeltely advising reception the same morning iy was met with a response of complete silence by marta who handled our check was them spoken to by someone else on reception in spanish and she just raised her eyebrows and walked was ok the only redeeming feature of our would stay again,0
1827,we arrived at midnight due to a late flight the staff greeted us warmly and checked us in in the morning we enjoyed lunch by the pool the staff held our baggage after while we explored the neighborhood taxi were parked out front during the day making travel to our next destination easy it was a taxi ride from the airport the train was an option at midnight when our flight arrived we originally thought it was closer to the airport but the room bathroom pool made it worth the extra taxi costs such friendly staff,1
1828,been to barcelona before we stayed at a hotel nearby so we already knew what to expect with the location the area may not be the however we preferred to be in the residential part instead of next to bland buildings lots of street art mismatched houses love it if that is not your thing then use google view prior to booking stop complaining about location we had our baby with us felt safe in the area when we walked a few minutes walk to metro shopping centre waterfront such a handy location you away from the bustle of city centre so it quieter but easy enough to get to the staff were really friendly helpful we honestly would have left them all a tip if we had any money left hotel room was fab very clean spacious even with our baby crib in it only issue we had was the people next to us were noisy for a couple of nights so it must be thin walls of course i can not fault the hotel regarding how our behave but i suggest maybe allocating families together if possible the swimming pool is quite small but did the job for us plus the views from the of the building are amazing degree view of barcelona and you can see the la sagrada fam√≠lia hear it ringing in the distance fabulous we felt very welcomed was sad to leave,1
1829,the hotel is located only a few blocks walking distance from beaches although in a rather industrial aera no problem to walk the staff of the hotel was exceptionel very customer oriented and friendly this is true for the reception teams as well as the people servicing,1
1830,the location is the only thing lacking at this hotel the building rooms food pool and roof are all very nice you can take a walk to the beach and there is quite a bit of interesting street art nearby but all the tourist spots require a walk to the metro and longer metro ride,1
1831,i have been in this hotel for a meeting it beautiful and it has a very polite staff good breakfast and i liked the rooftop perfect to drink something in the end of the day room and bathroom are big clean and confortable good experiencebyeeeeeeeefranc,1
1832,unfortunately we can not recommend a stay at the renaissance barcelona hotel our room had an incredible smell to it it seemed to get worse as the night went on since we were not staying but one night and had quite a bit of luggage in tow we chose to deal with it rather than requesting a change of room the trash from the previous guest was never emptied and what appeared to be the water pipes woke us multiple times throughout the night the overall appearance of the hotel is very beautiful and the front desk staff very kind however our overall room experience left us looking for a different hotel for our next stay in barcelona,0
1833,the hotel is extremely conveniently located close to the metro and placa de catalunya our room was clean and and there were lots of restaurants right in the vicinity would definitely stay here again,1
1834,the marriott hotel is very beautiful it has a terrific lobby with about large square leather white ottomans with beautiful pillows throw around never seen this before this is a nice sitting area to eat and or drink the menu is nice they have one of the best white sangria i have ever tasted there a small gym with treadmills and a standing weight machine water and apples are available there is a spa never used but they an amazing roof top bar it is a stunning view of the whole city there a bar to order drinks and food it is great for selfies the rooms are very nice but small some rooms have a nice view and some have a blank walk usually rooms in the etc are rooms with the wall but the location is amazing there are cute quaint tasty small restaurants all around small coffee shops also blocks from the hotel is the one of the main streets with tons and tons of shopping out the door of the hotel to left on the opposite side of street there is a great grocery store floors the hotel restaurant is nice only had breakfast there try the thai restaurant blocks away called thai barcelona enjoy,1
1836,we have just returned from a night midweek break at the renaissance hotel in barcelona the reception and surrounding inside areas of the hotel are stylishly decorated there is a roof top bar area which gives you amazing views of the city we had an executive suite on the first floor which came with a coffee machine which only had one type of coffee and complimentary mini bar however the mini bar only had water beers and coke drinks inside we have stayed at other star hotels and the mini bars have been full with a selection of food and drinks inside so we were a little disappointed with this one the room was a good size however would not call it an executive suite it was just a slightly bigger room than a standard room the bathroom was really nice however there was only one dressing gown and one pair of complimentary slippers when they knew of us were staying there the room was cleaned and towels changed everyday the breakfast was adequate but nothing special which we had included with our room booking it was expensive if you had to pay extra it has a gym area and spa which we did use and there was supposed to be a pool however all we found was a small water feature on the floor the reception staff were very helpful and friendly especially andrea who made us feel welcome i would recommend this hotel however we would prefer a,1
1837,i stayed here for two nights before a cruise i really enjoyed the hotel the room was clean and very quiet with a large bathroom there was free speedy throughout the facility the staff was friendly and efficient the hotel offers an excellent free buffet breakfast with a variety of hot and cold foods breakfast is served in a floor restaurant that offers an enjoyable panoramic view of the intersection below from very large windows there a beautiful outdoor terrace bar on the floor with a nice view of the city best of all it in a great location within walking distance of many of the city highlights highly recommended,1
1838,stayed at this hotel several nights on our recent visit to barcelona and had a very good experience the hotel was clean and the room was more than adequate for our needs with a very comfortable bed the service was very good especially at the front desk the hotel is centrally located in the heart of the city close to sights and restaurants this hotel maybe a little pricy for some but it satisfied our needs the buffet breakfast was very good with many selections of food all in all a very good hotel in the heart of the city,1
1839,i like this hotel for large and clean enough staff to serve lots of in the center of breakfast has multiple mini market beside the hoteli will definitely will book it again,1
1840,when we arrived our to our first room there was a musty odor we waited and thought that it might air out eventually after showering before a cocktail party we were attending the bathroom flooded the flood was not from a leak but rather poor during a shower water accumulates on the lip of the tub and because of poor design the water travels around the tub and onto the floor no way to prevent short of not using the shower when we called guest services which was difficult since none of the buttons worked and there was no instructions regarding hotel services and explained the situation a maintenance person was dispatched and quickly informed us of what we already knew the problem was not anything he could fix because it was a construction problem we were then moved to another arrival to our second room we found an extremely cold environment degrees celsius we promptly set the thermostat to degrees and left for our cocktail party for which we were already late after the cocktail party and dinner we returned to our room to find the temperature still degrees despite the degree setting we promptly called guest services again easier this time since the phone buttons worked and were told to turn off the and open the windows to warm it up that worked until it became too hot and humid at about am turned the back on only to have it cool to instead of the degrees it,0
1841,i stayed here for days on business the rooms are ok bedding to a high quality but the rooms are little out of date the service is good and the bar terrace is great with good love music from a marriott perspective they need to improve marriott on line check in no requests are answered and no one ever answered any chat messages,1
1842,worst marriott property i have stayed at as a platinum lifetime elite i have visited many marriott branded hotels in my travels other renaissance hotels stays have been perfect there was nothing right about this stay with my family rooms let first talk about customer courtesy at the front there was none with the employee that checked us in nothing that we had requested and was confirmed happened rooms were not on the same if you had planned ahead in assigning the rooms this would have happened we were then told although our reservation confirmation said breakfast included that only people would get breakfast and the other would have to i never get upset but the manner in witch this was told to me was shameful almost yelling at me of course i backed away no sense in disputing this with that person when we got to the room again not on the same floor the exhaust from the kitchen was blowing up in front of our window and there was a smell in the room so they were able to move us to the same floor that one of the rooms was on wonder why we did get that room to begin with however this room had no chair to sit in but it was near the other room the smell of sewer was throughout the hotel especially on the floor and our room the hotel said they can do nothing about it there were just too many missteps,0
1843,this was our visit to this hotel and again the quality of service was second to none can not fault this hotel the staff are so amazing and committed to the guests and daniela our waitresses were excellent and so professional julia alejandro roger and gis√®le were so helpful full of knowledge and extremely friendly can ask anything to the staff they will assist you anyway they can you again we will be back beaufils and family,1
1844,my wife is a heat seeking missile for the truly special things in life you know those things that sit at the intersection of great price and fantastic quality it no mean feat then that gran hotel la florida sits among her list of favorite places to stay from to expect a sterling quality of service from everyone the whole staff radiates a sense of pride at their jobs and for the place that they work in they expect to serve you well and they expect that they will be good at do always like dining in the hotel but you should for this hotel the views of barcelona make up for the lack of proximity to most of the barcelona attractions that because the hotel is nestled atop mt tibidabo it overlooks barcelona that means you trade easy access to barcelona hot spots for the view and some particularly enjoyed the view over breakfast an opulent affair spanning all the spreads from cuts of artisanal sausage to custom made omelettes to racks of sweet buns and breakfast meats galore i particularly enjoyed having a drink and looking at la sagrada familia still imposing from a rooms themselves are very large and very comfortable i stayed in parisian hotel rooms as large as the bathroom in our room in gran hotel la florida the turndown service even sets the system to play classical tunes as one gets ready for bed our room featured a balcony from which i could check,1
1845,the staff made us feel welcome there was no query they could not solve and they were very polite the room was very clean nice pool with rooftop view will be going back to stay at this hotel again hopefully when i book my next barca trip,1
1846,lovely stay good location staff very friendly only downside was the pool was tiny but it was the end of the world would recommend this hotel to anyone breakfast was good staff were always helpful erica was superb she helped a lot with the a couple of issues we had with the internet which was working nothing was too much would definitely stay again,1
1847,nice hotel close to the metro and renfe direct connection with airport and the train station clean rooms with everything needed nice breakfast also my children liked very much the pool area on the roof very helpful and supportive staff many thanks for our days in barcelona,1
1848,highly recommended rooms are lovely staff are so helpful and friendly metro and taxis easily accessible beach is a little distance away but easy enough to get to with there services we used metro brought a ticket for got red from clot to urquinaona and then yellow for two stops to barcelona the a min walk to the beach sounds alot but it so quick and easy or taxi is the hotel has a pool which is lovely but only beds it would be good if they got a few more but not essential as most people go to the beach,1
1849,very friendly welcoming and accommodating staff great location close to many restaurants supermarkets and metro quiet very comfortable bedding and family friendly would highly recommend catalonia albeniz,1
1850,great staff very helpful i needed directions to different locations they were very patient and helped as much as they was a taxi strike and the staff helped me understand the metro and the area where i needed to get off and back on,1
1851,we stayed nights at this hotel we were made to feel very welcome and all the staff were so friendly and and helpful the rooms were very clean and comfortable the breakfasts were excellent and had everything you could want the metro was very near and sagrada familia was minutes walk away a huge thank you to erika and all the staff for making our stay a happy one we will definitely go back,1
1852,stay was great close to everything wish you guys had onsite parking however i understand that not always possible reception staff outstanding reception staff deal with some incredibly rude patrons while i was staying at the hotel i witnessed some very unreasonable patrons your staff members have the patience of a saint always trying to accommodate the most unreasonable demands thank you,1
1853,this place was wonderful it was clean and comfortable the location was very close to everything and the cab stop was right outside the door the front desk helped plan activities and ordered tours,1
1854,i have been in quite a lot of hotels but this one is certainly above average the rooms are clean and spacious enough with very high ceilings the rooftop bar and pool are really nice after a day of traveling or walking in the city and the personnel are very kind and helpful last but not least the breakfast is great,1
1855,the hotel is in the centre of the city however very quiet and is in a very prestigious place the sky bar is great with the pool overlooking the sagrada familia staff were great rooms are very clean and comfortable,1
1856,we could have asked for anything better from his hotel it was a short walk no longer than from las ramblas it was very mature and relaxed hotel and the staff were phenomenal very helpful and cheerful we were upgraded for free to club havana which meant in the morning we were able to get free croissants just for our level which was a bonus considering the breakfast was euros the roof top bar was nice and overlooked a few over hotel the bar sold lovely cocktails which we had every night when we was in barcelona city we used the metro to get around very simple to use we got a i believe which was journeys for to conclude we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel as we was sure on how great it would be but we had an amazing stay at this modern hotel and me and my partner would definitely recommend to anyone especially couples,1
1857,really enjoyed our stay at this hotel very modern and clean a bit of a walk away from the main attractions but if the weather is nice who cares we stayed when the at jean festival was on so we had a great view from the rooftop bar next time we stay i will be tempted to upgrade the room to one with the private balcony as they looked great,1
1858,great location very clean nice big room small pool with views great breakfast and best of all is the restaurant angle which is michelin star and there have a nice bar all round fab hotel stayed twice and love it,1
1859,i stayed at cram hotel with my wife and we had a really great experience location was great you have a lot of restaurants and bars nearby and you also blocks away from passeig de gracia the hotel is nice clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful the room is not huge but it clean and comfortable the bathroom is great as recommendable,1
1860,nice hotel very accommodating clean and fair price staff are friendly and know english do bring an adapter for outlet the pool is a small size but it makes up for it with the bar on deck check in time is they allowed us to leave our cases behind locked doors for early arrival,1
1861,its a great hotel so close to the city center lots of light a very nice terrace to have a cup of coffee great staff great coffee shops around it has it all i cant say that is pricey is not you pay a good amount of money and you receive great quality and location i can assure that is a great place to enjoy barcelona,1
1863,we booked this hotel for a meeting the meeting rooms are great food were very good especially the meats rooms were so modern and clean the pool area is a great area to relax after meetings our customers were also happy with it hotel is also in a good location walk to passeig de gracia highly recommended,1
1864,this hotel is centrally located just a few blocks from la rambla placa de catalunya and several gaudi sites the rooms were comfortable and clean though small we had just barely enough room for a spare bed for a child we also thoroughly enjoyed the pool and the staff were really helpful it could use a bit of updating but overall we had a great experience here,1
1865,very impressed with this doubletree good restaurant bar in lobby nice size rooms very comfortable with a beautiful swimming pool highly recommended decent last minute price king size bedroom,1
1866,stay of nights there as hhonors diamond you should be treated fairly unfortunately not at all no welcome for breakfast the hotel do a segregation of hhonors member on the underground with a limited food and untasteful moreover the staff is far to be professional and spend more time to chat and joke than take care of customer this hotel is not at all as hilton level and should be removed from hilton group,0
1867,we stayed from the july at the alexandra it was a good week we love the hotel and it location just off passeig de gracia just over for the stay not bad value the staff are very helpful friendly and we got nice fresh warm cookies on arrival in the hotel the bar downstairs is a great spot for chilling relaxing and having a quite drink with some local food we had a nice view over the swimming pool it does get kind of busy but we managed to get sun loungers no problem only down side the cleaning ladies start early and they can be quite noisy and they feel like they are practically in the room with you,1
1868,first of all i would like to say that i am a hilton honors member for quite some time and have thoroughly enjoyed most of hilton hotels where i had stayed also i would like to make it known that i very rarely review any hotel however my experience in this case has been so extremely bad that i felt an obligation to my fellow travelers this hotel quite frankly does not deserve the hilton designation when someone looks at hilton hotel he has trust that the franchise will guarantee a certain level of quality and experience at this hotel was a total disaster from the very beginning i arrived at the barcelona airport at on thursday morning and when booking this hotel of course it threw it into the next day when i arrived i said that i would pay for wednesday night plus the prepaid night for thursday they gave me a room which had no air conditioning when i complained they told me that the minimum it could be set at was when i continued to complain they finally switched me to another room at that morning i talked to the manager mr dalmau and was told that i would have to switch to a third room in this room the air conditioning worked well however there was a family with several young children and infants that were screaming crying and running in the hallways despite my complaints there were no apologies only a very arrogant attitude,0
1869,just had an excellent steak meal in sollemillio fantastic service by vidan harlan and particularly ali very friendly and welcoming beautifully evening on the roof terrace very relaxing away from the street bustle,1
1871,exceptional boutique hotel located in the heart of barcelona close proximity to numerous dining and sightseeing options the courtyard pool and patio lounge were a nice option for relaxing after a day of sightseeing and before going to dinner that evening what made this particular property shine was the staff the level of service and attention to detail at this hotel is unusual at this price point however it was comparable to that of most star hotels i have stayed in,1
1873,this is a very nice hotel the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful it is an easy walk to the subway a special thank you to ali in the terrace bar who gave us exceptional service for hilton honors members there is a nice continental breakfast and the server there was very kind and helpful we had a junior suite with a beautiful balcony and nice view,1
1874,the room was clean and the taff service minded it was as now noise from the street or other guests the hotel had a geat location it was handicapped friendly one of the better four stars hotel i stayed in,1
1875,i have enjoyed hilton hotels for business travel and decided to book the alexander doubletree in barcelona expecting the same standards i experienced in the past this hotel was extremely disappointing first i received an email that they would not be able to accommodate their standard time as the hotel was in full capacity and my room may not be ready in time luckily my train was arriving late to barcelona so that did not present an issue for this second upon entering my hotel room a terrible stench permeated the room i opened the window to air out the room but the smell would not dissipate third the bathtub did not drain properly and water filled up the tub as i showered i had arrived late to the hotel because of my delayed train so waited until the next morning to let the front desk know about these issues the next morning i called the front desk and asked for both items to be checked upon returning to the hotel in the evening neither of those items had been fixed my stay at the barcelona was short so i did not call again and mentioned it to the front desk during the person at the front desk questioned whether i had made a mistake about the room not being checked i was extremely disappointed as a hilton honors member of the room and the lack of service provided the only positive to this hotel is that it is close,0
1876,this was our hotel for the final few days of the trip it was the cleanest and most elegant of the properties we stayed at in spain the location is great because you are in the quieter part of the main stay area of barcelona great location for shopping dining and touristy type walks the rooms are big the beds were comfortable and the best part if the warm cookies that they have hidden behind the front desk,1
1877,loved this hotel great location lovely room nice facility the staff was super helpful from the start including the front desk people who gave excellent refs for restaurants and sightseeing and the restaurant staff estefania and elena who were happy help us plan our last evening in barcelona,1
1878,booked through a third party supplier hotel withheld intial deposit gbp as expected the remaining amount was then settled on check in with nil balance to be paid was then charged again for the nights on day of check out without my knowledge deposit not released and then charged again on day after check out they admitted their mistake in recharging my card when was meant to be refunded but their response was that bank wo let them refund i am now nearly euro out of pocket for this trip and have not refunded any funds do not stay here,0
1879,we stayed here for nights and i ca fault this hotel at all perfect location for us walking distance to all major sights and it was quiet in the evenings but not too far from the marina and la rambla marina was walk perfect if you like a stroll in the summer evenings and some lovely restaurants along the marina la rambla is a walk the hotel staff were friendly and helpful room was spacious with a small balcony without sun loungers however nice if you wanted to leave the door to the balcony open of an evening cleaned well daily although it was annoying to have to always ask for tea coffee and milk should be standard in a hotel when cleaned the terrace is a lovely asset to this hotel rooftop pool is so good just what you need after a day of sightseeing,1
1881,very nice stay would return again the service was wonderful we lost our drink tickets somewhere on way to sagrada familia and they replaced them for us no problem the bed was comfy and bathroom was awesome with a bidet even enjoyed roomservice and it was very affordable,1
1882,hotel was very clean and comfortable in a perfect location being only a slow minute walk from placa catalunya which is the main tourist centre in room was good we were on the club floor which had fresh pastries each morning which we ate so we could get straight on with the did eat in the hotel at all but we used the lobby bar which was great but it would have been nice to have a pianist or some more background music the bar is located at the bottom of an atrium that runs the entire height of the hotel the building design of the hotel is very interesting and there is also a pool on the roof that i sure would be nice in the hotter months would definitely book again,1
1883,hotel is located blocks from plaza catalunya which makes most of the city accessible by foot or short trip room was nice we were on second floor facing the busy street but the room was soundproofed we did hear or feel a thing while windows were closed breakfast was good and the service was pleasant and helpful we paid slightly more than some other nearby places we might have found but were not upset when we spent time there it has a nice rooftop pool and snack bar,1
1884,being only a minute walk from placa catalunya and las ramblas the hotel is in a perfect location when we arrived we were told that our room had been upgraded for free we still not sure why so we now had a premium club room with a queen size bed and free croissants in the morning the rooftop bar and pool were great with a very chilled atmosphere we did eat breakfast at the hotel as it was quite pricey however there is a shop opposite the hotel open hours selling anything you need the room was very clean spacious and equipped with tea and coffee and a hot water machine one thing i say is that the room was a bit dark the window was quite small and the lights were very bright however we were not bothered by it as we did spend much time in the room apart from at night the wifi is free but like with a lot of hotels it was very slow during peak times would definitely recommend this hotel for couples as it very peaceful and easy to get to,1
1885,friendly staff rooftop and outfit pool was the best value good with family room although more expensive then the breakfast is recommended to add a complaint was dealt with in an excellent manner we will return,1
1886,i returned home last night from a night stay at the silken gran hotel havana i have to say this is probably one of if not the best hotels i have ever stayed in the reception staff upgraded our room to a junior suite upon arrival this was situated on the floor just below the pool and rooftop terrace area the room itself was absolutely stunning everything was fresh and contemporary and most importantly impeccably clean towels robes slippers and even a towel to take up to the pool were provided there was also a fridge in the room which was very useful to keep items such as milk and water in although the bar and pool was situated directly above us this was not a problem as noise levels were minimal the only thing i would say about the room is there was a view only a wall to look out on again this did prove to be a problem as the view from the roof terrace is amazing you can even see the impressive w hotel and sea views in the distance we had breakfast and a couple of evening meals at the hotel and they were delicious and in comparison to restaurant prices around barcelona very reasonable as for the drinks there is a good selection of cocktails and of course sangria i visited with my mum and she would highly recommend the mojito sin for a refreshing drink at the end of a day exploring the,1
1887,the hotel is conveniently located at the heart of its just a few blocks away from rambla catalunya and passage de gracia the rooms are a bit tight but nonetheless it has enough space to move around staff are very friendly and helpful they make an effort to communicate in english which is highly definitely recommend this place and given the chance to go back will stay here again,1
1888,stayed in a hotel for several nights with my family nice location very friendly staff cosy atmosphere excellent service rooms are comfortable clean breakfest is ok the hotel is close to the center metro a bunch of restoraunts and cafes,1
1889,it a very good hotel staff are very accommodating veronica is very helpful the place is near the centre just min walked metro is also accessible as well as the bus the hotel is clean and the breakfast is very good i will stay here again when we go back to barcelona,1
1890,we stayed one night in the hotel balmoral and found it very satisfactory the room was comfortable and spacious and reasonably priced for a four star hotel the staff were efficient and helpful the only quibble i have is that we were not allowed access our room when we arrived about an hour and a half before the official time unless we paid an early fee although the room was clearly ready this is the first time i come across this policy and it was the welcome i expected,1
1892,i had a lovely stay in this boutique hotel located in close proximity to the sagrada familia the room was lovely and clean and the staff so pleasant i would like to thank veronica at front desk for her professional and kind service i would definitely come back,1
1893,nice room and good equipment kindly personal and very good breakfast just a little far from the center but near the metro and the main bus lines for visiting go there and you should be happy recommended,1
1894,i can t complaine about anything the staff was always available and very nice room was clean bed comfortable and in the last floor there is a nice spa unfortunately i didn t have time to try it position is good next to diagonal and well connected you can also go on foot to plaza de catalunya and las,1
1895,we had a great experience at hotel balmoral lovely spacious modern clean rooms no issues with anything great location in the city for us close to diagonal metro station hardly heard anything from other guests perhaps the roof terrace could benefit from allowing food drinks out there but honestly in a city with as much to do as barcelona it was no hardship would definitely stay here again,1
1896,very good location near to the diagonal avenue and near the best stores of barcelona rooms are very confortables and the attention was very good maybe the breakfast need more options very clean and all the people working in the hotel are very kindle,1
1897,very good hotel it self with service and do need any transportation to see so many they were giving away some drinks daily was very good refreshing stuff in i recommend this hotel to everyone,1
1898,the hotel is nice and clean rooms are a good size and the beds are more like the english equivalent to a king sized rather than a double as advertised the location was brilliant a minute walk to casa batllo and la pedrera la rambla is around a minute walk,1
1899,perfect place for exploring bcn rooms are not huge but big enough for some days but we booked a double bed of queen size they first gave us a room with a bed of cm width ridiculous wide enough fit two little children the receptionist offered us a wider bed for thus you make money,1
1900,nice hotel with friendly staff and clean facilities my only critisism would be that the buffet breakfast is spread out around the restaurant a little so you have to go hunting for things which makes things interesting in the morning but the food was good,1
1901,the room was very clean great breakfast perfect location quiet close to the stores restaurants and the metro friendly staffs specially veronica always willing to help you they scheduled all our tours it made it easy to just enjoyed our time in barcelona,1
1902,really really expensive for the general quality of the hotel poor breakfast quite simple room very poor bathroom no service available in the bar and the price really high i would not recommend this hotel,0
1903,if you want something centrally located and away from the hustle and bustle of las ramblas this is the place to be clean spacious and just far enough away from big touristy crowds excellent location especially if you would like to immerse yourself in one of the old villages and be a part of the plaza life gracia was an awesome suburb to eat in and is close to metro we took advantage of the nice rooftop patio in between touring around and was great staff at hotel balmoral were also extremely helpful and knowledgeable muchos gracias,1
1904,something went wrong with our booking through airtours but the staff at belmoral let us sleep over one night and have breakfast buffet before finding our booking the next morning strongly recommend the hotel really nice room and breakfast buffet on top of that,1
1905,our stay at the hotel balmoral was excellent from the start we were greeted with a smile and much helpful information about where we were staying and how they could be of help to us during our stay taxis tickets the breakfast was wonderful serving both american and barcelona foods the location had easy access to the metro and bus lines along with easy walking routes the staff was friendly and helpful we enjoyed our stay very much and would return,1
1906,hotel balmoral hb is in a prime location for shopping long walks delicious paella even more delicious sangria and of course very close to la pedrera casa mila nearly every staff member i interacted with at hb was welcoming and accommodating our needs and requests the cleaning services were impeccable the cleaning staff was so generous and we never felt pressure to leave at a certain time or not return to our room at a certain time these amazing people were like ninjas great work i would highly recommend a stay at hb and be sure to include the hotel breakfast in your purchase the food is delicious with a wonderful mix of spanish cuisine like spanish omelette and my favorite pa amb tomaquet and classic european favorites like nutella and croissants plus this hotel has central air which is quite a luxury in european hotel and particularly important for fussy americans traveling during the summer months what a bonus wonderful facility location staff and experience,1
1907,my husband young adult daughter and i stayed five nights at hotel balmoral and loved the comfort of the triple room the delicious breakfast and wonderful service by the front desk staff the location was great as well,1
1908,well appointed friendly staff great room with nice balcony and very comfortable bed the staff was excellent and helpful and offered suggestions on restaurants tourist spots etc great restaurant around the corner called mossul we found this hotel to be centrally located allowing us to get around with ease i would stay here again,1
1909,no king beds even though they confirmed king charge for ice desk service is not nice air did not work we told the front desk and they said it takes a while to kick in we only stayed days but we have yet seen it kick in front desk just did not care i bet you they even had kings beds but they did not want to bother putting us in the room that we reserved,0
1910,hotel very close to the action euro ride to las ramblas great sites shopping and restaurants within walking distance friendly staff and good complimentary breakfast adequate sized rooms that are meticulously cleaned daily,1
1911,nice hotel with very helpful staff the young lady on the desk gave us great information and recommended a very good tapas by the harbour the room and bathroom was of a good standard and my only criticism was the air conditioning was finding it hard to cope,1
1912,i have been coming to this hotel since and it is by far one of the best hotels i have stayed in barcelona great location walking distance to metro and plaza catalu√±a staff is very professional clean and comfy highy recommended,1
1913,hotel balmoral is located near a metro and bus station which makes your transportation easy with big cozy and very clean rooms amazing breakfast with lot of local products the staff very helpful and everyone was with a big smile all the time it was an amazing stay and the hotel is highly recommended by all means,1
1914,this was a day trip with my husband and year old was excellent and pool area was great to relax and our son had a great time meeting new were spacious and quiet and beds really location and staff were recommend this hotel,1
1915,we really enjoyed our stay here only regret was we did spend enough time relaxing by the pool as we were so busy exploring barcelona the room was very clean and comfortable great bed and it had a good size bathroom with excellent shower we caught the aerobus from the airport to the place de catalonia and then took a five minute walk across the square to the hotel the hotel is situated slightly away from the square so when you enter you escape the hustle and bustle of barcelona into a little oasis even the pool area feels quieter and calmer even when it busy personally i would have liked a bigger pool but it was fine for a gentle relaxing swim we had breakfast across the road at a great spanish cafe as we only wanted coffee and croissants so we did eat in the hotel overall a very enjoyable stay,1
1916,we booked this while in the cab from the barcelona airport read other reviews and it really was perfect location close to the main hub of ramblas street great shopping restaurants easy walk to the marina and beach and the gothic was clean the staff super bus tours just a minute walk away too,1
1917,superb location with excellent and cleanliness highly recommendable for families business partners or even to share with a friend though pool is small the area is nice in terms of sitting and having a cool drink on the terrace the lobby has excellent food too the wine was exquisite and overall an excellent experience,1
1918,third time here would stay anywhere else very professional team at the catalonia ramblas location was excellent will defiantly be back again breakfast was delicious we loved the pool and having lunch on the terrace,1
1920,excellent stay will definitely stay at catalonia ramblas again very well located to lots of attractions breakfast excellent with vast choice very clean rooms and very comfortable rest of hotel spotless love the occasional seating areas dotted around my friends and i had a brilliant time,1
1921,location location location large clean updated rooms with excellent amenities very friendly and helpful staff small gym has limited exercise equipment but serves the purpose fine for vacationers excellent new spa and sauna facilities,1
1922,excellent location friendly and helpful staff the room was luxurious and the afternoon chocolate was a lovely treat pool and roof terrace were hidden treasures that we thoroughly enjoyed would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning on my next visit to barcelona,1
1924,best location next to ramblas passeig de gracias and walking distance to the market rooms were great and spacious washrooms were super nice not much for views but you do really stay in your room while you in barcelona definitely recommend this hotel to anyone,1
1925,great hotel central location very friendly helpful staff thanks to dafne on the reception the rooms were spotless beds were very comfortable the pool area was lovely and very welcome in the heat pool towels safe is free wifi also freewe did not try the hotel food there are lots of cafes and restaurants around the minutes walk to las ramblas the airport bus and hop on tourist bus both stop in the square around the corner,1
1927,people working there were brilliant helpful i would to name a few a like silvia natali and so onbagugae handlers all good the only thing i was abit not happy the toilet could be up grade it and so on,1
1928,i knew from the minute i walked through the doors of this hotel that there was an issue you could sense the atmosphere amongst the staff now i booked a two night stay for four people some time ago they charged me for the privilege on may i asked if there was any chance i could have a check in instead of the normal they duly came back and said it should be a problem but they would see how things were on the day i arrived at from a cruise and spent the next six hours waiting on my room all with young children they kept saying come back in minutes every time we asked which was after and got all stroppy every time we did i accept that there is a check in just say that an early check in is not possible better still and i said this to reception why not ask housekeeping if they could make a family room a priority as there was a family with young children waiting all the while guests were arriving and getting their rooms early nobody told me that the bar was a building site banging and crashing all day and dust everywhere i would have booked if i had known they also saw fit to remove my spare room key that i had the audacity to leave in the room to leave the air con on shame on me so they just left me with one key the,0
1929,the whole experience was disappointing we were made to wait for minutes before our room was ready and this is after the check in time of there was a line of people waiting and we had to queue three times before our room was finally ready we entered a warm stuffy room where the air conditioning has not been switched on it is definitely not what i had expected based on the review i will definitely not be coming back be ready to be disappointed,0
1930,stayed here for nights in july the staff was very friendly and helpful the breakfast was good they had a person to make omelettes the rooms were generous size and modern overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay downtown,1
1931,we had nine of us staying here for one night upon arriving in barcelona en route to a cruise our travel agent made the recommendation based on the location in the middle of the city and the price point everything went fine my family not used to hotels were a bit taken aback by the old style heavy keys that you have to leave with the front desk upon departing it was a holiday in barcelona that saturday so all of the shops were closed in the neighborhood therefore we really did get a great feel for the rooftop pool was refreshing and the deck was nice pool is very small and fills up quickly they did have much in the way of service at the upstairs morning breakfast was typical european not fantastic but suitable overall it was fine for a one nigh stay the rooms are very austere and i do think i would choose it for an extended stay in barcelona,1
1932,we loved our trip to barcelona and enjoyed our stay at this classic and beautiful hotel the views from the rooftop was amazing both at day and night the location was perfect the rooms and staff great highly recommend,1
1934,the hotel is a business and is centrally located to both the barri gotic area and to the exiample section of town as well a number of good shops and boutiques are nearby on passeig de gracia and el corte ingles is on the nearby placa de catalunya the hotel public areas are beautifully decorated staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions on places to eat our room was very nicely furnished with decent lighting for reading and with double sinks in the bathroom even though we faced the street and were on the floor the room was quiet that being said a white noise app on your phone will solve any problems anyone else might have the breakfast buffet offers a wide selection of items fruit was fresh as were the breads,1
1935,wonderful hotel perfect location with access to great dining options and sights hotel was extremely clean the gentleman at the front desk was extremely friendly and approachable he made us feel welcomed from the moment we stepped into the hotel great value option,1
1936,if i am back to barcelona i will visit this hotel again definitely i recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit barcelona but the noise of subway train was little bit annoying when i tried to sleep because i can feel and hear when the subway train comes near,1
1938,absolutely loved this hotel prefect location just opposite the passage de gracia metro however we found that most places could be walked to pool area is fab for relaxing and taking in views of the whole city book directly with the hotel and get the best offers half price breakfasts which are incredible and a free drink on arrival the only thing we found was our room wasnt ready until which meant us havin to wander around lovely barcelona for a while as we wait but this was due to their late checkout you dont have to checkout until which worked for us on our last day very just something to keep in mind when i go back id maybe ring the hotel beforehand and try get an early room if you are arriving early,1
1939,hotel is situated at the central part of barcelona you can go walking by passeig de garcia and reach placa catalunya catalunya square suitable for shopping there are a lot of brand shops on this street in a five minutes of walking you can reach the famous balue home projected by gaudy,1
1940,lovely hotel with a dipping pool on the roof top where you have also a superb view the hotel is very clean and everything was well organized but the best is the location of the hotel super close to plaza catalunya and pg de grazia with metro connection stations to the beach a minutes walk to la rambla we would be def come back to avenida palace,1
1941,the best location you ever dream everything is near by the hotel its make the vacation the evening its must to get to the pool that in the roof of the hotel there is a bar and with a cold beer with the view you can enjoy from a quality time,1
1942,the room was terrible it was so small with no sunlight and ages old carpet the pictures on trip advisor and other party sites are deceptive there might be some rooms which are better but the room that was offered to me was not at all i would have booked if i had seen earlier me and my friend arrived here at around midnight and as soon as we saw the room we decided to leave the receptionist gave us another room to check out but it was no different so we asked him to cancel the reservation and give us our money back which was around he said due to their hours cancellation policy he could do the money back with all these back and forth by this time it was and since we paid so much already we stayed in the night we stayed in with a suffocating feeling the whole night and the old smell on top of this there was only a thin sheet to cover no comforter or anything and the bed was like a box spring so disappointed not how i wanted my vacation to start i would not recommend this hotel,0
1943,perfectly located to walk down larambla shop in exiample and walk to the beach ornate lobby great views from the rooftop bar and pool well refurbished rooms and quality products in the room had a lovely last minute stay via hotel tonight and enjoyed fabulous service highly recommended for an easy and comfortable stay,1
1945,to start off with this hotel is right in the middle of barcelona and exactly where you want to be the hotel was very beautiful and from the outside very well kept we are a family of four so went with the family room which essentially is paying for two rooms our nightly fee was for this price we had high expectations once in our room we noticed a horrible smell coming from the vents that was definitely something deceased in the ceiling we immediately alerted the front desk and nothing was done therefore all four of us slept in one of the rooms as our kids did sleep in the other because of the smell the next morning i went down to talk to the front desk i was told there were no rooms available to move into therefore i booked a room at the fairmont for the price of this hotel upon check out they magically said let me talk to the manager the manager was very kind and went and acknowledged the state and smell of the room he did offer us an upgraded room but by that time it was too late as we had already booked a different room at the fairmont being told previously told there were no other rooms available we were not offered any type of discount and paid full price for the night we stayed even though we only used one of the two rooms we are currently now at the,0
1946,we booked a family room with rooms interconnected it is a classic and charming hotel with swimming pool and bar on roof top not busy that gives you a great city are spacious and very clean breakfast buffet has many fresh and good choices location is excellent it on busy commercial street you do hear any noise though from hotel rooms with lots of shops bars restaurants and walking distance to casa batllo and la pedrera if you come with a car there are public parking garage book online in advance to pay a lot less just min take a cab if you have little kids to avoid walk they are cheap and air conditioned so far all the cab drivers we met are all honest and did not over charge look up google map suggested distance and price you all have a pleasant stay like we did we will definitely come again for this beautiful sunny and friendly city,1
1947,we stayed at the el avenida palace hotel for nights during out time in barcelona we had suites as there was myself my husband and our teenage daughter and year old son wonderful location clean and large bathrooms and extremely comfortable beds to collapse into after a day on your feet exploring barcelona the hotel building is beautiful with lovely stairwells but also a lift for convenience our son enjoyed the pool great breakfast selection i would definately stay at this hotel if i ever went back to nz,1
1948,we stayed at this hotel before our cruise guests with rooms for two nights a significant investment we went hotel directly from our international flight we knew check in was til later afternoon but hoped for a place to freshen up a bit it was like for us we returned to the hotel at and for our family with rooms we only had ready at we were late for our pm reservations to sagrada familia and no one seemed to care others were waiting for rooms also by sleeping in the lobby i not sure how difficult it would be to have enough staff to get rooms turned around more quickly especially for that first night after international travel the hotel is beautiful loved it and the rooftop area i wish i had felt more cared for in the check in process,0
1949,we booked our stay about hours before our check in time we booked it through the app hotel tonight we got a fantastic deal through this app we paid euro for our night stay we did look at another for nights the following week on the same days and it would have cost us euro so the deal we got was brilliant the hotel was brilliant too very friendly helpful staff lovey clean comfortable rooms and bathrooms a nice rooftop area small but lovely the location was brilliant just a minute walk from the main airport bus drop off in the would highly recommend this hotel to others,1
1950,old school glamour with a nicely renovated room friendly staff great location near plenty of transportation options lots to see and eat within easy walk pool was small but just fine for us would recommend,1
1951,excellent value for money we had two rooms for similar price to cramped single rooms to sleep four in paris london and san location right next to a metro station and easy walking distance to most key locations beautifully presented hotelgood breakfast in beautiful dining rooftop pool and bar,1
1952,excellent location and star service worth value for money recommend hotel for any one want to stay in center of barcelona close to place de cataluyna and metro station perfect location for shopping,1
1953,stayed with family at the hotel avenida was very central really close to the ramblas hotel was clean lovely rooms comfortable beds very new and modern bathrooms with shower and bath generous with very nice bathroom amenities good breakfast swimming pool with a beautiful rooftop with amazing views when we mentioned we were celebrating two birthdays they put champagne in the rooms which was appreciated we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel,1
1954,went there for a week vacation with my family the hotel staff was very nice and helpful at all times cleanliness was good and rooftop bar and pool made the hotel experience awesome for the hole family,1
1955,first sheets are dirty second i found bugs on bed which made me stay up and not have a metro goes under the hotel so it like the sound or the shake of it can easily be felt till late at night and early morning i do not recommend this hotel you can have better for the same price and same area,0
1956,returned once again to this special hotel having so many fond memories selfies taken in front of the impressive elegant central staircase personnel extremely welcoming even to the point that we arrived very early was greeted with ice cold home made lemon drink wow we certainly appreciated that gesture after such a long and hot journey the location of hotel el avenida palace barcelona is superb within easy walking distance to las ramblas etc the plus side for our visit this year was the new roof terrace with heated swimming pool having a cocktail over looking barcelona the new restaurant with its fine cuisine excellent breakfast with a choice of hot and cold dishes which certainly sets you up for the day ahead highly recommended we can not wait to return to our favourite hotel,1
1957,excellent family run hotel with exceptional service attentive staff and perfect location for sightseeing very pleasantly surprised by this hotel has an amazing roof top terrace as well turn right from hotel and first left street leads straight to la rambla turn left from hotel and first right leads to the cathedral and gothic area this is the major shopping street in barcelona passieg de gracia which becomes portal of course turning left on passieg de gracia also leads to stores both high end and regular mango great restaurants within minutes if you book viator tours they leave from explore catalunya office which is about a min walk anonio gaudi casa battlo and la pedrera are on passieg de gracia min walk sagrada familia is about min walk book without hesitation you will not regret it,1
1958,we had a good stay here breakfast included is well worth it nice rooms very nice bathroom awesome roof top bar and pool perfect location to explore the city right beside shoppimg eating and subway,1
1959,we stayed in a family suite with our two teen daughters lovely room great linens large modern bathrooms staff is attentive and location is excellent just a block from plaza cataluyna and the rambla a block from passeig de gracia and close to the gothic quarter lots of taxis and public transport options are plentiful in the area but especially liked ciudad comtal in the corner nostrum for quick to go options and coffee and vinitus for tapas all are easy walking distance,1
1960,i choose this hotel because it was slightly removed from the bustle of downtown barcelona it was a great choice offering access to surrounding neighbourhoods an easy pleasant minute walk to the beach and convenient access to the a four points sheraton that delivers exactly what you expect i took rooms for my family and was very pleased with the rooms and the though was the service by everyone i met in particular i mention angelica of the front desk team to whom i ended up turning for any assistance including one persistently insoluble issue which she solved such great service and the location will see me select this property over more luxurious venues on a return visit,1
1962,i loved that this property was not in a touristy neighborhood easy walk to the beach and the metro the breakfast buffet was good and there is smoking patio out the back of the dining room we also had a refrigerator in the room,1
1963,ca say enough about the great team at this hotel they offer helpful advice and impeccable service as always the room was spotless and comfortable great value for starpoints too the location is outside of the main attractions but is an easy walk or taxi,1
1964,our family enjoyed a wonderful days in barcelona and we loved our stay at the sheraton four points the hotel was wonderfully situated and provided easy access to all the tourist sites while giving you a local experience in their emerging neighbourhood the surrounding restaurants were excellent and within a few minutes walk from your room while the rooms are modestly appointed they were clean and perfect for resting at night and parking suitcases during the day while you explore the city lastly the staff was excellent front desk waiters etc were all interested in making our experience positive i was very happy about our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time touring while visiting barcelona,1
1965,the hotel is located in the quiet residential part of barcelona which is a huge positive and within walking distance to the are several markets near for your basic purchases of water and snacks the room also has a mini fridge which worked out perfectly for us it was a pleasant stay with clean rooms and excellent housekeeping but it is a budget hotel so if you are looking for luxury this is the place for you,1
1966,the shore is only a few minutes away there is a great deal of food options down the road the staff was really great we really liked the bar the bartender was very nice i will stay here the next time i am in town,1
1967,the front desk staff is so very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful experience they were lovely spoke english and helped with tours and information the hotel is a min walk to the beach close to great restaurants and public rooms were comfortable and very clean i would definitely stay here and recommend this hotel to others,1
1969,the hotel is excellent in downtown area but not in walking distance of many tour sites like park guell they have taxis outside the hotel a lot of the time they also have a bus stop but they do run a lot so your better off with a taxi there is no free breakfast free breakfast is only if you have a platinum member in your room,1
1970,we stayed five nights at the four points we were given room but i wished for a better room more floor space given my hubby platinum status in the end the room was comfortable the bed was great and the linens are nice bathroom was comfortable although the shower around the glass base could use a little scrubbing the breakfast was nice with good food choices i really liked the grilled vegetables the staff is what makes this hotel top notch truly lovely and pleasant ladies and gentlemen the hotel location is good the tram is walking distance a shopping mall called glories and pla√ßa catalunya is not far by poblenou is right there with several restaurants it super safe the beach is about minutes on foot we had room service the first night and the food came super fast and was delicious we appreciated the daily water bottles we also rented a car through the hotel and the process was very simple recommend this hotel,1
1971,the hotel is located far away from the bustling touristy part of barcelona yet you have everything in the hotel and around for a nice relaxing stay the area has lots of restaurants and a shopping mall bogatelli beach very busy is in about minutes walk via a nice pedestrian route dotted with cafes and small shops taxis are not easy to catch on the street though we saw a couple parked just outside of the hotel as to our stay we stayed for nights and were pretty happy checkin and checkout were easy the front office staff is very nice and helpful the room size was ok for two adults breakfast was fresh and very good choice the manager and waiting staff were welcoming and helpful parking is available around the corner but you could park on the street even on the lane this was what we did all in all a very good choice if you want to stay away from the noise and traffic of the central barca,1
1973,we arrived in the evening and was tired from a long flight upon checking in we had to bring our own luggages upstairs no bellhop service and you have to squeeze yourself into these tiny elevators that can barely fit people me and my family had to take turns going up being a platinum spg member they upgraded us or so they say but the upgrade is the same type of room and just floors higher i needed some ice at one point and called the front desk if there are any ice dispensers which is typical of four point hotels but was told i need to go down to the to get it myself or they will charge a service fee if i want it brought up to the room the shower is so narrow that you need to be careful that you do not hit your was a situation where the people handling the breakfast table in the morning was getting fed up with the tour group from china who could not speak or understand english remarking that english is important wait a minute their bellhop can barely speak english when i asked for a taxi i understand that the hotel is a basic hotel but it should not be this bad,0
1974,the location is ideal for a lot of attractions in barcelona not only that but staff are very friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and modern and the rooftop pool and bar make for a good view and a nice resting point on a busy day a great choice,1
1975,glad we picked this hotel it a little out of the way for those wanting to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle but it a lovely walk to the beach and the city centre about mins the room was spacious and clean and the front desk were happy to store our bags before check in and after check out the rooftop bar is worth a visit the barmaid remembered our drinks after our first visit the breakfast was really good lots of choice and every member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful,1
1976,i traveled many destinations and would not recommend this hotel the entry to the hotel is terrible the front desk staff is untrained and is able to answer simple questions if you want to sleep comfortably i would not recommend staying here if you require a strong internet signal in your room i would not stay here if you prefer a cool room i would not stay here when heading up to the roof top bar i nearly fell into the elevator as a vacuum cleaner was left unattended in the elevator the roof top bar had grown men playing football that made it impossible to go into the pool without getting hit in the head the manager of the front desk argued with us regarding the city tax even though our book it receipt showed paid he insisted it was our problem to resolve and that we should pay again the beds are horrible st best see below,0
1977,this was a perfect choice for a quiet stay in barcelona away from the crowds it was perfectly located near the beach a minute walk the service at this hotel was excellent the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay the rooftop pool and bar were and the view was breathtaking the distance from the hotel to las ramblas was about minutes by car we would definitely go back,1
1978,we greatly enjoyed the food at this restaurant and would recommend it to those who are seeking some quick bites the view from the outdoor cafe was interesting as we overlooked the pool and a grand sculpture which i am still unsure of what it is called the cold soups were served in test tube type dishes and they were really good we had the beet and the cucumber soups the dishes were on the smaller side but that was fine with us i had the taco and loved it,1
1980,please please please ignore the miserable reviews below me i cant believe how some people can be so damn rude and lack so much common sense this is a lovely hotel yes its main purpose is being a business hotel but familys are still welcome ive stayed in a few business hotels now and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them just some peoples expectations are not realistic we stayed here for a week while exploring relaxing in barcelona and i wouldnt have picked anywhere else to stay stylish hotel throughout friendly staff regardless of previous comments and lovely breakfast we specifically didnt eat dinner here because of previous reviews and to be honest was glad as the downstairs restaurant is under renovation at the moment so they obviously can not offer the full service they would like too although i would like to point out that absolutely nothing could fault the breakfast service huge array of choice cooked cold cereal fruit how anyone could nit pick and find fault with that i have no had the first flight out of heathrow so arrived at the hotel around even though check in isnt supposed to open until our room was already ready for us to get comfortable and yeah okay the beds arent the softest in the world but if they were soft im pretty sure someone would complain that they werent hard after a couple of nights sleep you get used to it like a human plus actually exploring,1
1981,my husband i began our day trip to spain in barcelona the marina location was quiet and convenient close enough to walk to the beach or to sagrada familia the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was amazing,1
1982,the hotel is close to two underground tube stations marina or bogatel which then get you into the centre of barcelona quickly although the underground is efficient it is very hot but cool on the trains the hotel is about a fifteen minute walk to the beach through the streets the marina is about ten minutes walk the same way restaurants available for evening meal there and a room was clean and plain but comfortable large tv no english channels apart from the news toiletries provided no breakfast unless you pay extra there are small eating places close by to grab a croissant and coffee had dinner there one night when returned too late to go out again very good food there is a pool on the top floor but it is quite small there is a fair few sun beds and chairs there but they get taken very quickly and you are sitting on top of one another but it is good for a couple of hours rest after a hard day exploring the reception staff were really helpful we needed directions to a few things we had booked and they made sure we knew what tubes to catch and the exact directions the area surrounding the hotel is more local and residential but we felt really safe walking about late at night and stopping off at some of the more local bars where you are not ripped off for a drink or meal as you are in the,1
1984,staf at reception wants you to pay in advance they gave a familyroom with beds while we paid for after that we got a bedroom with a broken or too week airconditioning terrible very young staf showed no sincere child kept us waiting in the evening for a room while we had a baby that had to go to bed,0
1985,just got back from a four day stay at marina i enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere found the staff to be friendly and helpful the room was very clean but a little small no tea or coffee facilities were available in the room as advertised with the breakfast was amazing so much variety the area is not very touristy more residential i travelled with my ten year old son and felt very safe and the locals where friendly lots of cafes and bars close by the roof top pool was very welcoming after a hot day sight seeing and the sky bar was lovely lit up of a niggtthe beach is a minute walk but it euro to hire a parasol and two loungers which is a rip off overall i would recommend this hotel it has a good vibe and was child friendly,1
1986,we stayed here last week it was amazing a great location as was out of the hustle and bussing of the city but close enough to walk to places took us half hour to walk to la sagrada familia right near the harbour lots of lovely bars and restaurants hotel was very clean staff very attentive and safe in the room if you happen to have your car there is secure underground parking breakfast was amazing so much choice could fault it if you looking for a place to stay i highly recommend would stay here again,1
1987,back yesterday from a night stay at the marina my teenage daughter and i had a basic twin room on the floor i asked for a quiet room away from the bar and rooftop pool and away from the lift which i was given as in any hotel earplugs were useful the cleaners arrived early and were noisy than the norm the pool is on the floor it superb after sightseeing it was a quiet sunny haven to get a cocktail and some chill it got a little busy at times but there was always a seat available even if there were any loungers left my only criticism is that smoking is allowed which seems a bit dated in an area where there perhaps smoking should just be around the bar and not the pool the itself were a little weary but the shower was powerful pillows comfy bed was clean so all good the staff were all lovely and helpful particularly the staff on the ground floor it a min walk to the beaches which again were superb la rambla and casa bastilo would be a bit too much to walk i think so we hopped in a taxi are taxis to the left of the and then walked back ish alternatively you could catch a rickshaw bike along the beach front part of the way and then walk the rest to the bottom of la rambla la sagrada familia is walkable about mins up a straight road with,1
1988,due to bad weather decided to have dinner in the hotel a bummer disappointing regarding service and portions euro for small tiny piece of salmon not recommended waiter may need to look for a new job,0
1989,overall a very good stay here comfortable room double comfortable bed and delicious breakfast minutes outside of barcelona would definitely stay at another hotel good helpful staff a short stay to visit family who live here and also to soak up some culture i would highly recommend this hotel,1
1990,really nice hotel great rooms breakfast and pool area you can skip the spa but make sure that you book with privilege free mini bar and great service you can easily take the metro walk or the cab close to the beach,1
1991,i stayed here with my adult daughter and had a great time the hotel is ideally located we walked everywhere it is close to the beach but also close enough to walk into town the staff are very polite and helpful the room was clean and had everything except tea and coffee which i would have expected for stars the roof top bar was great and lovely to return back to after a day of exploring my only real complaint is that the bar could open earlier so you could get beach towels and a drink they missing a trick here as lots of people had obviously gone to a near by cafe also people had saved beds which is incredibly selfish in a hotel this big with such a small pool the hotel should be clear and strict about having a policy for this employ someone to keep an eye and remove towels when the person has not been there for half an hour some towels were there for well over an hour,1
1993,hotel from hell from the minute we checked in and had to wait five hours for a room to opening the elevator door and finding a vacuum cleaner in the middle of it to having the front desk hit us with additional charges that according to book it were paid the manager in the evening when we address these issues said to me i like americans in a rude beds had big gaping indentations in them very uncomfortable also look like somebody threw something on the walls in our room they were sticky and dirty the showers were very unsafe the toilet and the shower falling away from this place it not even close to the marina,0
1994,whilst this was a perfectly nice hotel with great staff i did not like the area long walk to the beach so for the first time ever i used the metro once you get the hang of the ticket system it is no different to the london underground the staff were wonderful and after having been ripped off by the taxi driver they could have been nicer warning if the fare seems to high tell the driver to wait and go inside the hotel pool area is tiny and fills up very quickly breakfast ok,1
1995,we have stayed in barcelona many times times this was the first time at this hotel it was mainly chosen because we came by car from southern france so it was very easy acces from north and you did not have to drive in the city center and there was a fair prized parking in the were pleasantly surprised by the very friendly staff and the hotel quality the hotel was very fairly prized compared to more citycenter hotels and were absolutely better quality breakfast was very nice are used to stay closer to the center so we thought it was a bit of a walk to the center there were however metro stations close by,1
1996,we stayed very clean rooms wth staff very friendly breakfast is very very good with a wide verity the hotel restaurant food is very poor quality for the price an we waited for a cocktail we ordered an the place was empty with two members of staff doing nothin that was a major let down to a lovely quiet hotel in a nice location,1
1997,the positives the location of this venue is absolutely perfect minute walk to the diagonal mar shopping centre and minute walk to the beach minutes walk front desk staff were awesome and always to assist checking in and out was a breeze and absolutely no at staff in the restaurant in the evening were very and the food quality was very buffet was fine good choice of and the options for which type of breakfast were junior suite has a large bathroom and the bed was negatives sadly there are a couple of things that really let the hotel down and would in our opinion be pretty easy to junior suites are on all floors the first suite and not ideally placed next to the housekeeping room so there is a lot of noise from the housekeeping door being and the room attendants and their associated room attendants failed badly on the night first night we opted just for change of towels but nights the room was not cleaned properly not replaced toiletries not replaced all round a job not once but twice after we complained to front desk things were fine but the staff on housekeeping those two days badly let the hotel down just simple second problem is that whilst free throughout is not stable at all and not only keeps dropping but can remain down for long periods of time if you do find that you are the type of person that needs to work whilst travelling,1
1998,great hotel rooms are tight but very nice and classic place friendly and very helpful staff free buffet including free beer etc very good location been there before and will go again thank you,1
1999,loved this quaint hotel at the very top of la rambla only two minutes from playa catalunya so getting aetobus to there from the airport was so handy hotel is in an older type building but that does deter from its warmth charm and friendliness staff always kind and helpful theyd left us a bottle of cava in room on arrival and given us a decent room overlooking the patio at the back as they had promised in emails our room was a good size had a lovely bathroom a free safe and air con plus s little fridge and micro were an added bonus free buffet was a lovely touch wine beer sift drinks tea and coffee breads yoghurt fruit and a small selection of hot foods at all times was very enjoyable good breakfast for a city hotel too would definitely go back great little hotel lovely staff in excellent location,1
2000,stayed hear for nights my wife and i and the lad and his girlfriend the hotel is the cheapest but worth the extra due to location which was to none rooms a little dated but nice the hour free snacks was a nice touch even though it was the same every night microwave in your room with fridge but the main thing which i never experienced was the free beer wine fantastic overall loved our stay will be back next year for sure,1
2001,i stayed at this hotel for the third time in the span of a few months i was not disappointed as the overall experience was excellent once again great and trendy hotel with lovely staff and services good for both business and leisure while the hotel is not in central downtown it is very close to the metro while tourist buses pass in front of the hotel every minutes,1
2002,this was my first trip to barcelona the hotel is right about on diagnol ave so the location is phenomenal it within walking distance to a lot of restaurants nightlife near the train rail etc the front desk staff were very helpful and found them to be more helpful than the concierge throughout my stay the rooms are nice clean and modern especially the bathroom the only confusing part for me is that there are two hiltons the hilton barcelona and the hilton diagnol so if you do speak spanish like me very well make sure you show your taxi driver the address of the hotel so they take you to the right one,1
2003,nice area near a mall and some places to eat and a short walk to the metro train and minutes to the airport the metro goes to many tourist sites and taxi is easy to get and also buses to other parts of the city,1
2004,great location close to public transportation metro in minutes gets you to city center in less than minutes lot of good restuarants in and around room was pretty good sized well maintained did not try the breakfast in the hotel as there were several options around quick access to airport also will stay again during my next vidit,1
2005,this hotel was in the middle of town walking distance or a quick train ride to most of the attractions our room was exactly what you expect from a hilton property knowledgeable and friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms the restaurant however is a hard pass for dinner breakfast was the usual mediocre but dinner was over priced and disappointing there is a tapas place right next door,1
2006,good friendly staff at reception and was very requested an additional bed for our son and it was promptly brought in and set for is good but bbq restaurant is even was a pleasant experience to stay,1
2007,wow what a great you going to barcelona and would like to stay at what i would call centrally located hotel pick this hilton the staff was welcoming and helpful without coming across as being less than genuine special kudos to the server in the restaurant wish i could recall her name she was terrific she was the only dark hair female so she will be easy to service check staff also very good and host working the lounge also went out of her way to greet and make the hhdiamond members staying on the fourth floor feel taken care off the only minor problem occurred at the lounge when i tried to get a glass of cold water and all the cold drink holders were locked the lounge attendant called for the keys and a grumpy older gentleman came to unlock the fridges but not before complaining about how those fridges were locked at a certain time and then open much later he was quite loud about that to the point that the lounge hostess had to apologize for this persons lack of hiltons that i have stayed before usually have the fridges open for guests to get cold bottles of water or juice do see why this hilton locks the room was clean comfortable and the worked very well bottom line great place to stay,1
2008,dont stay in this hotel if you need an extra bed in your room my son could not sleep in his and we had to stay tried night but got sore back after having the metal springs in the matress hurt his spine and do not expect to get any help to get better bed either you will only hear lots of even i booked the extra bed week upfront they prefered to give the good extrabed to someone arriving same day who had not booked this in desk manager told me they were a big group arriving bit earlier than really dissapointing,0
2009,great location near a subway station the hotel lobby is nicely decorated service staffs are very polite helpful and attentive the rooms are comfy although a little upgrade of the amenities could be considered,1
2010,the location in the financial district was well situated for getting around hotel was clean and in a safe neighborhood the breakfasts were well prepared and had a good selection the staff was friendly and helpful but a few things in the room did not work need to have their facility manager check out the rooms more frequently that everything is in good working condition working phones wobbly faucets sliding closet doors that keep sliding i would stay again if i first checked out the room,1
2011,this hotel was very nice and we enjoyed our stay we would stay there again the staff was great and the location although kind of away from the old part of the city was in a great place very near the subway and taxis were everywhere,1
2013,i choose this hotel due to close access to train station but was pleasantly surprised to find it was close to all city transportation close to supermarket pharmacy restaurants and shopping center great area for working and eating outdoors,1
2014,we stayed two different times for a night each time we stayed with hilton points overall i liked the hotel as the rooms were larger than normal for europe and while not exactly close to the gothic area or exiample area it is convenient to the train station we used twice and airport and very close to the green line subway that takes you to the gothic quarter the building is a cool modern kind of european feel and our experiences with staff were good also the breakfast and breakfast area for hilton honors was good my only real complaint was the shower that was not real clear how to work we came back a second time and it was still tough other than that all good,1
2015,really nice hotel with good facilities the staff are however extremely slow particularly on reception for some reason there can be a que of guests and just two people on reception there is also not a separate hhonurs reception for members which is very unusual,0
2016,i stayed july to july in this hotel with my wife i have been a diamond member for the last years and stayed at numerous hotel in asia europe usa africa here are my bad experiences with the service amenities and ambiance of this hotel when arrived no one assisted us with the luggage wanted to check in at the ex lounge told ca and should check in the arrival counter the staff was rude not polite and when requested for a upgrade to a suite was told non available lousy executive lounge someone sleeping in the lounge like a homeless person during day time and the staff was totally unaware the breakfast at the lobby was the worst that i ever experienced ate only one day i was promised to a junior suite on the night but the staff was not aware fully what going on however i got the upgrade on the night but the quality of the suite was not worth mentioning the room amenities were minimum i set of toiletries for guests no mouth wash reluctant to provide extra drinking water when i asked to show the written benefits that the hotel provides to diamond member none was available the duty manager said she will send one to the room but never done when i changed rooms no one assisted us to move my wife got a trolley herself and we arranged moving rooms hotel ambiance is not suitable for a hilton hotel and more like,0
2018,good location within walking distance from restaurants shops and public transportation but far from most touristic spots beautiful lobby and really great rooms with nice beds and tasteful decoration nice bathroom with rain shower complimentary wifi very very slow good breakfast to my shock the cost of the parking was per night it so ridiculously expensive that changed all my perspective of the experience having a car wo go back,1
2019,its good located and nicely designed very spacious and clean the only thing i did not like was the breakfast buffet which was not hilton standard in europe friendly staff even though the hotel was packed these days,1
2020,first the highlights updated hotel with comfortable rooms and a great breakfast in a great neighborhood secondly the disappointments as a gold honors member and mile flier i have stayed at a few international hotels the staff never quite got all of the amenities in my room right each day no new coffee most days bathroom amenities missed most days daily water was hit or miss on my last day of i asked for water to be replaced and was told the hotel policy was water only on the first day of arrival really this is the first major brand international hotel where i found the complimentary water rationed to one day i explained my concern to the staff and they had no answers penny wise pound foolish i will not be back,0
2021,brief description sleek clean compact hotel room walk to bus small gym no pool i would stay here description of room twin beds robes slippers blackout curtains great fridge electric kettle ironing board tea no usb ports two waters per stay small but mighty bathroom one piece of molded glass for sink with counter space on both sides with space underneath to store personal items peterthomasroth toiletries provided large mirror above sink that does fog while showering small lighted round mirror perfect for night light bidet towel warmer deep narrow bathtub with detachable showerhead curved shower rod with sheer shower curtain top abstract knobs in shower supervise children water gets extremely hot hair dryer provided outlet outside of get a business card with the hotel address there are two hiltons in barcelona both on diagonal avenue this hilton is closer to the beach buy advanced tickets online before attempting to visit any tourist attraction to avoid a long queue disappointment buy a ticket for the hop on hop off bus to get an overview of barcelona do one route take a siesta in the middle of the day and then do a second route in the evening take taxis to attractions on subsequent days taxi fares usually and accept credit cards taking the hop on hop off bus for transportation to see sights is extremely frustrating since busses only run in one direction and time is wasted waiting for the bus barcelona busturista busses seemed to run more frequently than,1
2022,ok it expensive but it central quiet spotless great food and drink and staff very polite and well trained to look after visitors very close to good shopping and tapas bars would i visit and stay again without question,1
2023,well located hotel only minutes from the center it is also near to two shopping centers calm hotel and luxury room with confortable beds very friendly and careful staff they all speak fluently english and french and are very welcoming especially karim the executive lounge manager who is very funny well organized and helpful since he even advised us and gave as clue for our trip i strongly recommend hilton barcelona,1
2024,this modern stylist hotel is very close to shops restaurants staff are polite they even arranged for a breakfast box for our am checkout comfortable king bed and roomy ensuite with very modern decor,1
2025,i stayed at the hilton barcelona for nights last week and really enjoyed it the service was great all around from the front desk to the multiple restaurants the rooms are very spacious and comfortable very clean and bathrooms are quite large breakfast was perfect with a nice selection of items location is also good very close to a mall and multiple restaurants will be back,1
2026,stayed for a couple of nights as a hilton honors gold member i was lucky enough to get upgraded to a suite also because the room i booked suddenly became unavailable carlos at reception was very helpful rocio at the the executive floor was equally great she introduced us to the busturistic hop on and off buses which turned out to be a great way to see barcelona there a stop very close to the hotel i would definitely consider staying here again thumbs up,1
2027,this hotel was outstanding in many ways loved staying in the gothic quarter of barcelona with it many tiny pedestrian only streets and great shopping just around the corner not only did our second floor room have a beautiful view of the cathedral just across the plaza but the rooftop views were outstanding rooftop has a small wading pool with at least deck areas with high top tables to enjoy the views and take photos our room was gorgeous updated with a beautiful tufted headboard lovely fabrics throughout on curtain panels bedding pillows and upholstery in different shades of blue and green very clean and nice large bathroom with sinks nice water pressure in shower room also came with a great espresso machine and fridge too would highly recommend this hotel because if it location views and luxurious feel,1
2028,we revisited this lovely gracious hotel after six years and it is every bit as good now as then you ca beat the location across the square from the gothic cathedral and down from the gate leading into the bari gothic or gothic quarter which is the most interesting part of barcelona the hotel has a nice elegant restaurant with great service and it less expensive than many trendy spots which are half as good this square is a far superior location to the huge plaza catalonia which is noisy and surrounded by busy streets with honking traffic you will not be disappointed in this hotel,1
2029,my husband and i stayed here for our honeymoon we had a room with a view of the cathedral square wonderful the hotel was very very clean and in an incredible location it was also super easy to find just take the aeropuerto bus to the last stop and follow the avenue to the cathedral the staff were also superb competant and friendly,1
2030,we spended night at this wonderful place we really enjoyed our time there the hotel have a fantastic view of the hestorical barcelona cathedral have very nice was very nice and clean reception team was very helpful i loved the walk in the city will go back again,1
2031,this hotel is amazing the staff could possibly be more helpful and the location is ideal across the plaza from the cathedral in the center of town it is very easy to walk to the major attractions and cozy neighborhoods,1
2032,stayed in a reburbished room on the floor room was beautiful only problem was our double bed was beds put together but everything else was perfect very clean hotel and cleaning staff did an exceptional job with our room each day would highly recommend this hotel for quality and location especially for first trip to barcelona views from the roof terrace are amazing buffet breakfast excellent would definately stay again,1
2033,we booked directly through the site as i have read then when you do the hotel gives you the crappiest room i asked for a high floor bot thinking we would get it but we got which is the last level before the most expensive room get the one facing the cathedral epic it was a great location and the jacuzzi pool was small but perfect for us we had it all to ourselves and it gives you the best view of the cathedral they can also bring you food and dribks to the other side of the spa i was excited when i saw salad roll it is hard to get salad and veggies when you eat out in barcelona a lot of salads come with fish or something like that anyways we only stayed too days before heading to rome and it was great we heard a ton of free music from up on the roof including the kind they play when they so the catalan circle dance opera and a bunch more great way to relax and watch life go by,1
2034,with a location just steps away from the cathedral colon hotel offers a very comfortable stay the great location offers walking distance to nearby restaurants stores and shops the hop bus and markets while the hotel lobby has a very traditional vibe our room was very spacious modern and comfortable the hotel staff and housekeeping were very friendly and courteous i would offer the hotel five stars except that our room bathroom door would close otherwise overall hotel colon is highly recommended,1
2035,best location magnificent cathedral as background while you or just casual drinking on open rooftop easy to locate all is familiar with the place easy to walk to shopping place or local market for dinner classic design with advanced facilities interior is maintain its heritage look but combine with new design and technology wifi is always on and enough for daily use rooms are clean spacious and all stuffs you need is excellent service from staffs helpful and care for visitors breakfast is complete however the variation should be alternate family stay rooms for days july best vacation ever star from us,1
2036,we visited barcelona and i was a bit sceptical that i had booked the right hotel however my fears were wasted all the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was airy clean and had great views the hotel could not have done more to make our stay more enjoyable a special mention to raquel in guest relations who organised some beautiful flowers for our stay will visit again,1
2037,the hotel s located right on the cathedral plaza and the plaza teems with activity so if your room faces the plaza and you a light sleeper you may want to consider earplugs seriously but that a minor annoyance and likely a for most people the liveliness and activity are fabulous besides the proximity to the cathedral you within a short walk to placa catalunya the picasso museum la rambla santa catarina market etc the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff is very nice and thanks to david it a ca miss,1
2039,we checked in on july and checked out on august this hotel was central to everything we planned and did and our view of the cathedral and the surrounding plaza an upgrade was breathtaking the hotel is in an old building which is spectacularly maintained the staff was very attentive and efficient however on close inspection upon check in the bathroom was not cleaned to perfection as we found some unappetizing body hair on the floor and in the bathtub which was gone the next day also the tv was on the fritz on our first day but the maintenance staff addressed this issue quickly after we reported it to the front desk the also an was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive i would stay here again but hope the housekeeping staff will devote more attention to detail,1
2040,stayed days prior to boarding our cruise loved the location friendly staff who spoke english concierge assisted us to choose great dinner location options luggage is stored safely with quick easy access if need be,1
2041,overall very good experience they keep the public areas spotless however there are some things you need to know the restaurant is quite expensive i elected to not have any meals there at all there are so many options close to the hotel another thing you need to know is that they block the elevator from going to where the is located until it is not a pool but a large jacuzzi that is kept very clean and it is refreshing but it is shallow in addition there were several times that they had not opened it until i called them myself to remind them to unlock it for guests to use why is that this was at plus there is an additional code on a keypad you have to enter which is fine but they changed the code during my stay and i was not aware of that because they had not informed me and they said they would have the maintenance look at it well the staff person did even know that the code had changed themselves that wasted a day for me not fun the in my room was not good either bummer the finally was fixed after days of complaining about it my key malfunctioned times over days and they finally issued me a new one but not until i really pressed them ok so why would i return because of the staff like victor who was excellent and raquel who is concierge she personally got,1
2042,i had one of the hotel single rooms for five nights it was on the small side but not unreasonable for a single the room was spotless i was on the back side of the hotel so i did have a cathedral view but also had no noise the front desk and bell staff were friendly and professional the restaurant was beautiful and the service very good but as others have mentioned the food in my one meal there was only not awful but there are so many great places to eat in barcelona the location of the hotel is excellent it across the plaza from the cathedral and walking distance to gothic quarter born and la rambla attractions about a five minute walk to a metro stop also an easy walk to the aerobus the airport this is not among the most luxurious hotels in barcelona but it holds its own in the classic old school style of a full service hotel coupled with attractive rates and the excellent location it really a good choice,1
2043,the hotel colon named in honor of christopher columbus in an older hotel with beautiful architecture it faces on a plaza directly facing the barcelona cathedral which is one of the most beautiful cathedrals in europe inside and outside the plaza on which the hotel is located is a gathering place for buskers flower sellers and mimes the hotel is a shot walk from the rambla a colorful market for local souvenirs flowers and in particular fresh and prepared foods including many that are not eve known in the united states the hotel itself has prompt and attentive service rooms of larger than usual size for an old property the bar service is in a beautiful capacious setting with attentive service sitting outside on the plaza is a fine place day and night not only for the street performers but also for the locals who pass through on foot and on bicycles day ad night there are numerous cafes and restaurants around the plaza on which the hotel is located for a genuine introduction to the culture and people of barcelona and catalonia the hotel colon is an excellent choice,1
2044,i was traveling by myself in spain and while i know barcelona pretty well i wanted to stay some place safe and near the heart of the city i happened upon this place and i could not have been happier the room itself was small but perfect for one person decent price as well could use a bit of updating but it was clean and the bathroom was large and very nice however i spent almost no time in the room because i could pull myself away from the rooftop terrace and pool incredible view of the cathedral and surrounding barcelona i was sad that i had to leave but i will definitely be back soon,1
2045,shared a twin room with my best friend on a night break everything was top class loved the room little balcony modern shower ca fault it very clean we sat upstairs on the roof top one night and tapas and drinks were brought up to us they said minutes it was only what can i say reception staff were truly delightful always helpful we were on the floor their are two lift wifi was good,1
2046,stopped in for two nights recently well located in the gothic quarter between metro stations a short min walk to both exceptionally lively area in easy walking were able to leave our bags until our room was ready staff were friendly and spoke english had a balcony room on the first floor so were slightly concerned about potential noise from the square but as they are refurbished rooms they installed the french doors very well which blocked out all did seem to have as much power as it should have very pleasant bathroom one large shower free wifi was reliable and in room amenities another reviewer mentioned the bed was two singles pushed together so not ideal for a couple but the only minor flaw in our whole definitely stay here again when visiting barcelona,1
2047,plunge pool cathedral view fantastic wifi hotel colon was exceptional extremely friendly staff willing to help out with anything great price and family friendly this hotel made our stay much easier because of its great location will not think twice about returning to this hotel and i highly recommend it,1
2048,on our second stay in barcelona we chose hotel colon again and it was no disappointment a well run hotel with courteous professional staff some of whom were particularly memorable antonio concierge arranged several trips for us and gustavo front desk was also you for another pleasant visit,1
2049,great staff and safety was there preference i strongly recommend it to everyone happy to answer any questions its is centrally located and shops of all kind around room and service was perfect and so was the room and space,1
2051,my daughter and i recently stayed at this fantastic hotel we spent weeks travelling around spain and barcelona was our last stop we arrived a little early for check in but our room was ready for us we chosen a cathedral view room and i really recommend spending that little extra to do the same was a beautiful view to wake up to and listening to the bells was wonderful the reception staff were all very helpful and so friendly and knowledgeable in all the places to visit we had booked for breakfast and really enjoyed the selection of hot and cold food the rooms were spacious and the bathroom was well stocked with all your needs would definitely book this hotel when i next visit barcelona,1
2052,right in the centre for all tourist attractions and designer label shops however a whilst a classic building a little faded in parts rooms clearly vary a lot and some are recently renovated others clearly not,1
2053,perfect location small but pretty room with juliette balcony and great air conditioning staff are attentive and helpful would stay again for certain always something going on and great family atmosphere n,1
2054,enjoyed our stay here great location had rooms on the floor view of cathedral not as good as the higher rooms but the and floors are newly remodeled and very nice top floor deck nice also for drinks would stay here again,1
2055,this hotel was perfectly located in the city centre only a short and very direct bus ride from the airport within walking distance of many attractions but they also bus stops on the square outside meaning was very easy to get anywhere in the city we were offered a glass of bubbly on arrival and complimentary drinks were available from daily our room was lovely and the complimentary toiletries were of a very high standard service was excellent the staff on reception were always very friendly and helpful great value for money my only slightly negative comment is that it can get noisy throughout the night due to the rooms overlooking a central courtyard above reception and any noise in the reception travels up to the rooms this was easily resolved when a kind member of staff advised where i could buy some earplugs from i ca believe this was a three star hotel it felt far more like a hotel i would definitely recommend the hotel and plan to stay here again,1
2056,great location spotlessly clean comfortable room which is dark at night very thoughtful design great amenities wonderful gave great restaurant recommendations thoughtful touches,1
2057,great boutique hotel right in the heart of barcelona by las ramblas very busy area outside with loads of tourists but is a little oasis of calm inside nicely decorated rooms a bit small but typical size for a capital city still very pleasant we had one of the suites with the outside seating terrace which was great very cool air conditioners in rooms which allowed us to get a very nights good sleep when it was hot outside lovely for a romantic break close to the gothic quarter our favourite area parking was not too bad using the underground sabas underground car park just off catalunya plaza and only about from hotel expensive to park though really liked the chain of hotels,1
2058,went to barcelona on july spent a week at the catalunya plaza boutique hotel hotel has been restored very pretty inside very nice staff especially jordi at front desk great breakfast in morning beer and cava are put out in afternoon clean rooms but they are small we requested to be moved from first room as it was so small no washclothes great location as bus stop is across street and you are at the top of la rambla walking area with shops and restaurants lots of high end stores like avenue in ny also very busy this time of year and warm weather no public bathrooms you either use a mcdonalds or some restaurants require you to buy something to use the toilet eating outside was crowded and everyone smokes but inside where they had air conditioning was less people make reservations before you go online if you want to see the major attractions we took a minute train ride to see the champagne caves and could get a tour as they were all booked train and bus service were easy to use itapa next to hotel was not very good food however la tagliatella was an excellent italian restaurant as was bars bar everyone eats late to at night so if you go earlier you can get right in mediterranean sea was beautiful to swim in beach nice but crowded and there are restaurants you can eat at right on the beach,1
2059,the decor of this hotel is charming we loved our room which was immaculate the breakfast buffet was delicious they gave us the option of ordering from a menu which we did the first day the next days we just ate from the buffet which was very large fresh and delicious this hotel is in the plaza catalunya which is one block from las ramblas we were able to walk to the barri gotic the tour bus stop was on the square right across the from the hotel the service at this hotel was great loved this place,1
2060,nice hotel with very nice clean and clear rooms small but very practical which is not a little bit far from the gothic distric of the city walk i would recommend this hotel his great concept of the very good bakery at the ground floor,1
2061,comfy and clean hotel in a terrific location block from la pedrera in the eixample very nice and helpful staff rooms are pleasant yes they are small but to be expected in europe and who needs a big room when you should be exploring the wonderful city of barcelona the bakery is a great feature we usually got breakfast there instead of the hotel buffet more selection almond and chocolate croissants mmmm,1
2062,great hotel star service clean good was fine but worth considering to skip breakfast and take a coffee and pastry from the hotel lovely team this is a three star hotel but feals a lot more i definitely come back again,1
2063,if you want to stay in the heart of barcelona this is a perfect location close to sightseeing points and the city centre highly recommended for a short stay the bakery downstairs is busy but charming,1
2064,stayed here with some friends last week what a fun little hotel tucked away yet close to everything rooms are small boutique style but we equipped the bakery first thing in the morning was absolutely fantastic so fun to watch the bakers and pastry chef create as you enjoy eating their creations because of the small size of rooms i can say night stay here would be a great base while exploring barcelona are area would love to come back very soon,1
2066,great location clean minimalistic room which is pretty typical in spain great shower front desk staff very helpful with food recommendations and any questions we had bakery was awesome and smelled soooo good only complaint was very poor internet in our room to be fair we were on floor so we sat in the lobby and had a coffee or water when we needed online not a big deal,1
2067,praktik bakery is in a great location for both sightseeing and shopping the rooms are very small but nicely decorated bathrooms are very small hardly any closet space it is nice that there is air conditioning and the bakery downstairs is lovely,1
2068,the hotel is beautiful we had a two room connecting family suite and it was perfect for the four of us the bakery is amazing and always so nice to walk into breakfast was included and it was wonderful the location was away from the touristy areas but easy to walk everywhere,1
2069,i highly enjoyed and would recommend staying at praktik bakery all of the on duty receptionists during my stay were helpful and responsive even though they were busy late one night when the couple next door was yelling loudly the male receptionist came upstairs to personally knock on their door and let them know people are trying to sleep i loved being welcomed by the bakery every morning the breakfast buffet option was convenient and fresh hot fresh individual coffees they have decaf very helpful and clean and convenient to get to and from visiting the whole city,1
2070,what a gem of a hotel this is visited in april with my wife and whilst it is a bit basic it is absolutely stunning simplistic decor but very clean and attentive staff the bakery is awesome and the goods on offer were soooo tasty breakfast is a must if you are staying it is in a great location and close to the main shopping areas but far enough away from the super crowded streetswe will be back,1
2071,very gentle staff the breakfast was adequate it needs some improvement the night auditor could be more well spoken english by the receptionists although the girls at the bakery need to improve it,1
2072,enjoyed every minute spent at hotel praktik bakery we used the airport shuttle to and from the hotel and were treated to courteous service the entire time the hotel is right next to gaudi la pedrera within walking or metro distance to other tourist attractions as to the actual room our twin beds were closer together than expected but this was no problem the huge shower was divine finally it was amazing to wake up to delicious bakery food for breakfast each morning we will definitely stay here the next time we visit barcelona,1
2073,we were very satisfied and would recommend this hotel location and cleanliness could be beat only wish it had a pool bakery was excellent start to the day and staff was always helpful and friendly even when it was was very busy we would stay again,1
2074,my husband and daughter and i loved our three nights here in july when importantly the air conditioning functioned perfectly rooms are small but that is not important to us beds are very comfortable and rooms are quiet and immaculate bakery is terrific breakfast good staff personable and efficient and we loved the international atmosphere several different languages spoken at breakfast and many young people with backpacks as well as older people like us great location too and be sure to pick up some turr√≥n at the shop in the casa pedrera a couple of blocks away the hotel will reserve a van to the airport for you if you like but it would also be easy to hail a taxi on the passeig de gracia a couple of blocks away on a more individual note i must again express my appreciation for the hotel kindness in allowing us a credit for the nonrefundable stay we had booked for march and were unable to use because of illness we would stay again at the hotel praktik bakery and would recommend it to anyone in a minute,1
2075,super central and very modern we enjoyed every minute in this hotel the bakery is outstanding as well we sure coming back on our next trip the price is unbeatable and the workers are very kind,1
2076,great hotel with a very convenient location far enough from the ramblas crowds but walking distance to everything attractions metro passeig gracia etc rooms are nice europe standard size no drawers clean nice shower quiet front desk very helpful with restaurants and directions they also provide towels to take to the beach the bakery located in the lobby is outstanding best bread in barcelona according to locals great for breakfast or light meals,1
2077,its a very nice hotel the room was great the personal was very very friendly the lobby was perfect we would recommened this hotel we enjoyed our stay definetly will be back again in barcelona and also back in praktik bakery,1
2078,we stayed nights in bar√ßa with our boys had the family room and a double actually had separate rooms which were very nice staff super location close to everything and the bakery is would go back,1
2080,a nice h√¥tel to recommend the room was a little bit small but very clean the breakfast not very diversified only slices of cheese butter and jam but in g√©n√©ral good very delicious bread the staff at the reception really helpfullthe location of the hotel si excellent we will come back in january,1
2081,overall hotel experience is very good this was our stay here the reason we keep coming back is the magnificent backery the great restaurants and bars just walking distance,1
2082,we have spent nights here with my wife it was one of the nicest hotels i have been for a long time the room was adorable clean fresh no street noise and with well working air conditioning the staff was friendly helpful and open to our requests the location was perfect the bakery downstairs has awesome food and staff is very welcome,1
2083,great hotel the lobby a little bit messy and small but that it rooms very clean and comfortable if you are looking for a place near gaudi buildings and plaza catalunya this is the right place also the hotel smells like bread,1
2084,clean and functional room an excellent breakfast and helpful and smiling staff in a beautiful at the top and the location is the best of metro station is so close at the hotel,1
2085,very hip hotel with the best bakery in town downstairs it is buzzing all day the rooms are very well styled would compare to the ace hotel as far a budget boutique with a vibe instead of being stale and bland like most cheaper hotels location is perfect too walk everywhere,1
2086,my girlfriend and i spent a week at this hotel and had a great time the location was perfect great breakfast and cozy rooms for improvement purposes i like to focus on some things that could have been better starting with the service and employees they were friendly and helpful when we asked for help also that it was staff there we got the feeling that it was a lot of staff working there but only one for the hotel part and the rest for the bakery so it was not so much of personal contact which often is appreciated just to have someone at the hotel help the tourists that staying there with things that can improve the whole vacation to barcelona by guiding to restaurants public transportation sightseeing and other the beds they had some extra madress that was awful to sleep on so during the last few days i had to take that off the bed to get some cleaners did a good job to make it tidy every day though one simple thing to improve the stay would to have toilet brushes to stay in the bathroom so we can keep the bathrooms clean ourselfs which would have improved our bread that was served for breakfast was delicious though it would be appreciated to have some more yoghurt cerials etc and more things to put on the bread and eat also the logistics for where the glasses plates bread toaster and drinks are placed is not,1
2087,good hotel in top location good services friendly personel clean and a unique combination with the top active barcelona bakery on the gound level and reception area unique experience really recommandable wiil book this hotel on my next trip to barcelona,1
2088,location was perfect we could walk everywhere we wanted to go and room was bigger than expected with huge comfy bed and very clean staff were excelled with great recommendations for local places to eat and drink and a good sense of humour too it never felt too formal thanks for a great trip,1
2089,easily accessible clean friendly staff fantastic food would stay there again watching the bakers at work at after getting back from the gothic quarter was i not spend on the breakfast which is limited in choice merely order your food directly from the bakery counter and give your change to the poor hungry guy sat on the pavement outside had a great time in barca largely due to this hotel,1
2090,we had a nice stay at praktik bakery everyone who worked there is very friendly and helpful the rooms are small but cozy and clean the location is perfect for visiting the main attractions of barcelona the only downfall was surprisingly the breakfast which despite being in a bakery has limited choices oh and the parking is very expensive but this is the case for everywhere in barcelona,1
2092,great location relatively central to everything with quick access to metro concierge staff incredibly friendly and more than happy to help with anything would highly recommend just wish they had a pool,1
2093,we arrived very late at night the bakers were already making bread for next day so it smelled like heaven friendly staff amazing location clean rooms superb breakfast even if you do feel like the hotel breakfast you can just buy stuff from the bakery and eat downstairs or make it a breakfast at bed rooms are nice a bit small,1
2094,our stay at the praktik bakery could not have been better the rooms are nicely appointed and while smaller work perfectly for anyone who is out and about in a great city like barcelona sitting on top of a bakery made it easy to have breakfast snacks and quicker meals as we were trying to get out to see the city the neighborhood has lots of local restaurants to get away from the packs of tourists,1
2095,because everything is smooth and working well nice room rather calm nice and welcoming staff tasty breakfast nothins to think about so that you can save your energy for city discoveries and fun,1
2096,when we come on your website we see parking free excuse me but i never hear that correspond to the food is pretty good and healthy but the saler could be more happy to serve the room is clean and nice,1
2097,great breakfast a nice vibe really helpful staff room was a touch small but really clean easy walk to some interesting areas but we struggled to find restaurants that we really loved but would stay there again,1
2098,a wonderful bakery downstairs at your fingertips everyday rooms are small but clean and adequate service is outstanding loved watching the bakers in the back making these delicious breads and sweets a truly unique place,1
2099,could be more centrally located for all the stuff we wanted to do we could see la sagrada familia through our window when we arrived there was a line out the door of mostly locals just trying to buy the bread they bake in the lobby it is unbelievably good clean cute and intensely affordable,1
2100,when we asked about recommending a restaurant that locals would go to they came through with a perfect recommendation when we wanted to take a walk by the water they gave us the map distances to locations and a recommendation for lunch,1
2101,the location is perfect allowing quick access to explore barcelona located next to the beach lots of terrific restaurants shops and night clubs the gm raul has created a superior team and guest experience elena coordinated every detail of our travel arrangements and gave us lot of ideas before we even arrived to help us plan they were wonderful and made this trip so perfect for us we stayed at club level at the hotel arts a ritz hotel and it was definitely worth the extra cost for starters the club lounge offers panoramic view of the city and relaxing environment that lets you take in the city and beach while being catered to like royalty it is open first thing in the morning until midnight and is staffed with concierge to help with reservations answer questions about the city make a cappuccino keep the amazing endless buffet of food fresh and stocked there is everything you could want to drink from sparkling water to juices to champaign wine and mixed drinks while out an about we would swing by the club for a quick glass of wine or coffee and get some small plates it made our trip more affordable and so easy it was also nice to have a quieter place to get a way from the city for an afternoon break every morning i started my day running on the pedestrian path by the beach you can easily get a good five mile run in along the,1
2102,the location is fantastic with expansive views from every window rooms are very modern and comfortable and there are lot of outdoor places to lounge and relax we stayed in a junior suite on the club level the lounge is fantastic with great food and drinks all day long but what really impressed us was the incredible service from the concierge everyone was warm and helpful especially anna the club level concierge who went out of her way to prepare us an early morning departure treat as we were departing at am lovely hotel lovely staff we ca wait to come back,1
2103,we highly recommend hotel everyone was so nice and the concierge was particularly helpful with restaurant and activity recommendations the rooms are beautiful clean wonderful views we loved the pool and the beach we enjoyed the amenities of the hotel,1
2104,beautiful views of the city and ocean from the room the club level was a great experience with excellent food and very attentive service would certainly choose this hotel again when traveling to barcelona,1
2105,the decor and rooms at this hotel are beautiful and the reception staff were very professional but we did have a few gripes first of all there was no corkscrew or bottle opener in our room so we had to ring and wait for one to be brought to us secondly they have disposable out cups for the coffee in the room which might seem not much of a great deal but i prefer to drink out of china my biggest however would have to be about the breakfast which i thought was very average also after ordering cooked to order eggs and bacon our plates were left on the side waiting to be brought to us for at least five minutes and were uncovered with two waitresses talking to each other directly over them i suppose i should have asked for them to be cooked again as they were cold when they got to us but as were in a hurry we did overall a nice stay one night before a cruise but i would stay there again,1
2106,arts no longer wows like it did when it opened it remains a very good hotel you can see the ritz carlton management prompt response to requests upgrades amenities rooms are spacious and functional very nice views,1
2107,a wonderful hotel in barcelona located on the water being on the water it a minute cab ride to the ramblas but i personally prefer being on the water then on the ramblas it also next to night life the hotel is beautiful and service is excellent the concierge is great and will help with whatever you need rooms are classy refined with either city views ocean views or some corner rooms which have views of both i must single out bellhop david alster who was really great breakfast is excellent with a great selection only disappointments were pool though nice is small for a hotel of this size even though the hotel is on the beach it does not have its own private beach and a personal pet peeve was charged for one serving of ice cream with three scoops though i expect high prices at a hotel and they did adjust it at check out that was exorbitant i definitely recommend this hotel for anybody going to barcelona one last thing we checked out the w hotel while there as we were curious as we debated staying there and we definitely recommend hotel arts over the w hotel the w hotel though nice is more of a party hotel and you can go there to party when you want no need to stay there just for that the hotel arts just deliveres on everything,1
2108,we stayed for nights at arts hotel with my husband the first room we were given was not nice at all overlooking a crowded roundabout with a lot of traffic and noise and the corridors were kind of dirty the front desk proposed a new room by the end of the afternoon and it was defining worth the wait nothing compared to the first one with a nice view over part of the beach and sea service was really good even though there are a lot of trainees who sometimes are clumsy with customers the cons of the hotel the location around km from anything the swimming pool ridiculously small with lots of families and children i do not understand parents going to these kinds of hotels with children who can not clearly and fully have fun and enjoy as facilities are clearly not adapted to them breakfast you can order eggs waffles or pancakes from the kitchen but nobody tells you that which is not a one except for the price of course we tried the last year and will stop at the or mandarin next time so we have a clear picture of the luxury hotels in barcelona,1
2109,this is not what you can expect from a star hotel very poor in all ways it need to be refurbihed wifi into the price no wifi you have to pay around a night no hair dryer in our room bbad shape with stings on the furniture holes in the leather with the window damaged and no hotel guide about facilties difficult to find restaurant and no breakfast buffet i could not find it and it was not available high prices for dinner and breakfast you have to pay for everything and i ordered for breakfast smoked salmond and received bacon not for a lower price they did not warn me there was no salmon availabe when i ordered it,0
2110,excellent hotel with very friendly and careful stuff perfect rooms outstanding views and very good restaurants we stayed in club room and had a few priorities as a club reception free wi fi and special meal time times a day the only problem that spoiled our impression from hotel was problems with luggage we waited for it hours on check in and about minutes on check out and always check your bills mistakes could happened,1
2111,this hotel is not pretty to look at from the outside but the inside is quite nice we were fortunate enough to not stand in line at the level one reception as we booked the club level and were able to have lovely personalized service for check in where they served drinks with or without alcohol the public reception served champagne the service everywhere is impeccable although it seemed like every employee i encountered had started work in the last weeks to months thus there were many mistakes with their answers to my questions yes even at the club level i had little confidence in our club concierge who had begun work weeks ago as she did not know about a couple attractions and gave us some incorrect information which frustrated us and cost us time the club itself is lovely with a fabulous view and delicious food as well as drink our room on the floor had a view of the sea and the city we loved the size of the room as well as the appointments the rooms were large and the storage plentiful in european standards the fitness facility is excellent and had much more equipment options than i imagined this hotel is well situated on the coast next to the casino if that means anything to you sure to bring id and available to all areas via taxi or bus the pool was crowded but the area poolside was lovely the bed by the way was,1
2113,very good hotel big hotel very nice the service is very nice the rooms are very goodthe price is expensive the breakfast is very goodnice localization need to have reservation good pool in front of ocean,1
2114,hotel arts is a beautiful hotel located on the beach in barcelona it location is convenient to the metro and of course the beautfiul beach the staff were amazingly kind and considerate their customer service is the best of any hotel i have ever stayed in,1
2115,top class hotel great facilities for events and meetings very central to all requirements fabulous breakfast for busy schedule excellent gym rooms are spacious with great beds and space to work or just relax a little bathrooms are equipped the shower with ledge to sit is great otherwise soak it up in the bath in summer this must be the place for couples with everything on the beach and nearby if you a foodie book in advance to enoteca paco p√©rez summer months they do lunch and dinner and will accommodate kids to an extent cooler months can be easier to get in this is in the hotel but leased out great wine list for the anorak to the help me peeps tough decision not to stay in hotel again on my return a few months later but needed easier access to another part of town bar hoppers best you head out but it ok for a night cap or drink while you wait meeting spot,1
2116,stayed a few nights last week to kick off a jaunt through spain portugal we re platinum and were upgraded to a higher floor facing the city beach which was appreciated decided against the club level upgrade since we d be touring most of the general the hotel is beautiful but falls a little bit short of standards the bathrooms were lovely sitting bed area plenty spacious but somewhat sparsely decorated definitely appreciated the shades as we were a little the hotel staff was wonderful and couldn t have been more helpful the folks at the desk were great the concierge was very helpful and the complimentary champagne cold water in the lobby is always appreciated the main issue we had with the hotel is the location it s located on the beach and is far from the old town tourist attractions sure you get access to the beach but most ppl don t come to barcelona for beaches and then there s the issue of foot traffic from the cruise ships which isn t always the most pleasant we found ourselves spending a significant amount of time in transit between the hotel and other parts of town when it would have just been easier to stay elsewhere overall a perfectly lovely hotel but be aware of its locations with regards to what you want to do and the extra time you may need to allot for transiting between the hotel and the main tourist attractions of the city,1
2117,it was for us a great experience my kids was so glad to make their fist kids the pool is small but there is not to much people the localization is near the beach and the olympic port i recommand this hotel,1
2118,this property has it all we were upgraded to a superb room on he floor and had a delicious dinner at the hotel we loved the location and were not dismayed having to take taxis to the many sites of barcelona what makes this ritz stand out is the staff who are the best trained of any ritz south beach take a lesson please and go out of their way to make the guests comfortable we plan to return before years end thanks to valentine mijan and lorrenzo for their gracious service you are the reason that ritz carlton continues the tradition of excellence,1
2119,family with kids stayed nights in an executive corner suite second visit friendly check in process with drinks offered large suite with lounge area queen sized beds bathroom with bathtub separate shower and toilet room was cleaned twice daily this is a huge hotel with a lot of guests from all over the world so it tends to be a bit busy especially the pool area which might be a bit small compared to the size of the hotel it can be difficult to get a sunbed by the breakfast buffet with and its also possible to order eggs any style etc from the attentive staff great by the pool and a nice cocktail bar close to the reception area world class spa on the floor top notch concierge service and we got some great restaurant distance to the beach a ton of restaurants nearby the hotel is first class all the way and its easy to recommend definitely worth a try a good tip is to use the express check out form so you do not have to wait in line when leaving,1
2121,the staff make this hotel they are all just rooms ours was floor have great views we were over the marina stunning food was great and service well downside only one it was v expensive oh and the pool and spa on the top floor is a must,1
2122,stayed because i am a marriott member the hotel was excellent location fantastic roooms excellent staff phenominal only issue is prices in the in hotel are astronomical we ate out but absolutely loved the hotel itself beautiful clean great location,1
2123,very convenient location during our visit outstanding hotel spacious room service and restaurants in the hotel staff is very attending and well trained to provide excellent service we will definitely stay there during our next visit,1
2124,just returned from a long weekend in barcelona staying in the hotel arts our party comprised three generations including a twelve year old and a sixteen year old in every respect this is a superb hotel wonderful facilities welcoming helpful and friendly staff throughout the hotel having spent three days exploring this beautiful city it was bliss to come back to the pool or simply relax in one of the quiet areas i hope to return in the not too distant future,1
2125,i had never heard of this hotel but it is a part of the ritz carlton brand which summarizes the service stars from to staff make every effort to provide service staff will greet you in halls etc stars on the beach many restaurants near boat tours at the doorstep the hip on hop off bus stops outside the hotel metro stop is a short walk through a park cabs easy to get casino and clubs walking distance rooms clean nice amenities good bed tip opt for a club room the club is wonderful meal servings wine and beer snacks nice view great staff made our trip a true vacation stay here again would not stay anywhere else in barcelona,1
2126,second visit to the arts in wonderful barcelona we were greeted in the club lounge and presented to a nice upgraded room along with the room for our children enjoyed very much these updated rooms in the upper floors with beautiful views of the mediterranean and barcelona there are six restaurants and bars to choose from serving everything from light informal breakfasts and lunches to exceptional catalan cuisine we specially enjoyed the cafe veranda for breakfast with so many delicious choices from local options to chinese fried rice to regular crepes pancakes it was a fun start everyday nearby there are many small restaurants not very good but there is also a the beach area to enjoy and drink a real sangria while watching the sunset ramble area is a good minute walk but the hotel has always lots of taxis and private ones for transportation the club lounge is worth it they have offerings a day and its nice to unwind late in the afternoon with a nice cava and a few local appetisers while discussing dinner plans the staff at the lounge is well trained and help you with reservations and options for dining and exploring the town recommend the rooms with lounge access,1
2127,at hotel arts in barcelona we had a great room with a wonderful view of both the harbor and the ocean very service minded staff especially at the pool area even if it is rather small for the hotel size they do their outmost to service the guests especially lea a very pleasant stay only thing breakfast is pricy and so is lunch at the pool restaurant but you have many options as the hotels is placed close to many restaurants,1
2128,i stayed for two nights with a group in the hotel in may we were very well treated rooms are lovely huge double bed and fab bathrooms with all the comforts of home my view was not great but the swimming pool was very nearby the hotel is well situated just afew minutes walk to the beach and a nice stroll to the centre of activities food was lovely and they cater for all types of food requirements,1
2129,i had a stay here in july room the room itself was very nice and had a lovely view over the beach the bed was comfortable and the shower was ok though it seemed to veer between freezing and scalding with no discernible state in between whatever i did to the temperature dial breakfast was good and the pool area is very pleasant albeit crowded there was a well equipped gym the only quibble being that the tvs on the did not work and were still not working on the day i left despite my reporting the problem on the first day the staff in the hotel were the biggest asset as they seemed unusually capable and friendly bear in mind that the location of the hotel is just by the sea so ideal if you want to use the public beach or look out over the sea but most restaurants and sights will be a taxi ride away not a problem but just to bear in mind depending on your preferences there is a club area with food and drink though if you want this then maybe best to book a room with it built in as to purchase access is a hefty a day and there is even a waiting list for this wifi is chargeable unless you have a marriot rewards number or similar,1
2130,i appreciate the attention to detail and the welcoming feeling you receive when staying at the barcelona arts hotel when i left my passports in the safe and called from the airport to pick them up the staff had them waiting at the valet station when i arrived to expedite my returning to the airport in a timely manner,1
2131,we stayed here for our final two nights in barcelona the hotel is great the room was over the top awesome see pix the staff was friendly and helpful especially oriol freixas who treated us as though we were royalty the bed was ritz quality and the bathroom products were ok molton we stayed in room which has a panoramic view of all of barcelona including the beaches the only complaint that we had was that this hotel is not in the best part of town we tried to go off premises to have dinner but we quickly ran back to the hotel to eat there as the neighborhood was a bit seedy no question we would stay here again,1
2132,great hotel excellent location staff is eager to please rooms are gorgeous and for euros a night this is a good deal we look to stay here again soon as we had an overwhelmingly positive experience,1
2133,this is a hotel so quality is assured i love the location which is close to the beach and marina not inconvenient if you want to visit the tourist sites and the bus stops nearby greenline one of my all time favourite hotels reserve the vip pool loungers for a spacious day in the sun,1
2134,this place is simply amazing the hotel is stunning the service is and the rooms are gorgeous did i mention how awesome the service is there is always someone around to help you out answer your questions or to simply wish you a buenos dias oh and added bonus the entire staff speaks english,1
2135,this was our second stay at the hotel arts and it was as great as i remember fantastic service and the location is awesome the pool area is fantastic and the overall food choices at the property are top notch,1
2136,we are world travelers best hotel we have ever stayed at the concierge staff was amazing thank you carlos juanra carmen blanca and fred the house keeping manager sara made us feel like family very hard to find these days we will be back barcelona was a great city the entire staff and the food was just amazing thank you all the seijo,1
2137,easy to resume everything was just amazing we travel the world but this place is just the best ever in all aspect chapeau service cleanness of the room the hotel in general the valet service the employees the concierge everything is just wow,1
2138,my wife and i visited barcelona for the first time this past week and it was absolutely amazing experience staying at the hotel arts barcelona we had stunning room on the floor club level with panoramic views of the ocean and city we highly recommend the club level experience which was out of this world one floor above us was the club room serving meals and drinks from am to pm we stayed four nights and ate of all our meals seriously in the club room the staff in the club room was first class in service and informing us about the hotel and the local activities the next time we travel to barcelona we will be staying at the hotel arts for sure,1
2140,we really enjoyed our stay we are a family of and we were able to really relax here after traveling from the states the staff was very accommodating and kind the food was excellent as well we highly recommend this hotel,1
2141,the hotel arts is not only charming but it has exceptional service food clientele the hotel arts staff truly makes you feel like you have their undecided attention and they help you create a barcelona experience you will never forget i also highly suggest the club level as it make eating snacking so convenient apart from breath taking views the staff on the club level took care of our every whim and desire all in all it was the perfect hotel and i ca wait to stay there again,1
2142,aside from a beautiful hotel they could do enough for you i never actually experienced anything like that before someone grabbed me out of line at check in to bring me to their computer they have someone at the elevator to press the button for you or answer a question if you ask where something is they escort you most of the staff are adorable young students from all over the world working at the hotel while studying in barcelona talking to them all and finding out what country they were from made it very interesting breakfast buffet was amazing location on the beach was good pool are was nice wish they had their own private area on the beach as being in a public area was annoying because it was non stop vendors walking around you chanting what they were selling as in water beer was very nice view was amazing with a corner view beds were amazing,1
2143,from the moment you arrive get in the lift up to reception and receive a champagne reception you feel very special we were allocated a superb room and thought it was fantastic could not be faulted in any way whatsoever only two issues the pool is massively oversubscribed and because it is relatively small you feel it is over run by children also the service prices are astronomical for a burger really other than that this is a top class hotel go adults only guys this establishment is made for it,1
2144,one of my top hotels the location is great seconds from the beautiful beaches of the mediterranean and a short walk into downtown barcelona the hotel is fantastic rooms were in stellar shape the pool was perfect really not a single complaint about our time their car service picked us up promptly from the airport and we were allowed to check in early which was great having just landed on a red eye from the us recommended to anyone traveling to barcelona who wants to enjoy the best of the old city and the beach,1
2145,stayed here in was very disappointed this visit was much better breakfast buffet very european rooms were great responsive service best beach location a cab needed to get to la rambla and shops will stay here again,1
2146,stayed a week in this lovely tidy with great facilities hotel walked to the beach and restaurants our room was overlooking barceloneta it was magnificent paradise in summer highly recommended,1
2147,highly recommend staying at this property everything is first rate the rooms on premise dinning facilities and the staff are first class the property is in an excellent location close to the beach and major attractions would stay here again on my next visit,1
2148,i stayed earlier this year in january during torres winery global conference awesome location and magnificent views both facing sea in the front and the city in the back superb breakfast and very dedicated service i would definitely stay again,1
2149,this is an excellent hotel but with some drawbacks it not very close to anything other than the beach which is a little grimy it a city beach so we found ourselves walking for minutes before hitting anything very interesting the hotel facilities are lovely but are not commensurate to the number of rooms for example the pool is v small and often was overcrowded the lobby was often a zoo the restaurants were packed the staff are very friendly but needed multiple follow ups before any of our requests were handled,1
2150,we stayed for nights at the arts hotel barcelona for a family vacation the hotel itself is big and busy initially at check in we were told that our room was ready and they ca guarantee a time of check in however another room was ready with partial sea this was at pm when asked again how long the wait would be for our requested room sea view again we were told that we could not be given a specific time since we were tired and were traveling with our year old daughter we took the room it was a big spacious room with beautiful views of the sea that made our visit much more pleasant housekeeping were very efficient the pool area was very crowded and noisy for a hotel that size the pool is extremely small however service is great and staff are all very helpful the lobby was very busy and chaotic overall it is a luxurious hotel staff are very kind and go out of their way to help we did face some wrong charges upon check out almost euros extra however that problem was fixed so i guess the hotel needs to work on the computer system that they currently use overall it a nice hotel with helpful staff and a great location and for sure would stay there again,1
2152,i was taking my daughter and two granddaughters on their first trip to europe cruise on mediterranean to italy decided to spend days in lovely barcelona first chose and reserved two rooms beds bathrooms and sea view a year in advance all confirmed and then reconfirmed upon arrival one room ready exactly what i wanted adjoining room was then given away while we waited for luggage offered apologies and then a suite suite had no sea view only beds only full bathroom i was supposed to sleep on a sofa bed and rollaway we let my granddaughters use the suite i went back to original room offered free cocktails with dinner and that was it by the way is near hospital so sirens all night service at meals was excellent but would never use hotel again,0
2153,we had three rooms for a one week stay and each rooms occupants had a wonderful experience rooms were impeccably clean and spacious room service and laundry were well done location is very close to the beach and night life,1
2154,stayed here in and staying here again will not return from management to front desk staff it been a poor experience it not the same they keep apologizing and sending stuff up to the room i need more action less gifts not letting my mother into her room after i specifically asked the front desk intern to add her name to the room at was and is unacceptable especially on a hot summer day management or leads do not help the situations i would list them by name but i will not several situations have occurred since i am not happy please also note most staff are interns but i honestly think it management issue best to all of you who decide to stay it really unfortunate,0
2155,hotel arts is dated expensive chaotic and has a transient lobby full of wealthy overweight not chic guests better go to soho house or mandarin we booked via amex plat and were told we had an upgraded room after going to the room this was not the case and when i followed up with the staff she acknowledged this was not the case why did she lie there was no turn down service in the room carpet fraying interior decorating style of airport hotel rationing of nespresso pods per day per room a food and beverage credit that excluded alcoholic beverages why bother broken ac in gym no availability of lounge chairs by pool until we complained and begged this is why we had booked hotel incidentally pool was overrun with screaming children the second day they upgraded our room which was better and had sea view checkout was chaotic bill was incorrect generally over priced for luxury puts ritz carlton to shame,0
2156,loved our stay at the arts from the moment you walk in until departure everything was service and the view were excellent enoteca restaurant was fabulous but the best was the club its personnel went out of their way to make you feel special,1
2157,first i would like to say the staff at this hotel is superb they upgraded us to a room because it was our honeymoon and let me tell you this room had the most beautiful views of barcelona and the beach estelle went above and beyond to make our honeymoon special thank you so much,1
2158,great place to be if you want to have fun next to the beach excellent water front walk excellent for the athletes of all in the area is just excellent eat sea food its the clubs are the hotel provides excellent concierge service we visited some great places thanks to your concierge in and checking out was really smooth i was informed of the taxi strike and arranged for us to leave earlier,1
2159,i always try and stay at ritz carlton hotels but partly due to the comments of the other reviewers i only stay in club rooms with access to the lounge previous reviews are totally correct this hotel needs to invest some of its income on new carpets and a deep clean of the sofa the decor is fine actually typically rc and there are some nice touches such as sweets for the children the pool area is a joke and not in a good way far too small and unless you get up to save beds at which i was forced to do having had nowhere to sit on the first day you can forget about finding anywhere to sit it was only because the sea was too dirty to let the children swim and beaches no better that we put up with the hotel pool but it such a shame the hotel does spend some money on improving this situation there is the space for a separate club level pool in the garden was very expensive but i do mind this as it keeps certain clientele at bay i have been to more ritz carlton hotels before and it totally ruins the experience at least most fellow guests did have a bit of class and knew how to behave the hotel overall or rather the club rescued our trip after the disappointment of the beach and we were very impressed at the consistency of staff whoever is responsible from,1
2160,we had a glass at the bar at hotel art and it was an amazing and breathtaking experience lovely and very service minded staff and overall a luxury and top experience we will definitely stay here next time drinks are super,1
2162,we celebrated our wedding anniversary at hotel arts the entire staff was absolutely amazing they greeted us by name and made us feel extremely welcomed knowing it was our anniversary they congratulated throughout our stay and really made it special this was a first class hotel i read a few negative reviews and am surprised this hotel was perfect i travel for business weekly throughout the states and have seen the best and the worst this is up there with the best the amenities the cleanliness the beautiful cut flowers dinner recommendations the gym pool were dynamite i do note that it was a short cab ride to almost everything as this hotel is on the beach for us it was perfect we had all the modern amenities and it was less than euro cab ride to everything simply perfect hotel and location thanks barcelona arts we will be back with our children next time,1
2163,i stayed here for a few days with some friends the building is huge and in a great location the staff are helpful friendly and welcoming all staff i met were so polite and kind and happy to stop what the were doing to talk with you the service from the hard working staff really was star the public areas are well maintained and luxurious the views from the hotel are incredible the view of barcelona really is breathtaking to wake up to i felt let down by a few things the pool was far too small for a hotel of this size it was also very shallow i stayed here with the plan of spending a few hours each day by the pool but i only spent two days by the pool as it was not what i expected at all i pre paid for the breakfast but i feel that the choice was very limited and sometimes the scrambled eggs were cold there was a good choice of pastries and bread but limited on hot food and cereals i did not feel like a star breakfast and was not worth what i paid was also a few issues with the room some of the sockets did not work and there was a smell from the they were minor issues but they were resolved and it was what i expected from a star hotel at this price the room itself felt a little dated and in need of a,1
2164,one of the greatest hotel in barcelona spain and europe i recommend it for your journey in barcelona leisure or business as long as you can afford it good services great people and great city do miss the arola restaurant ask anything at the front desk and they can almost provide anything requested neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet consectetur adipisci velit,1
2165,we stayed here on several occasions whilst visiting my favourite city in spain amenities were perfect excellent service and friendly polite and respectful staff everywhere we went from the gym to the swimming pool breakfast etc handy to the beach and niteclubs are within walking distance magnificent night vista over the city highly recommended,1
2166,the hotel arts was meant to be one of the best hotels in barcelona but it does not live up to this hype at those reading this you will probably see all the other star reviews and think this guy is talking nonsense but the truth is that this hotel gives off the air of a business hotel and a conference centre with no soul or atmosphere if you are a family do go here stay at the there was a queue for the lifts and the staff did not even use their own elevator but instead used the guest lift not very useful when there is a queue and nobody can get a paying customers should get priority i think the swimming pool was as small as a fish tank the water was as cold as the atmosphere for a hotel with floors surely there should have been a greater amount of space dedicated to a leisure area furthermore there were no changing rooms on the pool level disappointing for a five star hotel on the contrary when we visited the w hotel which was cheaper saw it had multiple panoramic pools large and spacious enough for a luxury food was another problem our first meal at the pool bar cost us upwards of euros for a family of the pizza was ridiculously overpriced for an oily piece of bread that would have costed euros at max to make but was sold at over euros just because this is,0
2167,so good for a cheap place i really liked how the set up was and how we were able to go from place to place and make sure that the locaiton was legit all of that really helped and i hope to go again so i can help,1
2168,staff were excellent again room very spacious and nice food was excellent and the bar very trendy stayed at ritz carlton many times and will be back againalways helpful and willing to help so thank you,1
2169,the hotel is located near the sea front and is pretty handy for the beach restaurants and on the bus city tour routes we had rooms with double beds with a great sea view on the and floors we asked to have the rooms near each other but the hotel could accommodate the rooms were nicely decorated and very comfortable were very clean with free bottled water by the beds the toiletries provided were nice the rooms were clean and serviced regularly the reception area on the first floor is attractive and the concierge was very helpful with dinner did not eat in the hotel but used the bar in the reception area a couple of times but it was completely without atmosphere and the service was pool area is too small for the hotel and the sun beds are packed in around it we were told that if we left our spot for minutes our beds would be given to someone else and our belongings removed so we could even leave our beds to have lunch the outdoor restaurant by the pool was nice but a little pretentious and not good value for did not have breakfast at the hotel because it was not part of our booking and was ridiculously expensive so we ate in a cafe around the corner which was fine we had a great week in barcelona and despite the comments i have made enjoyed staying at the hotel it is a good base for,1
2172,from the moment i first arrived at the hotel i knew i would have a great stay i was warmly welcomed and the staff recognised my expedia status and were able to offer me an early checkin which was rooms are clean and was adequately sized for me the rooftop pool area was always kept clean with plenty of towels on offer i read someone else complained about the drink prices at the rooftop bar i thought they were too bad especially given the costs of running it staffing it amusing aspect was seeing and speaking to people who did realise it was a hotel when booking they first appear a little nervous and apprehensive but you soon notice them relax and enjoy themselves i would recommend this hotel to all my friends gay or straight,1
2173,my fianc√© and i stayed at two hotel a few days ago and the room was comfortable and quiet great showers with comfortable bed if you decide to watch television and i would hope you did the channel selection is pretty good the rooftop area is quaint and relaxing with a good bar we really enjoyed andres everyone at the front desk was great and extremely friendly the area is awesome with tons of restaurants and great shopping i will certainly stay here again and would recommend it,1
2174,the hotel is really nice and quaint the staff is friendly and helpful they gave us tips on where to go how to get there and where to eat hotel has a cute rooftop bar pool area hot tub gym and sauna,1
2175,sometimes when you get to a gay hotel or a you expect that rude attitude towards people gay people tend to mix professionalism with drama and sometimes that mixture goes wrong in the case of two barcelona things kept professional with points to improve the breakfast is fine the fruit selection is faulty and the maid cleaned my room after despite that everything went fine expect those clones of all age showing off their bodies and sometimes sad grindry hornety faces that is gay life in the century where people act much and mean very little,1
2176,we were on holiday with my mom and we both really liked this hotel the stuff was friendly breakfast was really good and the atmosphere was really pleasant the pool area was amazing the room was nicely decorated even though it was a bit surprising that the bathroom was basically a separate shower and toilet behind a glass walls however we did mind it because it was just the two of us,1
2177,this review written by a actually i lost my card homosexual while i generally not one for into gay locations for vacations i have understood the appeal of a hotel there have been a few instances in my life where traveling with a same sex companion raised eyebrows you just want one bed or bringing a gentleman back to a room for the night was an issue i stayed at the axel property in berlin and there was something nice if a bit quaint about just being around my queer bros there so that not a bad twohotel either by initial design or reorientation ahem is not that from the proliferation of reviews here saying we did know it was a gay themed hotel but liked it anyway my guess is the gay theme did pay off at first and they have marketed it around europe as a fashionable discount location which in fact it is and i must say the idea of a little sheen of as just a tourist atractiion not as a rule for entry is kind of appealing as we queers become more and more accepted and so this place seemed to be about gay dudes as far as i could tell and honestly i realized pretty quickly i could tell and it really did matter i stayed during a major event at fira a convention center just down the street and while other nearby hotels were charging and up two was still affordable its location,1
2178,my partner and i booked this hotel without realizing we were doing so during pride week we aren t really the party type and weren t really sure what to expect we were apprehensive to say the least i can absolutely recommend this hotel without hesitation in fact we can t think of anywhere else we would rather stay when visiting barcelona the staff were extremely kind and helpful special to jaime who has an excellent sense of humor i m a sucker for jokes they upgraded our room upon so we had a nice balcony overlooking the street this was much appreciated the facilities were modern and clean we really enjoyed the rooftop pool in the afternoons when it was entirely too hot to walk or generally move around the city drinks are expensive up there but it s expected that you pay for the convenience fyi you have the option to pay at the bar and not charge the drink to your room we liked this since we didn t incur a huge charge there s also a nice little community park behind the hotel with plenty of places to sit and relax we enjoyed purveying neighborhood life here the hotel is located a bit outside of main tourist zones but we liked that it felt more like a local neighborhood there s a metro station located less than a block away that will get you anywhere in the city very quickly still pla√ßa montjuic and the lovely,1
2179,my first compliment goes to daniel the gm his high level of focus permeates the entire hotel in all departments the hotel is pristine it a hip and central location close to subway the guest composition is diverse in every sense of the word the employees are multilingual and always eager to help you get bank for your buck great value,1
2180,this hotel is for you who are looking for a gay hotel in barcelona and a more affordable alternative than the other axel hotel the hotel is stylish and clean and the receptionists are really friendly and helpful there is for sure a gay feel to the hotel although the hotel is a little more laid back than the other axel hotel the roof top is nice but normally not as busy as axel rooftop the hotel is located in the sant antonio area just a minute walk from the gay neighborhood of eixample gaixample,1
2181,i stayed at the hotel for four days and it was just a very good i arrived i was welcomed personally by the hotel manager daniel he ensured that i had everything i room was very modern clean and quiet i felt at home from the beginning and enjoyed every day on the rooftop pool and at the sauna of the hotel axel min awaythe breakfast buffet was very nice too and obviously barcelona rocks thank you daniel and thank you team axel two to make me feel home robert,1
2182,my wife and i just checked into this hotel last night what a treat the axel group hotels is apparently for gay men however in their advertisement they say they are hetero friendly and indeed they are great staff great room great service great location etc etc there are a few gay men staying here but plenty of hetero couples like pool on the roof is open hours love it recommend,1
2183,loved this hotel gorgeous interior very well located the rooms are fab and the roof top pool is great during the day if ya want to cool down after a long hot day in barcelona but wait there more you can use the pool anytime so at in the morning and you fancy a dip you can head on up and do worry about it being cold the pool is heated at night time loved every second of this hotel,1
2184,great hotel with most modern facilities centrally located and above all they have very friendly staff to the hotel manager daniel calvo who was very helpful in sorting out an issue during my stay recommend,1
2185,my husband and i stay at two for two nights three days and just found it to be excellent we total enjoyed the experience and will be sure to return again and again two of course is the sister hotel of alex hotel who facilities were also available to us two is a little quieter and maybe more relaxed with fine rooms and showers we live in the us and prefer walking showers with doors that close complete all of the hotels we stayed in in lisbon porto and san sebastian had step in tubs with petitions that did not close so for us it was difficult to get a great show two has great showers if you looking for a spa the full service spa is in alex hotel a short walk away where we had the best massage ever,1
2188,we travelled to barcelona for a wedding last october and decided to stay in this great hotel part of all are great and were delighted with the hotel the hotel is located in the eixample surrounded by classy restaurants and shops and very near of passeig de gracia and plaza catalu√±a great transport links and very quiet arrived early in the morning and were lucky to have our room ready on the floor overlooking the nicest courtyard i have seen in a long time great amenities and a very tasteful decoration which made our is served on the ground level and gives you the option to enjoy the sun in its courtyard terrace great international and national buffet breakfast selection,1
2189,first off the location is great as is close to everything but not in the middle of all the tourists at the end of a day of touring all you want is to escape from the masses stay away from the old quarter and enjoy a glass of wine by a pool ahh art gallery has both the location and the pool on its rooftop if you like art then you have a bonus as there is a gallery in the basement with exhibition as well as permanent collection throughout the hotel in fact each floor is named after an artist while all of that makes for a huge winner in barcelona there are a few areas that could use improvement the carpets are worn and the rooms at least ours had markings on the walls from wear and tear the pool is a great escape but be forewarned that it is shallow so no diving either way you love the view and you can order drinks and food to enjoy your rest there is a small training room next to the pool but we never used the exercise since we walked all day service is fine not over the top but you receive a welcome glass of cava champagne and cleaning is very good breakfast is a nice buffet and most people enjoy that enjoy,1
2190,my daughter and i were very happy staying here we were welcomed warmly by very helpful staff in reception the hotel is in a very good central location with good access to the touristic tour buses which we booked at the hotel red and blue routes three blocks away it is surrounded by bars and restaurants we enjoyed a complimentary cocktail by the shallow pool in the evening the breakfast staff were very kind helpful and attentive the breakfast menu was brought to us for the cooked breakfast and there were plenty of choices for the fresh additional continental breakfast our room was small and kept very clean and tidy by the housekeeping staff it was a quiet internal room on the fifth floor and had a lovely ensuite the wifi worked very well in our room there was a docking station for recharging my daughters phone the complimentary coffee is quite strong espresso in small cups i always take a travel kettle and mugs with me however the hotel says it does supply kettles on request room service is prompt and friendly the decor was delightful and we loved the themed floors and galleries the staff left us a note in our room to warn us in advance of taxi and airport strikes and offered to help with alternative transport to the airport we had already booked a transfer bus and the hotel confirmed our times for us the left luggage after check out is carefully ticketed in a,1
2191,as soon as you arrive you can tell the hotel is going to be special it is beautifully and even smells lovely the check in was smooth and the artfully decorated lobby is a welcome surprise even the corridors are decorated artistically just providing that special touch the room was lovely and again really good the special touches like the toiletries provided free bottles of water on the first night and even a little pack of biscuits on the side when we arrived all made it even nicer we had a problem which the staff dealt with immediately and very well the staff were very attentive and provided us with information for how to get to the airport and let us know when there was an issue with taxis the rooftop pool was the real highlight of the hotel was too busy towels were provided again by attentive staff the pool is very deep but was a nice way to get out of the heat and can see a view of the mountains through the other roofs the location is a really good way to explore barcelona close to a metro station and not too far to even walk to the centre restaurants near by as well as little supermarkets,1
2192,we spent a fantastic week at this lovely hotel the room public areas were spotless and the staff friendly are so many great restaurants nearby a little off the main tourist areas but close enough to all the attractions making this the perfect base,1
2193,after lots of research we finally settled on this hotel and were very happy we decided to go for the basic double room because we were planning on not being in the hotel much and it was a perfect choice the room had everything we needed for our stay a comfy bed toiletries such as shampoo conditioner shower gel soap toothbrush etc hairdryer and slippers and dressing gown there were also towels for the room and towels for around the pool you can even borrow an iron and ironing board which was good because my husband wanted to his hotel had everything we could need which was perfect for our city break there were quite a few bars restaurants and shops in walking distance from the hotel and there was a metro station within a short walking distance we would recommend and would stay again if we were ever to return to barcelona,1
2194,this hotel was typical for europe where the rooms are rather small the room was comfortable the staff was absolutely great and the hotel is very near public transportation and the restaurant district we spend very little time in the hotel while we are traveling so our main concerns are comfortable sleep cleanliness and location this hotel supplied all of that very well,1
2195,what a great hotel this is we loved the area and loads of nice restaurants to eat close by breakfast was wonderful and the pool on the roof was great after a full day out to spend an hour or so relaxing by it before going out for our evening meal,1
2196,was headed to barcelona for a convention and decided to arrive a week ahead of time whenevr there a convention in town prices seem to be very high found this place in a great location blocks away from passeig de gracia at a great price the hotel exceeded my expectations the decor is beautiful chic trendy modern and full of art breakfast was very good and enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful terrace beautiful tree in the middle you would never think you in the city sitting on that terrace the room was very comfortable nice bathroom however my room was on the floor and quite noisy people in spain seem to go to bed at am so i could hear people partying outside i went to the front desk after trying to sleep in that room for nights they right away changed my room to an upper floor at no additional cost very helpful and friendly staff also right near the hop on hop off bus stop la pedreira which was great would recommend this hotel any time,1
2197,what a funky hotel if you want ordinary then do stay at the soho but if you want delightful extras such as mood lighting romantic rooms comfortable beds excellent reception staff and a huge superior breakfast using locally sourced fresh produce then book at soho with confidence and the central location tops it off we loved visting barcelona and staying at soho was the cream on the cake,1
2198,our third stay at this wonderful hotel we had a room on the floor with a big terrace facing the street it can be a bit noisy because of the traffic but it did not bother us roof top terrace and the small pool are great for relaxation and some sun bathing breakfast concept is both modern and traditional the new detox juices and other fruity dishes make an excellent alternative for the more traditional bacon and eggs but really there everything you need for a full breakfast the staff are really friendly service with a smile the location is very convenient near the city centre with undergound station just a minute away and good bus connections we want to come back,1
2199,absolutely fantastic staff amazing facilities room service lounging areas and a completely comfortable stay very good value for money and would reccomend to anyone bus and metro stop right outside the hotel with a supermarket came in very handy,1
2200,have just returned from barcelona and staying at the hotel soho was such a good decision the rooms are very modern with lovely touches such as mood lighting complimentary safe magnetic door signs high quality shower amazing air con etc the whole hotel is scrupulously clean the design of the hotel is cool lots of metallic finishes and so well thought out the staff are excellent personally remembering your room key and number after meeting you once there is always someone on reception hours a day they control who comes into the hotel so you feel very safe at all times the rooftop pool is perfect for a dip to cool off in and a very relaxing place to lie in the sun as barcelona bustles about beneath you it is in an excellent central location with taxis available as you soon as step outside i would definitely return to this hotel it really made me and my friends holiday so much more enjoyable,1
2201,great hotel in an excellent location spacious trendy rooms very good internet connection within walking distance to everywhere staff were always very polite knowledgable and welcoming we would definitely stay again,1
2202,my wife and i have recently returned from a day stay at the barcelona universal and have nothing but praise for the staff are so helpful and polite and ca do enough to make your stay more enjoyable during check in we were informed that we had been given a free room upgrade which was a very welcoming surprise the hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff work very hard to maintain it that way our room was on the floor and looked out on to road at the front of the hotel and although the road was busy the double glazed windows did an excellent job at blocking out the traffic noise bed linen and bathroom towels were changed daily and the air conditioning in the room was probably the best i have ever encountered in a hotel which was a godsend as the outdoor temperature was well in to the rooftop bar is excellent with a good selection of beers spirits and cocktails the bar really comes alive at night and offers some great views across the city the rooftop pool is small but ideal for cooling off in when the daytime heat gets too only criticism and which others have already mentioned would be the occasional smell from the drains the smell of sewage would sometimes be in the hotels corridors and also near the rooftop bar at times it could be quite strong but was only encountered a couple times during our stay so did impact,1
2203,went here for nights on my hen do great location and great breakfast but unfortunately that where the positives end two of the group had money stolen from their rooms and the staff at reception could have cared less rooms regularly smelt of smoke and weed which appeared to be coming through the air con huge stag do took over the pool and bar and staff made no attempt to keep them quiet during the day or night when they returned home screaming at around staff were loud and in the inner rooms where the window looked down on to what can only be described as a dumping ground heard quite a few people complain on checking out and not once were we asked if we enjoyed our stay total disappointment would go again and would recommend this place to anyone,0
2204,we chose this hotel for its location and roof top location was excellent very central and easy walk to the attractions of the waterfront la ramblas catalunya plaza and espanya plaza we had a room on th floor just overlooking the rooftops around room had all amenities we needed and the bed very comfortable the bathroom was spacious but the floor could be slippery when wet the rooftop area was lovely nice spots to sit and relax we did not use the pool we went to use it one afternoon and there was a large group of men drinking around it taking up all the space and being very loud that would be the only complaint i would have about our stay the breakfast buffet was excellent,1
2205,the location of this hotel is excellent for what we wanted the staff were lovely nothing was to much trouble they really are a credit to the hotel right next to the metro station so easy to access the main sights will defiantly book this hotel again,1
2206,we stayed here for nights in july to spend most of our time sight seeing this hotel was the perfect choice the hotel is centrally located within seconds of a tube staff were always friendly welcoming and the hotel felt safe with onsite security at entrance bed and breakfast represented excellent value for money every day breakfast was fresh and excellent variety including soya almond and lacto free milks pastries fresh fruit yogurt cereals and hot the roof top pool and bar were rooms were cleaned daily to a very high the hotel is quiet and well maintained we stayed in a triple room which was very ample lots of space plenty for would most certainly recommend and would stay again,1
2207,no disappointments from our return visit to the universal we stayed for three nights in a superior room at the front room modern great air conditioning needed and all the basics being at the front there was some street noise but hey it a busy city famous for night life the hotel was quiet though loved having a pool on the roof also the roof top space is well used with seating areas and a sun bathing deck there is a bar too sea city and montjuic views made relaxing evenings we did eat our evening meals there but drinks were pretty standard hotel prices for a large beer for a cocktail breakfasts were good lots of choice personally i would have preferred tea or coffee made and served it came from a machine and you served yourself but it was fine really you pretty much got on with it at breakfast restaurant looks new and is a pleasant environment the lobby and reception staff were knowledgeable and helpful the location is ace mins to la ramblas placa reial about mins walk to see the magic fountains and just across the road from metro and funicular we enjoyed our stay very much,1
2208,four night stay in a superior double room perfect location and great value views from the hotel were stunning and it seemed to be the only hotel with a pool terrace on offer in the local area it was the perfect setting to relax in the evening and included a live singer one night which was superb reception dealt with any queries quickly and effectively view from the room was onto the back of the hotel and local flats but it was not an issue and probably helped guard from any noise on the main street the hotel restaurant named the wolf tavern offered a small but great menu especially for vegetarians complimentary beer tasting and afternoon tea were nice touches all employees were helpful and made the atmosphere great especially on the roof terrace it is clear the hotel manager values every guest and asks for their feedback when they return home looking forward to returning to the hotel again,1
2209,my husband i stayed here for a week and had a beautiful stay it is close to the ramblas but not too close it a bit of a walk to the barri gotic but we love walking so did not mind the breakfasts were very filling and we often did eat anything again until dinner the rooftop bar and pool are a real pleasure with amazing views of the city very memorable stay,1
2210,we arrived at the hotel after a very long delayed flight from singapore so it was nice to be greeted and served by lovely helpful staff who showed us where all the main attractions where on a map and gave us heaps of information visited the pool which was nice and seemed to be popular great sangria from the pool nice staff our room was lovely and was big especially as we were women travelling and needed twin beds and we were able to make tea coffee a must for us and not found in most of the hotels on our europe trip the hotel was within walking distance of la rambla and other attractions breakfast was wonderful catering for everyone highly recommend,1
2212,nice place good location cool rooftop pool and views good food from restaurant friendly helpful staff train station is right in front of hotel for convenience near lots good bars and restaurants as well,1
2213,stayed here for nights for my son and we got a large family room which was a good size doubles and really large bathroom hotel is in a good location and you can stroll into la ramblas beach front in no time we were out and about most of the time but did find time to chill at the roof top pool one afternoon and we used the roof top bar early evening which was comfortable good views breakfasts were very good with loads of choice and even though it was really busy it did have a canteen feel about it the bar staff were friendly and the receptionists were great especially as there was a taxi strike on the day we left and she gave us correct and precise directions to get a bus which we appreciated i would recommend this hotel and be aware that you pay deposit or is that just the brits,1
2214,stayed here for nights friday saturday the hotel was in a good location welcomed by a friendly receptionist be aware you have to leave a deposit on arrival for bar purchases etc as we were a party of ladies we had a triple room the room was large and very clean although we could hear our neighbours so not sure how soundproof the rooms are it didnt really bother us as we literally only slept in the room there was much in the way of natural light again not really something that bothered us we did pay the for breakfast instead choose to visit local cafes much more reasonably priced we used the rooftop pool and bar the cocktails were great as was the snack highly recommend this hotel as it is in a great location for exploring the beautiful barcelona the rooms were comfortable and the staff really helpful,1
2215,traveling with our old boy we got the most perfect hotel room ever very nice suite our son has his own apartment with a nice big bed we have a nice huge bathroom and a nice balcony outside just perfect this hotel has a very nice bar on the roof with pool and sun chairs all over we did not have time to use it in daytime but used it every night after coming home after all exiting things to do at the day in town the neighborhood is nice you live close to nice breakfast places and also the tapas street de blei,1
2217,we stayed here for one night before our cruise traveled with a tween so needed a triple room and we were very happy with the size of the room and the amenities checkin in was easy and our room was ready early we had a corner with large windows and a street view with lots of natural light but good light blocking curtains for sleeping road noise was not really an issue for us separate bathroom and large foyer was very nice a problem with wifi in the room was fixed quickly upon request we enjoyed the pool area all afternoon and had a nice snack in the evening downstairs in the restaurant wait staff were very nice and accommodating we were thrilled with the pool and rooftop area the breakfast the next morning was fantastic tons of fresh fruits eggs breads charcuterie cheeses etc something for even mimosas we will definitely recommend to traveling,1
2218,my husband and i had been doing some traveling prior to our stay at this hotel once we got to our room we felt like we were returning to the comforts of home the bed had a full mattress with no splits the decor was modern and super clean the bathroom had a tub and lovely tile the air conditioning worked well highly recommend,1
2219,perfect location wise for a first time visitor to barcelona right next to the metro station plenty of restaurants and bars nearby walking distance to the main areas had a suite on the top floor which was superb apart from getting woken up at by staff cleaning the rooftop pool area the breakfast was simply stunning highly recommend staying here,1
2220,location staff room and the breakfast were great recommend to everybody beach is mins shops and restaurants are around the a lidl is near pool is very small but who cares if there is a great beach,1
2221,barcelona universal hotel is a well equipped hotel located in the center of barcelona just a few yards from metro station parallel the staff is very service orientated and they were keen on making sure you as a customer feel very can highly recommend universal we had rented two privileged rooms,1
2222,i booked and paid in advance for a superior room which was rather more expensive than the standard room however on check in we were given a standard room these rooms do not have windows and i was aware of this which is why i booked the more expensive room on alerting the reception staff we were given another room next the lift on another floor the hotel is not well sound proofed and we heard people coming and going in and out of the lift all night for nights the hotel had allowed a large group of british men to book a large number of rooms at the hotel they took over the pool and bar area and had no respect for other guests and some were staying on our floor and very loud this was the last stop for us after an week trip and we were looking forward to sitting by the pool which we were not comfortable in doing we were required to pay a euro bond on our debit card which we were told would be refunded on check out at checkout we were told this refund would take days we stayed in hotels throughout europe and this was the only hotel that took a security bond reception staff were condensing and not very approachable on the positive the breakfast was very good and the location very central,0
2223,we stayed here for nights and the hotel was perfect a great location right next to the metro but also within walking distance of la rambles and the main harbour hotel staff are all very friendly the bar and restaurant are both good and reasonably priced we did get to use the roof top pool as it was that hot but the roof terrace has great views and i am sure from may onwards the pool would be great highly recommend this hotel if you are doing a short break to barcelona,1
2224,we booked this hotel fairly late notice at a great price for the location we were very happy with the service and room etc the rooftop pool and bar were excellent for early morning swims too will return again here for my time in barcelona thanks,1
2225,my daughter and i stayed at this hotel for a wonderful days we had a fantastic view of barcelona rooftops we could even see the sagrada familia and other tourist sites from our window the breakfast was plentiful and varied it definitely suited my vegan daughter with two choices of milk oat and soya as well as my self the gym swimming pool and fresh fruit cocktails on the roof certainly provided a relaxing end to the days where we trekked around a very warm barcelona city speaking of the city the location of the hotel is perfect not too close to las ramblas la boqueria etc so it was too noisy or crowded nearby montjuic too the metro station is right outside the hotel lobby which provides great access to every possible area you would wish to visit many people spend extra money on transport from the airport but we found using the hola transport card the metro was an apropos and cheaper form of transport from the terminals ca recommend this hotel and barcelona high enough we wish to return soon,1
2226,me my mum and my daughter stayed here for nights and really enjoyed our stay the hotel was a handy location by local transport sights and the staff were friendly and helpful our room was lovely spacious and clean there was always plenty of clean towels in the bathroom toiletries and a hairdryer was provided the breakfast was plentiful and yummy as was was the food we tasted from the restaurant and bar the upstairs roof top terrace with bar and pool was a lovely space and we ended up spending a lot more time there than originally planned although only a small pool a lovely extra for a city hotel on checking in and checking out the hotel staff allowed us to check our bags into their luggage room so we could enjoy every moment of our holiday had a lovely holiday and would definitely book into this hotel again if we barcelona,1
2227,we were made to feel welcome at this hotel from we arrived till we left everything was to a high standard and the staff were very friendly and helpful the rooms are great quiet and well equipped with a safe and a kettle nice decor and a good cleaning service we had a view of the beautiful green mount juic and from the roof terasse we enjoyed the views of the whole area it was so pleasant and relaxing to spend time up there in the evenings with nice staff and a great selection of drinks also non alcoholic and snacks the breakfast room is lovely and the breakfast is excellent with everything you can imagine the hotel even provides you with a cup of tea or coffee in the lobby before you leave for the airport we felt safe and very well treated at this hotel and would love to come back,1
2228,very good hotel we had room on floor with great panoramic view hotel right next to metro and funicular latter links with cable cars up to the fort easy walk to gothic area great cocktail bar just behind clean rooms excellent breakfast small roof pool enough for a cool down dip with plenty of deck chairs fresh towels and a good bar friendly staff good location for all main sites would happily stay here again,1
2230,skip over this property and look somewhere else i start this review by saying we have traveled all over north america and this is our trip to europe we always travel to to countries for as many weeks so depending on location season and certainly our budget we have stayed in large small and star properties even in a hostel which was more superior to this hotel so in fairness we have experienced many levels of quality and service with each property in my view this is a star hotel at best the booking site agoda had completely dropped the ball by not communicating our special request that it was our anniversary and we would appreciate any special consideration upon checking in they had no record of it when we mentioned it no one even acknowledged or said congratulations i do recognize that we booked a standard room but what we got was the absolute worse room a hotel can offer this hotel and its parent company nn group should be ashamed to market a room like this to its guests the room had a small frosted window which you ca see through never seen that before it opened to a courtyard with full of construction junk and noise the room is small and dilapidated see pics after complaining the front desk person said oh i know i move you apparently it was a room with some history then they moved us one floor up to a room that had,0
2231,we were supposed to stay at the hotel but they were having problems with their plumbing systems so we were upgraded and directed to their sister hotel the barcelona universal which was approx metres from the this hotel was on the main road and quite impressive the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and we had help with our suitcases to our room the room was very large and airy and quiet the bathroom a decent size and the beds were extremely restaurant was more like a bistro the menu was not very large but the food was very tasty and i would recommend the steaks the best i have had in a long time the service was quick and the staff very would most certainly recommend this hotel and if i go to barcelona i would book at this hotel again,1
2232,we spent one night in this hotel it is really beautiful room was nice and well furnished with style breakfast was good with plenty of is free and it works is around min away from airport by they were not helpful in granting an early when we reached they said is at which is really too issue we had with the ac all the sudden lots of dust came out on the floor but we did inform them it was only one night and we were out most of the time,1
2233,the staffs at the coffee shop in breakfast is very friendly esp the receptionists and soo thankful for them that they had picked up return a precious rings to me after i check out thx sooo much,1
2234,beautiful hotel well equipped rooms very clean the hotel is in a great location close to activities but the room itself was very peaceful we would definitely stay here again wifi service was poor to mediocre,1
2235,the services at this hotel were impeccable from housecleaning to concierge everyone was superbly helpful the room was conformable quiet and well arranged extra luxuries like robes slippers and every possible toiletry item was available water tea and coffee were free on the top tray in the room a separate closet area was a smart touch it kept the room from looking cluttered breakfast was abundant in its choices and superbly fresh there were meats cheeses eggs of every style sandwiches pancakes waffles custom juices and a variety of cereals yogurt and fruit i sure something is missing it was quite the cornucopia the hotel was centrally located which made it very easy to get to any point of interest by the garcia metro station or by cab by the way cabs are much cheaper in spain than in the usa do hesitate to treat yourself if you going to a tricky location,1
2236,really enjoyed our night stay at the hotel clean and comfortable and the rooftop bar and pool were amazing with incredible reviews great location too definitely recommended the only reason i did give it was the service no specific issues but it was special i definitely go back though,1
2237,we absolutely loved our stay at nh collection barcelona gran hotel calder√≥n in barcelona lovely clean quiet and comfortable room spacious bathroom with nice amenities quick elevators excellent free wifi wonderful breakfast buffet optional at additional cost we included breakfast in our booking service especially the concierge and the hotel manager excellent restaurant for dinner too don giovanni highlight of outstanding concierge service was solving a complicated baggage problem when on short notice we needed to send two lb suitcases to our next hotel in madrid the concierge found a suitable courier service at a reasonable cost arranged for and took our suitcases under the hotel care until the courier accepted them for shipment the next time we saw the suitcases was in our hotel room in madrid the concierge also helped us with directions gave us good restaurant recommendations and provided a decent map to guide us while we toured the city on hotel manager inquired several times about how we were enjoying our stay and even wrote a personal note thanking us for our patronage service from his staff was totally breakfast buffet was a joy extensive offerings of all sorts of meats cheeses breads and pastries jams and jellies sushi eggs cooked to order sandwiches fruits coffees teas cold beverages including juices and even a smoothie bar great service too as you sit with the plates you filled from the buffet then servers bring your drinks and any hot foods you ordered like the freshly cooked omelets,1
2238,we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel very friendly and customer oriented front office concierge staff lovely junior suite yet bathroom was somewhat small compared to the size of the room great location sumptuous breakfast roof top swimming pool it all really worked for us,1
2239,great revamped hotel in good location and excellent value for money room was huge with seperate lounge nice sized bathroom but just a shower and no bath room was quiet free wifi decent breakfast well worth a visit,1
2240,modern and stylish city centre conveniently hotel with well equipped good sized rooftop bar and pool are particular attractions with pretty much degree views of the city although drinks a tad pricey,1
2241,we picked the nh as we have stayed at nh hotels before we had a great hotel room with two balconies not sure about the other rooms but ours had wooden flooring and not carpets as i prefer wooden flooring it was a big bonus for us location wise we had the best part of the city with great tapas bars food market and walking distance to train stations staff was very friendly and everything was not too much when we needed something loads of taxis was outside so that it was not an issue to get to the airport,1
2242,stayed in room own balcony clean and comfortable quiet hotel location is perfect good tapas etc restaurants just steps away friendly staff breakfast buffet was terrific gym and rooftop pool sufficient enough,1
2243,the hotel is very nice stuff is amazing and always ready to help will solve any kind of problem very quickly breakfast is served from so you will definitely manage i strongly recommend this hotel only positive emotions and memories,1
2244,rooms nice all well appointed comfortable beds valet car parking was was very high i and could barely reach it breakfast was quite good reception staff let down the hotel experience not really good enough,1
2245,hotel fantastic really nice interior nice welcoming reception with friendly and helpful staff free wifi was great free welcome cocktail at hotel bar rooms were nice the top floor is absolutely amazing there is a pool and a bar on the roof where you can chill out and enjoy a view over the whole of barcelona it amazing location fantastic it is about a minute walk from the place de catalunya the central of barcelona you are right near the ramblas the gothic quarter and surrounded by bars and shops even the tourist bus and bus to the airport is infront of your door,1
2247,absolutely loved this hotel location the friendly staff and wonderful breakfasts the rooms are large by european standards and the balcony is a nice touch we asked for a late check out and they were only too happy to assist at this price point i think this hotel is hard to beat,1
2248,the staff of this hotel was hugely helpful kind and respectful i was there with a group and the team accommodated us and helped us every step of the way i would stay there again in a heartbeat no complaints whatsoever,1
2249,our experience with the roger de lluria was generally consistent with the positive reviews on tripadvisor as my wife our two adult daughters and i were going to be in barcelona for only one night i wanted a convenient location in the heart of barcelona i was already familiar with the area having previously stayed multiple times in a nearby hotel this time i wanted a somewhat more elegant place and the roger de lluria seemed to fit the bill i booked two double rooms for a sunday night and requested twin beds high floor and facing the street on the friday before our scheduled arrival we decided to arrive a day early my daughter called the hotel and asked if there was availability the next day the answer was no but a few minutes later the desk clerk hakim called back to say they could provide two rooms for the first night although he warned they would be smaller and not as well located as the rooms we would have the second night unfortunately the price would be the same as for the better and bigger rooms euros per room per night but hakim said he would include breakfast for the first morning therefore even before our arrival we had a sample of the friendly and helpful service provided by the hotel staff and after our arrival there were other examples i had parked my car a couple of streets away see why below and asked if it was,1
2250,the hotel really is a good base for exploring barcelona the rooms are small but i doubt you will spend much time there with all of barcelona at your feet i love that the hotel owners are so community minded they donate the profits from one hotel to charity and they offer discounts for neighbors whose family are visiting the hotel also has a discount card for restaurants and shops in the neighborhood i love it,1
2251,from bcn took the aerobus and it mins walk even with our wheeled no problem take the la rambla then right to after the church and it in the left of carme street close to everything sites grocery restaurants hop off shops street shops atm tourist info all walking distance we stayed overnight for no problem with taxi they can even hail for you at the front of its door taxi cost plus tip breakfast is filling staff were nice and can speak english room looks newly painted and most of all the bathroom was clean shower was warm it a small room by us standard but it comfortable and clean and safe this is a hidden for the price we paid it really star,1
2252,a great location just off la rambla the rooms were small our double room had the bed against two walls with a small gap to walk around the lift is noisy and can be loud if your room is close to a disappointing hotel the best feature being the friendly and helpful reception staff,0
2253,hotel curious is located just west of la rambla lots of people walking the main north to south touristy thoroughfare in barcelona the hotel offers a great breakfast with lots of juices and coffee options the balcony we had overlooked the street the hotel sits on and noise was not a problem at night the balcony doors were nice and kept the sound on the outside the room was nice and modern my only complaint is that we could feel the springs in the bed despite this we had a surprisingly good night sleep each night i especially liked the light switches by each side of the bed that could turn the whole room lighting and also would control a table side lamp very nice and thoughtful the staff was helpful and friendly,1
2254,we stayed at hotel curious for nights the staff were welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble our room was very small but your in barcelona so we were hardly in it it was furnished well and clean the breakfast had enough choice for us and we even had the choice of an early breakfast on the day of our hotel is in a great location being just off les rambles i would recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to barcelona,1
2255,the hotel was in perfect walking distance of la rambla pla√ßa catalunya and provided easy access to transport services to get across the whole of barcelona all the staff were very friendly and someone was on the reception desk so that only hotel guests could enter or leave the hotel making you feel very safe our room was a decent size for the time we spent in it the towels were changed and the beds were made every day the shower was also one of the best we have had breakfast was fresh and available each morning from there was plenty of choice and was perfect before a busy day of sightseeing in the city it was also very helpful that we could leave our suitcases in the hotel after checking out before our flight home later in the day it was perfect for our night stay gracias kitty y nina,1
2257,pros extremely being right smack in the middle of passeig de gracia where the metro luxury and high street shops and amazing tapas bars restaurants are in abundance room was comfortable and spacious toilet was clean and modern cleaning staff was warm friendly and wait to check in and out no clear queue system people are just standing around fighting for attention of the at reception seemed irritated when we made a request for an extra dental kit since only set was provided in the room and pillow even before checking with the relevant personnel he told us that he wo be able to provide pillows period but did bother asking how else he able to help etc but an overall decent experience,1
2258,notes patric was extremely helpful you must pay in full upon check in warm reception area upstairs with treats since we arrived before service was impeccable be aware that the in our street view room could keep up possibly because it is controlled from the hotel they would bump it up but they brought us a very quiet portable room which worked great throughout our stay the hotel photos on this site show the top floor there are other balcony rooms and some have no windows at all so know what you booking location is amazing it like rodeo drive in beverly hills read the fine print about booking with breakfast included it is good but you do want to be locked into a euro breakfast every day as the selections would get stale after meal there and you must eat before also you can always eat there for euros daily and i understand you could order omelettes specially made for you the only complaint is the room was so modern and minimalistic that they did have major conveniences like drawers towel bars or counter space the nightstand has a large lamp so you can barely use the surface we had a street facing room and blackout shade was and windows blocked all noise two of gaudi works are within blocks of the hotel one is next door safe area taxis everywhere stupid humid all day in the summer terrace bar had views and great drink but food is sub,1
2259,we decided to give the hotel royal a try in this visit to barcelona fortunately we were gratefully surprised by its wonderful service at reception and the fact that we were given an upgrade in all the bedrooms we had reserved the rooms were nicely decorated confortable and climatized complimentary bottled water and nexpresso coffee was availabe in all our rooms i slept very comfartably that hotel is exceptionaly well located on the paseo de gracia just a block away from the hotel majestic were we have stayed before but its cost is only and the rooms rooms are very similar if no breakfast which was included in our rate could be improved also the elevators got slow during breakfast and checkout time i will return and recommend the hotel royal,1
2261,vam tastar el men√∫ desgustaci√≥ a la terrassa de i va ser una experi√®ncia magn√≠fica el cambrers van ser motl simp√†tics i atents el menjar bon√≠ssim i les vistes espectaculars segur que repetirem aquesta experi√®ncia a la nostra ciutat we tasted several tapas on the hotel terrace and it was a great experience the waiters were friendly and attentive great food and spectacular view of barcelona surely we will repeat this experience in our city,1
2262,very nice hotel in area rooms were nice and if you like being in the action with all the best shopping and nice restaurants this hotel fits the bill staff was friendly and helpful and they have onsite parking we arrived early and they were able to check us into one room early and had complimentary coffee and breakfast for us while we waited they were helpful with a map and showed us all the sites to see and where to go and eat i would recommend this hotel to anyone going to barcelona,1
2263,my friend and i stayed here from july and found the hotel staff very helpful our room was just a comfort one but was very clean and adequate for a base for our sightseeing around another mirror full length would be helpful in the bedroom especially for two ladies trying to put on their makeup the breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed sitting outside on the sunny terrace every roof top terrace bar is great for a relaxing drink in the evening so all in all i we were impressed,1
2264,we spent one night at this hotel prior to a cruise and from the moment we arrived all the staff were great helpful and could do enough for us we were offered an upgrade and when that room would open due to an issue with the lock we were given an even better room with great views of passeig de gracia and a terrace the rooftop bar is amazing although smoking is allowed up there so stay upwind of any smokers the breakfast is good with everything you need and again super friendly efficient was quick and they ordered us a taxi for transportation to the cruise would definitely stay here again on our next visit to barcelona,1
2265,great location and excellent breakfast is the bar on the roof is little bit city bustour red hop on hop off bus is stopping front of the will return and recommend the hotel royal,1
2266,location is perfect breakfast so satisfied clean helpfull staff just next to la pedrera el nacional and plaza catalunya is so touristic and business so good it own garden so big and at the top there is a terrace bar which is popular for local people too,1
2267,a very nice hotel in a great location staff were very friendly and helpful best of all is the roof terrace cocktail bar do not miss out on a late evening drink and check out the views they also have a great range of tapas and other bar snacks at competitive prices although barcelona is not a cheap place,1
2268,perfect location for everything that you need great room would have loved to check out the bar too jet lagged next to gaudi home stroll to gothic area and marina cheap taxis to about it staff very friendly and helpful added to experience,1
2269,stayed there for days night the room was very clean and staff were very friendly location was great as if you want to do some sightseeing there is a bus stop right across the street from the hotel for the open top bus tour the tour takes you to most of the major sightseeing places in barcelona although this is not a big hotel but the rooms are still spacious we got a coupon for free drinks upon check in we visited the bar on our last night the bar could over see the most famous architecture of gaudi the la sagrada familia the view is very nice from the rooftop bar i recommend this hotel for couples friends and families to stay and remember to go to their rooftop bar for the night view of barcelona you will be amazed,1
2270,we stayed here for nights to explore barcelona before embarking on a cruise the hotel is in a great location perfect for sightseeing and local transport such as metro and hotel is well designed and our room was great with a garden view the reception staff are very welcoming and marc particularly wanted to know how we rated our stay and welcomed all enjoyed breakfast and visiting the roof terrace bar with great views over the city at night thanks for an enjoyable stay,1
2271,well what can i say after an amazing week trip staying in a lovely villa in the mountains of tarragona and traveling the historical coast visiting towns like reus and tortosa the trip was for my fiance birthday and we wanted to end the trip with a short city stay in barcelona we booked one night at this hotel on the last night of our trip our flight was at the next evening and we were drawn by the good reviews and complimentary late check out giving us the opportunity to have a late night out enjoying the nightlife while still being able to rest until before check out we arrived at via taxi after dropping our rental car at the airport we were greeted by the worst arrival i have ever experienced at a supposedly hotel our greeting by mr feran consisted of a very cold reception charging our card on arrival leaving to pay on departure which was the city tax very strange on asking why we were told maybe you are not used to this class of hotel at per night i have stayed in many hotels which demand double or triple this price and we have also stayed in many hotels which were less expensive but much nicer he then proceeded to try to joke around with us that the payment was being made off my fiances card insinuating i was being cheap or needed her to pay for it its a joint american express account,0
2272,we really enjoyed our stay here positives food cleanliness location staff a bit disorganised but the hotel is still very newly opened staff forgot drinks at pool after we ordered on quite a few occasions i received some skewer when i sat by the pool thinking they were complimentary as is usual in this calibre of hotel i then realised no one else had them i pointed this out to the staff who snatched them away quickly wrong person whoops we visited the spa to book treatments times but no one was at the desk there no where near enough beds on the terrace we had to sit on chairs while others took more than one there should be a reservation system or list as when one comes free everyone rushes to get one,1
2273,loved our stay room was quiet and beautifully appointed we also thought that the size of room and bathroom were larger and more luxurious than other hotels we had stayed at in europe staff very welcoming and were very helpful location was incredible within walking distance of most things yet out of the hustle and bustle of las ramblas we would recommend this hotel to our friends and family,1
2274,me and my girlfriend stayed here for a week at the end of june to the beginning of july we were extremely excited and it safe to say we were staff were absolutely amazing from the moment we pulled up outside in our taxi extremely helpful from carrying all of our bags to the concierge giving amazing recommendations and advice about all things barcelona peggy and dennis were especially rooms were extremely comfortable and had everything you need from usb ports to remote controlled blinds to amazing bathroom facilities the architecture of this hotel was incredible and the huge light well in the centre of the hotel just makes this hotel stand out even rooftop pool does have many sun loungers or beds but even if you do get a bed you can easily still sit there and enjoy the all day beaming sun and if you do get a bed it delightful and very peaceful the food and breakfast is expensive compared to other places but you certainly get what you pay for all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone i speak to family friends or strangers i also stay here again if i ever visiting barcelona again thank you for an amazing stay the one,1
2275,high class and warm excellent nice beautiful perfect position to start a trip through the amazing city center of amazing infinity pool and roof top bar only negative point the services at the roof top bar were not as excellent as they were within the other parts of the hotel we will come back for sure,1
2276,the one barcelona is a fantastic hotel located in central barcelona near several of the gaudi houses i stayed here for only one day with several members of my family but i think we all would have much enjoyed an extended trip at this beautiful place needless to say i would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat the staff was lovely both at the hotel and the restaurant the rooms were large and airy it is located next to a fantastic bakery that i highly recommend this hotel exceeded all of our expectations and we thank you for the lovely stay and service,1
2277,i could not fault one thing about this hotel the service and detail was second to none and the concierge was exceptional recommending the best restaurants and making reservations for you the room was spotless and decorated beautifully the location is perfect would definitely return if i came back to barcelona,1
2278,this hotel is new and perfectly located with a beautiful terrace and a good resting area with a pool the staff is attentivethe rooms i tried a room are very well equipped with nice furniture and flat screen tv the bed is excellentthe design of such room is somehow confusing as the bathroom is located in the entrance which provokes a strange sensation to say the least breakfast was nice but some improvement should be made concerning the choices and fresh juices should be served not canned juices as i was served all in all an excellent value for the money,1
2279,we arrived in the early hours to be greeted by a very friendly member of the concierge who was efficient and helpful and quickly showed us to our room we slept very well and the bed was heavenly after we had attended a business meeting the following morning we spent the afternoon relaxing by the pool on the roof terrace with drink service to our sun beds simply stunning views over the city will not disappoint,1
2280,the location was fantastic with cute little cafes nearby and shopping right at your door step the rooms were very well appointed and it was easily recognisable that there was a high level of sophistication and attention to detail i absolutely loved the decor and velvet that flooded the hotel it was amazing how the windows in your room opened up like a balcony the bed was super large and comfy the bathroom was all dark and glitzy with an excellent rainfall staff were incredible also i will definitely be returning xx,1
2281,possibly one of my favourite hotels to date i could compare this to a boutique hotel only for the staff and knowledge of the concierge are second to none breakfast although for some was inadequate was for us perfect not over love the al a carte aspect of this and could not yes it but what you get for your money is justified in the area if you are willing to pay for a star hotel then expect nothing less than the service and facilities you receive for relatively new hotel the experience is seamless and well worth its star the rooms are beautiful the linen immaculate and cleanliness superb if you like the finer things in life please stay here location is fantastic and staff are helpful to say the least,1
2282,we spent three amazing nights at the one barcelona from the that was absolutely flawless to the food and the rooftop pool and bar we could not have asked for more the bellmen are absolutely great with a genuine hospitality oriented attitude and extraordinary professionalism the room was comfortable and classy beyond words the bathroom is gigantic with great amenities the bed is incredibly comfortable and they add a special touch by bringing you the number of bottles of water that you need which is always appreciated with a degree temperature the spa and the pool are great while the gym albeit small is well equipped the only minor dislike i had was with the restaurant staff as i felt they were not at par with the rest of the hotel the hotel is walking distance to la pedrera and casa batl√≤ my friend and i like to walk and we had no problem walking from the hotel to the port or la sagrada familia there are plenty of restaurants around and it a very safe neighborhood i would highly recommend to stay at this magnificent property you will not regret it as it is worth every penny,1
2283,super nice hotel with restaurant roof top pool in a great location walkable to all if you like walking great accommodating staff but the room was not super clean there were dust bunnies not a big deal it was a very enjoyable stay although i was too fond of the set up separate bath room and shower but did have much privacy my friend stayed with me for nights out of the nights i reserved was a bit awkward our room had twin beds not sure how the bigger rooms are configured the value was great though i would stay again if i were traveling solo the whole time,1
2284,good value for money hotel in a great location rooms were clean and staff friendly nice large walk in shower location was great in between urgell and universitat metro stations aerobus from airport drops off a few blocks from hotel,1
2285,centrally located hotel in the eixample area first time i stayed here and was very happy with the experience quite small rooms but did mind that as they were very functional very modern design a nice pool area and gym,1
2286,nice and clean hotel woth good location aircondition was very effective luckily temperature was adjustable in the pool was quite small but nice to have great breakfast and service nice cafeterias nearby with also vegetarian options also just around the corner of the airport bus stop,1
2287,perfect location close to everything to blocks from aerobus stop comfortable and very friendly staff i sure i stay there in my next trip to barcelona i did try breakfast because i rather have it outside and there are many nice places very close to the hotel,1
2288,during an unplanned stay in barcelona after my flight was delayed and my luggage was lost i made a late night booking at hotel to my surprise the staff at was pleasantly helpful and accommodating and the process was relatively my further surprise the room was relatively spacious the bathroom split toilet in one stall shower in another and the shower staff was exceptionally offered a small amenity kit a minibar for purchase room service until sat tv with dozen channels and excellent climate my room faced the street gran via it was still relatively beds were reasonably comfortable with sufficient pillow the location is excellent cafes and restaurants within a short walking distance small market across the street for late night snacks or drinks and walk to the metro station which can take you to other parts of the city within a few stay was so pleasant in fact that i decided to stay a second night while i awaited my luggage to arrive from another city,1
2289,convenient location friendly staff clean rooms and good room service staff are keen to provide you with any advise you ask i have one comment about the room design itself the toilte is kept separate from the wash basin and shower room which i found it inconvenient,1
2290,staff are so rude and the man on reception is very aggressive if you ask any on the reception staff for anything they say that they do understand english which is not true would not return only positive is the location,0
2291,this hotel was unique helpful fun and wonderfully located near the university stop our balcony was located on the building front on a busy street but the room was amazingly quiet with doors closed the walking time to placa catalunya was a minute stroll upon departure the aerobus was a five minute walk to catch for transport to the airport minute drive loved this hotel,1
2292,hotel very clean and located next to a metro staff friendly rooms spacious curtains black out like so sleep was brilliant as no light in room and our room was so so quiet had no complaints pool was tiny but did not affect our stay just a late dip before a shower and out on town a great venue and good location,1
2293,i absolutely recommend this hotel very great location the staff was helpful and kind there were only two cons the leaking pipe small leak waas fixed only two days after we reported it and the houskeepers kept taking our key that we left so the air conditioning would work while we were away but overall it was a pleasant stay,1
2294,modern and clean room great sleep thankful for the double for the balcony as it prevented us from hearing much of the noise from the street we decided to eat breakfast on the morning well done staff we very friendly and helpful great location as well with parking available in a garage close by,1
2296,the people working at this hotel could be more friendly they love families the breakfast is really good good healthy vegan options the rooms are really clean and modern the location is very good as well and the metro is really nearby they have a really small outdoor swimming pool which is great for small children or a refreshing break i love this hotel,1
2297,very nice and new hotel in the centre of the city clean rooms with new furniture and nice decoration amazing terrace with a pool and a stunning city view on the hotel roof top kind and helpful staff,1
2298,as a family of we booked a familiar room which is essentially two separate rooms accessible through one door this was the perfect set up for a family with a and year old the kids had their own ensuite bathroom and separate beds keeping everyone happy the rooms are quite sparse with minimal decoration essentially a bed desk and wardrobe as an environmentally friendly hotel there were any bath products available no face towels or tissues however it is in a very good location just a short walk to las ramblas the main street and to the port the hotel also offers a buffet breakfast of per person which was quite reasonable with a good selection of foods available,1
2299,stayed two nights in barcelona before our cruise this hotel is just minutes away from las ramblas many restaurants in neighborhood s well grocery stores andante is a very safe clean and highly functioning hotel staff is fantastic very friendly and speak many languages if you are looking for a clean and nice hotel near las ramblas and cruise port this is it highly recommend,1
2300,very nice hotel w friendly front desk staff hip and modern although the hallways may be a bit morbid dark and grey nice location although some of the surrounding streets were not exactly posh rooms were bright elevator kinda slow,1
2301,really friendly reception guy greeted us when we arrived late at night and was really chatty the next night too when we saw the rooms were very modern and well set out i found the bed uncomfortable but my friend thought the beds were good i do struggle to be fair the location was great a quick walk to maremagasin placa trial rambla the beach to name a few the pool is more of a cooling down pool not a swimming pool so if you are wanting a pool type holiday this is for you if you want a fab city break and a quick dip in a pool to cool down with great views then it price was really reasonable tooall in all i definitely stay there again,1
2303,we arrived in the evening and received a warm and friendly welcome which set the tone for our stay our room was modern clean and a good size breakfast was fantastic and everything that you can want to set you up for the day ahead all the staff we encountered were friendly and welcoming especially the guys at breakfast and on reception if we returned to barcelona i would hesitate to stay at the andante again,1
2305,our family stayed here in june in a family room just overnight as we were heading off on a cruise the next rooms were modern and ar conditioned clean and walking distance to las within a few minutes walk of the metro which we used the next morning to visit sagrada buffet breakfast did not have a huge variety but was good for us given our early morning start the quality of what was offered was the price a good choice for us,1
2306,we stayed for nights in a family suite on the floor our teenagers loved the modern vibe and pool the pool does however get busy when the sun is out great location just off las ramblas and walking distance to the beach loved tapas restaurant min walk torres liquor store also on calle nou de la rambla and carre four express across the road great breakfast well run hotel great value,1
2307,just wow was to sure what i was going to expect booking a ibis as plenty of mix reviews i guess staying at a ibis style added that little more for a two star we stayed for nights mid july to find and was well located in the centre of barcelona in fact couple of minutes walk from metro and mins to the luxury in was fast and efficient and while this was being done greeted with cold water and a chocolate croissant which i never had from some four stars hotels nice touch after travelling in and higher on the direct on their site and ask for top floor which we were given room that had a lovely street view did hear any street noise what so ever and i am a light was small which you would except from ibis anyone moaning on here saying rooms are to small it a two star hotel get a grip the room bright very clean bed was again more comfy then some stars hotels bathroom had breakfast which was included in the price the area was bright and clean it was continental breakfast which did us fine normal type food and was always topped management team have done a excellent will stay here again and ibis styles in the if on a budget and want a great few days in barcelona then this hotel is the one for you,1
2308,this hotel was recommended based on my previous experience with ibis hotels i was very impressed with the decor and friendliness of the staff pleas know that i would stay here again if i am ever back,1
2309,loved the hotel really cool and funky design room was immaculate very clean and well laid out good wardrobe space and nice bathroom with fab little funky toiletries nice to have a balcony although view was great would also have liked a proper door on the bathroom as a couple you do want to hear your partner on the toilet breakfast was ok adequate but could maybe be a little better good location easy to walk to most key attractions in barcelona all in all we had a great stay,1
2310,great service and location cristina and maria were very helpful and attended to our smallest needs the sagrada familia was visible from our balcony on which maria managed to install two chairs and a small table highly recommend this hotel,1
2311,friendly flexible service from smiley staff comfortable rooms great location and good value for money my teenage daughter and i and our friends had a wonderful experience modern furniture set in a beautiful building,1
2312,it a lovely and friendly hotel that is not too far from the city the city center is walking in walking distance and everything else can be walked to for those who do mind investigating the city on foot the metro is also not too far from the is helpful and ready to help,1
2313,we had not stayed at any of the room mate hotels when in barcelona as we most often rent an apartment for a longer stay we were only there for a fly through and boy did we love carla the staff were all excellent accommodating knowledgeable etc the room funky but comfy and quiet with great amenities loved the bath products and breakfast in the morning was enough to keep us going all day before flying out again will return for sure,1
2314,wonderful hotel with many personal touches that made us feel at home stayed here nights in july and we really enjoyed it comfy bed great shower super breakfast location is good not in the center of the tourist districts but all within walking distance or a short bus ride we definitely would recommend this hotel and the room mate chain,1
2315,i absolutely loved this hotel and i very hard to please the beds are nice and comfy and the rooms were spacious light and pretty the only downside is that we payed for a room with two single beds at arrival the staff said they only had rooms with a double bed left if we wanted two single beds we had to pay to be upgraded to another type of room with a balcony i felt like it was bad service from our balcony we could look down to see la sagrada familia,1
2316,a great place to stay in a fantastic location staff are really helpful special mention for christina at reception who was very helpful and patient in sorting out some tickets and giving lots of useful advice for places to visit and routes around the city breakfast was excellent and well worth paying for as an extra when you arrive cheaper to pay at the were only small niggles with the rooms the twin room had loads of space and a fantastic wet room but there was no light reported to reception but not fixed during our stay the second room was on the floor and was a double but was noticeably smaller there was a very strong smell of drains or something similar in the room which was made worse when the air conditioning was on the smell was present on the last couple of days on the floor in general and not just in the room the smell was less noticeable with the off and the window left open the shower was over the bath which was very slow to drain away and the cleaner started leaving the plug out of the bath spotlessly clean room everyday neither issue would stop us returning as the staff are great the building is really funky and it is in a great location with some good local bars within minutes walk for great food and hotel has a luggage room which we were able to use on our last day which was,1
2317,very nice hotel with good location clean and good design very conformable bad breakfast was reach and very good thanks for frendly staff on reception for all help and advice every day room was cleaned very well,1
2318,stayed here for a short city break having never been to barcelona before a great quieter location with fab rooms and a nice breakfast buffet staff are very attentive and knowledgeable about the city especially massive thank you to cristina for helping book tickets and giving lots of great suggestions for places to visit a wonderful hotel that can not be missed,1
2319,really nice hotel amazing decor we had a balcony view which you could see the sagrada famila and it was also very modern and clean security at the door which is a nice touch staff are helpful cristina in particular and friendly beds and pillows are super comfy bathroom is a little strange sink is separate from the bathroom the only downfall is the breakfast the options are brilliant if you like cake and cheese peppers and cold meats but we did there was virtually no fruit or hot options so that was our favourite at all other than that i enjoyed our stay here very much,1
2320,remarkable entrance warm friendly staff and wonderfully transformed palatial bedrooms with very high ceilings smack bang where it all happens could ask for anymore than wished we had longer,1
2321,this is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in the was beyond gorgeous the people were friendly the free coffee and warm croissants every morning were insane the location was perfect as well since we toured in every directions from the hotel we were in a large room for people and had ample room just loved this hotel,1
2322,great location just a short walk away from placa de catalunya and las ramblas triple room was very clean and spacious the staff were very helpful and friendly loved the fresh croissants every morning,1
2323,we had a lovely stay at praktik rambla only sorry we stayed for just one night the staff were very friendly and helpful everything was in perfect order and the place is just so beautiful the offer of colourful ice lollies at check in was a sweet touch and made us feel a little like in a wes anderson movie very central,1
2324,the front desk staff made me feel welcome and helped guide me with directions in the area anything i needed the staff were very helpful the bed was very comfortable the room was exceptionally clean great shower i loved my morning chocolate croissant and amazing coffee on the outdoor patio every morning i left an id and charge card in the safe and the cleaning staff contacted the front desk who contacted me the documents are now safely back in my country i will recommend the hotel praktik to all my friends and colleagues,1
2325,barcelona is a cool city praktik is a cool no fuss hotel i really recommend staying here the rooms are perfectly appointed and the bathrooms are really nice i enjoyed my stay and slept really well the italian restaurant right next door is great for a quick bite to eat too,1
2326,i recommend that you include breakfast we booked at the last minute so the price seemed high we hope that you have a flexible price policy with advance booking but in general everything is fine especially the location,1
2327,a very stylish place in the middle of the city action that said there is no balcony as in vinoteca or garden which was a bit surprising staff does not speak english very well and cleaning until pm is a bit too early if you stay for over a couple of nights,1
2328,stayed in this hotel for the first time chose this hotel for it history and character and that what i got friendly personel and lovely terrace where you can bring your own food and drinks the only one minus is the wifi even thou you get a transportable wifi device it is still weak and bad want to come back to this hotel when this would change,1
2329,we had a great time in barcelona recently staying at pratik rambla pros very nice and helpful staff great terrace area to enjoy location is incredible and perfect for exploring free croissants in the morning are actually excellent but make sure to get in by or they be gone cons small rooms very little space for luggage the washing subcontractor lost serveral items of my clothing still waiting to hear from hotel if they turned up overall decent for price fantastic tapas place across the road which is great for breakfast,1
2330,good location and services love it so much the bed is comfortable and the coffee is free every day there is a small garden you can have a rest with coffee and bread in the morning near from the mila batllo and metro station,1
2331,beautiful hotel and excellent service in a great location we especially loved the tile everywhere and the thoughtful decor details the desk staff was amazingly helpful and the amenities were a delightful surprise including the morning croissants paletas and candy at the desk and free wifi hotspot upon request,1
2332,for solo traveler i had not a big room but it was ok as i came to explore the city but i saw a family with kids and more than sure there are big rooms also in general i would recommend this hotel as it it unique trendy and has it own charm unlike the ones in chain,1
2333,the hotel charged me for a no show even though half my patty had arrived and my flight was cancelled arrived the next day to find they had given my room away they could have confirmed or notified me about this even via the half if the party that had arrived in addition to this they ca even spell the name on the reservation right poor customer service really wanted to stay here no longer wish to or even to recommend,0
2334,friendly helpful staff great location min walk to pla√ßa catalunya and la ramblas walk from port breakfast croissant and hot drinks ice lolly on arrival overall completely satisfied with our stay and loved every minute,1
2335,our standard double room was small but very comfortable the best thing about this hotel is its stunning architecture and decoration the entire place was renovated in a way that perfectly mixes old and new by respecting the original architectural features of the building nicely done staff is also very friendly and helpful the complimentary croissants and coffee every morning is good but a more complete breakfast option hurt the terrasse and the reading room are superb,1
2336,we loved our stay at praktik rambla the hotel was in a very convenient location it was easy to access all the places we wanted to visit the hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the chocolate croissants were delicious would highly recommend,1
2337,this hotel is in a brilliany location for accessing and the main shopping square where you can easily pick up the tour bus and you be at the main sights in about mins the architecture of the hotel is beautiful and has a very gothic vibe but with a comfy modern bedroom the shower was heavenly and the little garden patio is incredibly peaceful and quaint i stayed for days and the staff were very friendly and efficient they organised my taxi to the airport which was about overall i would definitely stay here again just so convienient to everywhere but with a traditional barcelona vibe,1
2338,it was the first time at this hotel the customer service provided by all of their staff makes me to feel well liked and treated as a family member their knowledge of barcelona communications and travel systems is outstanding,1
2339,this hotel is a five minute from the and bus stop which is the only mode of transportation i would recommend from el prat to the city the praktik is located on the rambla de cataluyna and is very central and a bit away from the main rambla and the place de cataluyna where the madding crowds congregate the property is amazing the rooms are great and the service is friendly the only issue we had during this our third stay at this property is that the internet did not work well at all the hotel is also a stones throw from some really amazing restaurants we highly recommend this property,1
2340,the hotel was simply beautiful from the building to the interior design our room was simply gorgeous with a wonderful small balcony observing the street free coffee and croissants every morning are a great way to start your wish the bed was of a better quality was the most comfortable but simply ok,1
2341,stayed at the hotel praktik rambla for nights on vacation with my mom we could have been happier with our stay our room was always clean and we could only hear minimal street noise loud motorcycles the beds were very comfortable and they provided each guest a pair of disposable slippers for the stay the staff were polite courteous and helpful i spoke to them in both english and spanish without any communication difficulties last but not least the location was perfect it was much quieter than the area around many of the other hotels i looked at for our stay but it was still in the heart of the city the block of dischord was only blocks in one direction and las ramblas is only blocks to the opposite direction there are plenty of restaurants and shops around and there a pharmacy nearby should the need arise i highly recommend the hotel,1
2342,praktik rambla is the most uniquely beautiful hotel space i ever stayed in the front desk was very helpful and accommodating including arranging an early morning cab for my airport departure i only wish i could have stayed longer,1
2343,we had a very pleasant stay a comfortable and very large room for europe standards shower was excellent and modernized with a rain shower head and additionally i think the breakfast could be enhanced from just coffee and croissants but it was very tasty the rooms should also have ice buckets in the room i had to request them for all of us and retrieve them an ice freezer is available for all guests on floor so this was a nice bonus for guests the outdoor patio and indoor sitting are lovely and have nice furniture the staff was very friendly and helpful we will stay there again without hesitation,1
2344,it is some years i use this hotel for my trips it is located in a very excellent historical location with new modern concept receptions is always friendly and helps in every situation comfortable rooms nice showers there is a terrace with a small garden to relax after a day of walking or meetings it is just on side of the shopping area paseo de gracie and all around you have all types of restaurants people working in the hotels are very friendly and feels you like be at home i do recommend it,1
2345,noise from other room is so big that i could sleep well every some water that where it came from are all around my shoes so my new shoes from barcelona became wet two things above was bad but other things about the hotel was good,0
2346,very nice hotel at central location can easy travel to attractions in barcelona the staff of the hotel is very friendly hotel surrounded by a lot nice restaurant and very close to metro station will back and stay again,1
2348,loved the property and very helpful staff greatly decorated and really enjoyed the terrace in our down time only complaint was that the room is terrible not near cool enough for summer however there was great coffee and pastries in the morning it made for a wonderful stay in central rambla,1
2349,i loved my nights stay in the delux double room overlooking the street of rambla nicely decorated room with a comfortable bed spacious for two person with the balcony great service and access to free coffee and tea the only thing i wish they had was a small fridge in the room otherwise very satisfied,1
2350,we had four nights in barcelona so wanted to find a location that would allow us to walk to restaurants of our choosing yet not be in the mobs of people on the rambles the hotel is located approximately four blocks off the main square above the gothic portion of the city in a much quieter part of the city the room we were in was relatively small but was very well appointed the huge plus was the open air patio at the rear of the hotel again well designed with numerous group seating arrangements this was a delightful setting for morning coffee and some of the best croissants we had in spain and back to the deck for evening wine before proceeding to dinner the staff were very accommodating and helpful as we finalized our daily site visits and restaurant plans we worked very closely with johanes during our stay who was a wonder it was the perfect fit for us,1
2351,great hotel ideal location beautiful common terrace with lounge chairs very helpful and kind staff family rooms available rather small but comfortable bathroom with shower great value for money,1
2352,comfortable and clean rooms excellent location staff very helpful and enjoyed my stay at the hotel and strongly recommend this lovely up the good definitely stay here again,1
2355,the smallish boutique hotel is a gem it is a historic beautiful building with great central can walk anywhere the people are lovely and very will be back the next time we return to spain,1
2357,good helpful staff and comfortable rooms clean and tidy and lovely bathrooms time we have stayed here and although this time we stayed in a normal room and not the deluxe it was absolutely fine,1
2358,could recommend this enough we a family of and stayed for nights our three sons had a treble and we had a double such a lovely building internally and decorated accordingly complimentary coffee machine was really pretty good and coissants and pain au chocolate hit the spot every morning which handsomely covered breakfast for all staff superb,1
2359,a very good and comfortable hotel with friendly staff and an excellent breakfast close to the historic centre and just around the corner from good bars and restaurants and the jewel of gaudi architecture la pedrera book it while you can you will be glad you did you betcha,1
2360,hotel is located in a convenient neighborhood for tourists the room is standard their service is excellent i feel like i can get any help needed from them the buffet breakfast is also excellent and worth the money,1
2361,upgraded on arrival due to our length of stay nights smallish but functional rooms not the smallest we had in europe though very helpful and friendly staff excellent value for money considering the quality of the hotel and its location close to metro station and numerous bus stops would definitely stay here again,1
2362,i am a fan of room mate hotels and can not rave enough about the high standards of customer care the room mate emma offers the rooms are modern and clean the beds hard and the sheets white and crisp the pillows were a little hard for my liking but that minor the bathrooms are glorious modern and outfitted with the best and most plumbing fixtures the shower head was divine i would suggest more lighting in the rooms especially by the bed breakfasts are great and well worth the price the reception is which was a blessing especially when my flight arrived at the front desk team is passionate and quite knowledgeable they knew everything there was to know about barcelona obtaining tickets restaurants and things to do in and around the city had it not been for their suggestion i would have discovered the quaint beach town of sitges which was a perfect place to spend the day patricio mar christina and pilar were great but special kudos to issac who helped me with my original reservation in february and was at the desk to personally greet me with open arms i will return to barcelona and to the room mate emma as well thank you all for a wonderful stay in your beautiful hotel and city,1
2363,overall our stay at room mate emma was great the was fantastic the room was big enough and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful especially carmen and i ca remember the guy name i think it started with g we were a bit put off when we first arrived though as we were told there were only rooms with two single beds left at the level we paid for as we were checking in later in the day but we could pay an extra euros for an upgrade our booking clearly stated a queen bed and there was no mention of conditions of availability we argued the point and after a few minutes were upgraded at no additional charge this was unfortunate as otherwise we had a great stay,1
2364,i agree with the other reviewers that the service at room mate emma was quite good i had some questions prior to my stay and they answered very quickly and helpfully the room was small but not ridiculously small as some european hotels can be the location was great close to a lot of transportation and walkable to most attractions if you do mind walking for minutes my only complaint was that the room completely lacked any natural light my room was on the floor and faced the stairwell which was weirdly purple i felt like i was on a cruise ship and not in a good way aside from that i do have any complaints,1
2365,all staff were friendly and helpful overall service was excellent suite was luxurious not expensive for this high level of hotel highly recommend the gaudi style of the building was really interesting,1
2366,the casa fuster is perfectly located in one of the best areas of barcelona near all major attractions or subway stations staff is friendly rooms are large enough and very well appointed bed and linen were delicious complimentary water every night the building is very beautiful and well maintained having a historical fell but not old internet worked very well and breakfast although not varied very satisfying swimming pool on rooftop is tiny more like an enlarged bathtub not really for sports but for freshening up although the room was spacious bathroom had a quite odd layout where shower toilet and bidet were all squeezed in a tiny corner of the room and felt a bit cramped overall i would recommend casa fuster to all my friends when in barcelona,1
2367,we had already got a great price for this hotel through a price comparison site for night and arrived excited to be staying in such a nice hotel the website stated that we could check in from however the reception said it would be before the room was ready so we left for a few hrs disappointed we could not get to our room however when we returned the same receptionist apologised again for the confusion and informed us that our triple room had been upgraded to a junior suite sweet i have never seen anything like this on my otherwise budget travels in many hotels it felt like we had won lottery every member of staff was courteous and professional taking time to explain the room and the facilities on offer the roof top bar with amazing views was fabulous but so were the prices thank you casa foster for making the last day of my kids holiday truly memorable,1
2368,my family and i spent one of our best vacation right here in barcelona and we could have picked a better hotel it is clearly a hotel in every sense of the word and the staff were if ever there was a rating for staff services everyone performed at their best throughout our past four days here helpful full of attention huge smiles immaculate attires professional and so warm the owner of the casa fuster should be so proud that his hotel runs so well and his guest so well looked after we will come back to this lovely city and we will stay at casa fuster and we will highly recommend it to all our friends and families who are headed this way,1
2369,we looked forward to staying at the hotel but had a terrible stay the room was so tiny that we could not unpack our suitcases the roof top pool is the size of a large bathtub service at the pool was non existent no waiter every came up to ask us if we wanted to order a drink the place is not cheap but we did even get help with taking our luggage to our room highly annoying stay,0
2370,stayed at casa fuster a couple of nights last week with my wife on the recommendation of our catalan friend the hotel is right in the centre of the city and has that real old world feel the staff were all excellent friendly and helpful room was plush with all the amenities lovely bathroom massive bed and luxe atmosphere the hotel is decorated in dark tones which is not my cup of tea as i prefer a brighter and more sunny vibe but that is just personal preference there was a water pressure issue for a few hours and no one could use their bathrooms but that was not the fault of the hotel apparently as it had something to do with the water utility service all in all a good hotel and a nice intro to the city of barcelona,1
2371,casa fuster is ideally located for visiting bustling barcelona we had a very nice room with excellent beds seaparate bath and shower dressing the roof top bar is also very pleasant without noisy music the swimming pool is rather a refreshing large bath tub cm of water x on thursdays there is a pleasant jazz session in the large nice ballroom well attended by locals the rather unimpressive breakfast is served in the large well decorated cellar staff is very friendly,1
2372,we had a lovely stay at casa fuster staff was extremely helpful and nice location was ideal and close proximity to many things breakfast was very good with lots of choices in an interesting room downstairs loved the bar area rooftop for the evenings with delicious drinks and snacks pool area is little small but plenty of space to get sun door men extremely friendly overall would love to come back to casa fuster,1
2373,truly a nice and a hotel with a good and relatively calm location rooms are spacy enough and decor is as expected from the website staff is friendly and professional one exception though wad the areal there the staff was not so keen to take our orders and they sometimes left the used porcelain on the tables for hours time for hours also in contrast to all other staff their english language left a lot to wish for on the other hand the breakfast staff was extremely competent and friendly i recommend hvis hotel,1
2374,after cruising with old friends our mediterranean cruise ended in barcelona decided to stay on for more nights at casa fuster hotel where we had stayed once before was as good as we remembered our room was spacious linen and bed very included a good shower separate jacuzzi and a bidet and toilet towel rail although i never found out where one switched it on breakfast was wonderful served in a very spacious and calming had a wonderful snack on our arrival on the roof top with terrific views our last night we dined at the galaxo restaurant one of the eat meals we had in many years on our travels the very best be going back there soon as o can plan another trip,1
2375,spent three days at hotel fuster and can only talk nicely about it starting with the beautiful old modernist building the staff the rooms and meeting rooms it is very well located in the center of barcelona just a short minutes walk to the gaud√≠ buildings at paseo de not miss the terrace at night it the place to be and have the last drink overlooking the beauty of the city,1
2377,the hotel is very snazzy the room was spacious breakfast ok the service was good conference services were fine slow wifi at times on the bad side no irons in the room the one they brought me had rusty stains which came off on my shirt no good the rooftop pool is ridiculously tiny why bother at all with something that can barely fit people across every lap pool i have ever been in anywhere in the world is much wider than this one the whole deck is so tiny that people were splayed out on the hard floor with barely a inch to step around each other and there were relatively few deck chairs hotel charged euros for me to use an indoor spa area for one hour with a big jacuzzi and tiny sauna,1
2378,they have a fantastic assortment for breakfast in a spacious restaurant service is excellent with a special mention for karla who is courteous polite and proactive providing great service little gestures like remembering your birthday and giving you a glass of cava to celebrate the occasion good value,1
2379,i recently stayed at the nh for two nights from the first experience at the front desk through to the lovely team who worked at breakfast all were excellent friendly and incredibly helpful all spoke very good english i had the most enormous bed room was clean and great bathroom coffee capsules tea etc in the room fresh water fruit and sweets at reception my only complaint minor i could have asked for one is that there is no ironing board already in the room easily remedied by asking reception the selection at breakfast was fantastic with an incredible choice of top quality food i did eat in the restaurant as it was closed for refurbishment but if the food is as good as the breakfast would certainly try because i was working i did do any of the options but understand that the ramblas was approx mins away with excellent transport links if you want high street shops the hotel is right by a decent sized mall with the normal range of brands available great hotel and not too expensive for what you get would certainly stay there again when next in barcelona,1
2380,stayed in this hotel at the end of june and was very happy overall with check in room and breakfast for me the only small issue was the fact that it was a good minute to the nearest metro but that not the hotels fault,1
2381,love nh constanza as boutique with smart bedrooms lovely roof lap pool great breakfast convenient location off diagonale some fittings are getting worn on showers baths we had to ask repeatedly to have tv international channels tuned in but we will be back again in december ta rdg,1
2382,absolutely great hotel location is ideal rooms very clean and spacious most importantly the staff is excellent patricia and sara at the breakfast were wonderful and made our stay extra special highly recommended,1
2383,we spent a few wonderful days in barcelona and the hotel where we were accommodated fully contributed to this thing the people who took care of this hotel do it with the maximum seriousness and this feels like entering the will return anytime with pleasure to nh collection constanza barcelona,1
2384,fantastic hotel friendly welcoming staff great spacious clean modern rooms great location i really enjoyed the sun terrace as well very clean great bar and eating area overall a lovely hotel that i would stay at in the future,1
2385,stayed here in early june first time in barcelona rooms were modern and of a decent size really comfy bed and a nice bathroom very clean everything worked great wifi air conditioning tv etc great breakfast room with an excellent breakfast buffet and great cappuccinos hotel staff are friendly and helpful there a wonderful lap pool on the rooftop that we loved really enjoyed the outside bar was good very good location pretty quiet at night of places to eat etc also an excellent shopping center right behind hotel with a good choice of boutiques and a food market below ground with a good variety of eateries price levels would definitely stay here again,1
2386,lovely hotel a bit further out from the hustle and bustle of the city but within travel distance of all the main attractions some cute surrounding it and walking distance to camp nou rooftop pool is nice and quiet,1
2387,nice and comfortable room in a location that perfectly suits my needs located in the shopping mall complex with all that it can offer and with comfortable parking jewish center chabad and synagogue only minutes away by foot,1
2388,horrible experience reception staff accused me of trying to leave without paying at despite us having paid them the full fare at i stayed here july with my boyfriend but by thought it was a bit strange that they charged us at also charged us a different price then quoted on when i booked about more and i pointed that out and they said it was due to taxes they also scanned both our passports and had us fill some forms with our home address and contact details they issued us a receipt which i showed to the staff as proof of payment but the staff would accept it claiming it was for another room and that my name did appear on the receipt they also refused to return the receipt i handed them and kept it despite the lengthy process with the passport scans reception staff at days later claimed they had no records of our or payment i asked them to check records of payments that day in both their booking system and their accounting but they did not want to help instead acting suspicious towards me and asking me questions indicating they did believe me eventually i had to pay again to end the scene and leave this time the fee i was charged was exactly the price we were quoted on and different from what we paid at again strange there was probably a mistake somewhere and i asked the reception staff to consider this but,0
2390,location was great was a nice area to walk around hotel was clean modern and very nice had a roof top bar which with great views food and drinks lots of tapas restaurants in the area room was on the smaller side but clean modern with balcony good for an overnight stay before our cruise,1
2391,good size and comfortable family room sofa bed double friendly staff location great for cafes and public transport taxis easy outside the hotel breakfast is available but more fun going out to explore local cafes and eateries,1
2392,our daughter stayed here earlier in the month and recommended we would happily go back and would recommend this hotel to friends and family great location for the sights handy for the metro,1
2393,like many of the reviews below i can not believe this hotel has only review a star rating it quite simple to get to from the airport take the train a couple of stops from the metro it around a ten minute walk the hotel itself is around a minute walk from the main shopping district in barcelona it far enough out that you do get traffic of transport or people but it has plenty of great bars surrounding is a lovely restaurant attached to the hotel it a tapas restaurant which is fairly priced but great if you in a rush or having a late staff were lovely and friendly and swiftly checked us in when we arrived we were provided with a map and the member of staff highlighted key places of interest and explained how far away they room itself was great we were on the second floor and even had a small balcony there was a safe provided hangers a hairdryer and a mini bar the shower was great and the room was very clean the only fault i could find with the room was that the walls were a little thin luckily we did hear conversations but we could hear people in the corridor and in the rooms next to us slamming their doors the room was cleaned every day which was great and we were provided with new towels when we needed them there is also a fantastic rooftop bar the first night we,1
2394,nice hotel good location the staff were outgoing the family suite was breakfast isnt worth the price you can do much better bar on the rooftop is fun but beware of its prices,1
2396,myself and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel in june for nights and we are so glad that we chose this hotel is in a perfect location it is within a minute walk of different metro stations urquinaona passeig de garcia and catalunya meaning that it is easy to get to from the airport or train stations and that it is a short walk or metro ride to anywhere in the city it is also only a minute walk from placa de catalunya and the top of la rambla and a short walk from the barri gotic and el born areas being located a short walk from all these areas also means that it is in a quieter area than some hotels in barcelona and we found it very peaceful each night and easy to get a good nights room itself was spacious enough for people and had a comfortable bed a nice bathroom with a very large shower shower gel and shampoo and a hairdryer a safe and a lovely little area which had a couple of seats and was a lovely place to sit and have a snack and overlooked a quiet courtyard type area the room also had a minibar which was just a small fridge which we used to put our own in and was incredibly useful the air conditioning in the room worked perfectly making the room a lovely cool temperature to retreat in to when it was nearly degrees outside the staff at the,1
2397,good rooms central in barcelona good aircondition and a cosy roof terrasse good service the breakfast has more potential but is ok i would like more fresh fruit darker bread and better coffee nice with youghert,1
2398,we spend three nights in early july the room was very spacious comfortable and clean it has a nice balcony with comfortable chairs to enjoy the location walking distance to public transport amenities like la rambla plaza catalu√±aand more the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful nice area for shopping and eating out,1
2399,we booked this hotel for nights in june as part of our month travelling round spain we chose this because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed this definitely feels more than a star check in was good with the receptionist spending a lot of time pointing out things on the map for us and answering our questions room was one of the best we stayed in with small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel the location was in a quiet area just off plaza de catalunya but within walking distance of la ramblas and shopping area we were minutes from el born a lovely area with good restaurants and bars we used the metro which was a handy way to see the city and very good value if you bought the ticket deal nearest met was urquinaona they have a roof top bar here which was lovely but underused which is a shame but on the plus side we always found a table,1
2400,i stayed for nights and it was in a perfect location away from the hustle and bustleof placa catalunya but close enough to walk to if you are feeling up to that the hotel staff is very nice the rooms were very roomy and mine had a little juliette balcony facing the front very cute there was an issue with the bathroom it did seem to flush properly other than that it was very enjoyable there is a roof terrace with a bar and the restaurant bruc tapas was very good if you want to dine local,1
2401,this hotel offers a great location in the heart of barcelona and meets all of the criteria for travellers who do not need exquisite facilities and are satisfied with a clean well maintained facility with a friendly staff a particular bonus was an excellent tapis right next door to the hotel easy to walk to the hub of shopping and restaurant locations and metro transport areas close enough to gaudi sites for those who do mind walking would definitely stat at the hotel constanta again,1
2402,nice clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff my sister arrived early and they checked her in before the official time which allowed her to explore for a few extra hours the hotel is close to attractions and walking distance to the beach,1
2403,we only stayed two nights at the hotel room was comfortable and clean we did not eat breakfast here but chose a nearby cafe room service was very good as our room was being the second day mid to late afternoon and we had to wait at least hour until completed before we could use it this was the only issue otherwise a lovely hotel,1
2404,i stayed at h√¥tel constanza for three nights in july located very close to urquinaona catalunya and passeig de gracia minutes walk friendly and attentive staff and excellent bathroom and air conditioner very appreciated when hotter weather i enjoyed the hotel decoration and modern style for a perfect trip in barcelona highly recommended for solo or family i would definitely come back for sure for a further travel constanza hotel should get three stars those of quality and performance,1
2405,my friend and i stayed at this hotel this weekend mid july the hotel is modern clean and located in a lovely part of the city away from the main hustle and bustle but with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful and the facilities were good the buffet style breakfast was really good value with an excellent range and quality of food there is a shopping mall located right next to the hotel which was very convenient it can be difficult to get taxis from directly outside the hotel despite a taxi rank just opposite we had to wait over half an hour on saturday afternoon for one to come even after the hotel staff had called through for one overall a lovely hotel with great facilities i definitely stay there again,1
2407,from the beginning i felt like my home helpful staff and very cozy room every morning in the breakfast we had fresh juice and location with two metro stations and two mini the street carrer next to fontana metro station has cheap grocery will definitely stayed again in this hotel,1
2408,i have stayed in star hotels that rate the same as this hotel first the staff are so friendly and are really knowledgeable the room is comfortable and the kitchenette is really handy the location is super being min away from the metro which is on line stops away from la rambla breakfast was included in the room rate and was a comprehensive continental spread including freshly squeezed juice great stay in barcelona,1
2409,stayed here for few days and we are quite surprised with the hotel everything is amazing location staff room and alot of great places to eat nearby this hotel is like a service apartment we love the style nearest station fontana we also ask the hotel to hold a parcel until we arrive and the staff followed our instructions accordingly good job and will definitely recommend to friends and family i wish we can stay a little bit thank you to all the staff of silver aparthotel we love our stay,1
2410,stayed only one night however experience was very positive excellent little hotel very friendly and accommodating staff really appreciated having a little kitchen in the room altogether made for a great stay,1
2411,the location is perfect only a few stops away from las rambles but in a lovely neighbourhood the staff are outstanding and should be congratulated so helpful knowledgeable and kind my friend had to go to hospital during our stay but they told us where to go and showed real concern i would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family the room was spotless and had a little kitchenette not five star luxury but very clean comfortable and super friendly local shopping was good with lots of friendly shopkeepers bar breton a few doors down is a great local bar with tasty paella tapas and good wine much cheaper than in the city overall one of the nicest safest and friendliest hotels around,1
2412,we only had hours in barcelona and the aparthotel silver provided an inexpensive and excellent property in a very nice part of town the room was small but comfy the bathroom and especially the shower was very very small the premises were neat and clean the staff were very friendly the parking was bright and secure the aparthotel is down a little street that easy to miss in the gracia area,1
2413,a great little hotel in an excellent location close to public transport a metro stop is only two minutes walk shopping and tourist attractions rooms are clean and well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful,1
2414,i had only one night in barcelona my daughter recommended to stay in gr√†cia a hip artsy neighborhood with great restaurants and bars the hotel location was perfect the price was very good and the staff wonderful my room had a rooftop terrace with kitchenette and plenty of space,1
2415,we would absolutely stay here again the location service and comfort were all wonderful the room was also very reasonably priced the complimentary glass of wine was a nice thought and appreciated,1
2416,my family and i came and got double rooms to stay for nights we absolutely loved this hotel and found that the location was perfect very close to many popular tourist attractions and to metro and bus stops the staff was extremely helpful in helping us make the most of our trip and providing information about the activities we wished to include in our trip we will definitely stay here again if we return to barcelona,1
2417,we stayed in this hotel the location is very good nearby the shops and bars and restaurants not far from placa de cataluyna not far from the when we are coming back to barcelona i think we will come back to this hotel,1
2418,perfectly welcoming and charming boutique hotel great place to base a visit to barcelona out of all the staff were so welcoming it felt like coming home each time after a long day of touring barcelona we especially loved the welcome drink they also provide for a small fee a daily breakfast starting early,1
2419,we had a pleasant stay at this hotel rooms were slightly small but very clean and good service the hotel is in a nice location convenient for sightseeing and transport links would be happy to stay here again,1
2420,this is a fine hotel rooms are nice clean and efficient the decor is interesting with a general wine motif in the lobby and other public areas the courtyard is comfortable and pretty the breakfast area is comfortable as a place to sit hotel staff is helpful breakfast is wonderful fresh fruits pastries bread and rolls jams cheese and ham and of course coffee and tea a delicious way to start the day the pastries are left out in the lobby for the guests to munch on during the day the hotel is convenient to the rest of barcelona it is a short walk or minutes to placa catalunya and from there to the gothic quarter as well as la rambla there is a bus stop right outside the door and two subway stations about three blocks away lots of restaurants nearby,1
2421,friendly and welcoming staff simple and trendy decor clean room room and bathroom a little small non il frigorifero luogo silenzioso posto ideale se frequenti la lutier school very nice place,1
2422,the location of the hotel is very conveniently located close to plaza catalunya the airport bus takes you there within minutes there are nice avenues and boulevards around with plenty of restaurants gay bars and clubs las ramplas is in walking distance the staff was very friendly and always helpful we were welcomed with a smile a welcome drink and nice words whenever we had a question or passed by the reception the statt was room was very small but okay for a short city trip we stayed nights it is in an urban but simple style the window went to a small kind of a patio with no views at all there was a constant noice of probably the air conditioning however closed windows kept noise outside quite well rooms towards the street are probably a lot the cleanliness of the room was not always impeccable toilet paper and body cream had only been refilled after asked for,1
2423,the welcome was very pleasent and wines were very good the room was quiet and clean and cool with the airconditioning nice bed location nearby city centre overall we were very satisfied with the room,1
2425,check in easy and nice staff provide parking validation at nearby garage about a block away euro discounted to euro if i remember correctly clean sleek room with ac bathroom setup was a little odd because completely transparent shower door opens directly into hallway there is a door you can shut to get some privacy between the hallway and the bedroom but it means another person can not use the hallway leading to the door was fine for our purposes but slightly inconvenient as i was traveling with my father breakfast is additional but only euro and was very good overall great stay also offered a free welcome drink at registration,1
2426,up until my last day i would have said i loved this hotel it was clean a great location helpful front desk staff i stayed here for nights on my last day i noticed money had been stolen from the safe in my room of course the hotel staff said this was impossible i am sure it happened being a solo traveller i keep close tabs on my money i allow myself a certain amount each day and count my money every night i was extremely upset and disappointed this happened and on my last day since i was catching a train early the next morning i did have time to report this to the police i did fill out a complaint form at the hotel needless to say i would recommend this hotel it was expensive to stay in and then i was robbed,0
2427,everything was great about this hotel location is perfect walking distance to plaza catalunya and paseo de gracia and in the heart of a hip neighborhood with countless options nearby for good food and wine staff was very friendly and helpful especially carlos and rooms are functional and nicely decorated tiny but that the rule in europe breakfast could be better i even thought it was complimentary since there is only fruit bread coffee and yogurt but they charge you extra for it,1
2428,perfect location walking distance from the heart of barcelona the staff is super nice and friendly rooms are very clean not so big but average size for a city hotel i gave on sleeping quality because my room was on the street side and even if there are high quality windows you still hearing big trucks and definitely recommend it,1
2429,the hotel has a great atmosphere very friendly staff and is in a great have booked to stay again when we return to are a little small but well set out so you do notice highly recommend,1
2430,a very nice hotel in a good location to explore the neighborhoods just north of the city center easy walks to several gaudi buildings the cathedral is a bit of a hike my floor single room was small and basic but had a nice balcony over the street and the double glazed windows did a good job of keeping the noise out the staff is very courteous and knowledgeable paying an additional euros for breakfast was worth it the buffet is very extensive and there is indoor and outdoor seating nice complimentary glass of wine at check in,1
2431,small rooms it is in the center after all but clean and cozy no pool or rooftop terasse nice personnel really nice how the wine theme is represented throughout the hotel vouchers for a glass of wine,1
2432,great discovery in barcelona perfect location absolutely wonderful reception staff friendly and very professional warm welcome with a glass of wine simple but clean and practical rooms will be back for sure,1
2433,i honestly loved everything about the hotel from the staff to morning breakfast the location was excellent to explore the city from definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone i know heading off to barcelona,1
2434,you get what you expect with a small wine boutique hotel great wine tastes very welcoming and helpful staff welcome wine fast are very small but functional need to get use to it clean and comfortable reasonable breakfast value for money euro per person hotel located close to passig the and there are a choice of good restaurants close by for my next visits in barcelona most probably will look for this place,1
2435,my family and i stayed at this hotel for nights we throughly enjoyed our stay and would return again we had the family room on the ground floor which was really well arranged to maximise space only drawback was that it was quite noisy later in the evening staff were excellent good value for money in a great location,1
2436,the staff at the hotel is excellent so helpful and friendly the location is great and there is a lovely garden cons the garden area closes at night and the rooms are quite small for the price paid more suited for couples rather than friends,1
2437,centrally located with but well soundproofed windows clean and modern rooms with very helpful reception staff with good local knowledge who were happy to keep our bags after checkout to continue our exploring until we went to the airport i be happy to stay here again,1
2438,the hotel met all of our expectations the room was clean and roomy the service was they even got us a cab that we needed at the hostess gave us great places to eat nearby we have nothing but good things to say at this hotel,1
2439,we stayed here for one night and were very impressed with the hotel the price quality ratio is great and everything is clean stylish and very modern and chic the terrace is beautiful the welcome drinks were great and the staff was very helpful we will definitely stay here again,1
2441,it was a pleasure to stay at hotel praktik is very friendly and helpful rooms are clean and everything is at is great a good variation of food sweet savory are delicious it is really relaxing to drink a glass of at the terrace location is great we had the feeling we were in the middle of all highly recommended,1
2442,we stayed at this hotel in june of this year the attention and service in general were excellent especially the dedication and attention of nuria geographically this is very close to emblematic places metro stations a few minutes walk from the city center and surrounded by good restaurants recomendamos este hotel we recommend this hotel no doubt it will be the place where we will sleep on our next trip to barcelona a toast to praktik vinoteca barcelona,1
2443,we decided to do a quick stop in barcelona open browsing the hotels in the gay area i came across rhis hotel that has a wine theme boutique style and quite unique upon entering the lobby you will be ushered with a glass of bubbly and some pastries and while finishing your drink you can relax in the lobby and be entertain with their wine inspired deco the hotelis neat clean has a urban inspired interior guest agent was very hotel is very close to the subway station aeroport bus stop sagrada familia the famous church unesco stamped and number of attractions further it also close to gay bars and bathhouse to mins walk avenue and street name are found in the building corner edge sometimes it hard to navigate lol,1
2444,lovely hotel very nice staff room was small but had everything we needed excellent location within walking distance of most everything we wanted to see and the rest was easily done with the metro favorite part was definitely the decor,1
2445,we stayed for three nights at hotel praktik vinoteca it one of the best hotels when considering the price that we ever stayed staff are so friendly and knowledgeable about local restaurants etc they even printed off train timetables for us to get back to the airport nothing was too much trouble and all members of staff went above and location was great off a quiet street but so close to all the major attractions with some great local places to eat the winebar is a great such good value too our room was small but we expected that perfectly functional too with a lovely big comfy usually like to try new hotels when coming back to a city however we will definitely come back to this one next time we in barcelona would recommend it to anyone,1
2446,we really enjoyed our stay at praktik vinoteca it was close to walk to a couple of the gaudi buildings as well as only a few blocks from the rambla streets there were lots of shops around they let us store our bags with them when we were there before checkin and made an effort to get us a room as soon as possible they welcomed us with a glass of wine and the whole hotel was nicely themed our only complaint was that our bed while comfortable was made up of two twin beds and at times we fall between the gap i never been to a hotel that did that before it just seems cheap when they put so much effort into the rest of the hotel,1
2447,well located clean and comfortable hotel excellent service at check in manger on duty very attentive and caring for us during our stay wine provided on arrival plus useful information with respect to the problem with barcelona airport,1
2448,excellent location with great service reasonably priced rooms but on the small size our room was at the front of the hotel and had some road noise although this was not a problem for us i suspect it may be for some was the wine selection and cost excellent for a city centre hotel nice touch was a welcome glass of wine at check in anybody who drinks wine this is a great choice of hotel,1
2449,this hotel is perfect for a quick city break we stayed for three nights the location is perfect so central the hotel is very clean and staff friendly the room was quite small and looked onto a wall which was a bit of shame if i returned i would definitely pay more and ask for a balcony room breakfast was nice with fresh bread and pastries the only thing i would say is that there is a lack of any savoury options apart from some ham and in all a great hotel for a short city break and we would return,1
2450,we stayed at vinoteka for nights and we really enjoyed it the location breakfast and wine selection are great the ladies at the reception desk very friendly and helpful i would definitely come back,1
2451,loved this hotel and look forward to staying there when next in barcelona the staff were friendly and helpful the room was quiet clean with comfortable beds and a super bathroom with great wine theme decor was original and the quality of the welcoming glass of wine surprisingly good,1
2452,the hotel is situated in the city center it is very easy to get around as the transport and metro stations are a two minute walk if you like walking it is also near enough to get to the gothic district on foot the main gaudi monuments la pedera and casa batllo are just a couple of blocks walk away the rooms in the hotel are spacious and comfortable the owner is an archeologue and it is interesting to visit the mini museum on the first floor or to admire the pieces of his collection that decorate the modern rooms the breakfast is excellent and the staff are friendly and professional,1
2453,i can honestly say we had wonderful service rooms were larger than i expected the terrace bar is very nice although small and if pool is what you want it is but still quite nice drinks and food is a little pricier than on the street but consider the accommodations i had a message at the spa wonderful experience complaint was it got hot in our room by late morning and did really cool off til room next door was fine but at night it was perfectly cool i would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel,1
2454,the staff speak perfect english food on roof top superb pool too small kids took over rooms comfortable and spacious beds lovely clean centrally located this is a must stay in barcelona boutique style hotel built behind the old facade modern well equipped rooms,1
2456,fantastic location and a beautiful hotel staying here was a real treat from the simple things such as the exceptional courtesy of the staff to the chocolates placed on the pillows each night and free bottled water which appeared daily the millennia old ecuadorean figures in a display case were also an interesting quirk highly recommended we will definitely look to stay here again,1
2457,this hotel is a member of the leading hotels of the world which is usually a good sign but not here it was nearly impossible to sign into the internet the phones were fancy but not labeled so that i had to call the hotel from a cell phone to order a were supposed to be entitled to special services like early and but in fact our was after pm and we got no early at breakfast we had to order eggs from the waiter we did but they never came there was a bright light shining in the window all night and there were no shades see picture the elevator sometimes failed to stop even with the floor causing the users to trip as they exited i needed to find a space to make a business call after checking out and some of the workers were positively nasty about providing it we could get a drink on the rooftop terrace as it was only for diners we could take advantage of a credit for a similar reason,0
2458,very nice hotel with rooftop pool wish there were more seats by the pool can be use the restaurant so ca tell you how it was but the seating outside was not available for food service only drinks we woke up in the middle of the night because the staff was clearing dishes not a good time to do that but mostly very good and convenient to sights bus taxi etc,1
2459,on booking this hotel a few months ago online directly with hotel website i experienced an issue which on contacting the hotel was rectified quickly and emailed by the hotel a few days before our arrival asking if we had any special requests etc we arrived earlier than check in and our room was ready we were very lucky to be upgraded to a junior suite check in was quick and easy and we were offered a lovely chilled glass of cava which after a morning of traveling was very suite was on the floor and was well laid out super duper comfy bed with lots of pillows great bathroom with separate bath and large walk in shower with the white company rooftop terrace with lovely views and a nice pool did swim or eat in the restaurant so ca comment but had a couple of drinks and staff were quick and efficient and cocktails were very we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend and stay here again,1
2460,i really enjoyed my stay at this beautifully designed hotel my room was gorgeous and one of the most unique i have stayed in spent some time at the rooftop bar and pool where staff were just perfect great place to cool off have a drink and get ready for the evening the best thing was their portier mobile phone it acts as a hot spot for your mobile and i popped it in my bag and took it with me everywhere so i did need to worry about wifi or mobile roaming it also had suggestions for restaurants shops and itineraries such a good idea hope to see more hotels provide this of the staff front desk porters cleaning etc were really friendly and helpful so many choices in this wonderful city and i am glad i chose the claris,1
2461,absolutely fantastic experience staying with my young son at hotel claris check was simple and all staff members were very attentive our room was perfect and the amenities were great we took advantage of the pool daily where we appreciated the views service and free available towels the terrace restaurant was great location was ideal tonnes of nearby with a walk to placa catalunya or sagrada familia great shopping very close by as well as a few markets for whatever essentials you may absolute best part of hotel claris was use of a phone that acted as my personal hot spot which allowed me to go by my day as if i was still at home emails phone calls etc this is something i never experienced at any hotel before and it was much appreciated,1
2462,as my maiden name before getting married was claris i was intrigued to stay here from the number of pillows you get to choose for your perfect nights sleep to the the complimentary wine and expansive upstairs lounge area along with a perfect location one could not possibly be disappointed breakfast was ample and served by attentive staff on arriving at the hotel you are greeted and treated like royalty definitely for us,1
2463,i really enjoyed my stay here the staff were friendly and very helpful the breakfast excellent and the room whilst not large was well designed good wifi but a bit slow to connect on occasions the location is excellent to get around the city the rooftop pool was also very pleasant even if it could be a bit crowded at certain times free entrance to the egyptian museum was a bonusthe flaw was the bed which was seemingly comfortable on first feel but the springs either demonstrated that the bed was not in its first flush of youth or a better design should have been chosen,1
2464,never stay anywhere else except the hotel claris when in the delicious breakfast to the high end designed rooms and the rooftop pool and bar it was a nice place to escape after a day of sightseeing and the heat the neighborhood is very safe and enchanting it is centrally located to the metro plus the local train system,1
2465,a high quality hotel with very helpful friendly staff great if visiting barcelona not too big with a lovely roof top bar pool over looking the surrounding area excellent location for most sights shops restaurants,1
2466,we spent four nights at hotel claris late february the property and the employees were wonderful the inside of the hotel and the rooms are all updated and modern the beds were extremely comfortable and with the roll down shutters you will find yourself sleeping later than you want we were able to walk everywhere including the sagrada familia the market and casa battlo there are coffee shops and restaurants very close by there is a rooftop bar and restaurant that is very nice we would stay there again if we return to barcelona,1
2467,was there for a business conference for few days nice hotel with excellent location liked the breakfast and the rooftop bar service was a bit confused good but not great all in all would stay again if in barcelona because of the location,1
2469,we loved the hotel claris and found the position to be perfect for shopping and sightseeing spacious room and bathroom and very good service breakfast was great and the location was great for walking and exploring barcelona an easy city to navigate and the claris was a nice spot to return to at the end of a busy day would highly recommend this hotel,1
2470,we stayed at the hotel claris for the last night of a day trip the location is killer shops restaurants attractions staff informative and helpful and amenities terrific we sat on the roof top for a couple drinks to end the and it did disappoint,1
2471,great value and llocation we enjoyed our stay because everything felt right the rooms were comfortable clean and very nice a little small but space by beds but we made it work bathrooms very nice and hotel smelled super every time you were in lobby staff terrific,1
2472,we recently stayed nights at this hotel we found everything was excellent from the staff to the rooms to the bar there was nothing not to like the staff were extremely helpful and very friendly we were able to walk to most attractions and took advantage of the hop on hop off buses to tour the area given we had limited time in barcelona,1
2473,my girlfriend and i stayed at this hotel for nights during a short break to barcelona the hotel was in an excellent location just minutes from la rambla and minutes from place de catalunya lots of shopping bars and restaurants nearby and also close to lots of sightseeing opportunities lovely and clean with an amazing smell to the hotel they must blow something through the aircon but it was a treat to walk into each and every time friendly staff and absolutely gorgeous decor and construction i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone,1
2474,enjoyed two nights at this hotel booked two rooms for a family of four both with balconies overlooking the courtyard nice to have a pool available for a swim after visiting room size good staff very nice would easily recommend to other travellers,1
2475,we stayed here for nights from wenesday june to sunday june the gothic quarter of barcelona catalunya plaza hotel was very good staff were really helpful giving directions on where to go and what to see map was provided of local sights many good restaurants reasonably priced nearby for both breakfast and dinner both also available from the metres away as was direct airport bus to and from every minsla rambla nearby in parallel street highly recommend jasmine and peter gilkes adelaide southaustralia,1
2476,a lovely hotel in a great location close to the las ramblas and on the door step of a busy shopping strip it was wonderful escaping the heat noise and crowds by walking through the front doors and through to the lush courtyard pool area the rooms were stylish and clean i would definitely stay here again,1
2477,the hotel is excellently located with most touristy sites within walking distance it is also next close to placa catalunya for excellent metro and bus services the hotel itself has a wonderful lobby and room was perfect for our needs we did eat in the restsurant but had a very good light dinner in the bar area the staff were very friendly and always happy to help especially with directions the hotel also stored our luggage on the day we were leaving which was very useful,1
2478,the staff here is the best they went above and beyond to help us out with some difficulties not of their making that came up for us while visiting barcelona the breakfast is abundant and scrumptious in a lovely exterior setting by the relaxing pool lounge area elegantly decorated very clean with rooms that have eveything you would desire in the perfect location in beautiful barcelona,1
2479,this hotel is really in an excellent location close to the pla√ßa catalunya metro buses around the city and bus to the airport and the old town el gothic it was so easy to get to all of the main areas either by walking or using the bus metro comfortable room with air con and free water every day a really great breakfast buffet which set us up for the day there is also a pool if you need a dip friendly staff who spoke really good english and were happy to help,1
2480,great experience friendly staff excellent breakfast buffet with a wide variety in choice the rooms are clean and finally the hotel has an excellent location close by metro stations the rambla and the shops,1
2481,imagine my amazement when shown to a room with no window to the outside only a small one in the room entrance looking on to the hotel corridor without lights the room was pitch dark i know that converting old buildings into hotels is complicated but it seems corporate greed knows no bounds,0
2482,my daughter and i called this hotel home for a week in june our room was fine but warm at night i keep my house very cool so i hesitate to judge the staff was very accommodating the bartender camillo promised me the best mojito of my life and he delivered located on a pedestrian shopping street there was easy access to buses and taxis las ramblas was within walking distance as was the gothic quarter i would definitely stay here again,1
2483,realy silent near from cathedral and historic center but difficult to found nice restaurant very near bus for aeroport is at five minute walk computer available but printer realy slow,1
2485,overall very pleasant the staff is very kind and helpful just ask for help or directions and they will help you in any way you need the room was large bright and clean the hotel lies within walking distance of everything but not right in the middle of the most touristed areas the nearby neighbourhood is very nice full of small streets with bars and caf√©s where the locals also turn up,1
2486,beautiful hotel in an excellent location i would happily recommend staying here to anyone while the room itself and the hotel facilities were excellent the service was truly exceptional amazingly helpful staff who went above and beyond to create an unforgettable experience special thanks to paula for looking after my girlfriend so well on her birthday very thoughtful,1
2487,paula the day staff was fabulous and very helpful on day to day activities around citytrouble with the electricity keeping up two days were with out power fir prime times a great safe place to stay,1
2488,the hotel is abit far from town but it very accessible the front desk hotel staff is very friendly it very quiet and nice neighbourhood near to park guelle and it about mins walking distance to the park,1
2489,recently stayed with my family of in the hotel overall good hotel but nothing special check in was great and they even allocated us rooms next to eachother so there was a connecting door between us which was great the rooms were excellent they looked great had space was clean large beds the shower was great we faced no issues with the rooms perhaps the triple room could slightly have more space wifi was offered but very slow and poor one night completely disconnected breakfast was overrated not many vegetarian options and there were no teabags which is required but would have been nice otherwise it was staff overall were very nice special thanks to paula who helped us navigate around showing us metro and generally being extremely welcoming and kind we did ask a man at reception at night time for any maps or leaflets and he seemed disinterested in telling us any even though the next day paula had was okay only metro stops from catalunya the tourist central area but it could have been closer if you are looking to be directly in the centre centre on las rambla however i just thought it was extremely overrated at out of all the hotels in barcelona there was nothing particularly special about it it was a good hotel but not amazing,1
2490,nice small hotel stayed there with family for week between the staff at the desk friendly and helpful above all the breakfast was very good thanks to the young ladies who always made sure to give the best they could would recommend a microwave cooker for improvement,1
2491,fantastic clean and stylish hotel in grasia barcelona the very friendly staff are really helpful the lobby area is a great place to work and relax i am looking forward to coming back this september,1
2493,the best ever information about hotel as well as barcelona offer for a reservation of restaurants the black board at the entrance with recommendations for brunches dinners festivals etc we tried some and it was so good very helpful and friendly staff shared hangout area at the reception with a bookcase and free water loose tea and coffee nice modern desing and light furniture really big double bed with big double blanket pillows per person room cleaning every day the room had a window to the street so it was quite noisy even at night great location for us still in the city close to public transport but not in the crowded city center breakfasts available on daily base demand even if you book only a room good and stable wifi connection we had some payment issues caused by a hotel system but the staff was very willing to handle those situations and successfully solved them immediately,1
2494,stayed for nights in july location was excellent for me as near to the office plenty of places to eat and drink nearby huge bed and excellent air con for the warm nights you often get in barcelona staff very friendly and most helpful highly recommended,1
2495,absolutely fantastic hotel service was great and the room and communal areas were a great standard exactly how it looks online really good location out of the main tourist area lovely restaurants within walking distance highly recommend,1
2497,the hotel is located just a few steps from the center of barcelona which is great the staff was extremely kind and they helped us in everything the room was clean and the bed was made by the time we got back so i loved it the only thing that bothered me was the noise because the walls were thin we heard the people in the room next to us and we also heard the scooters from the streets anyways i give stars,1
2498,staff were very friendly and helpful they knew the local area very well and they made our stay very enjoyable breakfast was varied and there was a good range of food overall this was an extremely welcoming and comfortable hotel,1
2499,we stayed at pol grace for a week at the end of july everything with our stay went smoothly pol grace is a small modern hotel located in a more quiet neighborhood area located ideally next to the molina metro stop only stops to pl catalunya very quick each time and the bus stop for to barceloneta beach the hotel interior appears as pictured on their website with a sitting area in the lobby free coffee and water with other drinks available at cost each morning an incredible breakfast is set out that ranges from fresh fruits cheeses yogurt granola local meats and breads and with instructions of how to make traditional bread with tomato and olive oil the staff was very attentive available and helpful i would recommend this hotel,1
2500,only one night stay but all as can be expected nice casual but very efficient style smooth and check out comfortable room and great breakfast location is convenient for town as well as travel to and from airport,1
2501,there are two things i look for when picking a hotel location and bathroom cleanliness and then there is the worthiness of the price i would have to pay for that i say pol grace hit the it not in the center of town but the metro station is right on the same block have had visited barcelona already i was very happy with this location as it is situated in a cute residential area where i could walk with locals pet their dogs and just see the everyday unembellished shops restaurants and small parks but you are not in any way missing out of the goods there are quite a few restaurants near by that are really well rated and fully packed at night even with the metro near by we walked home from pla√ßa de catalunya anyway on many occasions for staff were all very friendly the kind of friendliness you get from a friend who is hosting a dinner party so you feel welcomed as you walked size of the room and bathroom was in the goldilock zone and furnishing was well maintained we were very comfortable bedding was great towels were in great condition bathroom cleanliness was as expected really no complaints i just upload some pictures to reflect my words,1
2502,this hotel gives the vibe of a family owner business although i do know if that is the case or not the front desk staff is outstanding and as helpful as they can possibly be the room we had was small but comfortable the morning breakfast was excellent and we took full advantage of it every day of our stay the location on a small side street was perfect we had easy access to cabs and block to a subway station several restaurants or bars were within a short walk as was a small supermarket and a laundry i would stay here again if we return,1
2503,the pol grace hotel is recently renovated and a great place to stay it is located a bit north of the center of barcelona in an upscale residential area great friendly staff nice lobby with free coffee at any time excellent and clean rooms comfortable bed and bathroom very good breakfast the center of barcelona is accessible by bus or metro about a minute stroll nice to be away from the busy center if you want good variety of restaurants in the neighborhood from fast food to upscale and trendy,1
2504,the hotel has friendly staff is in a good location with clean and fresh rooms i like the decoration in the rooms i visit barcelona regularly and pol and grace is always my first choice there is a wide variety for breakfast well worth it,1
2505,this place was very nice and the rooms were clean was in a quieter area but subway is close by to get closer to the activities staff was friendly and helpful the breakfast was great kept us going for the entire day,1
2507,me and my husband stayed here july and we booked after reading others reviews hotel is great exactly as per the pictures on the website good location very closr to the metro which will take you to la ramblas in mins and you can walk to some other attractions within minutes theres a few supermarkets nearby and restaurants to choose from staff were very helpful at the hotel especially paula,1
2508,we had the misfortune in encountering a taxi strike the day we left barcelona and would probably have missed our flights had paula not alerted us to the problem and arranged a solution this hotel is close to the gracia neighbourhood which is a great place to eat and explore and is only away from the metro which takes you to place catalunya which is central stayed at this hotel for a week and was totally rested,1
2509,well located clean very helpful and friendly staff only negative remark is related with window insulation to street noise during the night nice touch the free tea in the lobby area,1
2510,we felt at home the minute we arrived we have never been treated so well in any hotel the staff are fabulous paula and cesar were great the rooms all have a personal theme that is fantastic and the breakfast was tasty ca recommend this hotel highly enough,1
2511,all the staff was more than nice and happy to assist with you name it we had a major problem with the flight vs the hotel and they helped us with all booked a hotel for the first day and did charge us for the last day a thing they did have to do but they did it i want to thank them for all of that and for the great stay we had,1
2512,i realised that i had lost my currency when i reached the airport for late flight home having spent most of the day around the them the next day and they had found it asked some questions about amount and sent it by courier within a was our visit and will be returning next year hotel could do with a bit of freshening up paint wise otherwise perfect,1
2514,this hotel is in a wonderful location in barcelona rooms albeit small are extremely clean and the staff at reception are great with advice regarding transport and general enquiries the range of food at breakfast was good and very fresh and the rooftop bar is a great location to wind down after a lot of walking which barcelona lends itself only downside is that it takes a little while to get used to the rumblings from the underground however after a couple of days we barely noticed it at no time was the noise bad enough to affect our sleep,1
2515,arrived before midday but our room was ready the front desk staff were very helpful and also gave us some very relaible tourist room was on the small size and i not sure that i would want a long stay in that room but for a city break it was fine the bathroom was well set up and well public rooms in the hotel are stylis and comfortable the roof top terrace bar was great place to end the recommended,1
2516,after a weeks cruising it was reassuring to arrive in this luxurious quirky and posh reception with a relaxed were well equiped clean and fresh and quiet this was a concern as location is excellent parallel to la rambla and can often be a trade off but we had excellent sleep and were well rested street view of cathedral over the road a nice boutique hotel thats private with good service and attention to detail,1
2517,the hotel is well placed close to the old part of the city and a short ish walk to the harbour there is a metro station directly over the road from the hotel the reception area is fairly traditional but the rest of the hotel has been well generally were welcoming and helpful facilities were as you would expect breakfast was a generous buffet with warm croissants and fress orange juice delivered to your table as well as the buffet there is a roof top bar with excellent views which is a good place to sit after a day being a star hotel there were some issues with housekeeping there were insufficient staff to clean the rooms during the day and so on three occasions we returned between and to find the room had not been serviced on talking to the hotel staff this was a regular occurrence there also seemed to be an issue with rooms not being ready at although that did not affect us there were free refreshments on a glass of cava and sound insulation on lower floor rooms was very poor our room was on the second floor above a side street but the noise from outside continued until starting again at about in addition and there is nothing the hotel can do about this one of the metro lines runs directly underneath the hotel and so there was a good deal of vibration every time a train passed,1
2518,excellent service reception staff could have been more helpful beautiful hotel and very central walking distance to waterfront beach barri gotic opposie jaume underground station nice small rooftop bar and views very good choice of food for breakfast,1
2519,just returned from this fantastic hotel i could not praise it enough we were welcomed at reception by a lovely lady ms martinez and given a welcome glass of sparkling wine our room was ready so we were able to go in early which was nice i was pleasantly surprised how big our room was we had a corner room which was spotless bright and airy with a great view i can often feel claustrophobic but no fear of that with three huge windows there were robes complimentary water and toiletries the roof terrace was a bonus the staff very friendly and helpful and prices reasonable the views of the city were fantastic and we watched the sunsetting from here over a bottle of delicious rose on friday night there was a band on which was an added bonus only four sunbeds but as it was never that busy we always managed to get one i love barcelona and in future will come back to this hotel every time excellent position too in between the gothic quarter and el born can hear the metro slightly but it stops between midnight and and never bothered us thank you for a lovely stay,1
2520,the staff location room amenities experience were all fantastic looking forward to our next visit thanks montcada for a stay that one the best i have ever had i would highly recommend this hotel,1
2521,this hotel is absolutely fantastic the staff on the reception and at the bar are friendly and welcoming nothing is too much of a problem we arrived two hours before and as our rooms were ready the receptionist was happy to check us in as soon as we had arrived the location is incredible the hotel is just opposite the cathedral and the gothic quarter and is less than a minute walk to major tourist hotspots such as the harbour las ramblas and to pla√ßa de catalunya the hotel is impeccably clean and the rooms are designed beautifully the roof top terrace has the most amazing views of the city and perfect to relax with a drink after a day exploring barcelona we stayed in a basic double room so the rooms were a little small but perfect for a few days stay in barcelona although our room was situated on the first floor facing the busy street of via lietana there was no problem at all with noise from the street on an evening my only issue with the rooms is that as we were situated on the first floor the metro underneath the hotel caused our room to rumble like a small earthquake after midnight and before this was a problem but for light sleepers the rumble is enough to wake you up perhaps if we had upgraded our room to a higher floor this would not have been a problem despite this however i would definitely recommend,1
2522,great hotel brilliant location in the heart of the gothic quarter only a short walk to la ramblas and the port and all the lovely little side streets the staff are exceptionally helpful people and great to chat to the food is also great we had the breakfast buffet and they put on an afternoon tea spread free for guests at he bar i would recommend this place and will definitely return next time i in barcelona,1
2523,ideally situated nearby the port la rambla and in the barri gotic very nice rooms good working airco very good and large beds very friendly staff take the breakfast inside the hotel it s nearly perfect between there s a little but nice buffet ideal for a quick bite only negative is the very small terras sunbeds very small swimming pool meters,1
2524,we had a great time at the alma this is a beautiful hotel our room overlooked the garden and was very quiet everything was excellent staff assistance garden cocktails we really enjoyed escaping the heat and traffic in the garden,1
2525,the alma is a gem leave the hot city behind as you enter the dark and cool lobby and you are quickly invited to complimentary refreshment something that continues in your room as free and offered the fingerprint room access method by very patient and caring to the rooms which are comfortable and classy minimalist with very nice touches and mine overlooked the tranquil private square to the north rear of the cant say enough about the kind staff and will return the razor sharp table that lacerated my calf on the roof top view was an exceptional blip and unless this is more common than i believe will not temper by enthusiastic was pain free and courteous the lifts are utterly ridiculous and slow,1
2526,my visit to hotel alma was very enjoyable everything thing was just perfect the decoration the servis the location my waitress sonia was very helpful frendly and the servis was excellent i definitely recommend this hotel see you soon,1
2527,great place to stay helpful friendly staff rooms very clean comfortable very modern classy lots of space and a big long luggage shelf that was great very useful bathroom beautiful and easy finger print entry to your room and the coffee was good too the hotel is a little dark especially in the lift a little more lighting would be good i certainly stay here again,1
2528,the room was very nice and clean and fully equipped the front desk staff and also the concierge were attentive efficient and tried to please in every way possible the location of the hotel was very good and accessible to all parts in the center of the city,1
2529,we flew into barcelona before a cruise chose to stay at the hotel alma for nights we did get to stay long enough it was in a great location service was outstanding we had the executive suite it was spacious immaculate had wonderful bath products beds were soooo comfy helped with the jet lag loved the rooftop terrace food downstairs was delicious with a pretty view highly recommend staying here,1
2530,we stayed for eight nights in july the hotel is very and is beautifully designed and furnished service was also attentive friendly and helpful the bed was extremely comfortable there are a few though we often did not have hot water in our room or it took minutes of running the water before it started heating up fortunately this was in the middle of summer but it can still be uncomfortable there is not enough hooks for hanging things in the bathroom and there is no coffee or tea station in the room also housekeeping was extremely erratic and on a number of days the housekeeping only arrived late afternoon to do a combined cleaning and breakfast is very good but also very expensive the free minibar went a long way to put a smile on our faces though all in all a good experience,1
2531,hotel location is ideal for exploring barcelona it is close to many places very good quality breakfast staff is very polite and the receptionists are always willing to help you and give you the best advices and tips about the town,1
2532,first time staying at alma will definitely return the hotel we always stay at was booked so alma was chosen for our two night stay chosen mostly because of location a block from passeio de gracia and number of restaurants surrounding it what a pleasant experience staff is incredible even escorting us to our room welcome bottle of champagne delivered and free mini bar are just a few of so many pluses garden where morning tea and drinks and appetizers into late evening served seemed to be always open,1
2533,let me list the advantages of this very peaceful and nice amazing very comfortable very friendly clean rooms and very bright i just liked how comfort are the rooms and the i just felt like everything is bright in the room which i felt quiet relaxed the breakfast got lots of varieties and the dining room is very just want to rate this boutique hotel as will def come again,1
2534,we stayed here just for a short layover on our honeymoon and we were very impressed with the were greeted with a glass of cava upon checking in and the hotel staff were very friendly and room was immaculate and the location close to the classy district of gracia is perfect for exploring this fantastic city will look to stay here on future visits to barcelona,1
2535,we were here for two nights at the end of a week road trip across spain and certainly the alma is now one of our favourite hotels located in eixample just a block away from gaudi casa mila and a short walk from the sagrada famiglia it is in a nice neighborhood with high class shops like cartier around the corner the ambience and decor are modern and very cool the reception staff are friendly and most eager to help i can only remember the name of andrea but they were all fantastic the rooms are all operated on fingerprint recognition and were well equipped and designed minibar items were free usb charging slots were provided the bed linen and mattresses were really comfortable the only thing missing which seems to be the case in most spanish hotels is a kettle for tea and ground floor restaurant and bar were wonderful and we had two great meals there the gourmet tasting lunch in the outdoor garden area was especially memorable even more amazing were the views from the rooftop bar where we could have stayed all evening to enjoy the lovely we did have time to try the spa and hotel thoroughly deserves its five star rating we would certainly come back to stay next time in barcelona,1
2536,room was quirky and cool i was greeted by a great staff was upgraded for free without a great location in walking distance to awesome food and shopping free fast internet in the room did not have a rooftop bar which i missed but you do have roof access,1
2537,exceeded expectations for our night stay so hot outside so cool inside and the salt water plunge pool and ice water in the lobby was most welcome stylish comfortable rooms with nice toiletries and shower helpful staff booked tickets to sites and pointed us to a great local tapas restaurant good city map it a romantic hotel loved the wallpaper in the hallways,1
2538,location is perfect for exploring the whole of barcelona and easy to find from the metro station the room was exceptionally clean and stylish the staff were always friendly and happy to help with anything from umbrellas to recommendations great value for money can not recommend this hotel enough,1
2539,i only review very good or very bad experiences and room mate anna falls into the amazing experience category the very best part was the staff we had a little glitch with our reservations but they handled it very professionally and courteously they were going to make sure we were taken care of everyone at the desk was knowledgeable and so friendly and down to earth it by far the best experience i ever had in terms of customer service at a that the hotel was immaculate and stylish it had all the modern amenities one could ask for plenty of outlets good air conditioning powerful hair dryer great water pressure hot water comfortable bed it was quiet at night breakfast was very nice and the kids loved the plunge pool after a day of site seeing the only negatives would be that some rooms are super tiny and do have natural light also in our kids room if bathroom door was kept closed there was smell in the bathroom however all of the positives far outweigh the few you room mate anna for an awesome stay in barcelona,1
2540,stayed for night inbetween airbnb stays and we had a great location with really friendly staff who could be more helpful in checking us in and advising on places to go things to do staff were also very quick to reply to emails about parking and checkin before we arrived which is always a room had amazing balcony view of casa batllo and a huge comfortable bed with a great bathroom and nice selection of bathroom products included could have asked for pool on the roof was a pleasant surprise and the views from the terrace are incredible checkout time of noon was greatly appreciated with breakfast served right up until then and the staff happily stored our bags afterwards when we went minor criticism would be price for the original room booked we felt was a little pricy and we paid an additional to check in early into a junior than that a wonderful place to stay right in the heart of the city would happily stay again,1
2541,stayed for three nights in july before heading down to benicassim festival and could fault the location right outside the metro station and casa battl√≥ if you after some gaudi sightseeing room was plenty spacious although they did mention that some could be quite small and the bed was large and really comfortable the shower was a particular highlight as much as a shower can be we did try the breakfast you in a lovely neighbourhood of barcelona and there are plenty of places nearby to get a cheaper meal free water and sangria in the mini bar was a nice touch wholly recommended and we definitely stay again,1
2542,what an amazing hotel if you are contemplating whether to book just do it the hotel is fabulous from check in to check out the staff can not do enough for you they ensure your stay is relaxed comfortable you have everything you hotel decor is contemporary very stylish we stayed in a executive room with a balcony it was well worth it the rooms are spacious have a balcony area where you can watch the bustling city the casa batllo was just across the road even though the hotel is on a busy road due to it being so central there is no noise at all the bed was so comfy the room was really clean fresh it felt like we were the first people to stay in there there are nice touches like chocolates on your pillow a complimentary bottle of sangria in the fridge the breakfast was great fresh fruit cereals hot food breads each day there was something special like a shot of beetroot carrot juice or a little salad the waiter or waitress would also bring round items for you to try which was a nice not hesitate book now,1
2543,after arriving from a stressful airport expierience we arrived at the hotel situated within a minutes walk from the rail station greeted by friendly helpful and competent staff who looked after our luggage until our room was ready we found our room s to be clean quirky and well organised with exceptionally comfortable beds and hardly any noise there was ample storage including a useful safe for valuables ac with a thermostat and free and fast wifi in the bathroom there was a large array of toiletries ranging from soaps shampoos gels and lotions which were replenished as required and a good sized shower which unfortunately became steamy after use an extractor fan would have been the many quirks of the hotel the jars of water in reception proved useful especially after a day out in the sun then at our rooms we enjoyed receiving the little notes from cleaning staff perched next to some jelly breakfast there was a wide ranging selection of hot and cold food and drinks with attentive floor we found the plunge pool and sunbathing beds which we enjoyed relaxing on after a hot we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at room mate anna and in barcelona and would highly recommend this hotel for its staff and quality of rooms,1
2544,great short beak spot beautiful quirky room very knowledgeable staff who new the kind of areas we wanted easy location for the centre and have a whatsapp service for help on the move booked our restaurant and taxi for was nice and good quality to set us on our way to travel home,1
2545,stayed with my young family for a long weekend and could have found a better hotel two connected bedrooms have a great solution not always available staff were amazing and so helpful breakfast was very good and the location is fantastic on the doorstep of all sorts of attractions highly recommended and one to repeat,1
2546,this hotel is in a fantastic location for all the sights of barcelona the staff are amazingnothing is too much troublethe rooftop plunge pool is to die forthe food is excellentthe cleaning team are brilliant definitely well worth a visit,1
2547,lovely hotel great rooms and facilities breakfast was fantastic massive choice and good quality the staff are very very helpful recommending good restaurants and bars very nice roof terrace and plunge pool definitely recommend this hotel,1
2548,this will be one of the few hotels that i feel that i really wan na go back to everything about our stay was so good first of all the staff was so kind and helpful they really wanted you to get the best out of barcelona the pool was also great nice chill area the breakfast was also really good so if you are having doubts about which hotel you should choose in barcelona take this one and of course the location is also great,1
2549,from the moment we arrived till the moment we left this hotel we were made to feel arrival we were offered for an additional cost a room upgrade for a night and i can honestly say that this made our break bigger room combined with the excellent views of the gaudi house from our balcony was a nice was very nice with a range of hot and cold options and you were really made to feel like you were in a star on reception was fantastic and dealt with all enquiries check in and check had a real passion and enthusiasm for her home was able to give excellent restaurants tips for us which gave us the chance to try what we thought was the best tapas in definitely recommend and will be back in the future,1
2550,we upgraded our room and got an outside jacuzzi and patio area that we used every day so worth the extra charge fantastic staff can not begin to say how awesome they sure our every need was looked after and taken care restaurant recommendations highly recommend,1
2551,this is a boutique hotel but does quite live up to the star rating the room is nice entry level rooms are small which is what we had there was really anywhere to put your suitcase let alone of them one of the good things was that the toilet is self enclosed meaning one of us could be in the shower or using the sink which did prevent access for the other one to the loo if you like privacy the main disappointment was breakfast we stayed at other boutique star hotels on the same trip which were streets ahead with breakfast service the hot food is cooked to order but to be honest was that nice the bacon was really fatty and greasy the eggs also greasier than fried eggs elsewhere on our first day the order was delivered wrong also i pretty sure the hot mushrooms were from a can fresh fruit was rarely topped up while we were there so we missed out on some they only put out small croissants at a time so often they were all gone too unless you waited around for a bit the location is great walking distance from many of the sights and a metro close by good sound proofing in our room which faced the ramblas overall staff were good we stay somewhere else next time,1
2552,incredible location right on la rambla so you can walk anywhere the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel is secure with hour reception and elevators the rooms get a lot of street noise but are insulated from it when the windows are closed great people watching from our room two balconies,1
2553,my wife and i always prefer the smaller boutique hotels when we travel and this one did not let us down most important to us is service and the staff here is exceptional though small they really look after every detail and make sure you are comfortable and secure the staff is very helpful from helping book excursions to tips on the best places to eat shop and when to do what i believe there are only rooms at this hotel we had a floor room with a small balcony overlooking la ramblas the room was probably entry level thus very small but we have been in smaller you can hear the metro below the hotel for the lower floor rooms we heard it on the floor but it was honestly not a bother and never disturbed our sleep maybe because we were so exhausted every evening the floor rooms are the jacuzzi suites the roof top bar is very quiet as it is primarily hotel guest the pool is really just to sit around and soak your feet while having cocktails nice place for a drink before you head out for the hotel location is very secure with many police patrolling the area you are in the center of la ramblas and in the heart of the gothic quarter so everything is at your finger tips from shops to restaurants to the la boqueria market which is almost next door you are also a very short walk from the,1
2554,my wife i went to barcelona to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite the hotel is so well appointed and the rooftop bar is the perfect place to spend an staff were ever so helpful and accommodating i can not thank them enough it perfectly located on la rambla only a few minutes walk from the amazing la boqueria market indeed most of the interesting sights in barcelona were within walkable would give this hotel stars if i could,1
2555,we loved this hotel the staff super friendly the location just perfect in the centre of barcelona the room was perfect king size bed with comfy pillows and crisp linen plus sizeable bathroom the breakfast menu is both continental and hot menu the roof top bar and swimming pool offers great views of the city they also offer a shower facility post check out in the downstairs gym great hotel definitely recommend,1
2556,after disembarking from our oceania cruise we spent eventful days in barcelona to cap off our vacation the hotel bagues located on la rambla was a perfect location for walking around the front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the restaurant staff was excellent as was the food we were supposed to have a car pick us up at the hotel to take us to the airport and we asked the front desk staff to please confirm it for us turns out that our flight was moved up an hour so they had to call the driver and ask him to get there earlier i think everyone at the front desk got involved in this task from finding the number to waiting on hold they were terrific i sure i may have missed some names here but thanks go to avelino jorge anastasia fabio nicolas soungalo the friendly doorman and eder and marco the restaurant staff heartily recommend this fine establishment,1
2557,at least there is peaceful place within barcelona city center there was no feeling of outsider or tourist but rather a usual luxury service only expected from this hotel impressive the ladies washroom,1
2559,if you are looking for a luxurious stay and a hotel with the finest touch you should consider mandarin oriental barcelona the duty manager the front desk the concierge the butler for our room all the way to the general manager are thoroughly outstanding we did not know the hotel gm but at breakfast andrei devillers general manager came up to greet the guests at each table and introduced himself he wanted to know what the guests requirements were and there was nothing too big or too small for him a personal touch that reflects his dedication and leadership we had a wonderful suite overlooking the prestigious passeig de gracie they have a michelin star restaurant and we would give them a michelin star even at their normal restaurant which is opened for breakfast lunch or dinner our suite was so beautiful that we had in room dining one night just to enjoy private dining be sure to have a mojito on the rooftop and enjoy their ceviche and other peruvian specialties this is a truly wonderful stay and definitely a hotel we want to return,1
2560,stayed at the mandarin oriental for several days and could have found a finer place service by all staff was supurb the breakfast was excellent and the location was right in the middle of everything i would highly recommend this hotel,1
2561,fantastic stay all staff were amazing there was nothing they could do for us they remember your name your preferences make you feel fantastic highly recommended they treated you like to royalty and made you feel welcome,1
2562,being a mandarin it is typically very pretty great service clean and very high end it is located in a great area rooms are very nice and large for europe breakfast is worth the price rooftop bar is very nice dipping pool is pretty but really should be a real pool instead of what it is view in the back of hotel is nice at all service very good and food choices good as well overall a very nice high end hotel but i would say a better business hotel rather than a vacation type hotel but if you can afford it it is very nice,1
2563,great location on a beautiful wide avenue surrounded by barcelona most iconic buildings the waterfront is within walking distance minutes or a very short taxi ride everything you would expect from this category hotel highly recommended,1
2564,i a little torn i visited the the blanc restaurant to meet a friend who was staying in the hotel it was a beautiful setting and the staff were friendly and provided excellent service however although the food was well cooked i had the ox burger it was quite bland and a little too sweet for my liking i felt it was overpriced for what it was that said the overall experience was enjoyable so i would certainly still consider staying there myself and checking out their other restaurants,1
2565,unique combination of a very convenient location and yet an oasis of calm on the passeig de gr√†cia a bit like the original mandarin hotel in hk the other great thing about the bar√ßa mo is the superb front staff porters receptionists concierges friendly courteous public spaces especially the restaurants are elegant and chic in an understated way otherwise the rooms tend to be on the small side with a d√©cor more like a cute but not classy than a premier palazzo no nespresso machine or even a kettle with coffee or tea bags for that matter poor fruit selection slow and weak wifi guests used to mo in asia will be surprised at the absence of a hot teapot brought to your room upon or the underwhelming breakfast buffet probably or of the diverse food offerings in asia quality wise f b is good especially at the signature star moments see separate review beautiful pool which only opens at am tiny gym with modern equipment though in other words a offering at a pricing,1
2566,stars on all levels butler service and concierge service is excellent rooms are beautiful breakfast room very very i can state a minor observation when it is hot in barcelona the lobby should increase the air conditioning and also the elevators,1
2567,great hotel very friendly and helpful staff drink on arrival plus voucher per person for another drink in bar lovely rooms and lots of food on offer for breakfast nice inside and outside bar bar has great plunge pool,1
2568,perfect in every way very big modern rooms by european standards and the staff are always smiling and helpful the breakfast with its buffet and a la carte options is the best hotel breakfast i have ever had both in terms of variety and quality this is our first barcelona visit we are on our day so we were sure what area to stay in but this location has turned out to perfect the only thing less than perfect is the rooftop pool a lovely area up there to have a drink and soak up the sun but the pool is little more than a wading pool this hotel has turned out more than we could have hoped for highly recommend,1
2569,three of us stayed in a junior suite very comfortably for nights the hotel and rooms have quality fittings and are modern and stylish housekeeping maintained the room very well complimentary water and coffee in room room overlooked via laietana and windows opened we liked the roof top bar and pool although the pool is only to dip your toes did not eat breakfast as there are so many options on the street for coffee etc at a fraction of the price reception staff are professional but not warm eg rarely greeted us when we came and went we did however get early checkin which was nice an enjoyable story stay overall,1
2570,clean modern hotel steps from gothic quarter the staff provides very good service and the rooftop are lovely the food in the restaurant was of mixed quality but the view and the lovely breezes were worth it the location really ca be beat and for the price i felt the quality of the room and service were very good i would definitely stay again ps the pool is about knee deep i think it just for decoration and for guests to dip their feet at the bar no real pool there is a business center set up in the lobby as well a very large and comfortable lobby lounge area,1
2571,great location and cool vibe the hotel has managed to make a modern but comfortable and welcoming atmosphere greeted with cava local champagne upon arrival and invited to enjoy another complimentary beverage on the rooftop bar and we are off to a good start the staff was very nice our room was quite large and had a city view but was very quiet our friends had a balcony on the other side of the hotel with a view onto rooftop life and a peak of the shoreline extensive breakfast available loved the lobby lounging areas and books highly recommend,1
2572,hotel looks much better in the pictures than it actually is we stayed at a different hotel one night in barcelona at the beginning of our vacation and two nights at the cubic at the end of our vacation the first hotel was half the price and much nicer our room had no outside windows making us feel like we had booked the cheapest room on a cruise ship the staff greeted you with a smile but was unhelpful and cold when you engaged them the location is central but it is on an unattractive busy noisy street i really hoped that we would like our first experience with an hotel but we wo be staying in any more of their hotels,0
2573,this hotel is well located and very well priced for barcelona the rooms with a iron balustrade face away from the road over city rooftops and are quite we booked a suite which was very spacious and comfortable everything at the hotel worked well the staff were keen to assist with everything from directions to restaurant bookings my only criticism would be the lack of in house gym but otherwise the place is a great choice,1
2574,have stayed here for week and loved it great location close to everything but with a little separation so it feels tranquil decor and rooms are wonderful because we had a teenager with us we had a junior suite lovely lovely room nespresso machine and electric kettle came in is gracious and extremely helpful rooftop pool also nice treat view is amazing and food quite good i only say quite good because i not a fan of spanish food likely the food is delicious would absolutely stay here again if i return it is a gem,1
2575,i booked cubik in october for my partners birthday as a surprise present even before arriving when i sent emails asking various questions the replies were prompt and very helpful and friendly so this automatically got the hotel off to a good start when we arrived we were greeted with friendly staff on the door and at the reception desk and also with a glass of champagne as our room was not quite ready which we were absolutely fine with we were given vouchers to get two free cocktails at the roof terrace bar which is amazing and has views all around barcelona cocktails were lovely as was the tapas they serve when we actually came to get our room number the hotel offered another two vouchers to get another drink at the bar at any time we wished we could believe all the complimentary things we were offered what really topped off our stay was the bottle of cava and two chocolate cakes we received in the evening of our first nights stay as a congratulations gift from the hotel to celebrate my partner that melted our hearts and was so thoughtful onto the general hotel are kept scrupulously clean and are a decent size some may find them on the small size we had an internal room however we thought the room was more than comfortable as we spent the majority of the time sight seeing and eating out and were only in the room to sleep the,1
2576,cubik is centrally located and walking distance to passeig de gracia barcelona central avenue gothic quarters etc stylish design and nice furniture in lobby and rooms the market restaurant is a hidden gem we had a great breakfast had a pickpocket incident and my mum wallet was stolen while walking around barcelona had to call all the credit card companies to cancel the cards hotel staff jenaro and javier were very helpful helped dial the numbers and speak to operators in spanish for minutes separately camilo was also very helpful in providing directions on places to would stay at a again,1
2577,except for the ominous who would never crack a smile or engage this is a great hotel in the hearth of barcelona the staff are efficient and go out of their way ensuring that the service levels are at least what is took a suit and really enjoyed all the space including the separate lounge the worked well and bed and linen where comfortable the suit bathrooms are large although ours did not have a bath i really only shower have a quaint breakfast room in the basement that is brought to life with some clever design and effects while the bar should not be missed at least for one sunset,1
2578,i spent hours on tripadvisor trying to find the best hotel in barcelona for our day vacation cubic was our winner and i am happy to write that everything about our stay was just perfect we booked the suite with breakfast our room was reasonable big the breakfast buffet offered a huge selection of everything you may think of to eat in the morning the interior design of the hotel was very creative and unique it definitely did not have the usual hotel and the best of it staff members were just simply great very professional and attentive the location is exceptional right in the middle of everything evening drink at the roof bar was another great surprise the views from the bar are stunning thank you cubic for making our stay just awesome,1
2579,stayed here in november booked a junior suite with balcony room was beautiful really clean and spacious great views across barcelona lovely staff left a complimentary bottle of cava in the room and cakes complimentary drink on arrival definitely would return,1
2580,we had a wonderful stay at the cubik the location is wonderful to start with the design absolutely phenomenal the staff so friendly and accommodating the rooms are clean and spacious all in all they really thought of and do everything to make for a wonderful visit the view from the roof top is precious definitely recommend,1
2581,my husband and i have just returned from nights at this hotel is in a perfect location right in the centre but rooms really quiet so a peaceful oasis staff were excellent efficient but available a special mention to camile at the front desk sorry if i have spelt that wrong he helped a scottish woman with boarding passes the housekeeping was excellent rooms were spotless the rooftop chill out area was lovely breakfast was fabulous with a great selection to suit everyone and the service was great was not a cheap break for us but flying from scotland never is but we felt it was worth every penny should be proud of their staff,1
2582,we spent two nights at the cubik and could not be happier with our hotel choice having never been to barcelona we were not sure where we wanted to stay we knew we wanted to be close to the gothic quarter and la rambla but not in the heart of it accomplished that we arrived very early after disembarking a cruise ship while our room was not ready at the front desk staff where very welcoming with water and champagne they took our bags and put them in a secure area so we could explore the city without worry the front desk also helped us book tour bus passes schedule a visit to la sagrada familia and book tickets to museu de design de barcelona to see the exhibit dave bowe is the front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful after spending most of the day exploring the city we came back to get our room we checked in a very spacious superior barcelona room on the floor it was a corner unit that faced the street via laietana at first i was concerned there would be a lot of street noise at night but the windows are so thick we could not hear anything from there we checked out the wonderful roof top bar and pool it was a nice little oasis on a hot day which gave us some time to relax after a day of walking in the hot sun what we really liked about this,1
2583,i have just returned from a excellent night stay with my daughter the roof top bar and pool is such a welcome extra to this hotel the staff are very attentive and the cocktails delicious the room on the floor was very good except the shower flooded into the toilet area and did not drain away i spoke to reception twice before maintenance man came minutes later he said it was fixed but it did the same thing for the next nights such a shame and he room was not cheap when i mentioned it again the night before we were leaving i did expect some compensation he did take bout euros off my bill i ca check the exact amount as he could print the bill shame,1
2584,our time at grand central hotel we stayed other places in barcelona but this is the best cool slick great service great location and we particularly love the rooftop pool and sky bar at night,1
2585,excellent location and attentive staff the rooftop was nice but it was a little smaller than i expected it was also strange that i could control the temperature of my own unit i had to call in temperature requests but otherwise a pleasant stay,1
2586,i only stayed at this property for a short days after a week in ibiza the hotel rooms are a bit small but very clean and well equipped situated perfectly in the gothic quarter very convenient to restaurants and shops as well as a good place to meet up for tours what really stood out with our experience was the doorman alonso he was the most distinguished and helpful of all the staff at this hotel from our experience it was very refreshing to find such professionalism in this day and age kudos to grand hotel central for putting such a wonderful team together i will definitely return to this hotel in my next visit to barcelona,1
2587,room was awesome fantastic value had a date in barcelona so wanted to make it special for her we went to skybar and had lovely bottle of champagne fantastic views then off to the nice restaurants on the beach front the next day had lovely breakfast in room and extended check out time of luggage was left behind the desk it was such a fantastic hotel i would highly recommend,1
2588,from the moment we checked in until the second we left the staff at the grand hotel central led by saul canal the manager made us feel at home in beautiful bareclona the accommodations from our room to the rooftop pool were first rate what really makes this place special is the people everyone was friendly and helpful service was outstanding help with directions transportation and reservations made this hotel far more than just a place to stay we felt at home food room and ambiance were first rate go see saul and his team,1

2591,my wife and were staying in barcelona for five days barcelona itself is fantastic on its own but definetly staying at this hotel made our time in barcelona even better to start you can not have a better location close to literally everything the beach la rambla tourist places and shopping as soon as we come to the hotel you know that everyone from the hotel staff will make sure you are pleased every question was answered everything we wanted from the hotel and staff was always met with a positive answer and a smile great pool and bar on the top floor which usually is open until am so it was nice to be out and about and come back to the hotel and enjoy a cocktail get some relaxing time by the pool beautiful room modern and spacious could hear any noice from the next door room or from think of a better hotel to stay while in barcelona and will for sure stay again thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay johnnorway,1

2593,this hotel is situated opposite the gothic cathedral and between the gothic and born areas of the city the room we had was quite small but finished to a high standard the minibar is complimentary free the staff could not have been more helpful and most spoke fluent english the sky bar on the roof with adjoining pool was a great place to relax and cool down breakfast was excellent with a wide variety available but quite pricey euro per head and there are masses of places nearby to buy breakfast gaudy buildings sagrada familia are a euro taxi ride away we were on a lower floor and the metro could be heard but was not obtrusive,1
2594,second time back to grand hotel central coming off the back of my first stay last year and what a brilliant hotel from top to repeating most of what i wrote last time the staff location hotel in general were all as to be expected perfect they will do anything to help you and go out of their way to ensure you are having a pleasant stay excellent roof top pool gives you such a good city scape view but do make sure you also go for a drink at night the ambiance is totally different and seems to be quite a hot spot for guests to brilliant and ca wait to come back,1
2595,from the moment we entered the city and the hotel we were totally taken care of we arrived at am from an overnight flight our room was not ready they quickly ushered us to the spa to shower and change by am our room was ready very spacious large bathroom view overlooking via laietana and the cathedral the pool deck and bar which is open until is magnificent with views overlook the entire city down to the mediterranean sea the hotel staff had wonderful restaurant recommendations,1
2596,a grand location for a grand hotel the concierge and staff were very helpful with information and helping to book the busiest sites and always cheerful and pleasant we enjoyed the bar and restaurant on the hotel roof it was a beautiful place to sit eat and enjoy the view i miss it already,1
2597,from entering to leaving this star boutique city hotel the experience was first class the staff at all levels were the best i experienced in a long time the hotel was immaculate staff friendly room bed comfy best bit the electric black out blinds i will be installing these in my future projects the roof to bar restaurant pool area was an unexpected bonus i needed to visit various businesses whilst there the hotel is located as in its name gran central walking or taxi ride nothing is too far would i use this hotel again pst definitely yes,1

2600,the grand hotel central made our trip the staff was abouslty incredible extremely friendly and helpful especially the concerge who helped us plan our days the hotel was beautiful with a stunning rooftop bar in addition our standard room was ungraded to a master suite an unbelievable room and one of the best i ever stayed in the hotel alone is reason enough to go back to barcelona would highly recommend,1
2601,this hotel has an excellent staff always willing to satisfy and help guests the booking process was easy with excellent communication with the reservation is very good but on busy and noisy had connecting rooms a standard with king bed and a superior room with twins the standard is smaller does have bathtub nespresso machine and has only a small rooms are adecuate clean and modern pretty plain decor lacking of caracter and some amenities as robes speakers or docks to listen music there was an input panel with some instructions to connect the celular with the tv but connections did work we found the rooms uninviting and cold for hanging out or spending some time resting there for worst windows are locked so the feeling is quite musty view from the room was quite is also adecuate but with limited space to use small for good good lighting and a medium sized tv the complementary frigobar has beer orange juice coke zero potato chip bag and a tube of is average overcooked barely warm scrambled eggs cold pancakes and repetitive choices we asked one morning eggs and pancakes from the menu to avoid eating the cold overcooked ones and the server took them from the buffet instead of making new ones so we ended up skipping breakfast of the mornings we stayed there it available till hr we had room service in many opportunities which was good we also had lunch at city restaurant and drinks at the roof,1
2602,i very much enjoyed the stay in grand hotel central i had a good experience there it was very modernand on the roof of the hotel that infinty pool was great there is a good view of the city from the top of the buildingonly thing i didnt like is there is not alot of space up there on the roof to relax you can only stay there a certain time until you have to leave but besides that i like the hotel the staff is very friendly and very helpfulso i def recommend that hotel,1

2610,my wife and i had an excellent experience at the grand hotel central a neighbor right outside our window was sawing for a couple days each morning waking us up so we asked to move we were quickly moved to an upgraded room at the front of the hotel on a higher floor where the windows are soundproofed problem solved also the front desk manager saul canal was very helpful in getting us tickets to the picasso museum and offering great advice on other sites great rooftop lounge and pool as well we would highly recommend the hotel,1
2611,the hotel staff were always very friendly and were happy to change our room on arrival from one bed to a twin room without any fuss the rooftop pool and skybar were fantastic and a great place to while away the morning before heading out exploring the staff were always happy to offer assistance but did bother you if you were just happy sunbathing which made a nice change to some hotel where you feel guilty not buying a drink they also gave us complimentary ice lollies that were delicious the room night staff were very happy to help when we needed any help regardless of the time overall a great stay and we would definitely return,1
2612,we are a family of six and booked three rooms at the grand central hotel the rooms were all very nice though a bit small like most european hotels the reception desk personnel and concierge were all extremely helpful and informative the hotel is very centrally located with the beach old town and calle rambla within walking distance the included breakfast is delicious and the rooftop pool and bar are also quite nice i highly recommend this hotel in barcelona,1
2613,everything about this hotel exceeded my expectations the location is ideal for exploring walking distance to the gothic area the medieval synagogue in the jewish quarter markets las ramblas gaudi casa batlo fabulous restaurants cafes the big plaza and shopping on passeig de gracia the building beautifully renovated and chic breakfast superb and the room had all the comforts of home plus what really makes it special however is the amazing staff everyone from the front desk doormen bell hop and waiters to the manager went out of their way to be beyond helpful and genuinely kind during our four night stay if i am lucky enough to be in barcelona again i will definitely stay at the grand hotel central,1
2614,my experience in ghc was excellence the best ia the service every employee makes you fell like home location is the best because you are right in the barrio gotico but alsob youbare walking distance from the beach rooms are simple but elegant and the rooftop is amazing,1
2615,we stayed at this hotel for nights the hotel is very central to everywhere great restaurants very close by as well as near the market and the gothic quarter the staff were really very nice friendly and efficient greeted with a drink or a glass of their lemon water that always out for you to help yourself the room was also very nice modern smallish but worked very well for two of us the mini bar was free we definitely are staying here again on our next visit to spain just fabulous and worth every dollar you hotel staff we loved staying at grand hotel central see you soon,1
2616,this excellent hotel has a great location and a very helpful staff the swimming pool has an amazing view i wrote down my when i made the booking and the very friendly man who checked me in made a successful effort to make me happy someone else whose service stood out was the doorman alonso who gave me some good suggestions for exploring the area by foot on the night all the taxis in barcelona striked one suggestion for improvement i was not impressed by the quality of the food and coffee at the breakfast buffet,1
2617,great staff greets you upon arrival we were offered a cold drink as we checked in and quickly escorted to our very stylish room the room was very clean and the bed was comfy the bathroom had a great rainfall showerhead and plenty of space the free mini bar was restocked daily as an additional bonus i would stay here again without hesitation the staff should be recognized for there excellent hospitality they made us feel welcome and at home from the very minute well done fellas and thank you,1
2618,from the concierge to the check the people were fantastically helpful room and hotel were amazing we did get to use the rooftop or pool but did check them out and will absolutely return to try them along with the restaurant location is fantastic too we loved everything about it,1
2619,we had a fantastic stay at the grand central hotel as a couple looking for a break away from the usual daily grind the staff were friendly and service was excellent they could have been more welcoming or helpful and nothing was too much hotel is a smart boutique hotel with good sized rooms and complimantary we absolutely loved the roof top bar and the infinity pool after a day at the beach or sightseeing it is so nice to come back and have some relaxing time in style the hotel is well positioned close to the shops and beach many tourist attractions are reachable via transport links near by hop on hop off bus etc thank you to everyone at grand central hotel for making our weekend blissful,1
2620,very nice hotel in a good location the noise level in the hallways from the cleaning staff and other guests was high the pool closes at which is really inconvenient i would say it a star hotel but everything was fine minus the noise and the odd pool hours,1
2621,me and my family were greeted very warmly the staff was friendly especially alonso the door man he helped us a lot he recommended restaurants and stores we also found stores because of him overall we had a great time,1
2622,we had a great stay here and i recommend to anyone with the budget to stay here the hotel itself was of a good standard if not quite being the absolute top end and our room was functional if unspectacular what really stood out were the excellent staff who from the management down made us feel exceptionally welcome and really comfortable we moved from another hotel of the same price point and there was a notable improvement in the care and attention the staff gave us here on top of that there is a fantastic bar and pool on the rooftop as well as the great food and drinks,1
2623,the grand hotel central is everything a luxury boutique hotel should be elegant comfortable central but most importantly the staff is the absolute best we stayed nights the recommendations for restaurants and attractions were perfect we got home late o e night and my husband asked the front desk if the kitchen made flan they did not minutes later there was a knock on our door and flan was delivered there was a taxi strike in barcelona on the day we left we would have had to take our luggage and get to the airport by bus but pau at reception offered to pick us up on his day off and drive us there saul canal is charming helpful and warm and he made us feel like family mauro torres and leo were also just so very good to us there is no where else to stay in barcelona not to mention the most comfortable bed we ever slept in and the greatest rooftop pool and restaurant love love love this hotel,1
2624,the grand hotel central in barcelona gave us a good experience when visiting the city for only a few days the hotel provides excellent service at almost all levels and i would like to mention ruben as an especially service minded member of the hotel staff rooms are not big but nicely designed clean and really well equipped the bed is very good but the pillows was a bit hard the possibility to choose a softer pillow would be great the terrace on the roof top is nice but a bit small the pool could have been bigger the view from the roof over barcelona is great but the service on the roof top was not as gentle as in the rest of the hotel all in all a good hotel with an excellent location,1
2625,almost faultless chilled hotel right in the centre of the city which is perfect if you are looking for a long weekend break in the sun roof top terrace is excellent albeit needs more shade options and to stop the timers which retracts the awnings and is a lovely place to while away the day breakfast was also a little slow when you order from the menu and there are spots in the dining room which seem to be passed by by the staff on the whole though it a great hotel and we had a lovely stay,1
2626,great hotel very chic superb roof top bar and affinity pool highly recommend fabulous suite and great service very central location close to gothic area and las rambles breakfasts to die,1
2627,timings are everything when your on a routine fast check in to a great room unfortunate noisy building works next door from rattled the hotel randomly naps were impossible till we moved simple request with best result lovely pool and pleasant drinks selection we ate out as my favorite market is around the corner mercat de santa caterina as well as a booking at tickets if you a corporate coffee drinker starbucks is next door and if your body is a temple in the other direction is an supermarket no good for parking if you have a car dropping off is virtually a tuck and roll from your slow moving vehicle but honestly with all our stuff staff helped getting us in and away quickly great stay willbeback,1
2628,this is the hotel you are looking for to capture the essence of barcelona in a few days overall a great hotel with some potencial rooms are great service are great and the roof top terasse is fantastic i wish to mention ruben as the edge to the service we had at the hotel the roof top has potencial in service and also the quality of drinks served here we definately want to come back and stay at this beautiful hotel,1
2629,the room was clean very functional the service was excellent the staff wad vey accommodating the location was very good close to all the services sightseeing we wanted to see during our days trip,1
2630,i stayed in barcelona many times and wish i had known about this hotel earlier the whole experience was absolutely perfect from the service to the room to the amazingly cool skybar and pool it also in the perfect neighborhood so glad i never have to search for another hotel in barcelona again this is the place,1
2631,best staff all was perfect also the sky bar was amazing the staff the view pool like a perfect dream the room assigned was cleaned and big amazing also the bathroom for sure i be back soon,1
2632,lovely hotel with wonderful staff this is the first time we stayed all family at grand hotel central the hotel was in great location close to every thing you need the roof top was a good place to chilled out and enjoyed the amazing view really we had fantastic time the more important at this hotel was the staff all of them were very helpful and friendly from the doorman until the managers but i would like to give extreme thanks to hicham for his hospitality and attention and the excellent service which gave us during our stay thank you recommend this lovely hotel and sure next year we come back,1
2633,great place to stay in barcelona very central location and the terrace with a beautiful view infinity pool and bar was an extremely nice place to relax and spend some time away from the busy city very professional and friendly staff as well,1
2634,we booked this hotel for nights for our anniversary owing to its spectacular reviews on tripadvisor and the stunning rooftop terrace it did not arrival we received a warm welcome from elena on reception elena informed me that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a nice gesture and very much appreciated she also changed our reservation at city restaurant as our flight had been delayed reviewed separately there are two elevators one solely for guest use opposite reception and one for guest and visitor use to the sky bar which is just right of the reception the other staff in reception seemed to leave us alone the executive room was very spacious with an enormous bed and a beautifully designed walk in shower and separate hand wash area sadly no bath a friendly welcome message regarding our anniversary was accompanied by a bottle of cava again a very welcome gesture the room was designed to a very high specification with black slate in the wash area and wood effect flooring in the sleeping area with lighting to give a relaxing ambience gilchrist soames shower products were also a nice addition having read reviews regarding noise i can say that we slept very well throughout our stay in room and was undisturbed through the night especially with the excellent air conditioning system complimentary refreshments water cola orange juice beer and crisps are provided daily from the in room fridge the cleaning team are the unsung heroes of,1
2635,loved this hotel location is excellent and we loved the rooftop pool the desk staff and doormen were very as we were early arrivers and they went out of their way to get us a room early concierge also very good while traditional looking on the outside the hotel is very modern in its d√©cor particularly the rooms i would definitely recommend it,1
2636,hello i rarely write reviews but at this occasion i and my wife have two kids aged and and were travelling with friends to sitges our friends minded our kids for hours so we could go on a getaway to barcelona we booked at this hotel which is the most fancy place we have ever been to the experience was in one word only because this place is ridiculously tasteful and cool but because of the people who work is a roof top bar i must talk about before going further it is insane with a small pool overlooking the whole city and during the day time it is only open for customers of the hotel which makes it super quiet and nice for a lazy read in the back to the real deal there is a guy who fronts the reception of the hotel who is called sa√∫l canal this man is some sort of a super god to us now cause we have seriously never ever been treated so wonderfully as he did when he found out our made our trip in one word amazing he gave us some sort of superstar treatment the whole time a little due to his love of iceland where we come from but also just out of his kind heart i think we will never forget this and all we can think about is we can get back to this heavenly place where the man with the big and generous soul runs,1
2637,the perfect hotel for so many in the gothic quarter pool view from the sky bar and the best customer service ever it was our anniversary and sa√∫l organised cava chocolates and balloons making it such a memorable experience we would never stay anywhere else,1
2638,the location of the hotel was perfect walking distance to almost sky area maybe not for fine dining but for casual it is could turn the temperature in the pool up too cold for class in the mornings great staff in every area helped us call restaurants for bookings and was clean and the bed was comfortable,1
2639,apart from barcelona that is a very nice city the hotel was very welcoming and well organized the staff was gentle pleasant and with a good level of english the service was great and the rooms were well cleaned good place,1
2640,marc was outstanding and made us feel welcome from the start everyone at the hotel was friendly and the facilities and location were excellent the roof top pool and bar are awesome our stay was star thanks,1
2641,loved this boutique hotel it is well located in barcelona and i was greeted very warmly by staff upon arrival the rooftop pool is also great to hang out at the only thing i had issues with is using the room phone to call the front it was intuitive to me otherwise it was a great stay,1
2642,we stayed nights before our cruise at the grand hotel central barcelona the front desk staff was very efficient and helpful during our stay we were given a pocket wifi to use during our stay which was very helpful hotel is centrally located and close to all the sites we wanted to visit room has a mini refrigerator which is replenished every day with drinks at no extra charge a special thanks to alonso the front door bellman the day before our departure i requested to have a taxi available for transportation to the cruise port sure enough when we were checking out the taxi was outside and alonso confirmed our ride was ready whenever we were done great service all around at this hotel,1
2643,we stayed here for a couple of nights from july for a last minute romantic break excellent place to relax sky bar awesome staff really friendly and helpful on arrival and service overall standards are very high would stay here again in a flash service staff at sky bar pool area were brilliant particularly johanna from poland and the young french guy forgot his name cocktails were lovely even if pound to euro exchange hurts right now good central location to do barcelona stuff but on this trip we spent most of our time in the hotel enjoying the sky bar,1
2644,very euro chic hotel still has a boutique like feel even though it a starwood property marc general manager and his staff were wonderful amazing rooftop infinity pool that looks over barcelona and the y queso sandwhich with truffle was amazing at the pool bar would come back over and over again,1
2645,smart staff combined with excellent service we are very happy to chose the central the rooftop is overwhelming but sometimes a bit crowded we can recommend the central to everyone who wants to join a relaxing time,1
2646,this hotel located in central barcelona just like its name from it to most travel spots are considered very convenient and just like minutes walking distance in the travel bus stop and also there is a supermarket next door extremely great location when we checked in we met a receptionist his name is marc i think he is the best receptionist i have ever met extremely nice and professional just by the way this hotel do check in i already starts to love this hotel the room designed very modern and they provide very high quality stuffs such as shampoo tea and so on each items are all better quality than other stars hotel we think this hotel train their staffs very good each staff from cleaning lady doorman receptionist restaurant waiters to room service everyone are just super nice and willing to help if i am going to barcelona again i will definitely stay here it just such a wonderful experience i had here,1
2647,friendly efficient comfortable and tastefully decorated with strong free wifi haute cuisine if desired excellent coffee and delightfully presented breakfast staff very professional and helpful particularly for those trying to speak spanish clumsily rooftop was more for ummyp in jocks but could have been fun had we frolicked however that may have cleared the pool good stay thanks,1
2648,just completed a night stay at this centrally located hotel before we even arrived the staff was very helpful in setting up our accommodations the hotel was centrally located which made many of the attractions in the city accessible by foot they were very helpful towards my year old child sending milk to our room at all times on the house they would even warm up her food when needed and you ca beat the rooftop pool overlooking the city on a summer day i would also like to extend a thank you to hermo who works up front you can tell that he genuinely cares for the patrons at the hotel and wants to make their stay as pleasant as possible the only downside was that the wifi although fast in the lobby struggled to pick up the pace in the i return to barcelona i would absolutely stay at this hotel,1
2649,we stayed but one night en route to a cruise the hotel welcomed us with complimentary cava and a super high level of professionalism great location for walking around the city and the roof deck is the perfect retreat at the end of the day the restaurant is lacking though so dine out but definitely stay here,1
2650,we were very pleased with the midmost hotel it just a few blocks from las ramblas and easy walking distance to key tourist sites as well as restaurants and shops the hotel staff were helpful and friendly rooms very comfortable and well appointed we were able to get two connecting rooms for our person family the hotel also has a charming rooftop bar as with a wonderful view we really enjoyed our stay,1
2651,flew into barcelona a day early for a med cruise asked for an early as we were coming off and overnight flight we were given a lovely room mini suite with a view of the avenue very comfortable room blackout curtains so we could sleep for a bit very efficient air staff was welcoming and friendly providing us with a local map and directions the hotel is very well located only a couple of blocks from las ramblas and close to the gothic quarter it was a great place to stay in a great city,1
2652,the midmost was a great place to stay location was great two blocks from the ramblas two blocks from the airport bus we walked everywhere staff were super would definitely recommend the midmost the rooftop was a nice place to come back to after a day of walking,1
2653,after having enjoyed many pleasant and comfortable stays at the hotel inglaterra the previous name of this establishment my wife and i looked forward to seeing the changes that occurred in creating its new incarnation as the midmost we were not liked the tasteful remodeling of the rooms a softer and more traditional look and the renovated bathroom was all spiffy and modern there seemed to be even more closet space due to some rearrangement of the closets interiors and we much appreciated the addition of the spacious safe as always the room was quiet and comfortably cool barcelona was quite summery while we were there and as before the housekeeping staff was cheerful and did a good job and even when we needed to use the room after breakfast until fairly late in the morning was very considerate in fact the staff as a whole was quite pleasant and welcoming the buffet breakfast was tasty with good ingredients including eggs and meats and cold alternatives and everything was refilled promptly the new coffee brewer now with caf√© americano worked fast and another nice improvement as always the location is unexcelled perfectly situated where the gothic quarter meets eixample and three areas of barcelona that have along with great restaurants and shopping the attractions of greatest interest to visitors and the hotel is only steps away maybe meters from the universitat stop of the inexpensive and fast airport bus obviously my wife and i are fans of the midmost we,1
2654,friendly welcome fast and efficient check in the rooms were very clean and the staff made us feel at home they truly cared about us having a great time in barcelona i highly recommend the metropolitan,1
2655,the hotel offers very good rooms fully equipped with everything and with the right food is very good and the breakfast offers a lot of options for both sweet and savory tastes ask for the menu of eggs and other dishes made at the stay,1
2656,we stayed here with friends for two nights in is a great location reception staff very polite and fizz on could not fault the hotel room a good size and bed a good size and extremely comfortable huge shower and bathroom we loved the rooftop pool lovely temperaturebar staff polite and prices very reasonablewe would defiantly go back if you are after a good standard hotel in a central location and child free this is for you thank you we had agreat few days,1
2657,recommended by a friend who is a frequent visitor to barcelona for work we were incredibly happy with this hotel the welcome and check in were great glass of cava as we checked in a gift of a bottle of red wine and some chocolates to welcome us to the hotel and a lovely room my wife loved the decor of the entire hotel and the room lots of mirrors nice bathroom with lovely toiletries provided we had a drink in the bar by the pool which was nice and relaxing breakfast was one of the best i have had anywhere great selection on the buffet and then the cooked options were delicious room was cleaned every day as you would expect and the toiletries and water replenished also used the laundry service which was good albeit hotel prices my only criticism is that the air conditioning would not get low enough for my wife and i which meant we spent most nights sleeping without even a sheet although it was not so uncomfortable that we could not sleep would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely look out for the brand again when in spain as the quality and service was better than others we had experienced to date,1
2658,i loved staying at this hotel in barcelona it is a pretty boutique hotel right in the middle of barcelona only one block from the plaza de catalunya the central square in barcelona you can walk to all the major attractions from here the staff was excellent and friendly and the room was large by european standards the prepaid breakfast was a good deal the only drawback is that the mini gym is really a treadmill and exercise bike overall i did not want to leave this hotel when it was time to return to the,1
2659,beautiful hotel and great staff the bar is awesome decor is great both pools are also really nice the breakfast is excellent many options and fresh food the rooms were great beautiful view down the road from the balcony location is away from the central plaza would return,1
2660,well what to say it was our first time staying at the group and it was amazing from the moment we arrived all the team where so nice and would do anything to help room we had was perfect so clean and such a beautiful room we had a jacuzzi too which was choose not to eat in the hotel but on the last day we did decided to have breakfast in the hotel wish we had breakfast there every day it was soooo good should have had it every you to everyone at the real was a super visit we came to see the concert and you guys just made it even better,1
2661,we stayed at this hotel and loved it great location helpful staff and beautiful well kept hotel we used the metro a lot and had great access restaurants around the hotel were great i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone in barcelona,1
2662,we loved our stay here location of this hotel is fabulous close to metro stations so within easy reach of all the sights casa mila is only a minute walk away and also a short walk away to the gothic quarter also located near some really good shops which was also very handy we opted for a balcony room that overlooked the pool and were glad we did the balcony was great to just to sit back and relax it was also a sun trap so nice to enjoy the evening sunshine rooms are a good size with all the necessities bottles of water are provided daily and also the room had a nespresso coffee maker also handy we used the pools and they were both nice both surprisingly really quiet breakfast in the hotel was good but again as many other reviewers have said expensive at euros there are places nearby which are cheaper and also a starbucks over the road which proved to be handy hotel bar is also good and the staff were very staff at the hotel are really nice friendly and also very knowledgeable about the area and metro is so much choice of hotels in barcelona and we were really glad we chose this hotel,1
2663,my husband booked this hotel for a long weekend to celebrate our year wedding anniversary he researched several hotels and areas before choosing the metropolitan which is literally at the top of las rambla perfect location friendly staff and our upgraded premium room on the floor with a balcony overlooking the outdoor terrace and pool was great the hotel has pools a plunge pool on floor with small area for sunbathing and a larger one on the ground floor with a large sun terrace just above you can order drinks at the bar there and they will bring over bring to you on the terrace bar prices were surprisingly reasonable for beer and wine around euros for a glass the albari√±o is delicious a bottle of cava is around euros and is of very good quality it a small hotel so one tip is to go down to the bar to order drinks and take back to room yourself instead of paying the extra euros for it to be delivered our room had a huge walk in shower super comfortable queen size bed a docking station and a nespresso machine which we made much use of each morning the hotel had organised a bottle of cava and some chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room to celebrate our anniversary what a lovely touch we only had breakfast at their kitchen restaurant once and on the last morning of our stay although it was pricey at euros each i,1
2664,stayed here with daughter our second visit to barcelona as it was her choice for an birthday gift from family before we arrived the email responses answering my questions from bianca were so thoughtful and positive that we knew we would receive friendly and good service and we were not wrong hotel is very central and just off the main placa catalunya easily reachable from the airport by the aerobus which stops nearby and is a minute walk away the receptionist checking us in was so accommodating and friendly and this continued throughout our time here the glass of cava on arrival was a nice way to start our stay staff were knowledgeable and informative on transport sightseeing and booking trips and activities etc the doorman was always happy and polite and greeted us every time we entered or left the hotel the sweet jars dotted around the hotel lobby and bar were a nice little treat as was the coffee available anytime and free of charge we also had complimentary bottles of water each day as members and a free cocktail voucher the hotel itself is beautifully clean and surprise in the room for my daughter birthday was lovely chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of cava and little chocolates in had a superior twin room on the floor with a terrace facing the courtyard and pool this was really quiet and relaxing the beds were fabulous with a choice of pillows each person has their own slippers and,1
2665,hotel is in a great location in the centre of barcelona a very warm welcome by the staff with the offer of a complimentary drink we upgraded to a jacuzzi suite which had a great outdoor terrace there was an excellent selection at breakfast and the staff were very attentive and friendly,1
2666,where do i start there is so much to say about this hotel right in the heart of barcelona at placa de catalunya it could not be more central for many metro and bus links to other parts of the city the hotel is so tastefully furnished and decorated very unusual and unique the double rooms are small but fantastically equipped with an espresso machine and a kettle in the cupboard for tea drinkers like me safe iron and board made use of the fridge in the room but like many people bought our own wine etc to enjoy in the evening on the balcony our room was to the front with a small balcony that had a great view over placa de catalunya not noisy at all when doors closed welcoming complimentary bottle of red wine delivered on our night was greatly appreciated along with chocs then truffles each night for the rest of our stay were delivered to our room such a lovely treat spacious shower with an additional hand held one which was a fantastically useful gorgeous complimentary toiletries with everything you could possibly need in the event you forget anything hairdryer robes and slippers too towels and beds changed daily room was immaculate did watch much tv but radio had an ipod docking station that was handy to listen to our own playlists now to the breakfasts wow what a choice and so beautifully presented too eggs cooked to your choice with plenty of hot sides,1
2668,very nice hotel with beautifully refurbished and clean rooms friendly and helpful staff located in the center of barcelona bus stop to get to the airport just around the corner and pivot point for public transportation right in front of the hotel,1
2669,we arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight and were offered water juice or cava sparkling wine when we arrived we lounged at the pool until our rooms were ready the rooms were very nice and the hotel is very centrally located many taxi drivers did not know the hotel but we could direct them to placa catalunya and it was only a block away the staff were very accommodating and left us chocolates and wine in our room that first night,1
2670,once again we have stayed in an hotel this time being the metropolitan and i cant praise it enough the hotel was very stylish and immaculately clean with lovely pools offering sun both in the morning and late afternoon offering peaceful tranquility in a bustling of the staff that we saw were very friendly and polite and always available to offer any advise you are looking for a hotel in barcelona in a great central location look no further,1
2671,great relaxing hotel in great location with super staff we were greeted on arrival by simone who very pleasantly sorted out a confusion with our booking while we were seated for check in we were offered by directed us to one of the best tapas bars in barcelona that just happens to be was very helpful in assiduously arranging a hospital appointment for my hotel has a bar pool on ground floor and a rooftop plunge pool that was just spot for on for a few hours of had a lovely lunch in the bar and some great relaxing down time in the hotel we definitely plan to stay here again,1
2672,simply the most spectacular place to stay in barcelona the staff went above and beyond to make my stay one of the most memorable experiences of my lifetime the hotel is exquisite i staff was attentive and really anticipated my every need during my stay if you want to experience luxury and amazing service stay at the cotton house the food was excellent and next time i find myself in barcelona the cotton house is the place to you cotton house staff you guys are simply the very best,1
2674,my boyfriend and i stayed at the cotton house for two nights at the end of our trip to spain not only is it decorated impeccably but the building itself is a work of art and i really appreciate how the hotel focused the design around the architecture instead of trying to change the building to fit their intended design the bar area on the patio is lovely and a welcome reprieve from the busy city as is the roof top pool i loved this hotel and hope to stay here again the next time i in barcelona,1
2675,i loved the cotton house it is very surprising when you get to a hotel and a doorman opens the cab door and takes care of your luggage and offers you water and sweets while you wait to check in and he asks you about your trip and everyone is so nice and they take care of you and when you get to the room you ca believe your eyes because everything in the room is so gorgeous ans there a room separately for the shower and the bath tub and another one for the toilet and the room is so modern but at the same time you are on a building that has a whole history behind it that how you will feel at the cotton house it so lovely and gorgeous and i out of words,1
2676,a warm welcome awaits from the enthusiastic young team who will do their best to make sure you enjoy your stay this beautifully restored building the former cotton exchange makes for a perfect stay in the heart of the bustling city exploring the delights of barcelona are easily done from this central location with lots of advice on hand comfortable well appointed rooms with my favorite ortega bath products and super comfy beds make for a good nights sleep not before a delicious cocktail or two followed by dinner on the terrace breakfast is served in charming surroundings of old world colonial charm with memories of of the former cotton trade a bespoke shirt making service is available to guests an added bonus after a hot day of sightseeing is a dip in the rooftop pool a perfect spot for a weekend city break,1
2678,a beautiful hotel in a great location delicious food and staff anxious to please we would certainly stay here again the decor is what i imagine a hotel in india might feel like we upgraded and had a courtyard room lovely atmosphere,1
2679,this is obviously not a cheap hotel but it is definitely worth the money the location of the hotel is great you are within walking distance of all the main city attractions the hotel rooms are modern and luxurious the grounds are beautiful and well kept and the staff was extremely helpful and welcoming the reception manager juan is an asset to this hotel it was almost am when we and we were very beyond hungry juan took the time to help us find a restaurant close by that was still open on a week night when we came back from dinner he offered us a free bottle of cava and desert to take to our room we would definitely stay here again and will continue to tell anyone we know to stay here,1
2680,the staff is incredible at this small boutique hotel my two nights here were very enjoyable the main floor is spectacular with sitting rooms a library area restaurant and terrace the breakfast buffet was delicious and sitting outside for a nightcap on the terrace is highly decor and furnishings of the public rooms really stand out there are examples of fabrics products and ledgers from the building previous incarnation as a club for textile suppliers and tailors even though my room was on the fifth floor i usually took the spiral staircase up and down so as to soak in the sights of the spherical lanterns and the rest of the building there is a very small fitness area on the top floor adjacent to the deck and pool the latter is tiny and is really just for immersion rather than swimming unless you have it to yourself views over the busy street include various hills and highlights of barcelona such as the tops of the towers of la sagrada familia rooms are small and the decorations are simple in a stark white the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom amenities fantastic my only complaint is that i asked for a room away from the street but did not receive one even though there are windows i could still hear the traffic below,1
2681,first time staying at an autograph collection hotel we loved the personal attention and luxurious hospitality hotel is within walking distance of both the neighborhood gothic quarter and born neighborhoods easy walking distance to great shopping hotel is very comfortable super luxury bed and bath concierge and staff friendly and helpful,1
2682,a step back in time but with all the modern features swanky hotel with great staff classy breakfast topped off with an elegant evening menu the rooms vary in size but come with only the best cotton linens and towels makes you want to take some home and you can buy them if you want located one block from the main shopping and dining district three blocks from gaudi home and just a stroll from the sagrada familia or the wharf district an international staff that takes care of all your needs a little pricey at times but well worth the expense,1
2683,overall this is a gorgeous hotel with great designs and furnishings the rooftop pool is a nice touch and you can see the sagrada familia off in the distance while the hotel was impressive on the inside and service was great upon arrival we felt the service was a bit lackluster for the remainder of our stay for the price point i believe better value can be found elsewhere,1
2684,historical building that used to house the cotton merchantss association thus the name afterwards it was a private residence renovation and conversion to a hotel was done tastefully and kept many of the original features such as ceilings and floors we were very well received given a very good corner room and attended to whenever we needed tips for trips tourist attractions etc breakfast is really good with good choices,1
2685,this quaint hotel is in an easily accessible area for the subway or taxis the architecture is absolutely gorgeous and has been restored beautifully the rooms are a bit small but well done the outdoor patio for dinner was a real treat never got to use the rooftop pool as we were so busy but it was lovely great views great staff very helpful,1
2686,as a lifetime platinum member my fianc√© i search out marriott hotels unfortunately he made the reservation so my platinum lifetime status was not honored he is a gold member and we did get a room upgrade so everybody was very accommodating in that respect why we loved this hotel glasses of champagne and a little chocolates i downed two glasses before we went upstairs no one rolled their eyes when i came down on a regular basis to take more in the room know us soap bath gel bath salts and lotion in the down service and complimentary waters every day we had a lovely view overlooking the outside terrace and bar below us took advantage of the pool on the sixth floor very small but water temperature was perfect and the lounge chairs were great and the towels fluffy large service by the staff are only request it was not honored was that we needed a lint brush for my fianc√© pants and the concierge was unable to find one a recommendation have one available service at the outside bar where we enjoyed a bottle of cava and a bottle of delicious spanish white complimentary potato chips which we devoured as well complained on trip advisor about their breakfast was just mean the food choices quality and quantity were everything we wanted was available plus desserts desserts for breakfast we thought the location was outstanding and the hotel is spectacular we would stay here again,1
2687,rooms are good but small during my visit i had multiple cases of mistakes in service and not professional handling of claims i got my room only pm wrong luggage was brought to my room waiters forgot my order in restaurant and they over charged me from my credit card from rooms star staff in a star hotel,0
2688,we loved this hotel it was in a perfect location just a minute walk from the ocean and minutes from las ramblas there tons of restaurants around and the neighborhood is charming i very glad that we stayed here instead of the the cotton house was charming and it actually felt like being in barcelona not a glass were very nice the showers were huge and cotton amenities were provided living up to the hotel name the were beautifully decorated with star service there history to the hotel as well cotton was used here for textiles and the library was beautiful their specialty cocktails were very good and the breakfast buffet was a great continental breakfast that included mint water and green juices the pool was on the terrace with a view of sagrada familia it was a small pool though and the fitness room was small as well i would highly recommend the cotton house and i stay here again,1
2689,part of the autograph collection of marriott boutique and unique hotels this is a terrific option in the eixchample neighborhood the building was a commercial property that was beautifully renovated to a hotel but kept much of the old world charm and architectural integrity of the building excellent staff at the front desk and we used marriott points for two rooms and agreed to pay a per day upcharge for the cotton king room these rooms are larger than the base madras rooms which must be very small there is a beautiful roof deck with pool and bar with a view of the city including the sagrada de famiglia the hotel is within walking distance to the la rambla el born and many other neighborhoods our favorite meals were at el national a cool food hall we also liked tapeo in the born neighborhood for tapas there is a good italian restaurant very close to the hotel called luigi if you need a break from tapas the only thing i did not like was the gym it very small otherwise i really enjoyed staying at this very unique and original hotel i also recommend using barcelona day tours for sightseeing options,1
2690,i made a reservation for my birthday for my daughter and my self with beds the room was ready so i went to the pool deck i asked the pool attendant for sunscreen she gave me her own because the hotel did provide her with any i asked to call down to see if my room was available she said there was no phone that she had to use her own cell phone she told me she was an intern she was very sweet but very inexperienced it turned out that the staff were temporarily interns when i got my room it was the size of a postage stamp there was only one bed i had a cold and when i complained they told me there was no other room available they said that they never guarantee how many beds the room was so tiny we cold not fit a roll away in it the staff was sweet but were not honest in meeting our needs on top of that my daughters watch went missing never to be found do stay at this hotel,0
2691,we spent one night at cotton house to fit in a quick visit to barcelona before boarding a mediterranean cruise what a jewel the property is in a converted house think rockefeller mansion that later became headquarters for a cotton trading company hence the name rooms are small as expected in europe but beautifully appointed we lacked for nothing my wife especially enjoyed the light fragrance that permeates the hotel it is made from cotton hotel staff was extremely gracious and helpful we were offered a drink upon arrival and checkin was efficient they offered us a quick tour of the hotel which was fascinating during the tour our bags were delivered to our room which was on the top breakfast buffet was outstanding the staff was very attentive and the food was delicious and do miss the marshmallows in the location is fantastic for visiting the city we will certainly be back to the cotton house,1
2692,my husband and i stayed at europark hotel for nights the staff were all lovely and incredibly helpful the room was larger than i expected and it had a true king bed it a little removed from the business of la rambla but it only a short walk over there and is also very close to la sagrada familia the reception desk had great restaurant recommendations and provided great maps with helpful and clear directions the breakfast was lovely and very convenient for days where you have an early start we relaxed in the evenings by the pool which is small but there was always seating and we never felt like it was too crowded,1
2693,i loved the charm of this hotel it felt modern and up to date the room was very clean and comfortable i was very impressed with the breakfast and loved the donuts the staff was friendly and helpful ca wait to return on my next stay to barcelona,1
2694,the europark hotel is the best option to stay at in barcelona the room was amazing breakfast was delicious it very well situated and the people were extremely nice specially the manager amazing,1
2695,loved this hotel great location minute stroll from passage de gracia minutes from la ramblas hotel was spotlessly clean very tastefully decorated and the staff very helpful we booked breakfast the selection was huge but enough for a decent start to the day when returning to barcelona will definitely return to hotel europark,1
2696,stayed here in march this was supposed to be a three night stay but my wife uncle became very ill and had to return after one night spoke to hotel and even though it was booked through voyage prive they informed us they would happily refund the two nights we were not going to be there they were very sympathetic and very considerate this is a sign of a hotel that really cares the towels we had were new and so a lot of the fluff came off onto my black jeans but hotel stepped in and were willing to get them washed but i requested a flint roller and this removed the fluff so this was great service on the afternoon of us leaving we discovered how central the hotel was all you have to do is walk out hotel and walk to the right for minutes and you are in central barcelona amazing laughed when we discovered this as we had been using the metro before to get to the centre manager we spoke to when we were leaving was a very friendly lady if we go back to barcelona we will definitely want to stay again as rooms are clean and modern definitely worth staying here people,1
2698,booked a superior room for our wedding anniversary with request for quiet room on high floor we were given room at back on floor and it was perfect very large king size bed and small terrace which got the afternoon and evening sun the hotel staff were very pleasant and the service was excellent location just perfect for us being near to the david bowie is exhibition local bars restaurants and metro hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of cava to help us celebrate our anniversary which was a lovely unexpected personal touch breakfast very good and worth the extra to purchase this it certainly kept us going until dinner time would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to family and friends,1
2699,we stayed nights in this hotel in barcelona from the to the as a family with kids in rooms everything was very clean breakfast very good and the hotel staff very friendly and bit far from the big shopping area or the harbour km but the metro is very close and with the support of the reception we managed to reach all destinations with the metro hotel to recommend and we will go back for certain,1
2700,stayed for three nights room clean and comfortable toiletries kettle and towels for the pool included in the room together with the best hotel hairdryer i ever had did have breakfast as i thought per person per day was too much instead had lovely croissants in the local were friendly and helpful with good recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to eat our thanks to lucia who recommended a great restaurant on our first night pool small but very pleasant hotel is situated in the centre of barcelona so is perfect for getting to all the major tourist attractions would recommend this hotel,1
2701,great easy to walk to most really helpful staff on reception with suggestions stylish on roof great bonus for end of busy day sightseeing good breakfast,1
2702,we stayed at the europark from june through july the room was charming and comfortable we never heard any internal or outside noise the location was excellent we walked to many sights and used the metro several desk people gave excellent directions as well as suggestions for dinners we loved bethem nine and la rita,1
2703,this was my first time in barcelona spain and did know what to expect this hotel was a modern boutique hotel that met all my expectations and then some i was very impressed the staff and management were all very friendly and accommodating they also serve an amazing breakfast selection that is included with your room i would stay here again on my next visit and would recommend it to anyone who is traveling to barcelona,1

2707,my stay was wonderful from start to finish the service was unmatched the pool is small but perfect for afternoon lounging room was cozy but clean and comfortable and the location is great for accessing everything you need in barcelona would happily stay here again,1
2708,very nice hotel the locate is a little far from the sites so be prepared to walk i was surprised how dead the neighborhood was after it has a cute pool on the roof deck but it was to chilling for a swim,1
2709,the hotel itself has a good centralized location and is within walking distance of anything you want to see in downtown barcelona the rooms were clean and very modern the front desk staff were truly the best lucia and marc were both incredibly helpful and gave fantastic recommendations for things to do and places to eat,1
2710,location very good less than a minute walk to ramblas segrada familia and gauti house metro was nearby room we were on the ground floor and had a nice patio the shower was indescribably powerful it was like a gas powered pressure common areas chic hotel many attractions in spain require you to get your tickets in advance and they provided access to a computer and printer to help accommodate that the pool is small and very very shallow like feet shallow it was nice to be on the rooftop and put your feet in as needed but do expect to get a workout easily a star hotel and they were very friendly i went for my birthday and during the whole trip it was the only establishment that recognized it was my birthday and provided a free bottle of cava,1
2711,we were a family of travelling with a one year old so finding a place was very important while i would consider this place to be a family hotel in the sense that there are a lot of activities if you have young children they provided such great amenities for our baby that the stay was extremely comfortable and relaxing we arrived really late close to midnight and were still able to check in with a portable crib already set up and ready to go for our son it was the cutest crib too by the way in the style of bus our son slept so well in it as did we because those blackout shades are amazing they also provided extra towels and baby bathtub and baby bath kit for us which was great the room was comfortable with a king bed water kettle which came in handy for making our son meals and a nice quiet balcony overlooking the courtyard the entire balcony was encased in glass so our son really enjoyed waddling out there to look outside and eat his breakfast they even provided swim towels for use at the pool which was really nice my husband got to go and enjoy the pool on the roof and really enjoyed having drinks and getting ice cream on such a warm day the staff were really nice responsive and helpful when we had questions or requests and were very accomodating to our needs as we were travelling with,1
2712,i glad i chose europark hotel room was really lovely and very clean i especially pleased with the rest zone with outside pool and terrace hotel service was great and very helpful when i visit barcelona again i will definitely choose same place,1
2713,very nice boutique hotel with friendly staff and good breakfast and pool area on the roof bad we did have a room facing the street with a big next liked our stay a lot,1
2714,well what can i say the reviews of this hotel dont lie its great from start to finish ahhh be warned the taxi from el prat airport to the ohla is about eur however the taxi drivers add on a eur to eur tip or charge on top be warned factor in ok back to the hotel we stayed in a junior suite however it was effortless the reception staff are excellent on the ball when entering the room is clean spacious and the bed was ernomous however be warned there is a huge bit of glass separating the room from the bathroom so if you not comfortable in being erhum in the nude in front of your loved one then this hotel might not be the one for you in the bathroom you have a walking in wet room shower and a bath the toilet its behind or adjacent to the front door took me minutes to find it i thought we been burgled and some strange weirdo had nicked the karzee it had everything be warned the air con is fresh it works really well flat screen tv is temperamental but the late night bed fold down service is great too my girlfriend loved the chocolates they popped on the pillow as we returned from our night out overall you be hard pushed to find a better hotel the pool area on the floor get there early to avoid disappointment there are only bean bag sun loungers which,1
2715,the room was clean nothing like the picture the pool is small what you see is what you get for a star hotel we made reservation for hotels bucks they were going to give us a discount for to return to the airport i ask a cab driver what he charged to get to the airport tourist trap i had the garden view which overlooked plants that people grew on their patio renovation for apartments and workers looking in the window thanks booking,0
2716,we chose this hotel over many others given the great reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed location was fab a short walk from the main centre attractions travelled from the airport using the train and metro which cost pp received a warm greeting with a cold glass of cava room was clean and tidy and very modern pool area is small but what we expected given city centre location staff were excellent and keen to help with area to sunbathe if beds were taken concierge service excellent my only criticism would be the the cost of the drinks for a small glass of coke and for cocktails would certainly stay again,1
2717,hotel stay was very good with helpful staff the location is great mn walk from main attractions the room was cosy and nice breakfast was really good and will get you going for a good chunk of the day,1
2718,really nice hotel with a lovely breakfast and really nice room service food from the room service was cheap and delicious staff could have been nicer easily one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in,1
2719,we stayed nights in this hotel in july this year and everything was just perfect we booked barcelona penthouse and we highly recommended it it is located on the floor with a great terrace facing the main street but also the sea very clean with nice furniture excellent bed and pillows and a large bathroom with everything you need complimentary bottled water and kettle very good coffe every day each evening when we arrived on our room we were surprised with fresh flowers delicious chocolates bonbons or cookies and in our last day with a chilled bottle of cava breakfast was also very good and plentiful staff was very polite and helpful with good recomandantion for restaurants to eat nearby the hotel ex betlem restaurant min walk from the hotel hotel pool is located on the floor and the restaurant on the good location for visiting barcelona we highly recommend this hotel,1
2720,this was a great place our room was on the floor and we had a view of the mediterranean and city the room was spacious and had all the amenities i did note in both hotels we stayed in that they did not supply face cloths in barcelona i do know what the reason is we were about a min walk from the pier so the location was good we had breakfast each morning which was excellent,1
2721,we had a fantastic stay at the europark hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was lovely and clean the decor inside the hotel is beautiful and the roof terrace with the swimming pool is a really lovely area,1
2722,i stayed here with a friend for nights this summer i have previously stayed at the serras which is also an exceptional hotel nearer the marina but i would say the ohla in eixample is very much in the same league the property service and location are all the hotel is modern clean and the room design excellent the pool on the top floor is also a great never feeling too crowded and again attentive service the concierge assisted us with etc with ease the location is great far enough away from the bottom end of las ramblas but instead situated at the top of the more chic shopping district i would recommend this hotel without exception,1
2723,i have been travelling several times to barcelona for work and stayed at the ohla eixample hotel the rooms are nicely decorated bright clean and provide everything needed for a comfortable stay like daily changed water bottles bathroom accessories service is exceptional and welcoming providing a nice environment when working abroad the level of service is important to me due to the numerous business trips the hotel offers as well two bars and a restaurant with tasty food or even an alternative working spot for long working days the common areas as the gym and outdoor pool enable all needed facilities under one really recommend this hotel and lloking forward to continue being its guest,1
2724,excellent small star hotel in eixample away from the bustle of las ramblas but still close to great shopping and restaurants we had a twin and a double room which were very modern beds really comfortable the pool area on the floor is great but can get quite busy with limited number of lounge beds nice bar adjacent to pool which serves cocktails and simple snacks and bar food staff were excellent late checkout for one room at was no trouble would definitely come back,1
2725,great hotel only negatives were they lost a bag and failed to put it in the taxi or find it imagine the cleaners binned it and that the blinds did work other than that great food and rooftop bar would stay again,1
2726,my wife and i stayed two nights at the ohla eixample and july took the aerobus from the airport to placa de catalunya and from there the hotel is a pleasant minute walk straight up rambla de catalunya before taking the last left onto carrer de corsega before you hit avinguda diagonal you can get there on public transport as well but if you do have a lot of luggage i recommend the was a breeze and while we were there i heard the staff speaking to guests in german and italian as well as english and rooms the whole hotel in fact is tastefully decorated to a very high standard with lots of nice little touches like built in usb chargers beside the desk a discreet room safe with an integral power socket so you can leave your ipad or laptop in the safe and charge it at the same time and room lights with levels that you can control from either side of the bed the hotel offers free but not terribly fast as well as an ethernet connection in the did make use of the lobby bar or the restaurant but we did spend the last couple of hours before our flight home on the roof terrace where they really have made the most of the space available with a pool and sun loungers cafe seating and a fully stocked bar we ordered a burger and a club sandwich while we were here and both were freshly,1
2727,stayed here for nights for my wife birthday had a junior suite which was lovely very nice hotel in a great location nice and quiet but still near the shops etc great breakfast and friendly attentive staff will definitely be going back,1
2728,we had a wonderful time at the ohla eixample the service was outstanding our room was spacious the bed was super comfortable the bathroom was large and the shower was awesome we loved the rooftop pool and how peaceful it was great location would definitely return,1
2729,ohla eixample is very well located and close to the shopping district the decor is very modern and interesting the rooms had all the amenities and very comfortable beds the breakfast options could be improved as they were quite repetitive after a few days,1
2730,we stayed at the hotel for five days with our two teenage kids the rooms were a bit cold and the beds not that comfertable that we would expect in a star hotel anyway we loved the area and the location was breakfast and excellent service performed by the staff,1
2731,we spent nights in barcelona stayed in ohla exiample hotel it starts with a perfect opening by offering cava to us when we walked in on a hot day the staff were really helpful and friendly rooms are service was multiple times a day to keep it very clean this is the perfect place to stay short or long in barcelona surrounded by multiple shops cafe closer to many place of interests the roof swimming pool was really great i enjoyed quiet and sunny morning swimming a lot,1
2732,the hotel is extremely professionally run and modern staff are very attentive and we loved the fact it not a chain or a huge hotel the pool is on the rooftop and quite large in comparison to other barcelona hotels we thoroughly enjoyed our time here the only down side would be it a tiny bit further out this may not be ideal for those who like to be central,1
2733,our stay at ohla eixample was an absolute delight spacious rooms and bathrooms with all essential amenities great service as well with an extremely helpful concierge that helped us with reservations tapas recommendations ticket bookings et all the hotel is brilliantly located with plenty of nearby shopping and eating options highly recommended and will definitely stay here again,1
2734,spent two nights at this hotelin barcelona great hotel very good service infinity pool on the top of the building very good breakfast amazing coffee we where welcomed with cava as a welcome will be back,1
2735,last night in a month long trip to spain and portugal so we stayed at ohla eixample after sampling ohla barcelona earlier in our visit the eixample ohla was truly outstanding the room was great the staff were friendly and professional and the xerta resaurant was sensational this is an excellent hotel,1
2736,we had a fantastic stay the staff could not do enough for us on our last day after checkout we asked to swim somewhere as their pool was being cleaned they paid for a taxi for us to go and swim at one of their sister properties what service would highly recommend we rented a scooter from cooltra away this was the best decision of our stay as we saw so much of the city,1
2737,stayed here recently for one night as i was in town on business great hotel friendly staff bed was perfect great wifi and fantastic location there is also a roof top pool with a bar that had great views of the port,1
2738,after reading hundreds of barcelona hotel reviews my wife and i decided to stay at the port vell in july prior to our cruise we arrived a few hours before time but the front desk staff got us and were extremely helpful and friendly we stayed in room on second floor with a view of the harbour the room was clean and comfortable with a nice view the furnishings are more modern not the traditional hotel style furniture at night we could hear the traffic but that did not bother us or keep us awake at night hotel location is great close to shopping and restaurants all with walking distance with a bus stop just across the street when i booked the hotel i told them that they were the start of our wedding anniversary vacation and hoped we could have a room with a nice view we not only got that but on the first night the hotel delivered to us a complementary bottle of wine with chocolate covered strawberries and a slice of chocolate cake totally unexpected and a really nice touch of class by this wife and i are very selective about the quality of hotels we stay at only star or higher the port vell has a star rating and is definitely that or slightly higher the only con we had was the price of the buffet breakfast euro each with limited selection we ate there the first morning but i would recommend walking to one,1
2739,arrived late at night after a long delay greeted warmly with a glass of fizz room was lovely with a view of the port good quality toiletries provided replenished daily great location for all the sights rooftop sun area with bar plunge pool was lovely to come back to late afternoon each day,1
2740,this is our fourth stay so we clearly hooked the location is excellent at the top of the harbour and close to to the gothic quartet making everywhere accessible on foot by metro or bus everyone here is unfailingly friendly and helpful the rooms are spacious and comfortable with a fabulous rain shower and effective air conditioning the rooftop terrace is a delightful oasis with a plunge pool bar and plenty of all types of seating the breakfast menu is wide and varied with a huge range of cooked and cold foods from cereal cold meats and cheese to cava and delicious spanish eggs this is a really lovely hotel,1
2741,beautiful hotel we stayed in room and view was amazing staff ca do enough very friendly roof top terrace is beautiful with the added benefit of a plunge pool to help keep you cool minutes from fab bars and restaurants would recommend la cala food is excellent would definitely stay here again,1
2742,fantastic location fantastic staff and fantastic hotel we stayed at this hotel for our anniversary and is a fantastic place we would recommend and will definitely be going back breakfast was great and had lots of choice fantastic weekend break,1
2743,we had a weekend getaway in bcn it was the first time we stayed in this hotel the location is just great right in the center very close to everything minutes walk to the beach the hotel is quite stylish from hotel lobby to room interior it has a nespreso coffee machine in the room we just love it hotel staff are very attentive and friendly we really feel that we are welcome here i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who visit bcn,1
2744,amazing location the rooftop is a brilliant addition views overlooking the harbour while you sit with a cocktail in the sunshine next to the pool great for a drink after dinner as well rooms are nice and clean even the rooms looking into the courtyard are good if you are too fussed about a view,1
2745,port veil looks from the outside like most old buildings in central barcelona nice but not exciting now getting inside of this hotel you re welcomed with something very different a very modern and pleases design very service oriented staff just as elegant hotel room as the rest of the interior and then the roof terrace with bar pool and a great view towards the mediterranean,1
2746,we chose a room with a harbor view it was lovely it had a juliette balcony which was something i did quite see from the website i thought we be able to sit outside my dislikes of the room were minor it wad a poorly lit bathroom and was lacking conveniences like an electrical outlet in the bathroom also lacking a waste bin by the sink good shower though the coffee maker in the room made good coffee and we were supplied complimentary bottled water daily the hotel is well located close to barri gothic and el born easy walk to metro stop the staff at reception was friendly welcomed us with a glass of cava,1
2747,stayed with two sons i made a mistake when booked only one room these rooms can not fit three and after a long trip we came from san francisco i was exhausted and very frustrated when found out that we do have a place to get some rest two guys at the front desk did such incredible job offered me an option to cancel at no cost despite hotel policy of hours no cancellation fee if i find another hotel as well as offered another room with a good discount i decided to stay and boy i did regret fantastic location with everything around the corner beach aquarium restaurants min walk to the old city taxi spot right by the hotel etc plenty of food choices nearby recommendation though breakfast at the hotel is pretty good i highly recommend to explore options nearby i recommend starting with mr robinson cocktails food min walk dinner a restaurant in the museum across the street is amazing if you like meat,1
2748,i had read great reviews so had high expectations and these were exceeded the hotel is modern and clean with beautiful decor the roof terrace bar was a welcome first stop before heading out of the hotel to explore the location is great so it was an ideal location to explore all the staff were friendly and helpful which always makes a stay do normally score hotels highly on trip adviser but this one deserved it,1
2749,this hotel is the perfect location for tourists with limited time in the city it beside restaurants shopping souvenir shops bus to hotel and its rooms are very staff are professionally friendly all hygiene factors for this hotel have been ticked i ca find a flaw to it it just needs to serve with a heart the staff are professional and functional but lacks the warmth and inherent sincerity that creates an emotional to a staff by the name of christian who helped us bring our pcs of luggage from the hotel to the bus station all taxis went on strike on the day of our departure although he was instructed to assist us he nevertheless went out of his way to ask the police for information on which roads were accessible some were closed due to the demonstration and which stops the airport buses are going to arrive at,1
2750,having read the ta reviews i made sure to get a room at the back ended up with which was fine on small size but fantastically comfortable bed and nicely decorated baffling was finding the ac control in the closet who a thought my partner loved the blue bottles of water for guests she collected a set and brought them home but a work colleague got a room backing onto the elevator had to move due to noise another was looking onto la rambla on level i think and also complained of noise the rooftop restaurant is so worth the small premium holy cow how much beautiful food did they bring out we went twice being gluttons for punishment at night the view is great but the bar is barely adequate no expertise in cocktails given the near proximity of excellent bars without the view head to somewhere like bar negroni for a much better and cheaper experience,1
2751,on june we had a reservation for people fo rthe rooftop at la isabela we received a confirmation for this reservation this was for a surprise birthday two of us arrived with them stating that there was no reservation and we could not come in i showed them our reservation and they stated you need a second he also advised that he did not have the staff to manage a group of people and continued to be very rude to us the attitude of the manager was completely unacceptable i advised him that we had people arriving and i expected a table within min to be ready he continued to give me a hard time at which time i advised that this was not acceptable customer service considering i had been there multiple times prior with clients and employees i had never received such ignorant behaviour after a lengthy discussion and my continued damand for a table they proceeded to set up a location for us in the meantime we had guests arriving and downstairs at the elevator they were informed they were not allowed to come up as they did not have a reservation first i will never come back to again and i will ensure i will recommend anyone against this hotel i do not have the managers name however this was the afternoon of june,0
2752,sheer luxus we have to experience this hotel once more and more and more best of all was the serviceminded attitude and friendliness of the staff the room were clean and bed comfortable nearly as the one at home and the bathroom shiny and clean breakfast among the best we have experienced at any hotel last but not least has the finest roof terrace and restaurant i attended so far,1
2753,overall the hotel is tremendous i did not give a for a couple of reasons the front desk staff is not very friendly and in particular francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out overall that did not affect our experience much but it is something they could work on none the less also the housekeeping staff was very pleasant but only of days did we have turndown service which again not a big deal but is part of the price also two of the days we returned from our long day outside the room and at it had not been made up this was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room all day everyday yet our room is last i tip the cleaning service everyday so it could not be that it probably explains our difficulty on the first day we got there at and asked if early checkin was possible the woman at the desk said the cleaning people are outside your room now so it should be an hour or less well we came back in an hour and a half still not done this was the time she reminded us in a teachy condescending way that time is uh we know you told us we could check in earlier so we left and came back at around still not done this is when francesc mansplained that the check in time was so we knew that,1
2754,good pool area and the spa was excellent friendly staff good hotel would stay there again clean close to the port and shops great restaurants all in walking distance buses and taxi are easy to catch train stations is a minute walk most off the attractions are in walking distance,1
2755,amazing hotel staff and location value for your money it is very quite and relaxing although located on the ramblas the bed and pillows were amazing and had the best night sleep in a hotel ever the staff is very friendly and speak perfect english facilities are great and they inform you about every possibility twice a day cleaning on arrival complimentary fruit basket only thing missing is a shower is the only minor point i can think of,1
2757,my husband and i stayed at hotel for nights in june we both loved this hotel here some highlights staff very accommodating helped with restaurants museums and tours but a bit surprised they do have a conciergelobby area spacious and elegantlocation perfect area right on las ramblas within walking distance to many great restaurants short walk to the gothic quarter minute walk to the waterfrontrooms stayed in one of the least expensive rooms available the classic it was larger than many rooms we had throughout europe great bed and pillows nice wood floors marble bathroom big window faced an interior courtyard nice and quiet restaurant only ate there for breakfast which was included with our room excellent variety of dishes eggs cooked to orderrooftop bar and pool a nice touch lots of lounging sofas beautiful view of the city spa area what a treat an oasis on the basement level had an indoor pool usually i do like indoor pools this one was really nice very with a nice atmosphere steam room and sauna and small workout room did have any spa treatments but my husband used the workout room and we both swam and used the steam room every single day so relaxing and a nice way to end a bust day of sightseeing,1
2758,rude staff no care or thought put into service or treatment of guests versus bar customers i saw sat in the back corner of the terracing facing a wall while many other tables were open no flexibilty of reception to do late check out maid singing loudly in hallway no latenoght room service even for ice or water tv did work well no help with taxi outside restaurant food improperly cooked and service slow,0
2759,we stayed here for one night in november for my birthday a surprise from my partner it was perfect amazing location right in the heart of las ramblas the rooftop pool and bar is gorgeous giving great views of parts of the room was nice with a big bed and a lovely bathroom not the biggest room i ever seen but more than big enough the staff were friendly and helpful offering us tips and advice for restaurants and places to return in the future,1
2760,absolutely loved this hotel location perfect central hub on the bustling la rambla a stones throw from placa de cataluyna and full of energy hotel beautiful colonial decor but in a very contempary chic we booked a privilege room i think it was a great sized corner room overlooking la rambla huge bed and so comfortable bathroom was a very good size and nice powerful terrace stunning my wife and i spent a day on the roof sunbathing and drinking one of the many great cocktails we then met our friends in the evening when they got back from sight seeing was their first time in barcelona but our so we opted out in favour of relaxation and had dinner there too food was exceptional we had a mixture of the menu and shared which was a good way of getting to taste a good really good selection with great each and every member of staff is a credit to the hotel they always smiled said hello asked how we where or how our day concierge and reception staff where exceptional great restaurant recommendations which they managed to get us reservations for last minute and in very busy establishments i will review separately but pla restaurant incredible and canete crazy tapas restaurant with unbelievable food and atmosphere where was all so impressed with everything about it makes it truly worth its stars and more thanks for a great stay,1
2761,our family booked rooms in july and stayed over for nights at hotel to discover barcelona we greatly enjoyed our stay at hotel the location is perfect we could easily walk to most places of interest and find restaurants walking distance the children loved going to the pool after a long day out and about to relax and cool down the rooftop bar had wonderful vistas the staff was really welcoming and knowledgeable nice lounge area fantastic spa the hotel is very well maintained and very clean on our last day we were treated to a gothic quarter free tour by the hotel which was really interesting only downside was getting a bit of street noise since it is in a lively area overall we would highly recommend this hotel and would love to come back ourselves,1
2762,i do know where to just love everything about this hotel the decoration is absolutely amazing a colonial touch the wood is everywhere the lobby is just beautiful the sofas are room was just spot very friendly and helpful breakfast was just great u can sip a cocktail in the rooftop while watching barcelona by see i really enjoyed my stay in i really want to go back there soon,1
2763,we love this hotel it is stylish the staff are great the location on las ramblas could be better the rooms are extremely comfortable especially the pillows and there is a lovely pool and rooftop bar what not to like,1
2764,this is an elegantly comfortable was understated yet a psychic courtyard haven from the bustling and centrally located blvd las ramblass sic the staff were particularly wonderful and truly sign of a very fine management team we have free breakfasts in our travel agents packet and it was the finest breakfast we have had in europe wifi was made traveling with computers iphones and ipads particularly dining room staff is amazing but for those who rush out early there is a starbucks on the corner and a very fine bar and grill on the same corner highly recommend this hotel it near the market and walking distance to treasures like el naionelmy husband came earlier for a conference and we were upgraded for the duration of our stay with a deluxe perfectly appointed and well run pools that our grandkids enjoyed and a beautiful rooftop terrace bar that had very tasty offerings and fabulous non alcoholic drinks that were very refreshing at the full service bar,1
2765,easy walking distance to many interesting spots in gothic section of city friendly helpful staff and comfortable rooms make this hotel a winner not able to take advantage of the spa but will try on my next visit,1
2766,we stayed here for a week following time in lisbon and porto portugal in september we were in barcelona during la merce just by chance we were unaware of this festival at the time we booked our trip a year earlier the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very nice we thoroughly enjoyed ending our day with a nightcap at the rooftop lounge view were spectacular and we loved the vibe we did eat here one evening and the food was tasty as well the one and only downfall was the hotel is over the underground train and it definitely shakes the hotel we did have to change our room after the first day or two and it was much better i have to say despite this we would definitely stay here again,1
2767,my partner and i booked this hotel a couple of months ago on expedia we both agree it was an absolute steal beautiful rooms very lovely staff amazing roof terrace and pool we felt very lucky staying here and if made our holiday even more special can not recommend this city and this hotel enough and definitely book to have the breakfast on the roof terrace one morning it made for an exceptional final morning in this glorious city,1
2769,we absolutely loved this hotel but first i want to talk about the staff who went above and beyond to make this trip great at check in we mentioned to monika that we were traveling for my husbands birthday so they upgraded us to a room with a great view of las ramblas we arrived a little before expecting to store our bags and return at to check in monika said they could have the room ready in a half an hour so we left our bags and took a walk through the neighborhood when we returned our bags were already in our room and it was ready to go is there anything better after a long flight that an amazing shower well this hotel has the perfect shower although the bed looked inviting at that point barcelona awaited monika had annotated a map for us to get our bearings it was so helpful so we headed off by the time we returned to the hotel almost hours later we we so ready to enjoy a long sleep in the hotel amazing bed the curtains are blackout and the lighting is completely adjustable so we slept in until almost am the hotel is extremely quiet despite being right where the action is the next afternoon we spent on the rooftop deck using the pool and having cava and snacks lounging on the bali beds on the roof great views and yummy food especially the tapas we also utilized the pool,1
2770,we booked nights at this hotel for our wedding anniversary hoping for something hotel was perfect booked a terrace room which is very stylish and the terrace is very spacious the city the street below has a couple of cafes where street musician work a visit for tapas the hotel room is always very clean tidy having a champagne breakfast on the terrace was pool area is a nice mixed and great for a relaxing afternoon but get there before as most go out in the morning and back for pm plenty of rooftop restuarant is very good also although on the night we booked a table the manager seemed to take a long time to recognise we were waiting smile a little it helps all the other staff are great evening thought after dinner sat and had drinks chilled overall this hotel is perfectly situated to get everywhere in barca and the hotel itself is excellent,1
2772,fabulous hotel not cheap but get what you pay for room was lovely and spacious privilege double and the bed was the most comfortable i ever slept in it was heaven booked direct with hotel and included breakfast in package and so glad we did as the breakfast was the best breakfast i ever had delicious fruits ham cheese cakes hot food cava it was endless the roof top pool was a welcome relief although jammed with guests in the afternoon and you are unlikely to get a bed or chair but does stop you dipping in the pool drinks on rooftop are expensive service at hotel excellent and the lobby areas are beautiful great location as well for all the sights and despite being on the busy las ramblas it was surprisingly quiet in the rooms at night i would definitely stay here again although next time i would bring my own coffee for the room as the nescaf√© cheap offering was pants,1
2773,we were pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hotel late one night after our flight was delayed from paris we were even more surprised when we walked into our room and what a treat after our mediocre hotel experience in paris this hotel is really clean and gorgeous the rooms are cozy but that pretty standard in europe and other big cities the breakfast is also really good the selection is amazing and we really enjoyed everything about our stay here if we return to barcelona anytime soon i would consider this hotel again it was booked through costco,1
2774,incredible staff and beautiful hotel made for a memorable stay the location is perfect to old quarter and la rambla everyone in the hotel treated us special the rooftop pool and bar were well appointed and well run highly recommend,1
2775,stayed at the for three nights in may my wife had been before and enjoyed barcelona and the hotel so we returned together the hotel is very nice we had a standard room and it was great very comfortable hotels roof bar and pool is really cool with some good views we had dinner and breakfast here and the food and service is excellent there is a good vibe in the bar at night time and it seemed popular with the young cool barcelona crowdi would recommend this hotel and also return it is good value for the high standards you receive oh barcelona is quite nice too,1
2776,my partner and i wanted to visit a nice rooftop bar at la ramblas for our anniversary and my birthday we had heard that terraza la isabela was popular as our family members are regular customers at the hotel and we have had many friends that have visited your hotel and we got there we went to the reception at hotel but there was no greeting and the man at the desk did not look up he completely blanked us which was extremely rude we then got his attention and asked where the rooftop bar was located we went towards the lifts and another man asked us what we were doing we said to him we were looking to go to the rooftop bar he then grunted at us then looked me up and down before telling us and putting his hand up in a dismissive manner there was no explanation and i was extremely offended by this we were both dressed appropriately so we were very shocked the service we experienced at this hotel was disgraceful and i would discourage anyone from going here this ruined by birthday and our think the staff at this hotel need to go on a customer service course and learn some manners,0
2777,so in may i was taken on a surprise trip to barcelona by my now husband and we stayed in hotel and this is where he proposed so now fast forward later and we are just married there just over weeks so we thought it would only be right if we went back for our well i just look this place and it will always have a special meaning to me we stayed here for nights and it is even more gorgeous and luxurious than i remember perfect location just step outside the doors to the lively hustle and bustle of la ramblas the roof top bar is a must to quench your thirst while taking in the city view i could have easily sat there all day drinking mojitos they are a bit pricey at but definitely the best in town the staff are so friendly and welcoming they really add to the experience and the breakfast there is no way any one could leave there with an empty stomach as the range they have is unbelievable and champagne for breakfast what more could a girl want already planning on making a visit back to my favourite spot in barcelona,1
2778,we have just had a super restful weekend at the staff are amazing esp the desk staff and at the roof bar nacho in particular is always happy to helpthe breakfast is great although euros each is a large amount starbucks next door seems very popular as does the supermarket the restaurant was delicious for sunday night steak and excellent steak it a location on las ramblas five minute walk to the plaza de son age and myself mid fifties would definitely stay again although would not choose the hotel for the roof pool very few deckchairs and no cover however the spa pool and facilities make up for this enjoyed by both thank you,1
2779,stayed here for a girls weekend and everything was perfect from when we checked in all the staff were super nice and helpful the rooftop pool and bar is beautiful we really enjoyed cocktails and dinner up there highly recommend,1
2780,we have stayed at a number of times now over the past five years and it has always been a pleasure great location great staff great facilities great hotel highly recommended if you are visiting barcelona,1
2781,we are so happy with our stay at everything was great friendly and service minded staff everyone i passed on my way smiled and said hello the spa was amazing a relaxing get away in the hectic city i would also recommend to book a spa appointment they were really good the breakfast is a bit pricy but it was definitely worth it i dream about coming back for another stay thank you for making us feel so welcome,1
2782,the lobby room and amenities are what makes this hotel superb is the personnel who are some of the most competent efficient and courteous front desk staff i ever room was quiet very comfortable and had the most modern finishes the top was an unexpected plus the lower level spa was fun for the kids and adults just a great hotel in a great area of barcelona an equal to fine hotels anywhere in the world,1
2783,a surprise night mid week stay for my husbands significant birthday so i booked this hotel based on its reviews position and general description and was hoping for a bit of decadent luxury in great location got it la rambla is bustling at any time of day or night but step through the doors of the hotel and you enter a large luxurious open lobby with sofas and decor reminiscent of old colonialism in a good way it reflects the building heritage as an old tobacco company staff were very welcoming professional and helpful both at check in and out and for advice on good places to eat and city transport our room on the floor was a classic room and therefore not huge but plenty big enough and decorated in a cool and relaxing style the bed was huuge and i have to say having not been sleeping well of late i had the best nights sleep in a long time i took advice of other reviews and asked for a quiet room which means it faces away from the noise of la rambla the only slight gripe i have is that we seemed to be directly under one of the roof top bar speakers and whilst the music was by no means loud and did at all affect our nights by the time we went to bed it was off the rather monotonous and repetitive music choice did intrude on my siesta yep us over like an afternoon,1
2784,we stayed at this fantastic hotel as part of our anniversary vacation and were extremely satisfied with the front desk staff greeted spoke excellent english and made check in an absolute pleasure they assisted with our questions about the hotel and my wife needed to see an emergency dentist which one of the reception staff even arranged for us i sorry i do recall his name but all the staff were had a balcony room that looked out over the side street below it was fun to do some people watching from the balcony and this even helped with our restaurant selection as we could see the popular places below and chose a few places to eat at just from this room itself was large for european hotels with a really comfortable bed and all the things i choose hotels for strong safe bar fridge kettle and in the room and a hairdryer for my wife the room was pristinely clean and the bathroom was kitted with quality and vanity kit we chose to have breakfast at small restaurants nearby the hotel every morning as there are many and all of them offered a variety of breakfasts that said i sure the hotel breakfasts are probably superior also had some drinks at the rooftop bar a few times and that was awesome to enjoy the views and relaxing hotel is by the busy las ramblas and placa de catalunya so very central and walking distance to all the interesting areas,1
2785,after a not so great experience with go with oh we decided to book in here for a treat and spend the last night as a family group service was impressive from the get go and loved the interior of the hotel that was a luxurious escape from the city hustle loads of options to spend time lounging in and outdoors with two pools a small gym spa and sauna restaurant cafe and bars if you can manage to book a day bed on the roof the view with a cocktail in hand is a worthy one it simply magical to see the sun go down and the city light up the rooms were a little on the small side but the plush beds made up for it great to get a good night sleep the amenities in the room were also great and really appreciated the jug and tea selection in the room as well as bathrobes for lounging one confusion was that the staff opened our door to come in on more than one occasion without knocking which was a little intrusive it happened almost times during our night stay and not sure if this is the norm aside from that i would highly recommend this hotel especially if you want to give yourself a treat and spend it with loved ones barcelona might be beautiful but it also very busy and this was the perfect calm before and after the storm,1
2786,this hotel is lovely a perfect location the rooftop pool and bar had wonderful service and amazing sangrias the bed was comfortable our room had pillow options so my fiance took full advantage the curtains did a great job blocking out the sun when we wanted to sleep in the reception staff was very helpful with proving maps giving directions and making reservations our room had a small balcony that allowed us to stand and people watch over las ramblas the breakfast was wonderful with made to order omlettes and many other offerings including dessert i felt spoiled by the turn down service with chocolates our room was facing las ramblas and at night we could hear some noise from the street but we loved feeling like we were really in the heart of the city,1
2787,the hotel is in a great location it is right by the plaza de catalunya and close distance to la rambla street we joined the viator day tour and it was a short mins to walk to the gathering point musee de la musica and mins from where they left you la pedrera where along the way we did great shopping my son was asking for soccer jersey and if you do want to pay euros for the official stuff then the street vendors on the plaza late at the night is the way to got the room with the swimming pool on the balcony i was a bit disappointed to find out that it was a jacuzzi at first and it was too cold to use it the first day but the day was hot and after a long day it was a good place to wind down at the roof top and chill the key is to use the pool while the sun is still hitting the balcony before in july part that impressed us the most is the customer service by the reception staff there was a taxi strike from to on our last day and we needed to get to the airport at for our early flight the staff suggested cabify at first spain version of uber but my husband was cautious and wanted a plan b lo and behold when we tried cabify at it did work could locate a driver when we talked to,1
2788,we booked a suite for nights and had an amazing time the staff is really polite and pool area is really cool and relaxing and the pool bar is an absolute room has everything you need to keep in shape when away for a few will return for sure,1
2789,chose the olivia balmos primarily for the pool a delightful space in which to relax after busy days extremely friendly staff added to our experience of the hotel the location was perfect we would visit again,1
2790,we stayed at the olivia balmes hotel for the second time and liked it as much as we did the first time this time we stayed in a standard room with a small balcony on the courtyard side of the hotel we could even keep the balcony door open during the night it was so quiet again we were impressed with the high standard of the accommodation the extra friendly staff at reception and in the restaurant and the fantastic buffet breakfast on some mornings we were greeted with a glass of cava first thing what a nice touch,1
2792,returned after a night stay highly recommend this hotel great location room spacious immaculate with comfortable beds loved the pool area lack of beds not a problem as people come and go breakfast great too all in all fab place to stay and the staff really are as good as the reviews on here attentive helpful and thanks for for making our stay great,1
2793,the bed was very comfortable and the room was nicely done in that style that popular nowadays plenty of hot water from the obligatory rain shower head staff were friendly and helpful too did have time to sample breakfast unfortunately so ca comment on that,1
2794,our initial disappointment at a very small and narrow lobby was quickly replaced at the delight of a very convenient location comfortable room and free snacks with beverages almost throughout the day at the catalonia square my husband and i were there for nights and we will certainly not hesitate to stay there again for when we next visit barcelona the front desk staff deserve a pat on the back for going above and beyond their call of duty with a friendly demeanor at all times and the welcome bottle of champagne and fruit platter was the cherry on top,1
2795,perfect hotell in the center of barcelona clean and freshly breakfast and free buffet from every day salads fruits cakes sandwiches and wraps free coffie and soda we even got free bottles of water every morning to bring during our tours in hotel staff gave great service and were very helpfull in any gave tips and hints of what to do lots of smile and always a hello we felt welcome stayed in juniorsuites with a terrace no view at all and near by the pool some flowers or plants would done it nicer and it could be better to close a gap against nabours terrase but really not a big deal the good thing was it quiteness no disturbing sounds not even from the pooljuniorsuites with pool are located higher up and towards placa cathalyonia with better view then you have the streets outside so i guess it depends on what you aware the shower and toilet are seperated and it cant bee locked they are also behind frosted glass quite nice and modern free locker in the room and they made our beds before night free nespresso in got a bottle of cava and fruits upon arrivel most of towels and beautiful will recomend this for couples and even families,1
2796,first impression the reception staff was really good very friendly and helpful as should be up to my room junior suite and the first thing that came to my mind was how small it was but to be honest it was enough space and that is what i care about in the end just small for being a suite so keep that in mind when you book and might be expecting a larger room room was very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable free wifi was fast and reliable and there is a nespresso machine in the room as well i got a welcome gift that consisted of a nice bottle of cava and fresh fruits to go with this very nice of the hotel and unexpected the hotel is located perfectly and you are within walking distance to most of the touristy things as long as you do mind walking a bit everything is within right opposite to the hotel there are a large shopping hotel offers free of charge a buffet from that has hot and cold food sandwiches smoothies snacks etc etc really good breakfast was of the buffet style with the option to order eggs anyway you want selection was ok but overall i found the breakfast to be a bit of a disappointment one thing that i find in many hotels is design before function and it was the same here when it came to the shower even tho there is a door,1
2797,i stayed here with my husband we had a good time the hotel was very clean and neat and modern looking and was in a good location for walking to things we arrived before check in and they allowed us to store our luggage while we went out to get lunch the rooftop pool and bar area was very nice the room was nice and had a huge bathroom the air conditioner was very cold we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again,1
2798,this hotel had everything you need to make your stay in barcelona enjoyable the staff was friendly knowledgeable and spoke english the roof top pool was perfect the hotel offers free snacks from when i heard that i thought little appetizers but they had sandwiches salads hot foods fruit yogurt and more they were amazing the hotels central location was perfect for walking around,1
2799,lovely hotel clean friendly great rooftop pool snacks through the day on the roof very relaxed never too busy at the pool staff were great would definitely stay again recommend to friends in the future,1
2800,very enjoyable in all aspects staff decor location staff could not have been more accommodating very clean and contemporary only floors small location was accessible by walking to all main thoroughfares cabs were easy to flag down would highly recommend,1
2801,we just returned from a night stay at this fantastic hotel one of the best hotels we ever stayed at very professional staff they go above and beyond large room in a beautiful updated decor we even had a balcony to step outside on the rooftop area was fantastic bartender complimentary snacks lounging by the pool full room service menu available nice having a spa in the hotel as well i booked a foot massage after a long day of walking the location ca be beat easily walk everywhere and to all the major sights located on a quiet street daily complimentary bottles of water in the room on the morning we checked out we were handed two bottles of water for our ride to the airport i would definitely recommend this hotel and should we find ourselves in barcelona again we would stay here,1
2802,the hotel is in the perfect location it is easy to walk just about everywhere and is surrounded by the delightful little streets of the gothic quarter it is easy to catch a cab if you are going somewhere more distant as well the room was very nice larger than expected we would definitely stay here again,1
2803,travel all over the world and stay in all types of hotels this one i can definitely recommend location and overall feeling of the hotel the rooms are a bit small but very clean and comfortable very happy with my choice,1
2804,we stayed three nights at the catalonia magdalenes everything was great the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated we even had a room connecting with that of our swimming pool on the roof top is small but sufficient to cool after a day of visit and was appreciated a lot by the kids especially with its window on one side making it look like a giant hotel offers free snacks every afternoon until great rooftop was closed from during one of the days of our stay not a problem for us but we found out by chance and it would have been more courteous to inform us when we checked in,1
2805,my wife and i stayed nights at catalonia magdalenes in early april we loved this hotel check in was friendly and informative the room was clean and fresh the breakfast spread was probably the best we have ever had in europe and everything was really good and fresh i really like the snack and drink service offered throughout the day that was a really nice perk the rooftop terrace and pool was also a great plus the location could not be better as we loved being in the gothic quarter when i return to barcelona i will definitely want to stay here again,1
2806,lovely modern hotel with beautiful roof top and plunge pool with free tapas and refreshments from till pm value service and perfect location for gothic quarters and the harbour,1
2807,my fiance and i spent two nights here the weekend just gone the start of the british summer holidays and had a fabulous time the staff could not be more helpful on and throughout for which we arrived early our room was ready so we left our luggage and when we returned we were pleased to find out it had already been taken to our room rooms are average size and have everything you need bathroom and shower is amazing and toiletries are above average bed was large and very comfy black out blind is a great touch wifi is free and reliable which is always a plus the rest of the hotel is very pretty and well maintained pool and terrace is small but lovely and afternoon nibbles and drinks were very much enjoyed location is also superb walking distance to pla√ßa de catalunya la rambla and many fantastic bars and restaurants in the gothic quarter you can walk to the beach and harbour as we did but it a little further say a min walk however walking through the beautiful alleyways you do mind we ca wait to go back the only negatives i can think of are the noise from the hallway was bothersome at times i think because the hallways are carpeted the noise is amplified although this did not affect my sleep quality but i never have a problem sleeping a lighter sleeper may be woken up also a minuscule detail my coffee cup was,1
2808,we stayed for nights at the corner hotel the building has undergone a renovation and has a luxurious modern feel the decor is really quite lovely especially in the reception and restaurant areas we had a room at the front of the building on the floor superior room which was very bright airy and peaceful there is a rooftop pool on level which is a really nice space and a great place to unwind after exploring barcelona on foot there are plenty of restaurants cafes and bars nearby we had breakfast at a local cafe each morning but it worth mentioning that most places do not open until so if you an early riser it might be best to eat breakfast at the hotel why did i not rate the hotel stars the room is very small indeed and does feel pokey the water pressure in the shower is terrible and there no iron for guests to use only a paid laundry service on the whole however this is a decent hotel and i would return,1
2809,my husband and i stayed here for nights and loved every minute staff were all very friendly helpful and attentive beautifully styled boutique style with lots of bare brick oak and bright furnishings our room had juliette balcony king size bed and all furnished to a high standard everywhere was very clean small rooftop pool although service on the rooftop was a bit hit and miss for us we ate in the ground floor bar area and standard of food and service here was excellent breakfast was a veritable feast thanks to vanessa for her cooked to order spanish omelette too hotel is well located for local restaurants and only a minute walk from metro station would definitely stay here again,1
2810,barcelona is full of nice hotels but the corner hotel definitely worth to stop by nice decoration and very welcoming staff room are clean and good size i asked for a quiet one which i got only thing is quiet sad view but in that case i prefer my sleep was our anniversary and i mentioned it in my booking a bottle of wine was there for us and i want to thank the hotel for that very kind and generous really appreciated what i really liked is the terrace and the swimming pool the waitress serena is really nice and she is very patient despite the group that were next to us almost rude and noisy the swimming pool is good to refresh yourself but not big enough for a real swimmer who likes to do length only thing that i found a shame is that you ca order food for meal before in the it was saturday around we ordered breakfast formulas juice coffee and sandwiches friends joined us and ordered juice coffee and took sandwiches as well when we went to pay the waiter charged my friend for each order one coffee one juice one sandwich because our friend did not mentioned the breakfast formula despite the fact that they had exactly the same as us we tried to explained that it is not very goodwill but he ignored us overall it was a nice stay and except this waiter the rest of the staff is nice,1
2811,the only thing that would make this hotel a better experience for a mid price hotel would be a better kitchen the room service food was disappointing however everything else here is a winner lovely staff a comfortable hipness totally unpretentious yet stylish the rooms are not huge but tick all boxes especially the comfortable beds for a barcelona beach weekend on a medium budget this was a find oh and the pool is quite nice for a rooftop pool i would stay here again,1
2812,we stayed at the corner hotel on the recommendation of a colleague of my wife who had stayed there in may the hotel was edgy dark and but warm and welcoming our room was small but comfortable and it had my favorite shower in all of the five cities i visited on this trip the only thing missing were staff was very helpful with any and all of our needs the rates were quite reasonable the hotel was located in the heart of the eixample neighboorhood and was no more than a minute walk to the metro and about a minute walk to sagrada familia i would definitely stay here again,1
2813,amazing hotel located in an excellent location staff was very friendly and helpful rooms were nicely decorated and toiletries were excellent many great food choices within walking distance and la familia is a taxi ride down the street best breakfast buffet i have seen in spain and probably ranks in top of all my travels staff in the breakfast room were attentive and friendly and the food was excellent highly recommend the hotel and when in barcelona will stay here again,1
2814,very clean confortable modern nice hotel rooms and common areas are carefully designed giving evidence on the materials used natural wood is present everywere rooms were very silent also the one with two windows on the main street several products both salt and sweet are available for the breackfast quality is very good and the waiters kind and available to satisfy the requests finally the hotel and rooms looks to be better than in pictures,1
2815,we stayed at the corner hotel by chance our other hotel would accept a late arrival so we needed somewhere reasonably priced for our first evening in barcelona i found it by chance on tripadvisor and was sold by the good reviews it certainly did guy working on the reception desk was very welcoming and helpful googling some food recommendations for us for a late night bite to eat his suggestion turned out to be the best meal we had in barcelona our room was clean modern and felt like brand new and the bed was so comfortable i never wanted to had breakfast the next day thinking it was included in our room price it was so that was an additional price but it was very good and our fault for not checking the hotel even has a rooftop pool which is a nice bonus on a hot day as the location is central and not near the beach a few more sun loungers would be good summarise we had a very short but very sweet stay at this hotel and i would almost certainly recommend it to anyone coming to barcelona i glad we were able to stay there,1
2816,this was our first time staying at the corner hotel and we were treated like old family friends indeed we were treated better than most family friends the staff were the friendliest most genuine group of individuals i have encountered working for a hotel oh by the way did i mention the staff thank you vanessa lynn and serenna among many others as to all the other amenities you expect you expect from a hotel of this standard they all present and correct rooms are comfortable without being spectacular but this is barcelona who spends time in their room the breakfast is excellent the rooftop pool is a lovely place to relax the lobby area is a great place to try one of their amazing in all a wonderful place to stay go and stay you wo regret it,1
2817,renovation completed in this mid size boutique hotel has stylish rooms with a semi industrial chic excellent smart tv system features helpful maps information for the local surrounding area pleasant rooftop pool very sunny not overshadowed by other buildings as some city rooftop pools can be great buffet breakfasts but the mercat del nino is meters down the road and that is the place for breakfast fresh orange juice and tortilla espanola with an espresso superb the corner hotel is in a convenient location in eixample district easy walk to metro friendly two downsides the free seemed to attract dozens of students who are permanently camped in the lobby order one coffee each all day and never move from their laptops the lobby bar is comfortable so you ca blame them but it is annoying for paying guests the other downside is the large garbage bins situated just adjacent to the hotel entrance positioned so you alight from your taxi right next to recommended for large business groups unless maybe you are a business student needing as the hotel does not have extensive meeting facilities however for a weekend break holiday or any sort of romantic getaway this is an excellent comfortable hotel,1
2818,very comfy beds big screen tv in room clean and tidy with good size toiletries free wifi worked fine for us free sweets in reception is a nice bonus buffet breakfast was lovely rooftop pool is great swimming pool towels are provided good hairdryer not brilliant for thick hair no iron in room not much storage space in room service on rooftop a bit slow only lay down loungers on rooftop and then just chairs toilet door opens straight onto toilet basin watch your toes dont get caught underneath if your partner walks in,1
2819,i spent nights at the corner hotel during a business trip earlier this year and quickly fell in love the hotel is beautifully designed and the service is impeccable the rooms are spacious and comfortable much like having an apartment of your own in the city the sound system in the room completes the experience if you should like to venture outside of your room the roof features a small pool and great view as for exploring barcelona the hotel is close to rambla de catalunya and the gaud√≠ houses on passeig de gracia and a lovely walk to la rambla and the gothic quarter or the sagrada fam√≠lia in the other direction what more could you ask for,1
2820,the atmosphere is great in this hotel clean quiet and the staff are smiling close to the city center by hotel is comfortable and distinctive in terms of design and service that is corner lol is hotel is really special and when you go there you will really feel my words,1
2821,fantastic modern eixample hotel with rooftop pool attentive staff andy very comfortable room min walk to the closest metro a little far from more historic areas for walking but lots of lovely restaurants and shopping areas close by casa batlo and la pedrera are within easy walking distance had a great stay here and will gladly return,1
2822,the staff was so nice and helpful and thankfully spoke excellent english they even humored us when we attempted spanish the rooms were roomy comfortable and clean the location was close enough to tourist sites to walk but removed enough to feel like you were getting a taste of local life and they even gave us a free bottle of cava to make our honeymoon extra special,1
2823,my husband and i stayed here for four nights recently the hotel is a minute walk to the main la ramble strip so not far at all lots of lovely restaurants on the hotel is lovely the rooms were huge but well equipped for what we needed the hotel was quiet for being on the street only negative had to be the roof top pool it is lovely up there but only has sun loungers which were impossible to get and once someone did they stayed on all day the rest of the seating is a mixture of table and chairs and deck chairs which were very uncomfortable to try and sunbathe in i not sure why there are more sun loungers if it for space most people were using two decks anyway one for sitting on and one for legs the second negative was the pool bar service we were lucky if bar tender came up once and when he did he waited until he got a lot of orders then got the elevator down floors to bring up your drink this took about an hour from ordering we also ordered some tapas to the roof which took about hrs mins to arrive it a silly way of doing it would be better to not offer the service and let people take their own drinks to the pool which people were doing or have it manned from lunch than the roof top issues we would return here as everything,1
2824,we loved our stay here the staff was super helpful welcoming from the moment we checked in right through our stay roger at the front desk was awesome he recommended some great restaurants helped us coordinate our day trips he showed us exactly what metro lines to take which ticket options were the best value printed out timetables for us the hotel itself is great very modern yet cozy the beds pillows were super comfortable everything was very clean well kept the rooms even have bluetooth speakers built in which was a nice touch would definitely stay here again,1
2825,what a great hotel only months old when we visited in july great decor in the common areas as well as the room room was well appointed staff was helpful seems to cater to english speaking audience i really like the location it walking distance to the gran via and la pedrera some good restaurants and shops and the metro it a manageable moderate to long walk to the city centre and barcelonita i liked that it was a bit away from all the craziness seems just the right size too raul at the front desk was very helpful with suggestions on things to visit and places to eat natalia in the ground floor restaurant was just as helpful the rooftop terrace with small pool was a great place for the evenings i would stay here again,1
2826,loved this trendy hotel very clean and nice the staff was friendly and very helpful the room was clean and the beds were comfortable the breakfast was fantastic and well worth the money the drinks were just a bit too expensive on the rooftop although we enjoyed being up there all in all a great stay,1
2827,stayed at this lovely hotel for nights staff at check in was so nice we where early but got upgradet without extra cost and got the room right away the room was on the floor no problem with the lifts right at the corner of the building and had a litlle balcony clean nice room and you even hear the noice from the street the bed was amazing and with the pillow menu you are guaranteed a good nights was very nice the selection of tea could have been better nespresso coffee but small boring teabags homemade jam juices and eggs right of the stove nothing to complain pool is a realy nice plus when you have been walking around the city all day and can take a nice cooling dip only minus here was that there almost never where any staff at the bar or any to clean up people just left there towels everywhere so you thought that all the deck chairs was taken the hotel is located near a stop when you come with the aerobus from the airport nice neighbhorhood with good restaurants and a nice atmosphere short walk to main an even better stay a bathrope would have been nice when going to the pool,1
2828,we stayed at the corner hotel for nights at the end of june we loved it the hotel is simply amazing modern and stylish great lobby with casual lounge area for relaxation and drinks nice roof top pool and sun deck the room was small but well equipped and comfortable lots of storage space and most comfortable bed i have ever slept in besides my own great location with close proximity to major friendly and helpful reception desk thanks to roger and lynn who could be more professional ans sweet giving us directions along with a helpful map ensuring we wo get lost in a city and facilitating in our every need i could go on but suffice it to say i was very pleased with our stay i hope to be back for a longer visit in the future,1
2829,everything was great about the hotel our room was spacious well appointed and comfortable high tech though we never could master the bluetooth the staff was incredibly helpful we had a lot of questions of where to go what to see and they went out of their way to help lobby was nice lots of people there using wifi and having coffee the food breakfast was tasty we sampled just a few of the pastries convenient location,1
2830,stayed here for two nights before a cruise out of barcelona hotel is beautiful staff are friendly and helpful we even got a free upgrade to the coveted corner room the room was very large and modernly designed excellent closet space and large bathroom with beautiful windows overlooking the street best part of the room the amazing beds best sleep i had during my entire trip saturday night there was live music playing in the lobby lounge area after a long days of sightseeing we would relax in the rooftop pool and have a drink great location around some of the best restaurants and short walk to the sites overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in barcelona and i ca wait to be back again soon,1
2831,i stayed at the corner hotel for few nights with my boyfriend and we loved it friendly staff cool interior clean and chic pool terrace on the rooftop was our favourite i definitely wan na stay here when i next time visit barcelona,1
2832,the whole hotel is just lovely the decor matches all over the hotel and is beautiful the staff were very helpful friendly and spoke english perfectly putting our lack of spanish speaking to shame the hotel is really well located you can easily walk into the centre or get the metro metro station is around a minute stroll the best point about the location is the vast amount of excellent restaurants situated around the hotel ranging from michelin starred to delicious pizza we visited mid price restaurants which were all lovely check out trip advisor reviews of restaurants there are a lot of rated places this will be my first choice when returning to barcelona enjoy you wo want to leave,1
2833,a very convenient hotel with a good location clean rooms along with excellent breakfast was also nice with a good selective thanks for the champagne on my birthday,1
2834,my wife and i stayed at this hotel for nights at the end of july and were joined by our son daughter for had seen this hotel on a previous trip to barcelona but had not previously stayed and the reviews suggested that it was worth trying it definitely corner hotel has that perfect mix of being professional and relaxed and i would certainly want to stay there at any future visit service was excellent particularly lynn on reception who just stood out in her desire to ensure that everything was great throughout our areas of the hotel have clean relaxed and modern contemporary d√©cor which works for anyone you can be young and fashionable or mature and experienced and still feel comfortable at this is also a great pool area on the top of the hotel to while away some relaxed time swimming taking in the sun enjoying a drink or all three,1
2835,i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in barcelona whether it for business or leisure as it has everything you need when we arrived we were told we had a free rom upgrade which was nice and they had no trouble helping us sort out things in our room the receptionist lynn could have been more helpful she printed a booking out for us for an event that we forgotten to print the tickets for as well as help us find the best ways to get to places we wished to visit all in all very helpful and she made our stay easy the breakfast was nice and there was a choice of cooked breakfast fresh fruit breads cheeses meats etc the only downside was the it seemed quite expensive at each when i do normally eat a lot for breakfast seemed a lot for toast and a cup of tea but it was still very convenient and a nice roof top terrace is very nice and got very busy no loungers left only tables and chairs but i was bothered overall the hotel is very smart and sophisticated the rooms replicate this also big beds lovely plush bathrooms and furniture too we were even given a complimentary bottle of cava on our last night which was nice the location of the hotel is good it about a minute walk to the main shopping street if that your thing and about minutes from the universitat which makes,1
2836,stayed here for nights in august with my wife from when we arrived to when we left the service was excellent we had a superior room which while not spacious had one of the most comfortable beds i slept in a lovely bathroom and a large flatscreen tv albeit every chanel was spanish but we were in spain lol the tv did have youtube and an hdmi in so you could watch stuff for the web or plug something in if you wanted there was also a window which opened onto a small ledge the bar done fantastic cocktails and had a well thought out selection of spirits and beers the rooftop pool was fantastic to go and chill out on after a day of sightseeing we did have dinner at the hotel but did have breakfast one morning which was excellent also great selection of continental cooked pastries and even a selection of sandwiches and cakes we pinched a couple of raspberry muffins on the way out to have with coffee in the afternoon location wise the hotel is in a central part of town minutes walk from pass√© de gracie with its designer shops and gaudi exhibits and also where the tourist buses stop it about minutes in a cab from the hustle and busily of la ramble and minutes from the port and barceloneta outstanding hotel loved it,1
2837,stayed three nights for our first visit to barcelona found it on ta and could not have been happier lovely hotel with great staff room had great bed pillows beautiful bathroom and shower my husband took advantage of the rooftop pool we did not have the breakfast buffet but opted for the smaller breakfast in the lobby bar it was delicious their cakes are wonderful as others have said clean and chic a nice boutique hotel feels like home also close to paco meralgo tapas restaurant where we had dinner two of our three nights in barcelona lynn at the front desk had recommended it and we were not disappointed would definitely stay here again,1
2838,we loved every minute at the corner hotel the staff was amazing friendly attentive and willing to help vanessa from the bar and breakfast area was very sweet the front desk staff was very helpful and made a reservation for us for dinner at a really great spot restaurant the decor is stunning the pool area is lovely but they really need umbrellas the drinks and breakfast were delicious everything is so stylish and clean i would recommend this hotel to everyone,1
2839,the hotel offers excellent services the staff is very welcoming and always listen to the needs of the clients the breakfast is varied and very good the room was beautiful very quiet the staff agreed to gives us another room with a view on the inner courtyard thanks again and impeccably there is a small swimming pool at the top of the hotel if you want to enjoy the i would strongly recommend this hotel for your stay in barcelona,1
2840,this is a lovely hotel steps from two of gaudi casas and within walking distance of the sagrada familia very modern decor and facilities reception staff was young friendly and very professional comfortable lounge area and excellent breakfast taxi stand out front restaurants all about we were here one night post cruise arrived early and left bags they were in our room when we returned at two we highly recommend this hotel,1
2841,not only is the hotel within walking distance of well known gaudi houses and the sagrada familia it is a few strides from the underground and mainline railway station this makes getting from and to the airport very easy the hotel itself is modern and comfortable with helpful staff the breakfast room was a little more like a lounge and could be busy but the food was good with plenty of choice and cheery waiting staff highly recommended,1
2842,the hotel is located on the premiere street of barcelona passeig de which is known for its shopping restaurants and spanish is a small boutique hotel which has an awning in front with the hotel name then several magnificent doors but at first try none seem to open it lobby is small but there is a breakfast room on the next floor up which is a lounge with coffee tea and cold flavored waters during the day and cava from every evening we arrived in the early am and since our room was not available our luggage was stored the front desk associates would not confirm what floor our room was on but indicated that the jr suites were only on one of two floors one of which was the first floor which was not acceptable to us it was puzzling since we were the first to why we could not have the room we had requested however upon we did in fact get that reception associates are quite helpful with reservations and directions the breakfast buffet was plentiful with pastries meat cheese yogurt cereals and eggs on room was quite contemporary keeping with the hotel decor there was a king size bed a nice television a closet and no drawer space if a guest weto stay more than a few days we did not so the space was bathroom had a shower with a ceiling rainfall shower and a handheld as well as a bidet the toiltetry kit was,1
2843,excellent location great room and breakfast was first class my yr old daughter suffers with coeliac disease and they catered for her at breakfast very well the staff were also very helpful with travel advice and eating out in the local area,1
2844,the decor and serviices were al excellent as was the hotel central location to all sites and conveniences if back again to barcelona we will definitely consider it one problem i was quoted euro for private transport to the airport the driver demanded euros at the airport somebody was mistaken pleas resolve,1
2845,it was pretty impressive overall the service decor comfort every detail they have in the room i really had a great short time in barcelona and a lot had to do with this hotel kudos to the staff and management,1
2846,we stayed here in december after a ncl cruise for an old building with a long history this hotel was modern welcoming functional and for a family like us pax it was rooms were very modern with great features good sized bathrooms and a small lounge and work of the best features of this property besides the perfect location is the restaurant area that is open for breakfast and then snacks throughout the day which made it a great meeting point for our aspects of the hotel like the running group on wednesday mornings made me really enjoy this property too,1
2847,great location right in front of gaudi casa bastlo good facilities well laid out room balcony with great view over the vibrant city friendly helpful staff absolutely no complaints a fair price too,1
2848,we are a family with two small babies we stayed here for five nights end of our month in europe i have to admit that when i saw the room it looked too small to stay with two baby cribs and luggage pieces and it was large in bcn you do stay in the room too much and the lounge of the hotel gave us extra space to eat the take away sushi we staff are fantastic juanjo made my so easy and he went out to search in the streets nearby for a big taxi for us took all our luggage and put it on the taxi and doing all this while giving you the feeling he is there to help you and not because it is his recommend this hotel mainly for location and the fantastic staff,1
2849,we have just returned from a night stay at this wonderful hotel the location is perfect just a couple of hundred yards from the station and right on one of the more upmarket shopping streets sagrada familia the port area and the ramblas all within walking distance our room was extremely comfortable we were traveling with an month old and the cot provided was very clean and even included a child pillow and a cute teddy which our son loved we had a terrace out the back which was perfect for enjoying some wine in the evening breakfast was plentiful and of good quality and the free cava at was a nice touch above all i would like to compliment the staff at this hotel who honestly could not have done more for us and were extremely happy always smiling we hope to return for another visit soon,1
2850,perfect location right by metro stop and on beautiful street can see casa batllo from front windows we had an amazing family room which was two connected rooms at the end of the one with two twins one with king at a completely reasonable price nice decor and very quiet,1
2851,amazing experience at sixty two hotel my room was right on passeig de gracia with a little sitting area to enjoy staff could not have been more accommodating especially gisela who went above and beyond to make my mornings extra special when i return to barcelona i will definitely be booking this hotel for a pleasant stay recommend,1

2854,my girlfriend and i went for a drink at the rooftop bar in the evening we did stay at the hotel but just went for a nice cocktail and glass of wine it was a lovely setting to enjoy a drink with good views of the city not the cheapest of places obviously but worth the price definitely,1
2855,we loved this hotel the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful rooms are clean and quiet we especially loved the wine time from where you got to compare travel notes and enjoy some local wines the gym is adequate small but clean and there is water provided the rooftop bar and view are fun as well i was there with my teenaged son and older daughter great location,1
2856,we stayed for nights to celebrate our son birthday and the whole experience from arriving to leaving was exceptional all the staff were friendly and very helpful especially xavi who went the mile in trying to locate a venue for us to watch the lions v all blacks rugby test the roof top area gave spectacular views across barcelona and was excellent for winding down with a glass of wine at the end of the day watching the sun location with most sights within walking hotel and will certainly stay again if returning to barcelona,1
2858,accommodation in barcelona is not cheap however i feel this hotel adds just enough special touches to make it a great are what you would expect shower is fantastic and huge wine hour is a great concept the best thing about this hotel is the rooftop pool it is only small and not at all deep but it is relaxing and refreshing after a long day sightseeing huge thumbs up to xavi at the front desk very friendly and gave us two great restaurant recommendations,1
2859,i stayed here for nights and found the location was really good the roof top is spectacular and adds the the overall experience with super service in the day by such a lovely warm and welcoming bar lady the view is amazing and you feel so grateful and lucky to still have the opportunity to watch over barcelona after a long day of travelling around the city the pool is a little smaller than expected but there are plenty of seats around to enjoy the view the room i stayed in was very clean and the size was just right the bathroom was lovely and modern with a spacious shower even wash and cream if you have forgotten and complete with a hair dryer breakfast is available but i not one to eat a lot in the morning so a short walk and you have a selection of cafes with croissants and a coffee all in for,1
2860,i spent nights at yurbban trafalgar i had what called a standard room which turned out to be super small reminded me of ibis initially i had a room on the floor next to the elevator the same floor as access to the rooftop bar unbeknownst to me the rooftop bar is open to the public sometimes until am when they are hosting an event it was sooooooo loud my first night luckily i was able to switch rooms for my next nights what i liked great location good comfortable bed good shower friendly and helpful staff loved the rooftop deck improvements tea kettle in the room for almost usd a night there ought to be one the wine and cheese social is a great concept however the setup does work well since people are sitting next to the cheese and wine it felt very intrusive when taking a bit of cheese or wine perhaps place the cheese and wine on the table used for the breakfast buffet loud room on the floor due to access to the rooftop bar i probably would not stay at this hotel again i did think it was worth the price i had paid per night,1
2861,your search is over stay here what a gem rooms nice service great food amazing they share a kitchen i believe that is what they said with lolea which has amazing spanish food they do a wine hour from where hotel guests get together and chat over free wine really nice touch the rooftop pool and view are incredible really nice way to end the day at the rooftop bar the gym was another nice addition and free laundry what how could you go wrong here book it now oh and the location is convenient to everything we walked everywhere stop looking and book here you can see some photos of our trip on instagram at onetravellife,1
2862,i loved everything about my stay in yurbban barcelona is a very special city and this is a very special boutique hotel my husband and i are relatively in our early and this was our first time in barcelona we would stay here very clean great bathrooms and in el born and walking minutes from all the great bars and restaurant in born min to the gothic quarter min to passeig de gracia min from and amenities knowledgable helpful and friendly staff free pocket free laundry facilities only one washer dryer but we used it times with no issues very modern and fresh design and colours rooms fun signs and a wonderful rooftop area with a small pool we went up there in the evening for some cocktails and it was so wonderful some great music is pumped through the elevators and also piped to the rooftop very nicely done,1
2863,great hotel all the staff were warm and helpful they offered complimentary bikes portable wifi for walking around the city and wine time free wine with breakfast staff were lovely i forgot her name but there was one lady in particular tues and wed morning who was great and made us porridge which was on the menu and just generally was very attentive and location rooftop pool and bar all in all a great place to stay and will go back,1
2864,if you looking for an aperitif with a good view of the city try this rooftop bar the venue is perfect for taking good pictures and for enjoying the city from a different point of mojito cocktail is quite good and the staff can improve the service but is not too bad,1
2865,yurrban hotel was the perfect hotel in barcelona for a couple nights the best parts about the hotel are the location and the added perks that make your stay on the edge of the gothic quarter so there are endless great restaurants in walking distance and it s only ten minutes away from la boqueria i recommend taking different routes through the quaint alleys and popping in boutiques along the way also caf√© lolea the famous spanish sangria is just behind the hotel i recommend stopping in for a drink and some there is a wine hour from pm which is a great way to decompress there is free laundry and laundry soap on site that you can use if needed lastly there is a very small pool on the roof with an amazing rooftop area that has spectacular views of the room is on the small side but the location and rooftop make it very worth it,1
2866,perfectly situated in the centre of the city close to plaza catalan and the stops for bus tours metro and airport boutique feel super decor nice trendy feel drink on arrival at check in free use of wifi dongles as you go out around the city we used the aero bus for airport transfer at euros return such a convenient minute nearby is superb nice walks restaurants and bars min walk to sagrada bar and pool is small but comfortable though the barman has to be the most unfriendly and rude i ever met unresponsive unhelpful ignores you at the bar never a smile or friendly response bad are small but nice check out was a bonus i certainly have this as my first choice hotel in barcelona and hope to best thing was free wine and cheese every evening brilliant way to relax and meet other travellers staying at the this hotel but sort out that awful bar man,1
2867,we were pleasantly surprised walking into this hotel it super cute boutiquey type of hotel reminds me of the ace hotels in the states everyone was so nice and helpful super close to placa cataluyna and from there you can get anywhere min walk to the water the rooms are big for europe as are the showers and the bed was super comfy now here the best part the rooftop pool is amazing small but amazing the view from there is great and only hotel guests are allowed at the pool so it not a big scene up there cocktails are a little pricey but wine at the rooftop bar is euro it a great place to make a lot of english speaking friends after our daily rooftop relaxing and siesta we made it down to the complimentary wine and cheese tasting from we had so much fun tasting wine which in reality was drinking wine they advertised a free wifi box which we wish we knew ahead of time since we had one they also advertise breakfast which is included or was included in our room at the end of the day everything was great at the hotel would stay there again,1
2868,great modern hotel with central location the service here was impeccable for our whole day stay rooftop pool and bar were a great afternoon treat with views over barca large tidy rooms that ca be faulteddo forget to eat at catalana just around the corner,1
2869,this hotel is just a star all the way at our arrival which was hours before ordinary check in they served us something free to drink in the bar meanwhile they fixed a room for us already and from there everything was just perfect large and very comfortable designed room the staff was so friendly the pool on the roof was so nice and clean the snack bar had everything from good tasting drinks to club sandwiches and so on for us it was the perfect place to stay for those nights a little bit from the classic tourist streets but we walked just a few minutes to get there love to come back thank you,1
2870,had a great trip to barcelona for the weekend with my mum hotel was just fantastic breakfast staff swimming pool rooms and service was all great could recommend higher we would defiantly return to this hotel,1
2871,the hotel was excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel had great facilities the room was spacious and very clean the pool was great to relax in after a day looking round the city the location of the hotel is very good near to the metro and also not from the train station on passeig de gracia,1
2872,we spend nights in a triple room for single hotel is design comfortable and very well personal are the best a great thanks to lanny our receptionist who was able to give us and early check in at pool is very good they have sunbathing seats in the pool do not hesitate to contact them before your arrival in order to do an early check in i will definitely come back in this booked on agoda the best for promotion price,1
2873,my husband and i stayed here before and after a mediterranean cruise out of barcelona we used a timeshare exchange and could have been happier with this boutique hotel the staff provided us with complimentary bubbly upon our arrival while we waited for our room we showed up early and they accommodated us the entire staff was very professional and so friendly and helpful our interaction with josep clara and rafal was delightful they gave us recommendations for some delicious tapas and paella within walking distance and directions to attractions our room was on the floor very clean comfortable and modern we loved the view from the negative edge pool on the floor and it had a nice bar there as well the staff sent up a lovely complimentary plate of goodies to our room one afternoon we had requested a call on our day of departure and a live person called us to wake us up not an automated one the breakfast buffet is definitely worth checking out too to sum it up we ca wait to return,1
2874,my friend and i visited barcelona from and were pleasantly surprised with how wonderful the hotel and our experience was as for the details aesthetics modern sleek clean great bathrooms amenities super comfortable bed rooftop pool bar a plus if you need to take a nap relax midday before you go back could have asked for better service all the men at the reception desk were fantastic they gave great reservations at fantastic restaurants and booked daily excursions for us seriously did not try the food at the hotel except for a latte location central i big on walking and found that it was min to the beach and a quick walk to central shopping gaudi buildings and parks min to shopping to sagrada familia going at sunset so the sun hits the stained great location our days were totally walkable,1
2875,being a small business owner i prefer staying at hotels that offer all basic amenities plus i value quiet rooms olivia balmes hotel has it all it is located in a part of the city where it is easy to get metro access in any direction,1
2876,we had a fabulous stay so glad we chose this hotel perfect location not too touristy but close enough to all the main attractions rooms are exceptionally clean and quite large for a city centre hotel pool area is small but very nicely done and a great place to cool down with a drink after a day of sightseeing most importantly it is the staff that make the hotel special all very welcoming and could have been any more helpful with booking trips restaurants etc,1
2877,year back in olivia balmes wonderful h√¥tel there were many familiar faces obviously have a low turn over rate with staff very good sign lenin always helpful and an asset to the is great passage gracia is close by and wonderful for shopping rooms are spacious this time we stayed in room basic suite and ideal for itself is modern almost boutique in style great design and overall an ideal h√¥tel close to both shopping and local attractions,1
2878,our stay could have started better we arrived very early and were given drinks advice about where to visit and what to do in the city and local knowledge whilst a room was prepared for is in a nice residential area with lots of local cafes and restaurants just off pg de gracia which is the very upmarket shopping area there are metro stops for three different lines very close by and some bus routes go right by the hotel the city bus tours highly recommended to get an overall idea of the city also very close is easy to get anywhere from here and nice to hang out locally in the decor very smart and designer style as was our room which was quite spacious there is a nice terrace and a a decent local supermarket just over a block very friendly and very minor room malfunction was sorted literally within minutes which i think is always the sign of top class place,1
2879,barcelona what can i say a city that has everything we chose the olivia balmes after checking reviews on hotel is located on the outskirts of the bustling city streets but it was easy to get to everything either walk train or bus our rooms were clean and beds were big and comfortable shower was also large and powerful tea coffee making facilties room safe and hanging space for clothes could not fault the room all of the staff were friendly helpful and made you feel welcome pool on roof is small but adequate for cooling off after a busy day we did not book the breakfast so cant comment of food there are plenty of coffee shops within a min walk if you want coffee and light breakfasts we spent days in barcelona and didnt get to do everythjng so we are heading back at the end of september hopefully and will be staying at olivia balmes again i highly recommend this hotel ps weather was great too with a light breeze a cardigan or light jumper needed in the evening or for early morning walks,1
2880,it was nice hotel located in barcelona and the gentleman at the door in front was very precise and receptionists were okay however before the last moment the hose keeping opened the door without noticed when i was naked i wish it wo happen to the other guests,0
2881,having reviewed several cities we chose barcelona as it appeared to cater for all our tastes age group early to early as we had experienced booking difficulties with an alternative spanish hotel prior to departure we chose this hotel mainly for the ease in booking the accommodation on the hotel website roof top pool and reasonable price we were made to feel very welcome lenin is a credit to the hotel nothing was too much trouble and on the whole all staff were very helpful we had a good breakfast in the hotel on two occasions however we preferred to eat out in order to soak up the atmosphere of the city although the pool was not large it was adequate for cooling down and also provided an alternative area to relax within the perimeter of the hotel my daughter and i shared a room on the sixth floor facing out towards the city street we benefited from a large window and a well proportioned room my son room being on the opposite side of the corridor which faced into an inner court yard was less big with a smaller window although it appeared to suit his needs three tips i would recommend for a short stay in barcelona because of the heat we found using the local city bus a good way to commute to different areas as a family we are use to walking but even minutes in the heat can be exhausting get a good guide book,1
2882,we stayed here two nights while doing a whirlwind tour of barcelona this is a hotel but close enough to all the sights and public transportation to make a stay here worthwhile for the tourist as well chic decor,1
2883,hotel is in a great location and the door at the front desk gave great recommendations for dinner and a quick breakfast wish there was more seating at the pool but overall very pleased with the experience,1
2884,very nice staff great with amazing mojito sunbeds at the rooftop pool tend to be occupied really fast so go early rooms are nice and the hotel serves a good breakfast with times,1
2885,what a service i received all the staff of the hotel was amazing maindesk cleaning bar service spectacular the best part is the pool service felt like home reda alba and damo made it special,1
2886,we had an excellent time at hotel olivia balmes the members of staff could not have been improved they were efficient friendly and always helpful the hotel is ideally located for seeing the sites shopping and enjoying cafes and restaurants the buffet breakfasts were good and we enjoyed being able to choose to sit inside or outside the room was spotless and very comfortable the pool is small but considering that the hotel is so central having a pool was a real bonus the terrace and poolside were relaxed but benefited from the usual excellent service if i was to change one thing it would be the loud music played on the terrace in my opinion it did nothing to enhance the relaxed atmosphere and at times spoilt the atmosphere but that is as stated only my opinion as a hotel i can not recommend olivia balmes highly enough,1
2887,my boyfriend took me for me birthday as a surprise hotel and service was immaculate can not applaud the staff enough for their hospitality and being so welcoming perfect location also close to main town la rambles a cake arrived as they know it was my birthday they could do enough to serve you best service i ever received in a hotel rooms were beautiful thank you for making our stay and my birthday so memorable,1
2888,great location and service all staff were friendly and helpful with booking tickets for aquarium and football stadium the pool on the roof with the small bar was also very nice after a long day walking in barcelona,1
2889,we stayed here for nights and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it was smooth the room is very modern and comfortable the rooftop pool is really nice during summer time the hotel location is very central and in a very nice neighborhood and the best of this hotel is its staff every single one of them we came across was extremely friendly and helpful i am not exaggerating it was so sad to leave this morning but as the receptionist said to me when checking out you need to leave in order to come back damn sure i will,1
2890,the hotel and the staff were very attentive to my needs they even put a cake in my room for my birthday and i did even tell them it was my cool is that the rooftop pool was very chic and the location of the hotel was perfect it was outside of the trap gothic area and perfect i give them a out of,1
2891,had a great stay at this hotel located away from the bustle yet very convenient to sights restaurants shopping and train spacious airy rooms nice bedding rooftop pool fantastic breakfast but most of all the nicest staff from front desk to waiters to front door everyone was friendly and oh so helpful just the best i highly recommend olivia balmes by the way although i had a floor room overlooking the front entrance the windows are soundproof did hear a thing,1
2892,location the best thing with this hotel is the location walking distance to la rambla we also walked to the beach which took us about there are several restaurants close to the hotel the room big bright and comfortable a bit different design but we liked it big bed so we could all three sleep in it without a problem breakfast the only downside with this hotel the breakfast is simple and not worth the money there are cafes and restaurants nearby that you can easily go to even if the kids are so hungry that they ca wait pool small but great love the sunseats inside the pool they also give you a towel and it close to the gym the pool area also have an bar our old loved it and so did we unfortunately there is no view here what so greaaaaat helpful personal that speaks great english they will help you with everything you need and do it with a smile,1
2893,this hotel and all its staff we were brilliant we stayed for four nights and had breakfast for first morning the room was very clean quiet with comfy bed and pillows great air con and making facilities the breakfast was very good great location all the staff were very helpful and kind and helped book trips or restaurants for you highly recommend the teleferic restaurant in old town for a delicious meal and pool was wonderful after a hot day sight you everyone hopefully we will return for the rolling stones concert,1
2894,came back from days and nights in barcelona excellent hotel location staff rooms swimming pool was a great stay the staff helped us with tickets reservations for most of the attractions amazing service from all the staff we will definitely come back on our next visit,1
2895,we could not have asked for more great location not too close to tourist area plenty of wonderful places to eat within a few blocks always welcomed on our return each day breakfast was a fabulous mixture of local foods and self serve nespresso coffee,1
2896,we have just returned from a day stay at the olivia de balmes hotel in barcelona and having travelled many years already to many hotels this one now is considered within our top of best stays ever the hotel is well located to shop to visit tourist attractions restaurants and other things one wants to do in hotel itself is ranked with stars and that correct however its staff is worth stars in the reception restaurant virtually in every department helpful skillful truely friendly and making you feel valued as a guest we can only recommand this hotel to all that plan to visit barcelona and get real value for money and a wonderful again many thanks to all at the olivia balmes hotel,1
2897,all staff was super helpful and friendly loved the hotel clean modern rooms great room service pool is super nice and great view food was good loved the beds and shower will stay here once back in barcelona,1
2898,we went to barcelona for a weekend and this hotel was perfect for it with a nice swimming pool to relax in after a day in the city the staff was really friendly and helpfull would definitely recommend it,1
2899,i never found a hotel with such friendly and helpfull employees and that in juin the busiest period of the year clean and quiet room a swimmingpool on the roof to escape the busy town an excellent breakfastbuffet,1
2900,just came back from nights at the olivia balmes hotel we had a wonderful time the service was consistently excellent the staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay the room was large by european standards and nicely decorated the bed was big king size i think and very comfortable the air conditioning worked well and it was so nice to come back to our nice cool room after a day of wandering around barcelona our room had a small balcony with a chair small table and a drying rack for drying swimsuits we were expecting the balcony and it was a real pool and the rooftop terrace were what really sealed the deal for us the pool was huge but definitely big enough for several people to be hanging out in it it was metal rather than tiled and was lovely it had metal loungers under water so was great for cooling off while sunbathing there were many lounge chairs around the pool and we never had a problem finding one there were also tables and chairs in the shade the pool area had a bar that served drinks as well as light meals and tapas very nice on the opposite side of the roof terrace there were additional chairs and sofas and we hung out there at times as well great for watching the sun location is great only a block from la rambla with lots of great shopping and restaurants when,1
2901,we stayed here for two nights i actually thought i was booking the olivia plaza hotel which is on the central area in barcelona but now i glad we ended up at this olivia hotel the staff are trained really well and they be nicer or more helpful which makes such a difference the hotel is impeccably clean we had a lovely room the shower was amazing they left a little plate of fruit and cake for us on the second day which is a nice touch there is a fab rooftop pool not a huge amount of sunloungers but really relaxing and it gets the sun right up until sunrise the staff like i said are wonderful across the board is it cheap no but you pay for what you get and it not overly expensive either lovely for a weekend break location wise you are in the eixample area and mins walk brings you down to the busier shopping la rambla area the queen bed was just lovely and comfortable we had breakfast there both mornings and it was fresh and just lovely overall would recommend,1
2902,from the moment we arrived we could have felt more welcome beautiful hotel rooms and the service both at reception pool bar fantastic the whole hotel was pristine and the rooms were beautiful stylish well equipped,1
2903,very nice hotel good facilities excellent service from the with complementary drink to the nice and comfortable room to the excellent service from the entire staff who make a real effort to make you feel at home and appreciated this was a great experience and we will certainly stay here during our next visit to barcelona,1
2904,stayed here with my partner for days in july i would say the location was perfect for us just a short walk from the ramblas which we preferred as it was so exposed and crowded the hotel is very modern and up together our room was spacious and very clean we also had a lovely little balcony the only thing i would say is i like to have tea and coffee facilities in our room and they do provide that very happy with the place and i would definitely recommend,1
2906,the hotel is in a great location easy access to the metro and just a half block from las ramblas it is perfect hotel staff is very helpful and the wifi is very reliable there is a wonderful smell throughout the hotel that is a nice welcome when entering in from the city our bathroom needed a little maintenance some grout had separated here and there but overall it was nice we had a great view of the city from our balcony the room does not come with wash clothes bath and hand towels were there so be sure to bring some or a loofah you need it as you often come back to the room all sweaty and feeling grimy from a day of exploring another thing that you need to bring is conditioner as they only provide shower gel and shampoo i would definitely return,1
2907,the hotel is highly maintained nice designed the room was gorgeous breakfast tasty offers nice menu the hotel staff is well trained professional specially i would like to emphasize the high quality of the reception staff on top of them maria sara they are with best service with staff like them the hotel should be proud i will be back so my family friends,1
2908,accessibility was foremost for me choosing this hotel it was my second time visiting barcelona and i would stay here again was quite happy that i did and was in no way disappointed everything that was shown and mentioned on the site was delivered and up to par exceptional front desk and dining room staff overall my expectations were met and petit palace museum will be hotel of choice keep up the good work hopefully in the near future i will be back,1
2909,great location just min walk from placa catalunya great spot to arrive on aerobus lovely staff basic room was clean well lit and absolutely perfect as we really only slept there comfy bed did try breakfast at the hotel lots of local cafes stay here again no worries,1
2910,me and my family were not expecing that the hotell was so nice for a day trip in barcelona the hotell felt very nice the people behind the desk was friendly and helpfull the room se had was larger than expected from the pictures and the view for me was gorgeous would go the when i take a trip back,1
2911,great hotel in the heart of the city with amazing views and easy to all that is barcelona rooms where adequate and wifi was strong guest services were limited in their english when trying to find a great recommendation for a restaurant but i would stay here again,1
2912,this was a generation vacation and we all thought the service and location was bright comfortable with the help yourself free food lounge for mid afternoon snacking or a meal was greatly appreciated,1

2918,i already stayed in star hotels that had much less to offer great design very friendly and helpful staff efficient housekeeping and super cool patio with small pool to relax definitely a great hotel and will come back for sure,1
2919,we no why this lovely hotel only have stars we want to put at least stars to it good location minutes walk from rambla and pl cataloniavery good food in the restaurant we eat the duck good breakfast in the morning untill had a penthouse with a wonderful will book here next time in barca,1
2920,we highly recommend this jewel of a hotel located in the poble sec region of barcelona staff was on recommendations for the surrounding area and immediate assistance with any request the pool is a welcome getaway from barcelona hustle and the restaurant puts out a delicious buffet if you can spring for one of the penthouse rooms you wo regret it,1
2921,not cheap at nearly for the night i stayed but i loved the hotel it could be hard to find the sign discreetly hidden behind some trees but the staff are terrific and have perfect english the decor is imaginative the aircon was a blessing and there were ingenious touches like having the aircon in the bathroom set to a higher temperature and having a little light by the toilet so you do have to turn on the light if you have a call of nature in the middle of the night it had the most comfortable mattress i ever slept on it was so handy too to have the vending machine right outside my door i liked my private balcony and that the hotel had a the price for the room the price for breakfast and the fact that the crisps in the vending machine are heavy enough to activate the release mechanism of the machine so you have to get someone from reception to rescue them oh and the free wifi was so weak that i turned it off and used my own data,1
2922,we stayed in a junior suite for nights and it was exceptional everything about this hotel was great room was well appointed and spacious bed very comfortable breakfast excellent the location was perfect and within walking distance of almost all the sights and many restaurants in addition all of the staff were absolutely top notch especially juan i highly recommend this hotel,1
2923,i will not add to the previous reviews mentioning the facilities and the beauty of the architecture i would rather add to them the outstanding attitude of the staff there from the front desk mariano to customer service suzanne the operations manager jaume and all the room service and concierge staff members it makes you feel that you know all these people for so long even though on a short stay we were upgraded to a suite on arrival and hence got the full treat it will become our next destination every time we visit the city,1
2924,we just came back from barcelona where we stayed at el palace hotel i just want to say that it was one of the best hotels i ever stayed everything was amazing the hotel itself is gorgeous with a prime location our room was beautiful and always clean the housekeeping was doing a great job every day the stuff at the front desk and the guys at the door were just amazing always friendly and always helpful the guy who spoke russian was the one that we talked the most i regret so much that i forgot his name he was always caring and attentive and always went beyond his way to help us i would like to point out a special lady by name julie who made our stay unforgettable my husband was in touch with her before our arrival since it was our year anniversary we were given an upgrade to a better room and received a bottle of champaign with chocolates including a hand written note from her she took time to meet us in person later during our stay and it was a real pleasure there is absolutely nothing negative i can say about el palace if i am back to barcelona i would only stay there,1
2925,what an amazing piece of art in the heart of barcelona every detail is well thought of from the decoration impressive big size of the rooms the roof top terrace with a panoramic view of barcelona best view actually to the extremely respectful staff the professionalism of the concierge who were very helpful in giving the needed guidance surely the palace hotel made our stay my husband and i memorable in barcelona the location as well is perfect walking distance to catalunya place or passeias de garcia and yet very quiet highly recommend this hotel for families or any person looking to have a great stay in barcelona because this hotel will make sure to fulfill all the needs of their customers,1
2926,i just returned from a stay at the el palace hotel i was most impressed with the staff who truly tried their best to make our stay enjoyable my favorite was amal from guest who went out of her way each and every day she worked during our stay to ensure our stay was perfect and that all of our needs were met she was so very welcoming and warm and helpful amal helped to make our trip extra special i also so enjoyed guiseppe who works in the winter garden restaurant he was so friendly and enjoyable and made our dining experience fun,1
2927,the staff was awesome and was extremely helpful the housetop bar is great and the room was perfect with not a thing out of place the location can t be beaten with easy access to the shoreline and all the well known spots an easy stroll away when in barcelona stay here,1
2928,we booked this hotel almost a year a head of our stay based on trip advisor and a friend who stayed overall it was a very nice place location and front desk staff were great rooms are nice and quiet i could give it a star because we found the pool bar service at the pool to be very slow on different occasions we went up for drinks at the pool and found ourselves waiting a long time to get drinks minutes from time of ordering usually there was one nice bartender who just moved way to slow also i came to the pool one morning at and it was filthy with stuff floating on surface i was surprised it had been cleaned from the day before close to a star but not quit again front staff were awesome,1
2929,stayed at the serras for nights in june and on most counts it ticked all the boxes you expect from a star luxury boutique hotel service standards throughout the hotel were superb with the tone set by a warm and personalised greeting upon arrival accompanied by complimentary cava followed by a tour of the hotel smartly designed and beautifully furnished public areas including the wonderful rooftop plunge bar area which offers panoramic views over the harbour and the many mega yachts moored there despite it being quite crowded at times because of private functions there we always managed to find a seat to sample the excellent range of drinks on offer while we did eat breakfast in the hotel michelin star restaurant el informal we enjoyed two excellent dinners there with the food wine and service all top tier the serras location is perfect to explore the historic gothic quarter and adjoining el born area which both contain a multitude of shopping and dining options be sure to visit the picasso museum which is only a few minutes walk from the hotel and is well worth the queue time we also walked through the winding alleys and laneways of this historic part of town to the city centre eixample and the city main high end shopping strip along passeig de garcia despite all its pluses including above all it superb staff our stay at the serras did quite match that of some of the other similar standard properties we booked,1
2930,we stayed at the hotels for four nights in july we were visiting barcelona to celebrate my husband even before we arrived we knew the hotel would be special we were called to see if there was anything that we required upon our arrival upon arriving we were welcomed with cold drinks and as our room was quite ready we were able to organise our restaurant and excursion bookings the hotel is beautiful but it the staff that really sets this place apart our year old daughter was treated like a princess she loved the attention the staff gave her and especially the trips to the secret sweetie jar the rooftop pool was fabulous and whilst small it provided a welcome relief from touring the ate breakfast at the hotel and also sunday lunch it was all delicious and again the service was impeccable thank you hotel the serras for a wonderful stay we will certainly return,1
2931,we very much enjoyed our stay at the serras this is a lovely boutique hotel just blocks from la rambla all was perfect from the moment of our arrival we were greeted with a glass of cava and shown to our lovely peaceful room the staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful we also very much enjoyed the beautful rooftop bar with views of the ocean and city i would highly recommend staying at this lovely hotel when in barcelona,1
2932,we recently returned from barcelona after a one night stay at the serras and a day cruise we can not say enough about how disappointed we were with this hotel and do not recommend anyone stay there on the first day after an hour night flight we arrived at and were told they would put a rush on having our room prepared at when we enquired about our room we were then told that the previous guests had not checked out yet and they had until noon to do so at we enquired again and were told that was and we would have to wait and guaranteed the room would be ready by then the room was not ready until after so much for putting a rush on the room we had booked a sea view room for over euros and find we are on the floor facing trees and have absolutely no view at all when we later enquired about this they said any room on the sea side was considered a sea view room they did give us a reduced rate euros after complaining at pm the same day we receive a call from the front desk asking when we are checking out the next day as the hotel is very busy and we responded we would let them know in the morning after a long day of travel we decide to go to bed early and at are awaken by another call from the hotel asking when,0
2933,hotel service was superb staff took care to greet us arrange cabs and leave us a nice welcome treat in the room for our honeymoon check in rooms bathrooms and grounds were super clean and comfortable rooftop terrace was sexy and they make great drinks hotel is located in a great spot walking distance from the and the touristy street that includes la boqueria market a must visit the beach is a far walk but a short cab ride and also very totally stay here again if in barcelona,1
2934,spent a long weekend with my partner in barcelona at the start of a two week spain vacation and the serras could have been more suitable small luxurious very well managed with incredibly friendly unstuffy staff impeccable rooms and public areas and with a location suitable to just about everything one may want to do in this great town my partner and i travel a lot have been fortunate to stay in some of the world most wonderful places and the serras is way up there as a city hotel thanks for a wonderful stay,1
2935,we loved love loved this hotel it was the best stay of our europe trip the rooms are modern and clean and the bar and restaurant areas provide great food and drinks be sure to enjoy some time at the rooftop bar the location is perfect to explore the city and safe to wander from at night the staff make this hotel exceptional from check in to check out we received amazing and personal service thank you for such a great stay,1
2936,this hotel is well located very well equipped with beautiful interiors but what sets it apart is its staff from the front desk to the housekeeping every single member of staff we encountered with our three young children was absolutely charming and went out of their way to help us and make us feel welcome they dealt with nosebleeds and a marauding toddler and when i got tonsillitis they ensured that my husband survived the remaining trip on his own the concierge spent lots of time making sure everything we did went well even came running down the street after us at one point to tell us a particular museum was closed for refurbishment i would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again ourselves it is small and the pool is only good for a short dip but that really does matter the food in the restaurant is also fantastic one of the best breakfasts we have had anywhere if you are considering it do hesitate you wo be disappointed,1
2937,our family of adults teens aged had a great night stay at the serras the set up was perfect for people in each room and the location was ideal for our first visit to barcelona we enjoyed the rooftop bar and one of my daughters even worked on her college essay for a few hours up there it is a lovely spot to hang out and enjoy the the staff worked hard to make sure we had towels for the beach water bottles taxis and a fabulous dinner in their restaurant and lots of great spots for tapas we will be back someday for sure,1
2938,wow from location to a free upgrade fantastic staff amazing rooms roof top pool and bar and one of the best breakfast you could ask for certainly going back to the serras when i next in barcelona,1
2939,great little hotel near all the action impeccable service champagne on arrival and thorough explanation of everything in the hotel you get a free mobile device with a ton of local info for walking around down too,1
2940,fabulous hotel with world class service attentive genuine and extremely helpful it made our trip to barcelona especially memorable the restaurant informal was outstanding great food with great service as be back for sure,1
2941,my husband and i ended our trip to spain with fabulous days here perfection in every way the location was a perfect base for exploring the marina opposite las ramblas a short distance away and the entire gothic quarter our junior suite with sea view was a sanctuary to come back to after long hot days exploring and had every amenity you could wish for the sound proofing was amazing no sound from the street below a special mention to the shower my husband is still raving about the design we did eat at the restaurants as i always prefer to get out into the city but we did speak to a couple who had eaten there every night of their stay and they had high praise for it a special mention to daniella at reception she helped us with every request no matter how minor and every lunch and dinner recommendation we were given was spot on overall the service was exceptional i did get the busboys name when we were checking in but he was a joy to interact with for the duration of our stay we travel extensively and always in boutique hotels and i can definitively say for a city hotel this is one of if not the best if you are debating whether or not to stay here stop debating and just go ahead and make the booking,1
2942,after reviewing other critiques on trip advisor i decided to stay with my husband for nights at the serras on my first trip to barcelona it a fabulous location facing the waterfront on the edge of the gothic quarter so close to many la rambla la boqueria the picasso museum and the barcelona cathedral just to name a few the rooms are very modern they give you a phone to help you navigate the city streets and leave you a scrumptious treat nightly the restaurant food day or night is fabulous but the real star is the staff they greet you with a smile drink offer of help set up itineraries i want to recognize angela and the daniels x who went above and beyond in this beautiful city i can go on and on just check it out for yourself,1
2943,we have just enjoyed a wonderful night stay at this exemplary hotel everything was perfect from the moment we arrived at check in to be greeted by one of the many friendly staff members and enjoyed a hot towel and chilled cava while we checked in the room was excellent with a bottle of chilled cava and local delicacies waiting a very comfortable hypnos bed excellent and plentiful malin and goetz toiletries and an excellent user friendly shower each night a delicious little sweet treat was left by the bed a lovely indulgence at the end if a hard day sight seeing breakfast was i particularly recommend the organic avocado sandwich we dined at the restaurant and had a lovely meal where amongst other delights we had the best potatas bravas in barcelona another night the hotel booked a tapas bar for us when we were undecided as it started to no problem as the manager gave us a glass of cava while we waited for the rain to stop then sent us on our way with a map llamber turned out to be an excellent recommendation the roof top bar was intimate and the cocktails delicious the position of the hotel by the born district minutes from the ramblas and overlooking the harbour was very highly recommend,1
2944,we stayed nights in barcelona we had two connecting rooms in the hotel hotel location ambiance food service beds decor everything was star highly recommend this hotel w hotel which i though was very dated and off location reception door man waitress all went above and beyond for service only thing negative was the pool was very tiny and breakfast had limited choices and very expensive there are tons of cafe and restaurants behind the hotel we found a pizza pattza which was pretty decent food in barcelona was expensive compare to in barcelona was amazing at this time of the year although i think it peak of the tourism streets were packed with people everywhere,1
2945,i have traveled far and wide and this is by far on the top of my list of hotels i had a million questions prior to arrival i would email and get instant responses anastasia was always ready with an answer the staff organized dinners and trips prior to our arrival which made everything go so were greeted by jan as soon as the cab pulled up they do have a car that will pick you up but the cab is cheaper he brought up our bags clearly loving his job jan also went out of his way to come to our room with recommendations as he knew we were off to begur other amazing receptionists were daniella and sergio meziane who worked the rooftop bar was so fun and interesting to talk to and then there was sandra i just loved her i asked for coffee with half and half she did know what that was and we laughed and laughed as i explained our strange american ways then she brought me half milk and half cream in different containers and the next morning there she was waiting with my coffee what a were many other wonderful staff i missed some of their names give them all a raise everybody had a smile at all room gorgeous we had the standard room it was huge but it was just perfect the bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in big fluffy pillows and great towels and robes,1
2946,the serras hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel overlooking the marina i can not say enough about the staff they were friendly and helpful with every detail we received a glass of champagne upon arrival and found sweets at night in our room the rooms are amazing contemporary with a classic flare the showers are uniquely equipped with aroma therapy infusions absolutely relaxing do miss the rooftop pool and bar drinks are fabulous as well as the views,1
2947,the hotel serras is the best hotel i have ever stayed at in hotel organised the most wonderful supprise for my wife first started with the guest relations emailing me the great supprise that we organised their word they arranged the most gourgous roses on arrival and hid my daughter at the rooftop bar without letting on the lovely receptionist greeted us at the car and escorted us in to the lobby and then arranged to show my wife a tour around she not knowing that my daughter who she had not seen for nearly months was awaiting with a beautiful birthday cake and champagne was a for her to hotel gos above and beyond to make your stay special and it was thanks to all the wonderful stay at this hotel everyone from the great girls on reception to the to die for restaurant where the food is absolutely fantastic and again service is amazing to the doorman who helps you in every way possible to make your stay special but it starts at the top special thank you to the general manger antonio who met with staff that morning to organise and make sure they kept that wonderful supprise was kept so secret and took the time to hunt us down the next morning to make sure every went to plan a very very special hotel by the way the rooms are beautiful and well soon guys thank you once again for everything regardsdenis,1

2951,enjoyed a few nights in this fabulous hotel lovely staff very helpful and friendly rooms are comfortable and a bonus lounge with another tv and hammock across the hall alcohol on honesty system in terrace bar but everything else is included breakfast snacks lunch soft drinks water they catered for families recommended,1
2952,just spent a few days here could have asked for a better hotel great location but it is the innovation emphasis on conservation and thoughtful touches whc h really impressed plus the all day food and drink lovely breakfast terrace with amazing views staff are excellent one of the best places i stayed anywhere,1
2953,casa camper barcelona really is the perfect place to stay when visiting barcelona not only is it in a great location but the staff is friendly efficient and knowledgeable the rooms are modern comfortable spacious and clean the breakfast is plentiful and delicious snacks and drinks are available all day and the price is reasonable there is also a roof deck a gym your own personal lounge including a hammock free reliable wifi and an outdoor wall garden if we make it back to barcelona this is where we will stay and i would recommend this property to anyone that will be traveling there,1
2954,days stay in barcelona is so short i would love to stay a little longer casa camper hotel barcelona is a wonderful place the hotel design is beautiful and very refreshing to the eyes our room was big and clean love the complimentary food and drinks that they offer we ll go back in this hotel for sure very awesome stay,1
2955,perfect place to stay in we spent nights there clean spacious rooms good service the staff were very helpful and spoke good english i recommand definitely worth the money we will visit again,1
2956,this hotel is ideally placed within reasonable distance of all the major attractions and just a stones throw from las ramblas the hotel staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble the facility of a free help yourself refreshment facility for most of the day was very welcome after a hot day sight seeing and the rooftop terrace with honesty bar was lovely and a great place to relax with friends before after dining hotel itself was spotlessly clean and all room equipment and fittings were in good working definitely stay here again of we return to barcelona,1
2957,our room was lovely comfortable and clean we could walk almost everywhere breakfast had many options and was delicious there is food and drink complimentary available a good portion of the day and the desk was knowledgeable and friendly very consumer friendly and well worth the few extra euros for all the convenience and comfort,1
2958,we are a family of we stayed at casa camper for nights and thoroughly enjoyed it we had a suite which has a double bed sofa bed and hammock which slept and then a standard room that had a double bed and a separate which had a single in it the buffet worked a treat the kids loved it there is a basement area with a bar seating and pool tables the roof terrace has an outdoor seating and honesty bar and a rainforest shower having never been to barcelona this waste perfect place to stay,1
2959,casa camper is truly special and unique i spent nights here and it became home i had the corner suite and it was incredible space comfort light filled and the most heavenly bed did i say the bed yes that bed is the best i have had in all my team is amazing and they make a stay at this property feel full of warmth just incredible enzo francesco valentina morgan isa and so many more i can not remember everyone name but truly the team here is a gift plus the pepe manager of the hotel is so breakfast is excellent and the wonderful team member from argentina who prepares the meals is so so kind and will get you anything you want eggs pancakes whatever the rooftop terrace of this property honest bar and hours snack area really make casa camper feel like it is your home this is my new home when i return to barcelona thank you casa camper team,1
2960,casa camper barcelona is a lovely hotel it is centrally located the rooms are very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and ca do enough for you the breakfast is varied and you can help yourself to soft drinks and snacks at any time during the day on the roof terrace they have an honesty bar which works very well we only stayed three nights but would happily have stayed only criticism is that there are only two of these hotels the other being in berlin and there is definitely room for many more of them,1
2961,this is our third stay at this gem of a hotel it never disappoints clean classy great breakfast great staff and in a good location as soon as we walk into this hotel we feel safe and at home i just know i am in a good hotel that is going to take care of me not one negative comment to make we wish all hotels could be this good,1
2962,we stayed here for nights and enjoyed the fact that it was walking distance from great shopping and eating and a short commute away by bus from sights like sagrada familia we avoided the ramblas as being too touristy and used casa camper to explore the bohemian raval area the fact that we could help ourselves to a healthy choice of drinks and snacks at any hour of the day was an added plus the room combination we had of a living room across the hall the bedrooms are thoughtfully placed at the quieter side of the street was really unique especially with the hammock however note that the shower area does not have a door neither do the wardrobes so you have to be fine with a very open concept,1
2963,we went for a birthday weekend away last weekend the hotel is fantastic decor size of rooms location and to top it all off the staff and service was exceptional they made sure we were well looked after we hired their bikes they booked restaurants for us they surprised us with birthday cake the breakfast was good they have on tap snacks and drinks all day long we had intended to go to the gym but did have enough time and there was too much equipment in the gym but it way more fun to cycle all round the city down to the can not say enough good things about this hotel highly recommend staying here,1
2964,it truly felt like coming home when we came through the doors of casa camper we were just a wee bit afraid that things might have changed since the marvelous susanna martin had left the helm but she had trained the staff well and our beloved georgina was there to welcome us and show us that casa camper was just as fantabulous as ever having been in the air forever with layovers all i wanted was food and protein and georgina led me right to their clever where i scarfed down a yummy sandwich wrap etc feeling revived we headed up to our lovely room and then out the door to get our first glimpse of las ramblas which is so close casa camper is beautifully located and the staff goes out of its way to give you info on wherever to want to go and whatever you want to see and the chef well words ca even begin to describe the breakfasts but if you go away hungry then there is something seriously wrong with you all i can say is that if there was a casa camper in every city where we travelled and georgina could clone herself then i would never have to research our hotel choices again this is a in my book,1
2965,we were two friends who stayed nights at this hotel it is a great hotel we had a room that did not have the lounge across the hall and it was fantastic to have a separate toilet and huge bench space in the bathroom it offers breakfast which is fantastic and snacks all day not having to search out breakfast every morning was a wonderful benefit the room was quite large clean and the beds comfortable the location was perfect off la rambla and within walking distance of all the tourist sites we walked all over barcelona the staff were friendly and helpful when we had questions we also loved the rooftop area it was peaceful and so lovely first thing in the morning we would definitely return to this hotel again it was lovely to stay in a hotel that was not overridden with guests and you had to wait for perfect,1
2966,we loved this hotel well located super nice staff who helped us with everything rooms were great breakfast and all day snacks lovely rooftop deck with honor bar very close to all transportation and the large farmer market ca say enough nice about this hotel if i back in barcelona i would not hesitate to stay here again,1
2967,what an excellent hotel my friend grace and i choose casa camper for our last night in barcelona i wish we could have stayed longer the location is central and fun great shopping restaurants and museums all close by the hotel staff were helpful and kind their restaurant recommendations were great the rooftop patio is such a nice spot one might never want to venture out the rooms are very cool we had a room with two twin beds there were a few drawers and ample hanging space and hooks a nice flat screen tv was mounted on the opposite wall the room had a safe a nice size bathroom countertop dbl sinks the shower was really nice across the hall was our personal lounge it is a totally separate room that only you can access with your key or a button in your room it has a sofa tv table hammock and a balcony that opens to the street below it like having your own apartment in barcelona the rooftop is beautiful nice views of the city and streets below there is a self serve honor bar complete with snacks it had wine beer saki cava a selection of liquor water mixers there was also a board with several specialty cocktails and a phone close by you just decide on your cocktail pick up the phone order and they deliver it up to you from the basement bar breakfast snacks non alcoholic beverages coffee etc are included in the,1
2968,beyond expectations a quiet and well located hotel with excellent services and extremely helpful staff spacious rooms very comfortable beds great showers and efficient air conditioning love the breakfast and garden area would return in a heartbeat,1
2969,casa mimosa was a very nice hotel located on a quiet street but very close to major attractions sagrada familia and plaza catyluna our king sized room was quite spacious with great amenities upon we were greeted with a welcome drink and a very nice overview of the city my boyfriend and i actually got lost walking back from the beach because our phones died and of course we left the map but we spotted another property and they were just as nice in getting us on our way back to casa mimosa next time we are in barcelona this is where we will stay hands down,1
2970,we loved this hotel just returned from five nights at the casa mimosa with two teenagers we had a king room and the kids had a standard with two twin beds their room was small but lovely and perfect for them our room was quite large certainly by european hotel standards the beds were incredible our rooms faced the street which i think i would prefer since the garden although lovely can be very enjoyed the rooftop lounge and plunge pool it was surprisingly not busy even though i think the hotel was full while we were there and has fantastic views of la padrera sculptured roof the staff at this hotel deserve mention the front desk staff was super helpful and housekeeping was perfect i had a snafu where i left a bag in the backseat should have put it in the trunk of the taxi that dropped us at the airport i realized it about minutes after being dropped so the taxi was long gone my only hope of getting it back was that the hotel would be able to reach the driver since they had booked the taxi for us believe it or not when i called him the hotel concierge facilitated tracking down the driver who came back to the airport and the bag was returned to me service above and beyond my expectations we would stay at casa mimosa again in a heartbeat,1
2971,my husband and i were both beyond impressed by casa mimosa the staff were all extremely warm and accommodating our room was clean stylish and very comfortable the view from our balcony of la pedrera was an unexpected but marvelous treat we enjoyed wine on the terrace each night and loved the rooftop pool and bar we also appreciated the proximity to great shopping restaurants and attractions casa mimosa is perhaps our favorite hotel it really made our time in barcelona perfect we will return,1
2972,when u enter the hotel u greeted by the most friendly reception team with the glass of cava what a treat the room was lovely and the was really really nice thank u i think the hotel only been open recently when we did visit back in october last year the pool on the top floor with the view was very very nice,1

2975,i liked everything about this hotel nice rooms great customer service the amenities are also very nice housekeeping does a great job the place is very clean i can highly recommend if you are staying in barcelona i would like if the restaurant menu was a little stronger but also good and the service there was attentive stars if you stay here you will be glad,1
2976,multiple terasses swimming pools small but seems to be the case in a lot of other barcelona hotels very nice personnel decent food at decent prices and a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere rooftop terasse has nice views,1
2977,this hotel is well deserved of its high regard by travelers we spent two days at the casa mimosa to celebrate a very special birthday and thoroughly enjoyed every the moment we registered to the moment we checked out the staff were super pleasant and we mean everyone from maintenance staff to reception bars and catering noah greeted us on arrival with a choice of complementary drinks and proved very helpful in explaining the layout of the city and the hop on hop off others have reported this hotel was super clean with lovely bedrooms and huge bathrooms with and hers sinks and showers the rooms are equipped with coffee maker hair dryer shampoos conditioner emergency shaving kits and large clean towels there was also complementary water and a couple of bottles of our stay the atmosphere of the hotel was very relaxed on a summers evening we would highly recommend relaxing on the roof terrace with a drink in hand watching the stars come out as the night falls if you do want to eat in there are many many restaurants serving all sorts of dishes within easy walking mentioned on checking in that it was a very special birthday visit for my wife which was why we were in barcelona late afternoon on the day the hotel delivered a complementary bottle of champagne small cake and card absolutely amazing thankyou to all the team at the casa service did stop there on our last day we were due,1
2978,lovely little hotel just far enough out of the centre to relax but close enough to still walk most places minute walk to the top quieter of le rambles and block away from the hop off bus route by pedrerahad a suite room with a terrace which was lovely with sunbeds over looking the courtyard lovely swimming pool roof top bar and caf√© on the top also great views and perfect place to chillstaff were lovely also,1
2979,we were greeted by friendly staff at the front desk who helped us settle in for the nights the hotel has a spanish flavour our room was comfortable and a good size we faced out on the street but there was little noise to mention we were less than blocks from the underground and a bus stop across the road a weekly pass is the most economical transit bought inside the station we only had buffet breakfast once good but expensive drinks out in the courtyard was very pleasant way to spend early evening we would definitely return,1
2980,we stayed nights at the casa mimosa in june it is located near the block of discord and has views of la pedrera from the rooftop bar the location is quieter than staying in the old city yet convenient to the subway shops and restaurants the staff was very friendly and accomodating we would definitely stay here again,1
2981,i can not recommend this hotel enough it is the perfect place to stay in barcelona a quiet oasis in this beautiful city it is a euro minute taxi ride from the airport all the major attractions were a euro taxi ride area feels very safe it is very close to la pedrera minute walk and casa batllo minute walk there are plenty of good restaurants close by there is a fantastic bakery around the corner in hotel praktik which does amazing and very reasonably priced pastries for breakfast and delicious baguettes for a packed lunch if you going out for the day pastries filled baguettes a fruit pot and a cake came to only euros there is a small shop a few streets away a few doors up from the tiasanta restaurant that sells chocolate churros which are to die for there is a hour supermarket next door where you can buy water drinks extra milk for snacks etc the hotel is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean the pools and sun loungers are lovely the courtyard is peaceful with shady areas to sit if the sun is too hot the roof terrace has amazing views including la pedrera the room was an excellent size with a lovely big bathroom with double shower the toiletries were great too the bed was huge and so comfortable the air conditioning worked really well my husband took his own nespresso pods from home so he enjoyed his morning coffees using the nespresso machine,1
2982,we finished a two week tour of spain in barcelona and this hotel was perfect for location is excellent it two blocks from a couple of metro stations that will connect you to just about any tourist destination in the city diagonal and passeig de gracia you two blocks from passeig de gracia and three from rambla de catalunya and both will lead you to the rambla and the barri gotic you around the block from la pedrera which is one of gaudi famous buildings but even so close to everything the neighborhood itself is quiet the hotel itself is the front desk staff is professional and friendly offering all sorts of helpful hints to help you enjoy one of the great cities of the world if breakfast comes with your room you in luck the breakfast is excellent you have the convenience of the buffet and the ability to have breakfast items to order the ratings this hotel gets are this hotel has everything you need is close enough to everything you want to see and quiet enough for you to wind down in the evening this is the perfect place to stay in barcelona,1
2983,loved our stay here well appointed rooms and lovely staff the location is excellent with numerous restaurants and bars in the area a hour convenience store next door and a bakery over the road that does croissants and filled baguettes for those not wanting to spend euro on breakfast,1
2984,amazing world class hotel excellent location and great service great attention to detail immaculately clean with well appointed and well designed suites wish i could stay longer the staff are very helpful one of the best hotels i have stayed in you have to come here to see it,1
2985,excellent location with a homey and elegant feel the room we had overlooked the courtyard and gaudi buildings it was so gorgeous the room was beautifully decorated with a ton of detail the first hotel room i seen that had fresh flowers in the bathroom and living area as well as a few bottles of delicious sangria for us the pool top was very small just enough for a quick dip to cool off but not for lounging all day pool drinks were pricey but there was a convenience store beside the hotel with reasonable drinks,1
2986,if you staying in barcelona then you almost have to consider an hotel there are many of them in this great city this hotel is right by ave diagonal and a short walk to the sagrada familia and catalunya plaza both mins the lobby has water juice and snacks for guests there is a nice rooftop bar with a small plunge pool the larger plunge pool on ground level is more appropriate for a swim although still a small pool wifi is free breakfast at person is a little steep but you have plenty of alternative options nearby the rooms are modern and chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and well located,1
2987,we took our teenager children to barcelona for days and decided to be brave by at this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor we can not be more pleased with our choice it is boutique and chic hotel to our like first of all its location offers us minutes of walk almost to everything that we wanted our children to see it shares the same block with casa mila but tucked in the back which makes it quiet the reception desk though a bit short staffed and minimal is friendly and efficient sebastian our concierge is exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly he helped us all the tickets to parks museums and boat rides so we did not have to wait in line all the restaurants he recommended for our lunch and dinner turned out to be exceptional we never had a disappointing meal throughout our stay our family are world travellers and we are all gourmet affectionados the though could be better with more choices makes up with its openness modern simplicity and friendly waitresses our two rooms although could be a bit bigger makes up its small size with high ceilings and large windows and views and gaudi casa mila bathrooms are well furbished lean lined but functional and with all the amenities we need the rain shower is one of the best we come across in many five star hotels we stayed if we have to pick on something we wish its pools would be bigger and more,1
2988,beautiful very large room professional yet friendly service fantastic location near shops and restaurants i could go on and on the shower was the best i had and the room was very quiet despite the traffic nearby,1
2989,this hotel met our expectations and more from check and an orientation conversation with noah to the niceties of sangria bottled water and chocolates in the rooms we just loved this hotel we joined the hotel chain club because if this is how they all are we are definitely staying we had beverages and snacks when we checked in and they were always there when we came back from exploring it is a great location for shopping touring and hopping on and off the tour buses we will definitely go back,1
2991,my partner and i stayed here after much research at the end of june for my were disappointed from beginning to end the hotel was top customer service is second to the moment we arrived with a warm welcome and a glass of prosecco nothing was too much trouble the room itself was spacious light and airy and kept spotlessly clean on a daily basis on my birthday we even had a bottle of champagne left waiting for us in an ice bucket in the for making it a great up the great work,1
2992,what a gem modern hotel with very spacious rooms and super friendly staff we loved the location far enough away that you are in the thick of the tourist spots but still close enough to walk around definitely recommend,1
2993,we loved casa mimosa comfortable and spacious room with balcony and good selection of tv channels in multiple languages clear wifi friendly staff awesome deck and easy walk to metro things barcelona bathroom was spacious and the bed was great after long days on the go no complaints as our stay was a quick and enjoyable one,1
2994,splendid location near diagonal but away from the noise two small swimming pools one of them in the terrace quite comfortable rooms with space and very good ammenities friendly and well decored public spaces very very very good lot of nearby options for dining within walk is a little bit the hotel than the city itself which is have visited frequentelly barcelona for years now and it seems it has improved so little compared with other options but casa mimosa it a must go in the city,1
2995,great stay at casa mimosa it had it all massive comfortable bed with super soft linen double showers and sinks roof top pool friendly efficient staff we visited goudy la pedrera buy online tickets and avoid the queues the restaurant across the road was great too pau claris i d recommend the fillet steak it was done to perfection,1
2996,stayed in this hotel again for nights great location superb comfortable hotel with amazingly attentive and pleasant staff quiet rooms unobtrusive and excellent beds ensure peaceful night sleep expensive but totally worth it,1
2997,wonderful hotel highly recommend the entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home even learning your names great location in the gothic quarter walking distance or a short taxi to most of the great spots,1
2998,the hotel is excellent and their staff are really friendly the historic building is really beautiful like enjoying a piece of medieval history it is in the middle of historic barcelona and close to all the important sites,1
2999,the mercer is so wonderful that i want to keep it my little secret we had such a pleasant experience the rooms are well kept the hotel is stunning the breakfast was perfect every day the staff was friendly and extremely helpful looking forward to returning to this hotel again,1
3000,wonderful hidden away hotel in a great location within walking distance of many places of interest in the city star luxury with a lovely combination of modern and ancient all staff very friendly welcoming and professional lovely bedroom breakfast was the only meals we had at the hotel but that was very good highly recommend this hotel,1
3001,ideal for couples staff extremely helpful and friendly short walk to the main sights of central barcelona but in a nice quiet alley so great for undisturbed nights top pool and bar area which could be made of by the hotel but a nice place to relax of exploring prior to for couples,1
3002,service was phenomenal the staff knows the area what to do where to eat and how to assist you any way you need all of our tickets and reservations and activities were coordinated by the staff at the mercer hotel all we had to do was choose what we wanted to do,1
3003,this is an excellently run boutique hotel in a quiet and central location in the gothic part of barcelona with clean modern rooms a very good kitchen and friendly efficient staff the roof terrace and plunge pool is a bonus in that location,1
3004,this hotel while pricey is one of those hotels that gets everything right quiet elegant tucked away on a quiet street in a bustling tourist neighborhood the mercer has it all the staff is smart and accommodating the roof deck has a stunning view and tiny swimming pool the restaurants serve clever takes of traditional food all the key sites are within walking distance the rooms exemplify catalan chic and are also well thought out and well designed although the building is ancient and was remodeled when it became a hotel the architects and interior designers provided all the essentials kettle closet space reading lights while still keeping the unique historical character it took me a few days to realize we had no natural light in the room as our balcony looked onto the interior warning the hotel didn t tell us that it s hard for taxis to find coming in from the airport our cab driver gave up and dropped us at via laeitana we didn t have heavy bags and were able to carry them but if you need to be dropped off at the door then bring instructions to show your driver leaving is easy as the concierge can call a taxi when you go and they have a special map with walking instructions from the main squares nearby,1
3005,in the perfect spot to access all aspects of barcelona we could walk bike and tour and then return to the rooftop pool for a dip in the afternoon the staff was gracious and welcoming of both me as well as my daughter wonderful visit,1
3006,you would think it hard to write a review for a place that has received so much praise and love already but let me tell you it is quite possible my husband and i had the pleasure of staying at the mercer barcelona during the length of our honeymoon this past may though it been close to months since we returned from our trip we find ourselves talking about the mercer on a daily basis we miss it all it not hard to fall in love with a city like barcelona for us it become a clear favorite but rarely if ever do you feel that the hotel you stayed in almost supersedes the location it in we are avid travelers yet every day we found it nearly impossible to find the motivation to leave the hotel so we could go out and explore the city plenty has been said about the mercer understated elegance and history all well deserved the location in barri g√≤tic speaks for itself the true beauty of this hotel though lies wholly in its staff the attention to detail that goes behind every thoughtful note we found in our room each day the cava left for us as a surprise the perfect room service delivery at this is what makes a hotel memorable though it was never mentioned the staffed figured out i would be celebrating my birthday during our stay and surprised me with cake during breakfast my husband has been able to eat,1
3007,this was the first visit to spain for my wife and me we visited barcelona san sebastian and seville the mercer hotel is in the gothic district a perfect location for walking to numerous restaurants and the beach the hotel staff is exceptional very friendly and helpful our first room was small but had everything we needed upon our return after a week of traveling before returning to the our second room was quite large and we would not hesitate returning to this hotel we return to barcelona,1
3008,stayed at the mercer just after new year the location is perfect for exploring the barrio gotic ramblas and foodies we wanted to visit some nice restaurants so we emailed a few weeks before our stay the concierge were really helpful in organizing reservations at to reserve restaurants in barcelona after our arrival juan at the concierge helped us every day with directions maps reservations advice on restaurants and sightseeing he is one of the best concierges i had the pleasure of staying with the rooms are large with high ceilings well fitted out with very comfortable beds if we go back to barcelona perhaps at a warmer time of year we will stay at the mercer again,1
3009,we loved our stay at the mercer hotel the staff were extremely helpful polite and informative we really felt like we stepped into a hotel that cared for it guests the hotel is in an ideal location in the heart of the gothic quarter and i ca recommend this hotel high enough,1
3010,stayed in the mercer bcn in bottom line the entire experience was wonderful i ca recommend the hotel enough as a luxury option in the mercer is just inside the gothic quarter with el born about a block away that makes it easy for car access and very convenient for walking both to the historic sights and to more food in born the building is a renovated apartment complex with an old exterior but contemporary interior with elegant guest services staff were extremely solicitous and helpful with setting our itinerary including a great walking tour guide mark and making restaurant recommendations i ca say enough good things about the entire team they were also responsive to email requests in we stayed in the mercer suite which has a very large living room and smallish bedroom the decor in the living room was brilliant bright and airy despite the low light levels you tend to get with the narrow streets in the bario gotic the only complaint i have it bathroom design awkward doors took away usable space and detracted somewhat from the we had a small tapas snack good though not great on arrival and the included breakfast which was excellent,1
3011,i took my year old nephew for five nights to barcelona and wanted a small boutique hotel in a good location this hotel was absolutely perfect from start to finish i forgot my tour guide and the wonderful concierge gave us a map and itinerary which was perfect,1
3012,great facilities love the roof terrace very accommodating breakfast was amazing so much choice and try everything cocktails outstanding would recommend to anyone that wants a relaxing break and has cash to burn,1
3013,stayed here for nights with my wife as part of a break for her birthday a beautifully appointed hotel in the gothic quarter the decor is stunning and our room was amazing enjoyed the roof terrace and pool every day of our stay breakfast was delicious and cocktails in the bar were fabulous reception staff and especially the charming concierge were incredibly helpful booking taxis and excursions i have only experienced this level of service once before and that was in bali as has been mentioned by others taxis have some difficulty accessing the hotel due to very narrow streets the driver who drove us here from the airport was not at all happy with our choice of hotel and insisted on dropping us off on a nearby street that said on the occasions that the mercer staff ordered at taxi for us they were very punctual and waited right outside the front door overall i can not recommend the mercer highly enough expensive but very much worth the cost for a brilliant short break,1
3014,the mercer barcelona is fantastic right in the centre of the gothic quarter within walking distance of the main attractions and yet within the hotel there is a sense of peace and calm that takes you away from where you actually are breakfast in the glazed courtyard was the perfect start to the day and the roof terrace was a relaxing place to go after a days exploring and also a lovely venue before an evening out all this could only be achieved with people who have a passion for what they do and all the mercer staff went out of there way to make our stay memorable,1
3015,we really enjoyed the mercer the rooms are but the staff is what makes this hotel unique and superb the breakfast was delicious and quite beautifully prepared each morning we had a couple of with the broken but overall a great location to wander around the gothic quarter from,1
3016,we stayed at this hotel for four nights as a family of four we stayed in a suite and had roll away beds added to the room and still had plenty of room the service was impeccable the linens were beautiful and the artwork in each room and in the corridors were inspiring most of all we loved how the hotel treated us and took care of our every need a few things to consider before staying there the rooms are a little dark with several spot lights that are well appointed in the room so please note this if you are a big reader the pool on the roof is very small so the photo is a bit misleading having said this our two boys went up there each day to take dip while we ordered glasses of wine and looked out over the city in addition it is much quieter to stay in the gothic quarter than in a hotel that faces a bustling street but this means that a taxi can barely squeeze through finally there is the price tag it is definitely luxury pricing but you are getting what you are paying for,1
3017,we enjoyed our stay at the mercer barcelona very much the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was fantastic the mercer was a beautiful palce to stay and end our holiday in barcelona,1
3018,we had a wonderful experience at the mercer i would highly recommend it the whole experience was wonderful great people really awesome team we would return to a mercer hotel in spain on our next trip,1
3019,the mercer barcelona is a stellar hotel with superb service and a kind and friendly staff our family of five ranging across three generations stayed for nights and had to pry ourselves away from this lovely property the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooftop terrace pool is an oasis to stretch and refresh in at the end of the day the breakfasts are elegant and delicious the room service team is up at your door in a snap even remembers your breakfast order from the day before the hotel is extremely quiet yet steps from almost everything you might want to see in thanks to the polished and professional front desk team the savvy concierge and kind tania and sparkling aleix in the restaurant and bar team we can not wait to return and will savor the memories from our dreamy stay with you,1
3020,this is a really beautiful hotel the staff really do everything they can to make your stay pleasant and we were told that our superior room had been given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room which was beautiful a frequently restocked complimentary minibar and lovely molton brown cosmetics we were also given some complimentary patisseries when returning to our room after our first night location is really perfect for sightseeing and is situated very close to the gothic cathedral and the born district with its great is a small pool situated on the gorgeous rooftop terrace and the mercer breakfast is not to be missed my fianc√©e and i had a really wonderful trip and i recommend anyone who wants a plush experience,1
3021,everything was on point here refined to excellence we had a suite and it was worth every penny the bed was beyond comfort and the hotel is perfect in every way highly recommended the main restaurant was closed the day we went there but le bouchon was a nice way for us to ease into our week in barcelona,1
3022,we stayed at this hotel and will never stay anywhere else in barcelona again service is beyond rooms are beautify and rooftop is to die for with only rooms this is genuinely a boutique hotel bliss,1
3023,loved this boutique hotel stayed two nights in a room overlooking the placa so much fun to people watch from your private terrace a bit noisy but that part of the experience the restaurant has great food and great service the concierge was very attentive loaned us a converter for our phones booked us at a superb flamenco club just one minute away highly recommend you will not be disappointed opt for drink and show only eat dinner elsewhere will definitely return one day many thanks to all the staff for their hard work and being so friendly,1
3024,beautiful room overlooking the placa food was excellent there and they went out of their way to find us other restaurants nearby that we could eat in as we are both lactose intolerant would stay there again,1
3025,we came for dinner here in the pla√ßa reial for what was by a mile the best meal we had during our holiday the steak was wonderful and the area provided a great atmosphere all came for a bit of a price but nothing too much more than we paid elsewhere in barcelona we would highly recommend a visit,1
3026,we had a fabulous experience at this hotel from the fantastic breakfasts in the morning the wonderful staff and the really nice rooms it was perfect we stayed in a room overlooking the plaza and had no problem whatsoever with noise at is perfect we walked everywhere can not say one bad thing about this hotel enjoyable,1
3027,one of the highlights of our stay in barcelona was the beautiful hotel it was in the perfect location for our sightseeing the staff was warm and friendly helping us locate a tour for the same day that we arrived the included full breakfast was absolutely delicious and really made the price seem even more of a great value our room was clean modern and comfortable every detail was excellent and we will most certainly return if we ever have the chance to visit barcelona again,1
3028,this was our fourth stay at the hotel do and it is still a fantastic place to stay in barcelona the staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is well situated for all the sights in the city the breakfast is great and the afternoon fruit and evening chocolates are nice touches there is also a free mini bar of soft drinks another nice extra we definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay here again if we visit barcelona many thanks to all the staff for another memorable stay,1
3029,one of the features that mark a good hotel is how seamlessly it operates the hotel do meets this criterion in spades with the courteous and attentive staff all singing from the same hymn sheet to provide excellent customer service the hotel is elegance personified with superbly spacious and comfortable rooms and an excellent kitchen which serves imaginative and fresh food in a variety of settings from rooftop evening dining to al fresco dining facing onto the pedestrianised placa reial my partner jen and i stayed there in june this year as part of her birthday celebration it was expensive for our pockets but it proved worth it a special place to mark a special occasion,1
3030,this place is perfect location placa reial is great atmosphere it is service staff were wonderful and all the added extras such as welcome drink bottle of wine and tapas was great highly recommended,1
3031,this hotel is well located beautifully and tastefully renovated with great big bathroom and storage space in the room comfortable bed and the beautiful floor although the hotel is located in a noisy area double glazed windows worked very well and the staff were always eager to help they even packed a breakfast for our early flight out of barcelona love to go back soon love from sydney australia,1
3032,felt very welcome and cared for the food was excellent and staff extremely attentive i would recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to spoil themselves the best place to enjoy barclona and placa reial,1
3034,we stayed at the hotel do for two nights last week the location is great for people watching and shopping the rooms were and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the local area we have no complaints at all except for one that may not be the hotel fault every morning and night when we left and returned to the hotel we were greeted by a painted swastika on a post outside the hotel,1
3035,we recently stayed for a week in a very spacious and beautifully decorated junior suite overlooking the placa reial this is a historic building sensitively renovated into a boutique gourmet hotel it is owned by one family who own no other hotels therefore the staff attention to its guests to ensure their every comfort is excellent there is a wonderful feeling of camaraderie throughout it begins at the front desk with right through to thrice daily housekeeping the restaurant staff were terrific remembering who we were from day one including our quirky food preferences at breakfast the food was superb with an accompanying comprehensive wine list it was a delight to sit outside for meals watching the activity on the placa we appreciated that breakfast was available on the terrace from am altho one could have eaten inside from we also had room service breakfast on our last morning it was as good as going down to the restaurant so full marks there as well the location was perfect and a cab rank just outside on the ramblas within easy walking distance of most everything from the port up through to la pedrera etc staff were wonderfully helpful recommending and making reservations for us to dine in the evenings altho we did have dinner twice at the hotel and it could not be faulted the garlic anchovies and beef carpaccio were magnificent,1
3036,beautiful and a lot less expensive than we thought it would be even though i was jibbed for finding the most pricey place on the definitely will be back cold cannelloni a treat and best chocolate cake i can street acrobats were cool also,1
3037,although i love to read reviews i have to be honest that i hardly ever write one and if i do it is usually because i had a bad experience and want to warn people that being said i had such a positive experience at this hotel that i felt compelled to write a review i typically stay at star hotels and this is honestly one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at mostly due to the service the rooms are very nice but not over the top they are spacious and it is a boutique hotel so take that into account the location of the hotel is perfect i ca imagine a better place to be in barcelona unless you want an ocean view but we live near the beach so we did not need that the hotel is right in the center of the beautiful gothic part of town next to la rambla and in a beautiful traditional square with lots of cafes and shops my wife and i sat out and read on the square for an hour each day because it was so nice the staff take such good care of you and they do try to nickle and dime you a huge tasty breakfast is included and drinks in the room are included very nice perks there are only rooms in the hotel and they treat you like you are staying in their home i ca say enough great things highly highly recommend,1
3038,high ceilings spacious room excellent quality finishes fabulous staff hotel do is situated in the bustling placa reial where musicians performers and restaurants abound overlooking the action but without the noise from below our room was a tranquil oasis in this fabulous city very clean a little short on wardrobe space and contemporary we loved the wooden floors and furniture breakfast was superb and the roof top pool while small was adequate the wireless internet was excellent a shout out to albert for his friendly nature and obliging service highly recommended,1
3039,we had the best service all around from check in to check out room view location and service was the best very good restaurants close to the hotel thanks again for making this a great vacation my grandson loved the mini fridge because everything in the mini fridge were included in the price it was nice to have a cold coke at the end of long day walking,1
3040,my husband and i spent our last four nights in barcelona at this excellent hotel we could not have been any happier with our beautiful room and the service provided by mayre and the rest of the hotel do staff we stayed at hotels all over the world and the level of service provided by the hotel do plaƒáa reial exceeds almost all if one is a light sleeper or prefers peace and quiet it is imperative to have ear plugs and perhaps even headphones the first night i went to bed without using these and i was awake at scouting around the room to equip myself so that i could go back to sleep people party on the pla√ßa reial all night long it is kind of strange that such a refined hotel would be on a plaza that is so much like the latin quarter in paris but there you have it so go equipped and you be okay once i used both ear plugs and my bose headphones and took a melatonin i was fine but it truly required all three of these things to be able to get said the hotel provides so many lovely touches such as complimentary tapas and wine really dinner the first night fresh fruit every afternoon delicious breakfast every morning nespresso in the room complimentary drinks in the refrigerator these really do compensate for the crazy plaƒáa reial and the location could not be more convenient for getting around barcelona in,1
3041,this was a good surprise very friendly and helpful staff nice and quiet rooms with a super comfortable bed the shower had the best water pressure ever very important when you have long hair and wash it the had a bit of a british private club feeling about it the only downside was the pool on the rooftop or lack thereof it was more a bassin i just want to write that in case you are going there and are expecting to be able to swim,1
3042,just an outstanding experience although we were only there for one night a very special place to stay only one caveat although still worth five stars the location while fabulous in other ways is inaccessible by car or taxi taxis can approach a nearby street larger vehicles car service autos etc can only approach further away get your driver to call the hotel as you approach and they will send a porter and luggage cart rooms are small although very smart deliberated about how many stars to give location in the end gave five would have given less if i was mobile if i had a mountain of luggage or if it was pouring with rain,1
3043,our party of six adults stayed here only night before leaving on a cruise we all want to go back and stay longer everything in this hotel was top notch the bellhop met our party of six down the street to take us to the hotel there is no grand entrance on a street with a sign you actually walk down an alley way to the entrance the front staff was more than professional they were extremely friendly and will help you in any way possible we arrived in barcelona without luggage and they tried to help us track it down the day we were scheduled to check out it was raining as we were stepping out to go to breakfast the front desk offered for us to borrow umbrellas while we walked around we did even have to ask stayed in a tiny category room which was more than adequate for a night or two the bed was extremely comfortable the shower was absolutely amazing and the toiletries provided were loved hanging out on the rooftop at the bar bartenders and staff were amazing and take such pride in what they all highly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed,1
3044,absolutely stunningly designed boutique hotel in barcelona loved the location gothic staff food drinks the burgers and mojitos are delish the rooftop deck was lovely as long as you do want to actually swim the pool is only about a foot deep but we really did mind the guest rooms and baths are beautiful and well appointed the whole of the hotel including the is but i am sure that is intentional we found the small room a little challenging to manage with two large bags overall lovely,1
3045,the reviews of this hotel are outstanding but there is definitely room for improvement my fianc√©e and i stayed for nights the room was true to its title tiny a little too tiny for our suitcases and clothes there was also no full length mirror just one mirror in the bathroom and the room and hotel in general were incredibly dark so much so we could see where to put our key in the door the fact that there were only dimmed lamps in the room resulted in dodgy makeup application not a good look the bed however was incredibly comfortable and i would love to order the pillows so very soft the rooftop and cooling off pool was lovely and basically our own private rooftop until friday hit this became busy and we were happy we had plans to get out and about there was also very loud music on the thursday night until very late whilst the hotel is seemingly trying to tick the every soho house type boutique box going perhaps a few little friendly touches to make the rooms more practical lights and mirrors would enable every guest enjoy the experience not just bachelor men i felt young single and very much intending to mingle men was the target audience for this hotel,1
3046,first of all the staff at the wittmore was the friendliest ever all of them are supernice and helpful great job from all of you the hotel has a courtyard with a small restaurant and bar on the rooftop there are sunbeds and a small pool not for swimming breakfast is preferrably taken here maybe lunch as why only rated a four the light difficult to see where to put the key when entering the room difficult to pack your bag unless you put it on the bef finally the bathroom need more light difgicult to make a proper,1
3047,just back from a stay at the wittmore overall a positive experience but just one or two issues that stop it being fabulous this hotel is really stylish and exudes exclusivity starting with the discreet entrance the staff are very attentive and extremely pleasant you do feel they would do anything for you small touches like bottles of water etc are appreciated our arrival was marred however by the receptionist insisting we had booked a tiny room despite my confirmation clearly stating we had booked a large double room she was happy to give us a large room but at a cost stating that the double room stated on our confirmation actually meant large double bed anyway the manager pilar arrived and dealt with it immediately and professionally ensuring we had the room we booked this exchange lasted only a short time but the wittmore must know first impressions are crucial and having to debate about what you have booked is ideal the rooms are smaller than other hotels i have stayed at but that is well documented on the website so should be a surprise they are also extremely well appointed and the toiletries are fabulous however there is no full length mirror or if there is i could find it which brings me to the other downside this hotel is dark really dark and while i get it is all about the ambience it becomes rather annoying we had trouble unlocking our door it was so dark lets,1
3048,days barcelona shopping dining and a spectacular concept the wittmore was our home great location friendliest service ever melania lovely rooftop with very small but usable pool and great service again with a had a great time thank you,1
3049,we stayed for nights and really liked the hotel small boutique feeling with personal service the rooms are big and the breakfast is excellent can really recommend this hotel the small pool is ok with a wonderful herbgarden on the side,1
3050,we were received by a very serviceminded staff explaining where we are where we can eat drink shop etc no rush and she finished everything with a smile very cosy hotel nice rooms and a welcoming reception area,1
3051,we had a pleasant stay the staff is really nice and has your listening great atmosphere in this hotel a few steps from the montju√Øc park and min from the metro the only thing that bothered us a little was that there was no fridge in the room i would come back,1
3052,we had a great stay at hotel brummell checkin and out were very easy the desk is covered they helped us with excellent restaurant recommendations local tips in the trendy local area reliable help with taxi bookings and restaurant reservations when needed and the staff were always friendly and helpful the in house cafe has great coffee and breakfast for before you head out for the day interior design and facilities were really lovely we were able to walk to most areas of town from the restaurant and found it a great location away from the tourist area in barcelona but close enough to all the action and sights we would return here,1
3053,an awesome hotel and restaurant experience the hotel itself lives up to its promise of s unique boutique hotel with very friendly service and all possible amenities the restaurant was simply brilliant every dish a work of art,1
3054,the rooms staff and service were star hands down houses a michelin star restaurant staff gave us a tour of the room and went through everything including how to work the shower would stay there again in a heartbeat parking was i think this should be a courtesty to their guests especially since its such a small hotel,1
3055,my wife have booked us there as my birthday gift the best one i ever got in my lifeabac is unique experience for those who love top class kitchen and needs to be made well in advance few months to explain all the details and experience but the word unique describes is best from the first moment during entire stay there that took us few hours to go through entire large degustation menu and enjoying it fully till leaving the place and the mood taste and absolute enjoyment lasts for weeks,1
3056,a beautiful calm oasis in a relatively untouristy area of the city but still just a short taxi ride to the city center rooms are quiet and have an elegant simplicity staff is very helpful and most speak excellent english as we had an early am flight could not take advantage of the michelin starred restaurant but the continental breakfast served en suite was delicious the exercise room spa and swimming pool were also pleasant surprises will definitely return when next in barcelona,1
3057,a very small intimate and well kept property located several km from the city center but just a few meters from a subway station that will bring you there in minutes our room was large unusually comfortable and equipped with electronically operated black out drapes the staff was attentive but not obtrusive we chose not to eat in its famed restaurant and we were directed by helpful staff to several options nearby we found this property a slight bit overpriced but not outrageously so the quiet and care made it a reasonable value,1
3058,my husband and i stayed nights at the abac hotel before departing our cruise wonderful personal service beautiful room and charming property cab ride or subway to city center from this hotel located in a upscale neighborhood there is also a star michelin restaurant here however we were not able to dine at the restaurant during our short stay would definitely stay here again my only negative is that i wish the lighting in the bathroom was better,1
3059,this is a very modern style of hotel with a somewhat confusing layout having two elevators and clear sides to the building this caused some confusion in our party the rooms are lovely and well apportioned and our terrace was fantastic we ate dinner in the restaurant which was amazing and i review elsewhere all in all a little eclectic but rather wonderful,1
3060,from the moment we arrived we experienced top notch service by the hotel staff the concierge staff provided us with a map and took the time to explain how to get to many places of interest our room was spacious and beautifully decorated the bed was comfortable and we loved the tv in the mirror we ordered room service which was delivered quickly and was delicious throughout our stay we felt pampered in every way great hotel i would love to stay there again,1
3061,after careful research i chose el palace for our night stay in barcelona before boarding a cruise ship i was not disappointed gorgeous hotel fabulous breakfast buffet wonderful rooftop views room was comfortable elegance we even went to the cigar bar in the basement where my partner enjoyed a special cigar the staff and atmosphere makes you feel aristocratic also i have never stayed at a hotel that has had such a lovely smell throughout was it the fresh flowers the location great with walkable streets tapas bars i could have stayed a month or more,1
3062,we stayed four nights at el palace hotel we enjoyed our stay very much the staff were extremely friendly and showed us our way around the town it also located in a good position away from the super busy tourist areas yet close enough to walk the hotel was also really clean and room service was done few times a day most of all the lobby area is gorgeous we would definitely stay there again,1
3063,i stayed here with my family since there were children i asked for connecting rooms the hotel provided the rooms exactly as i location was also very good all major attractions were within min walking conceirge provided me plenty of information to go around my children also loved the way it general my family would come back to this hotel next time,1
3064,have just spent nights at this hotel absolutely stunning the decor is sumptuous and elegant the staff are wonderful the beds are like sleeping on clouds beautiful huge bathroom it really does feel like you staying in a palace divine,1
3065,charming classic hotel with elegant old world interiors and large spacious suites rooftop pool and terrace where drinks and food can also be ordered enormous bathrooms with high spec modern walk in shower and large jetted had a junior suite for nights stay and found it invaluable having a sofa to collapse onto after hours of walking the gothic excellent breakfast buffet laid out in a charming room which appeared to be a garden room plenty of choices and excellent attentive found my cappuccino a tad too strong so they were very happy to make another one and next morning i found they had remembered how i liked it you like older style stately hotels but with excellent service and larger rooms then this one is an excellent choice not too far to walk to a most helpful doorman who was always on hand to advise the best route to take to get somewhere very useful as there was a taxi strike on whilst we were there so this made walking the main mode of it was quite hot also i should state that the was excellent as we like a cold room for sleeping did not let us down every staff member in this hotel was utterly professional right down to the nightly turndown definitely stay here again,1
3066,this gracious old property is absolutely top notch it is not an edgy new world place it is of the class of a ritz property which it was until and has been extremely well maintained the rooms especially for europe are generously sized but what really sets the place apart is the staff they are excellent the concierge desk in particular is extremely knowledgeable and helpful highly recommended,1
