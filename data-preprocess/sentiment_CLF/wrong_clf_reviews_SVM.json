        "we stayed here for nights and although the hotel was modern quaint and clean we had a really bad experience with the customer service first we could even communicate with the concierge at the desk as they could barely understand english we were told a certain price for some of the services but then another price was charged to us eventually while we were not even aware of this we ended up being scammed into paying way too much euro for laundry services also because of the language barrier we ended running into problems with hotel booking sites and this put a major damper on our trip as we could not get the information we needed and were stuck confused and misinformed hotel customer service was unwilling to help us out not willing to make sure we had the best experience possible the hotel cleaning services were great as our room was cleaned every day"

        "before booking i read all of the most recent reviews and knew what to expect noting the noise comments i emailed the manager in march months before our visit and requested rooms in the back of the hotel i included pictures of the emails in this review upon arrival with email in hand i was told by the manager that an email stating that rooms have been allocated does not mean they are guaranteed i was very disappointed in this misrepresentation of a management statement the accommodations were basic as expected we did not sleep well as a result of the street noise and the flat pillows i did use earplugs and i would suggest doing so it may save your sanity the room and bathroom was clean bring your own soap theirs is low quality we did enjoy the breakfast before heading out for the day it is a buffet and we found the price to be the same as surrounding restaurants serving a regular breakfast"
