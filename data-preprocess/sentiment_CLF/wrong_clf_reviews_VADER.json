maps and received a friendly welcome on the first evening what should have been a relaxing bar experience after our journey was another disappointment the bar man focused his attention solely on mature american guests and ignored us when it was quite clear that we had empty glasses on our table and required service there was certainly no excuse for this as the bar was not busy in addition our bar dining experience was yet another disappointment having ordered and received our steaks they were both not done as requested in fact they were medium rare no service check was provided to enable us to easily rectify the situation one would expect this to be a natural part of the food service in a hotel of this standard worse was to come we attempted to order desert only to be told that the kitchen was closed again guests would expect to be warned of the impending kitchen closure whilst finishing ones meal so that any final orders could be fulfilled staff attitude and communication left a lot to be desired in this instance after receiving a lack of information at check in we approached a member of staff in the coffee area to enquire about hotel facilities however before he could ask him a question he stated", "i stayed nights in may at the waterloo house the house is quaint my room had a nice view and breakfast was delicious but my experience was tainted by electrical issues in a nutshell plugging my laptop adapter in a power outlet at this house killed the adapter here s how it happened when i first arrived in my room i noticed one of the lamps would not turn on i notified the clerk at the desk that the lightbulb was burnt but she said that this outlet did not work adding that the electrician could not figure out why fine i thought i ll use other outlets and i should have been more suspicious of the state of the electrical wiring because as soon as i plugged in my laptop to charge it in another outlet of course the power went out in the room and my charger had a burnt smell i notified the clerk again and while she was very nice she did not seem particularly surprised and suggested i talk to evelyn corcoran the owner evelyn nicely told me that this hardly ever happens indeed she said this had happened before but to other devices i understand this is an old house that s part of its charm but a faulty electrical system is not what i expected being in dublin for work i needed to be able to charge my laptop so i went to a computer store the employee said the frying of my", "motel one is far from the city centre and top attractions the central station is very far top attractions and canals will take you around minutes by the public transportation staff were rude no bath available just shower no iron or british electricity adaptors were given rooms

decision if i will be going to amsterdam again i will go for another option", "whilst rooms were breakfast excellent our holiday was ruined because on out of nights our sleep was constantly disturbed by revelers on our floor doors banging people running in the corridor and loud shouting when reception was approached both during the night first thing in the morning they showed little concern and even appeared to be amused no apology was given ironically a card is left in each room with a quote from the dalai lama sleep is the best meditation what a joke", "michelin starred restaurant closed for vacation not mentioned when booking concierge did not follow up when promised on a reservation we had to follow up on status they were unable to obtain a reservation day lost along with any chance to obtain a restaurant booking a street restaurant for us turn down service hit and miss omg the basics had to ask for that also in fact had to ask twice each time for the simplest of requests this hotel is living on a reputation and most certainly do not understand that a star reputation has to be earned every day that is why we pay so much who knows it may be your turn next to have our experience", "stayed here for convenience to as i was going to a concert if i was just coming to visit dublin i would stay here it out of town although a taxi is only feels very isolated no restaurants pubs etc next to it the hotel itself is a very modern design nice enough executive rooms with a balcony are very disappointing overlook a construction site noisy too superior double rooms feel a bit claustrophobic windows do open i had a family room which was very nice with opening windows overlooking inner courtyard so very quiet would definitely recommend this rather than balcony rooms or river view rooms the river view is rubbish bed was comfortable good hairdryer iron etc complimentary which was a bit disappointing the dull lacks atmosphere and boring background music played the same it seems each night strange menu mix of asian food etc after the concert the public bar closed by we were told to move to residents bar again very dull boring at over per night i ca recommend this hotel", "standard quality hotel for what is the reason to offer a standard business hotel for a price of a lux hotel if i want to sleep and to eat a hamburger and drink a beer i do not want to pay such kind of high price", "stayed here nights concert weekend in a standard room facing the the hotel is located a bit outside dublin center but the tendering due to the was limited and prices were high taxi to center is train station nearby to center per room was a bit old stylish but beds were quite good there were some noise from the neighbor room and the buffet service was rating is low due price value consideration we payed per room and for that we expect more but maybe that what to expect during dates", "we stayed here nights in an ocean side room on the floor of those nights two were disturbed by an extremely loud concert nearby which made it impossible to sleep the first went on until am the second is still going on but it is am as i write this and the music is still playing

staff were friendly our room was very disappointing i had stayed at the hotel before and had a lovely room so that what prompted my husband to book it we were visiting family in dublin and my husband booked the hotel as a surprise my husband paid euro a night for a deluxe king room and the room was shappy there were stains on the carpet and chair and the bathroom was outdated with mold on the tub we have stayed at numerous upscale hotels and have never had a room like this we had a view of what looked like ac units and a garbage area and he booked it directly with the hotel the door to the room was directly beside the bed which was awkward when paying these sort of room rates you expect a better experience we had to wait for the room to be ready which was annoying as we went in after normal checkin time sadly i will never stay at the hotel again", "positives are the hotel is very close to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum a minute walk will also take you to the temple of zeus and the stadium the plaka is a min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of athens at the end if the plaka you will find the ancient agora the acropolis metro is only a min walk that will take you to other parts of athens the beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to deg we had this for three days there is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee you have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so breakfast is rather tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm now fermenting the fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice coffee was via a nescaf\u00e9 vending machine tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from at least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you wo get a good night rest the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in athens you might want to", "so after a fab stay last week where the hotel ended my stay with a

too upon complaint i was finally provided with a double though it took forever for staff to get the key to me so i had to leave my suitcase outside my room and leave for work my colleague was not provided with a double now am now on the rooftop bar and there are no spaces i say that i am happy to chill by the pool what say fine though now i can not have a drink pathetic eventually the staff redeemed themselves by providing me with an awesome seat gazing at the acropolis service from the short chap with short blonde hair was exceptional if the rest of the hotel could replicate this service it would be good", "we unfortunately stayed here three nights as our first stop in ireland we shared a twin bedroom on the first floor for one of those nights which was miserable the hotel is very dated but the location was great so we muddled through our stay but left very sleep deprived our shared room was directly over the bar so we heard music most of the night i would be shocked if there was any insulation at all in between the floors on top of that the room was very hot there is no so if you want to be cool at night you need to leave your windows open which means you will hear everyone walking home from the bars at and you will be awakened by the sun at in the summer there was no sheet which i learned is typical in ireland only a thick covered duvet one woman at the front desk staff was grumpy every time we went up there however the woman who sat us for breakfast every morning made up for the bad experience she was delightful cheery and remembered our large party liked to sit together the breakfast was typical and pretty good i ca say the same for lunch mediocre we enjoyed the fact that there was a large breakfast and lunch room where we could sit and play cards during down time the elevator was weird in that you had to insert your card every time you used it and it", "the staff at the regency hotel were very friendly and helpful at all coststhere is a weird layout to the hotel that if you are on certain floors the lift does not go to you have to get off at one floor and take the stairs it was a nightmare i got to my room and i asked to be switched and the receptionist got me another room straight room was not much better there were cigarette butts on the window sill questionable stains on the pillow and bed cover the was very the cleaners would come in even when you have a not disturb sign on the door the hotel has a nice pub downstairs which i have no complaints hotel is a bus ride away from the center of dublin and a min drive from am

safe the staff was nice and helpful i do recommend for people in holidays just for fast business trips", "this would have been good for a hotel but not for hilton top of the line we stayed for three nights and the experience was a let down two nights there was no turn down or attention to the room the concierge service ranged from outstanding to i ca be bothered but the front desk was outstanding two out of three breakfasts were terrible the buffet items were outstanding but after seating and the initial coffee the wait staff had to be called they never would come back to check to see if we needed anything that was not on the buffet i felt they may have been shunning staff at lemuel bar and lounge generally did a good job", "this was the biggest mistake i have made on my trip to ireland please learn from my mistake this place must make money on the bar only it did not look like they put any money into the hotel itself the sour smell in the room was horrible the twin beds leaned to one side had to use a pillow to stop from rolling off the bed cramped small the bathroom was so small you had to turn sideways to get into the shower that did not have hot water the music and young kids started lining up at for a night of fun do worry but they were leaving but then again the staff would start putting the empty kegs on the street at sooo enjoy the hours of sleep food was not hot or tasty the dining room was a makeshift coat check at night made sure it still had a wonderful aroma in the morning for breakfast please note pay the extra few dollars and find a better only plus side walking distance to down town", "the room i got had a beautiful view of the acropolis but the air conditioner did not work and it was a very hot night luckily i only needed one night because i was leaving to the islands the next day the hotel is outdated and the towels looked old and overused like everything else you get what you pay for the location of this place is a plus thought it close to plaka and monastiraki the area is safe and it has a lot of restaurants at walking distance", "the room was clean steday wifi freat th floor and secent breakfast pretty far from the city center but all pales compare to the bed we ordered a double bed and got teo twin beds pushed togeter with a flat twin mattress on each which didnt even fit the bed i dont know how a hotel which respects itself

party agent other through hotel website family is due to arrive into athens early september we only require one room i have asked the hotel if there were interconnecting rooms advised no rooms of that have paid close to aud for two rooms for one night i asked if it was possible to remove one of the rooms and perhaps use the cost in theory to upgrade to a room facing the acropolis request deniedi was told that i could just cancel the room via the third party agent spoke to ihg guest relations explained the situation the agent was helpful and understanding at no point did i ever seek a refund knowing that the terms were prepayment and the agent contacted the property directly on my behalf to try and negotiate some sort of upgrade given the cost of the room unfortunately the guest relations agent was advised no i would have to pay for have a young family two children under they can not utilise the other room to be honest i am not upset that i booked two rooms i take responsibility for that however i was hoping the property could see it was a mistake and perhaps compensate us a little so am i looking forward to my stay no sure all i know i have tried to contact a management and there is no response i am hoping", "i ca complain about the location of the hotel and the size of the room but the cleaning service is very poor and our bed we were staying in a room smelled strongly

quite expensive especially if you traveling with your family", "the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations", "holiday trip with kids i ordered rooms for nights reading all the reviews i was certain i had a great place to night aircondition did not work the staff are well trained to apologize coz all they said was we could get you a fan for tonight is that why i am paying

believe in rooms were nice in the morning we had a visit from a big cucaracha in the room at the the clerk at the reception asked us how the stay was i said we were hungry on arrival and the took too long we were not happy about the cleaning as there was a big cucaracha in the room a few days later we called in to ask for a leftover gadget however as it was charging in the bathroom easy visible it was not found by the cleaning normal compensation for a stay in a hip hotel like the mirror would be to offer a stay for free however it seems like this hotel has some management problem", "stayed here at the start of july when we arrived after we payed and asked for a receipt but we were told we would recieve the receipt as we checked out at the end of the week we were then told our room was ready and we could check in until when it states on the website that we should be able to check in from onwards when we checked out they tried to charge us again and we had to show that they had taken

location next to christ church dublinia museum and temple bar area near hop bus stops hotel had a very limited area aside from bar and restaurant breakfast was good but food quality in restaurant for dinner was poor no fitness center staff was not very friendly and most seemed like they did like their job rooms were standard and clean overall we just did find the hotel very inviting and comfortable as a family we just did want to hang out there", "i can under stand when hotels get busy that you need to wait but when people who are booked in advance at least groups by my count are told to wait some over an hour while off the street are checked in well that is clearly all their rooms became available at once so clearly there is no coordination between and front desk they could have avoided the problem by having housekeeping release the rooms for check in one by their systems are more important than the a pleasant stay", "this hotel looks like a converted grand house in a posh part of town there are many period features with some very like in decor at first it looked inviting but then not very coordinated the room was very dated it had a period fireplace but a shabby wardrobe the lovely white sheets covered a poorly spring mattress not very comfortable for sleeping the period like bathroom features looked lost next to plastic door showers with shower heads that did not function well and shaving sockets that felt loose and did not workit is probably unusual to complain of barmy summer heat in dublin but you have to when the room is stuffy and lacks any air conditioning there was no extractor fan in the bathroom the open window was the only cool air to my surprise ear plugs were available in the bathroom their use only become apparent in the evening as the night club bar noise reached decibels as recorded on my mobile app this persisted until hours and was punctuated with sirens followed by shouts and incoherent ramblings of drunk party goers this also explained a bouncer on the hotel door when i arrived he asked if i was staying in the hotel does the hotel entrance also lead to the bar in dublin according to the bouncer i booked through a third party i asked the desk about the noise element in the morning there was no answer at and they did tell me that the", "i am sorry i was unable to write a proper review on this hotel as i was ill

or response my booking organiser advised me that the hotel stated that my payment was non refundable and that was had not asked for a refund instead a rescheduling however the hotel has felt that it is perfectly acceptable to collect over euros and provide no service whatsoever feel hotels are supposed to be hospitable and friendly i feel this one has shown neither and i would strongly recommend that you check all terms and conditions if considering a visit", "we have stayed at hilton before but this hilton d m barcelona does not reach the hilton standard that we usually get pool area does not suit for the kids family as they around half naked topless drunk lady dancing with a very very loud music around the pool and inside the pool with champagne i took this with the hotel but said it was ok here in barcelona to go topless but what to go topless is find but get drunk and dancing topless when there were so some kids around that a disgusting behavior and it a joke that hotel stuffs did allow about the hotel is that stuffs in executive floor are polite and friendly not all of them but many of them and they stuffs at pool area also polite and friendly but the guest service when you dial from the room are not that friendly do know if it how they talk like this in spain or she sound just unhappy or impolite to me the girl i talked to at pm on back to the room housekeeping were polite but the forgot to put towels for us we went for swimming and got to shower direct when we came in and found out we had no towels at all in the shower and another thing that bothering me was one

the rest of the bill in advance finally on sorting this out by having to go into the hotel a week prior to check in thankfully i work close by on check in when the other lads arrived again they were asked for more money i went to the reception and informed them that it had been paid in full using my credit card this was accepted but i was told they would have to look into it yet again leaving everything in the balance until checkout i have never stayed in such an unprofessional place that continually asks guests for money i realize they said it was a mistake fine but there was no

bedroom and having my luggage carried upstairs i went to unpack surprise the closets are on the first floor back down the steep staircase with my luggage in tow but how do you open the closets or turn the lights or even the tv my remote did work even the bedside lamp required instructions when using the desk it was inevitable that you hit your head every single time on the light fixture that hangs over the chair and my knee got a bruisin from hitting the desk drawer when trying to avoid the pendant light the furniture is low to the floor a trip factor comfortable to net the experience the designer thought about clever unusual or even and not guest convenience yeah there is a user manual to explain it all but who wants to read a manual for normally", "the hotel was clean and close to

million years on the face value however i had no choice but to stay the bare minimum i require from a hotel is its clean this hotel was filthy that enough to not to ever book it please see the pictures quick points was no ac the taps did work shower leaded and was wrapped up with tape noisey view from the windows in our room was laughable lovely roof covered in ac units that do work covered in mould sheets i could go on do not be fooled into thinking the location will make up for negatives of this hotel there are other hotels book those instead that the hotel the dinner show the table

tours and school trips etc so it is very busy it has a pool on the top floor which is nice but the personnel is unfriendly as can be if you have children that can swim well you have to be inside the pool too to take care of them the pool can be visited from am to pm very short time the breakfast buffet is a bit expensive for what it offers so you are better having breakfast in any of the coffee

to be the smallest hotel room i have ever seen one side of the bed is flat against a wall therefore you can only access the bed on one side the bathroom is unbelievably small the basin is so tiny you ca even wash your face without water going all over the mirror yourself and the floor as you sit on the toilet you are squashed between the door and the shower positives of the hotel include air conditioning nice balcony however always too hot to use staff where friendly the location of the hotel is perfect and very central and good water pressure from shower negatives include very small room

are still in bed we went to the pool at on the first morning the advertised pool opening time and found clubbers sitting there surrounded by empty champagne bottles smoking cigarettes there were cigarette ends in the pool we decided to go to the decor is cheap and nasty and the rooms are tacky i hope you dont mind going to the toilet in full sight and sound of your we had a corner suite tacky

stay was i think the young man who checked me in only spoke to tell me my room number the room was so small that either my husband or i had to sit on the bed while the other was up moving or we would

extra bed put in the room it was nearly impossible to open the closet door which was by the way the only place to put our clothes which was ridiculously insufficient the barely functioned blowing out almost no cold air when we complained about this they tried to convince us that it worked perfectly which was a terrible way to handle the situation and a total shame located a few feet from our room was a cart of cleaning supplies this made the entire hallway smell terrible which was disgusting for any hotel let alone one of this supposed caliber and for the icing on the cake our room was filled with construction noise from some construction project which they supposedly did not know the origin of nobody got a good nights sleep while we were there we wrote an email to management with no reply clearly they do not care there are plenty of other hotels in barcelona all of our friends who went to barcelona stayed at other hotels that were at the same price point and had completely", "showers are elevated which often results in water leaking onto concrete floors so it a high skip hazard my wife slipped and almost sprained a knee they could be sued for that if we were room designs are poor the shower basin was in middle of room so everyone in room watches younger ready never seen that before was location central to tourist spots fine for a day or two overpriced for what you get and better value at euro is fine but cheaper cafes al bother eating too close to hotel as it surrounded by really dodgy tourist trash cafes seems the so called cafes exist to sell dope and not really sell food except to stoned tourists who do know any better recommended that you get away from hotel area to eat tripadvisor has many recommendations on good places use that i am unlikely to stay here again given the safety issues and pricing and tourist trash food in the area", "this hotel would be a star in australia but even then you would get some complimentary coffee or water in the room safe broken no mini bar no room service they have vending machines hotel bar never open receptionist bell boy managing entire hotel to their credit room was nice bathroom amenities are basic sachets of soap and shampoo no toothbrush body lotion etc was expecting so much more for the was its great location and housekeeping service", "we had a table booked as part of a hen do we ordered of a set menu choice of starters mains and desserts once we had sat down it took a while for us to be acknowledged and the service was slow for the whole we only ever saw waiter would be a lot better if they had more staff they sat us in a dark corner was provided at the table however he asked us if we wanted to order drinks then before we answered ran off and did return for minutes so we had to go downstairs and order wine at the food was hit and miss the starters were all delicious however the burger i had was over cooked and served cold the music was extremely loud and difficult to talk as a group as could hear people across the table drinks were extremely were only toilets for the ladies not enough for a venue of this size so gave up queuing to go at one point must have been waiting minutes also one toilet had no toilet roll this is more of a bar than a restaurant even then drinks are very overpriced probably due to it also being a hotel mostly tourists visiting overall i would not recommend this hotel for a meal for a hen party", "just left the burlington and felt i had to post this beautiful hotel and ca really fault it for comfort and appearance however we just spent the night in room and never slept a wink a domestic argument in room until the wee small hours put paid to that my partner was going to phone police it was that bad paper thin walls did help and we heard everything there was wall punching door slamming roaring shouting swearing what appeared to be slapping and lots of crying it was nothing short of a disgrace the management had already said the hotel was fully booked so no point i asking to change rooms it was before we got any sleep and only then because the female left i accept that this is no fault of the hotels but i paid for a bed to sleep and could it was cheap either i reported to the girl on check out who seemed wholly disinterested always liked the hotel but doubt i stay again going home completely wrecked after what was to be a comfortable hotel stay", "to start off with this hotel is right in the middle of barcelona and exactly where you want to be the hotel was very beautiful and from the outside very well kept we are a family of four so went with the family room which essentially is paying for two rooms our nightly fee was for this price we had high expectations once in our room we noticed a horrible smell coming from the vents that was definitely something deceased in the ceiling we immediately alerted the front desk and nothing was done therefore all four of us slept in one of the rooms as our kids did sleep in the other because of the smell the next morning i went down to talk to the front desk i was told there were no rooms available to move into therefore i booked a room at the fairmont for the price of this hotel upon check out they magically said let me talk to the manager the manager was very kind and went and acknowledged the state and smell of the room he did offer us an upgraded room but by that time it was too late as we had already booked a different room at the fairmont being told previously told there were no other rooms available we were not offered any type of discount and paid full price for the night we stayed even though we only used one of the two rooms we are currently now at the", "so to be fair i did intentionally book this place the company booking system flagged it up as ok and i saw double tree miles from city centre and thought it be impressions of the place was rough it on the wharf and really not an appealing part of town at all kind of in the middle of nowhere and a pretty awful looking hotel however was really well appointed and the staff were lovely the breakfast was good and the coffee ok the gym was not really as exciting as it sounded on the website it basically a runner cross trainer bike and a few dumbbells all n all nice rooms and hotel just not the location", "unless you in town for a quick overnight you should find another option rooms totally outdated no air conditioning bad wifi connection no channel options on tv no ventilation in bathrooms worse coupled with hot week and no air expensive breakfast that is much better than a free continental breakfast no fridge in rooms front desk staff is friendly but did not get the same impression from the staff in the dubliner restaurant attached large amount of inviting seating space in the great because it much cooler than the rooms when it hot excellent concierge staff who help with the usual tourist stuff info about airport trips and getting taxis excessive bar smoke in the evenings if you staying in rooms with windows open above the restaurant", "this hotel is in the temple bar district i was disappointed with the price of the hotel and the size of the rooms when we first got there i was given an room that was already occupied than was given a room that was so small you could hardly move in it is in the temple bar district it was very noisy at night until am due to the night club in the hotel and clubs on the street the breakfast in the morning was wonderful i would recommend this hotel for the young at heart", "if you like a small room untidy floor and industrial extractor fans all day then this is for you i stayed in this hotel before and took into account the location and the fact that the building is old the beds were comfortable however this time there was no escaping the fact that the room had not been cleaned and the noise level was beyond ridiculous previously i had been at the front of the property so nightlife influences things considerably but the room this time was so small there was no escaping the noise it sounded like the window was fully open and it was the only quiet place was the bathroom and had there been a bath i most likely would have slept there having had a terrible sleep even with ear plugs i stepped out of the bed to go for a refreshing shower and found that a piece of pepper that had been around the bed not mine became stuck to my foot the level of gross was not pleasant to say the bar is lovely the location great if you completely deaf and the rooms a roll of the dice for the area there are better choices that give a good nights rest", "the rooms were not fresh and there seems to be serious plumbing issues in the building i had to change rooms and i had to ask for help with the toilet three times in total the price is just too high for what you actually get considering the fact that the breakfast is mediocre the coffee is very weak and the selection of bread etc is limited and that there are a lot of drug dealers hanging around the block the trains that pass connolly station shake the whole building every ten minutes the walls do not isolate sounds very well so you will hear all vehicles driving by as well as what your neighbours are up to go figure the carpets in the rooms as well as in the stairs and hallways of the hotel are dirty and not fresh the most positive thing i can remember from my stay was that the receptionists were friendly and service oriented when i told them about the plumbing problems they were quick to apologize and to address the issue but for the price paid i would have expected a higher quality on the rooms and of the breakfast", "it a below average dingy hotel with better alternatives for the same rates at nearby locations it very outdated hotel with outdated furniture that have stood the test time but their time has come reception staff were just fine but nothing to write home about location was good but i had stayed in a nearby hotel slightly better location for the same price but that was very modern and fully refurbished i think it was called definitely would stay here nor recommend i would highly advise a full refurbishment to the furniture and dirty carpets", "we booked our stay with and somewhere the information got lost we booked standard room with breakfast i need my coffee in the morning but the lady in the reception was telling us no she looked down at us the breakfast is keep that in mind even if you book it may not register and off course that not her fault but there is no need to make costumers feel ridiculous really what is when you pay a night so it not about the price but the way they carrying themself the room is clean but definitely not the room was well made and good condition but if the staff can not understand basic communication with customers then you are in great loss", "first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people", "hotel location looks good so we booked may be the cheapest room because we only spent one night in athens the room was too small and did have any window its ok thats why it is the cheapest room but what about the towels their colour went yellow and smell very weird and the bed also smells like that just try another hotel there are many options in the centre of athens", "up until my last day i would have said i loved this hotel it was clean a great location helpful front desk staff i stayed here for nights on my last day i noticed money had been stolen from the safe in my room of course the hotel staff said this was impossible i am sure it happened being a solo traveller i keep close tabs on my money i allow myself a certain amount each day and count my money every night i was extremely upset and disappointed this happened and on my last day since i was catching a train early the next morning i did have time to report this to the police i did fill out a complaint form at the hotel needless to say i would recommend this hotel it was expensive to stay in and then i was robbed", "we stayed here for nights and although the hotel was modern quaint and clean we had a really bad experience with the customer service first we could even communicate with the concierge at the desk as they could barely understand english we were told a certain price for some of the services but then another price was charged to us eventually while we were not even aware of this we ended up being scammed into paying way too much euro for laundry services also because of the language barrier we ended running into problems with hotel booking sites and this put a major damper on our trip as we could not get the information we needed and were stuck confused and misinformed hotel customer service was unwilling to help us out not willing to make sure we had the best experience possible the hotel cleaning services were great as our room was cleaned every day", "this hotel has a great location and should bar food is average and the service very slow it also is intentioned staff need better customer is my first experience with half a cup of coffee for the price of a full coffee top ups lot of work to is a reason why three sets of tourists walked out service needs serious improvement in this bar there are much better options in dublin"], "1": ["we booked and paid for the stay however owing to circumstances beyond our control we had unexpectedly been called back to england at that time we were at the ibis in bruges when i used their wifi system to inform the hilton in amsterdam that we had to cancel our booking this was done on tuesday morning at around i firmly believed that i had given the hotel plenty of notice of my cancellation upon arriving back in england at around pm dieppe i discovered that the email was sent by the iphone when it connected at home i have subsequently sent two emails asking for a refund and received no reply just goes to show how bad wifi can be cost me because email not received before checking in beware anyone using wifi abroad make sure that if you are relying on email to cancel bookings that you also phone hotel to check a very expensive and unfortunate lesson not of my making would much rather been in amsterdam than hospital here visiting dad", "overall the hotel is tremendous i did not give a for a couple of reasons the front desk staff is not very friendly and in particular francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out overall that did not affect our experience much but it is something they could work on none the less also the housekeeping staff was very pleasant but only of days did we have turndown service which again not a big deal but is part of the price also two of the days we returned from our long day outside the room and at it had not been made up this was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room all day everyday yet our room is last i tip the cleaning service everyday so it could not be that it probably explains our difficulty on the first day we got there at and asked if early checkin was possible the woman at the desk said the cleaning people are outside your room now so it should be an hour or less well we came back in an hour and a half still not done this was the time she reminded us in a teachy condescending way that time is uh we know you told us we could check in earlier so we left and came back at around still not done this is when francesc mansplained that the check in time was so we knew that", "the location of this hostel is really convenient right next to a major train station there is also a large common area for lounging the rooms can be a bit difficult to handle with so many people assigned to one bathroom but it manageable", "the hotel is very snazzy the room was spacious breakfast ok the service was good conference services were fine slow wifi at times on the bad side no irons in the room the one they brought me had rusty stains which came off on my shirt no good the rooftop pool is ridiculously tiny why bother at all with something that can barely fit people across every lap pool i have ever been in anywhere in the world is much wider than this one the whole deck is so tiny that people were splayed out on the hard floor with barely a inch to step around each other and there were relatively few deck chairs hotel charged euros for me to use an indoor spa area for one hour with a big jacuzzi and tiny sauna", "the student hotel at amsterdam city was overall just what we needed at the end of our week backpacking trip we stayed nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with people so we really appreciated the privacy cleanliness and an actual quiet and comfy bed however i do have two criticisms that i believe can be easily fixed firstly our room was never cleaned even though we put up the please clean our room sign not a big deal but just letting you know secondly when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city we accidentally biked all the way to the student hotel amsterdam west when we tried to return the bikes we were sure why our bikes did match the bikes there i checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at my boyfriend and i did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel when i was about to check my email receipt my phone died but we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel we started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when i saw that our bikes said amsterdam city and the other student hotel bikes said amsterdam west this was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place it turns out we were", "i booked this hotel based on the relative closeness to airport and that they advertised that they offered airport shuttles be careful these are limited as i found out positive notes lovely girl on reception very friendly but she was a trainee and had to keep going off and asking questions this meant a less than speedie i had already been up travelling for several hours and just wanted to get into my room it was now late afternoon the apartment block was in a separate building across the street very very spacious apartment bedroom even though i only booked a bed very different in terms of a lot of black so it seemed quite dark the bathroom was all black tiling and very poor lighting excellent shower but it did leak all over the floor the kitchen was weird in that even though it had a microwave etc there was no cutlery or plates so even if i had managed to find somewhere to buy food i had nothing to eat it the internet was very poor and could get a connection at all phoned reception for assistance they said they send someone calls later and plus now getting very frustrated a lovely guy finely came got me connected using an staff access he escorted me back down to the main bar area where i got a couple of glass of wine and me again via a staff internet access restaurants close by and as a single female traveling", "the hotel is close to the beach there is an area full of restaurants it also quite close to the zoo a bit further than the nearest metro station there is a bus line in the front street that can take you directly to the aquarium nice breakfast choices ice cava was a novelty large room for the rest of town we had to use the metro which means x to walk the line close by is not really well connected which means you always had to switch somewhere the view well if you see the sea it ok the sunrise was quite orange some of the buldings nearby look however depressing", "a little far from airport and shuttle requires fee free for hh members dinner was good also had entertainment in bar which was also good bed was a queen but was two less than twins couples together not great but we were exhausted and slept well", "my friend and i were put up by airbnb at the last minute in the orange suite due to trouble with our original host and we literally could not have been happier to be here i spare you the details and suffice to say that from the moment the hotel staff member opened the door to our room we could not keep our cool the hotel is within a five minute walk to dam square and a short twenty minute walk to the rijksmuseum the breakfast was well worth it with fresh squeezed orange juice and prosciutto staff was friendly and always willing to help us out it also right on the canal and very tastefully decorated our only complaint was that the suite was located on the ground floor and the foot traffic can be a little loud but we were so exhausted we barely noticed", "asked for a double bed or twin beds with double sheets got confirmation prior to arrival but once at the hotel we were given twin beds with single sheets which were still not changed to double sheets in spite of asking reception staff as well as the cleaning staff", "larissa metro train station is metres away the room was clean the pool on the top deck is a bonus only negative is that breakfast is basic and the bread on both mornings was stale reasonable value so no real complaints", "we stayed for nights in early july overall the hotel has a hip vibe and is clean and very had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine the front desk staff was attentive and careful what you ask for my wife wanted a tub so we requested the tubbie room one of the only rooms with a tub it is on the top floor in the back building and requires a flight of stairs to get to once you are out of the elevator inside the room there is a very small entry that is dark and the light switch is hard to find and another very narrow spiral staircase up to the attic where the room is so no matter what you have flights of stairs to get to this room in the room there are several beams going across it at a height of less than if you are that tall you will have to duck several times when walking across the room the tv is obstructed by those is no closet or dresser only an open structure with of pole space and a couple of hangers there is no place to put suitcases the lighting in the room is door to the bathroom is translucent and unfortunately the toilet is right beside the door so anyone in the room has a full if cloudy view of whoever is on the toilet and what they are doing the bathtub is a claw foot type and is out", "i stopped by here before my business meeting to find that the gresham has now been rebranded as hotel riu plaza the gresham it still as impressive as it was before and the selection of teas and coffees were second to none it a wonderful place any time of the day", "highly recommendable for location nice hotel people at the desk are helpful room has everything you need the pub next door is a bit loud but one is so tired in the evening that it does really matter because you fall asleep right away", "the region has numerous derelict buildings all around as grecian economy struggles yet the prices inside this hotel are astronomical ie small bear and a vodka tonic euros and i know your paying for your surroundings but they were no different to any other hotel i regularly stay in and although the rooms were nice its just kind of spoilt when you feel like you being ripped off with the prices for everything profit is a dirty word but greed would be a more appropriate one such a shame that this is the main thing remembered on a hotel visit", "i booked this hotel mostly based on price and location we were in dublin for the concert and visiting the city for the first time so i wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis the hotel was great there are four of us two tall teen boys in tow and i wanted to be sure we were stacked on top of each other i read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations it did and then some upon arrival we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready fine since it was well before scheduled check in i pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the us that flights arrive in the morning but the hotels are always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation americans have of being arrogant travelers we saw this again upon arrival at this hotel americans angry that no room is available at am checkin is clearly noted as pm if your flight arrives at am and you want to be in your hotel at am you need to book it for the night prior if you can not do that then do", "very nice hotel with rooftop pool wish there were more seats by the pool can be use the restaurant so ca tell you how it was but the seating outside was not available for food service only drinks we woke up in the middle of the night because the staff was clearing dishes not a good time to do that but mostly very good and convenient to sights bus taxi etc", "strategic place to stay the hotel is in amsterdam city near to station shopping center clubbing etc just walk a step you find everything you need the services is excellence but unfortunately there is no lobby are for parking a car"]}
