0,0,1,6,good location good breakfast which is included good wifi and tv pity they dont offer a buffet meal too especially on sunday night when there is nothing worthwhile to eat in this area without getting back on public transport only negative is no fridge,VADER
1,1,0,33,booked this based on the beautiful best western we used in london nothing like it do trust brand name terrible area did feel save old shabby hotel no help with luggage up to room smallest bathroom i ever experienced only thing that was okay was the breakfast wo be back there,VADER
2,0,1,50,the hotel was nice and modern the restaurant was also very good the public transportation is right outside the hotel which is convenient but i did realize it was really downtown we walked downtown and it was a minute walk the round trip public transportation price is about per person or all day the staff gave us bad information about the taxi to the airport though said they take credit cards they did not and said it would be to depending on traffic but it cost we had to run inside and pay the fee at the atm to pay the taxi driver this was a taxi that they booked for us,VADER
3,1,0,59,i think this hotel is too pricey for what it offers it is placed in a very dirty and crowded zone the rooms look old and need updating the room assigned to me smelled like someone had smoke in and it is a was extremely noisy the hotel and outside super noisy all the time i do understand the prices we pay compared to the quality of the experience it speciallymakes me wonder who works there and if they can be trusted as they do not have respect for the comfort of guests the sheets had little wholes in many places the floor was scratched a lot i sensed a really bad smell in the halls one of the receptionists was cranky and moody when people requested things that do match what he wants but are normal people requests i sense some entitlement here that needs them to be reminded of who paying i mean if they ask for so much money they should care about people and listening to them i do need rudeness or crankiness if i paying for a service if you do like your job please change it i insist that the price is too high,VADER
4,1,0,92,hotel is ok kind of location is not bad but not a walking distance from attractions rooms are quite small and breakfast is very basic i would explore another hotel if i go again to barcelona it has elevators one was down during my entire days stay staff are quite helpful with good english communication,VADER
5,0,1,103,we stayed one night and had two rooms for people rooms were spacious and comfortable did not eat at the restaurant because the breakfast price was outrageous within a minute walk to one of the hop on hop off bus tour stops which was convenient for us do even think about getting laundry done price is per item for a pair of underwear to be laundered hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood,VADER
6,1,0,117,after much thought my daughter and i decided to meet in athens greece for our first european vacation my daughter lives in south korea and i live in new jersey we thought it would be the perfect vacation we planned it for months and decided after much investigation to stay in the melia in athens greece our flight transfers and all of our plans went perfectly except for our choice of hotel there were many issues with this hotel the internet did not work well the room was not very clean the shower was moldy the blow dryer did work and when it was replaced we could use it in the bathroom we had to use it over the vanity and it did not have a cord long enough to reach over the vanity to use it but that was nothing in comparison to the security issue that we experienced an electrician from the hotel entered our room without any notice to fix the internet that what the management at the hotel said this worker proceeded to leave our room with the door propped open he said he had to check something n the basement this left our belongings exposed to anyone and everyone who passed by for more than five minutes i happened to return to the room to find that situation when i went to the management at the hotel they tried to tell me that the room was unattended when clearly it was the man who left,VADER
7,1,0,152,when the best thing you can say about the hotel is that you liked the front desk staff know it not great truly the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional we booked an eight day greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through italy for weeks through an aegean travel agency we had two nights in athens before heading to sifnos and serifos islands and then one night in athens again before ending our trip we were picked up at the airport and transferred to hotel economy by a great taxi driver i guess we should have known by the hotel name what kind of place it would be first of all it basically in the red light district as i would call it there are therese two minutes in any direction the hotel is very dated the beds are hard and the pillows are harder the bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind they could use plastic shower curtains you flood the bathroom when you shower thank goodness for drains in the floor you have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs actually sort of handy the refrigerator does work when you leave the room it connected to the key so there no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour it very noisy outside as well as above you the continental breakfast starts ta that late if you from the us it a pretty,VADER
8,1,0,172,the staff were very nice from top to bottom the pub was nice and the breakfast was good the room was dirty and in great need of maintenance do look under the bed the lamp shades were barely hanging on the hot water faucet was loose the shower was leaking and the safe was in operable and broke either they plan on selling the property soon or plan to rent out each room until it ca be rented again the one i was in was very close to this point but on the positive side the location was great they can arrange parking for you about a block away underground and the staff is very nice bring earplugs and an open mind do pay too much and the place will be fine,VADER
9,1,0,187,be aware this hotel has two small rooms on each floor which do not have windows to the outside they have small windows that look out into a very dark small open central lobby it is our first time staying in hotel with no windows to the outside we were unlucky enough to get one of these try to sell you on their buffet breakfast euros reduced to euros if you book breakfast for the entire stay bear in mind that you can get a baguette sandwich plus a coffee for about euros from any of the little pastry shops around the hotel we did bother with their breakfast option and were glad we front desk staff is especially this one lady who works nights the only helpful person we found was maria who was very gracious and helped us with check out,VADER
10,1,0,204,came to dublin as a treat after recovering from an illness our room was shabby with the formica peeling off the furniture stains on the lampshades and grouting around the bath discoloured the air con was outdated and noisy the shower was extremely low powered the room was at the back of the hotel on the ground floor with virtually no natural light getting in therefore had to have the light on all the time how depressing large blue bins for refuge collection were lined up right outside our window the breakfast was just ok the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and courteous as were the staff in mcgettican cookhouse the food here was very good and great value,VADER
11,1,0,219,first the highlights updated hotel with comfortable rooms and a great breakfast in a great neighborhood secondly the disappointments as a gold honors member and mile flier i have stayed at a few international hotels the staff never quite got all of the amenities in my room right each day no new coffee most days bathroom amenities missed most days daily water was hit or miss on my last day of i asked for water to be replaced and was told the hotel policy was water only on the first day of arrival really this is the first major brand international hotel where i found the complimentary water rationed to one day i explained my concern to the staff and they had no answers penny wise pound foolish i will not be back,VADER
12,1,0,228,the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,VADER
13,1,0,229,very expensive for such an old fashioned place after paying as much money as we did you would expect a little more comfort quite disapointed on the plus side the staff were as accomodating as they could been,VADER
14,1,0,238,it was not a good expensive and the pool is top room for all the view from the suite were to a construction they were so kind to check us out before that was positive thing and the man in the reception were,VADER
15,1,0,240,though it a four star but there was no sign of welcome rather no doorman to open the door or porter to help u with the luggage and the outside stairs are too broad to pick ur luggage n take it till the standard room category is considered to b the lowest n they treat u as if u they r obligating u to let u rooms r very small and bathroom small in nh collection milan and straight from there came to this nhcity centre hotel which was a terrible feeling after seeing the rooms n the do have any the room was neat n clean the bedsheets ver super white n so were the towels in the honestly i m waiting to go to my next destination a little claustrophobic,VADER
16,1,0,245,the walls are very thin and the staff is very loud the rooms are very minimal the water was off the first day we got here and the electrician did let us get much sleep into the next day there is no guide to calling the front desk in the rooms and when one person smokes in their balcony every room smells it keep looking there are so many better options in this city this just seems like a careless establishment there are better prices for better locations,VADER
17,1,0,265,clean secure and central in dublin expensive for what it was a tiny room with single bed and shared bathroom worked out at on hostelworld for a midweek night should be cheaper as comparable prices around dublin can get you lots more for an extra or,VADER
18,1,0,280,well the rooms are superb and the air con is awesome for athens hot and dry summer also the staff in reception is very helpful but all these became a distant memory very soon after i entered my room i only stopped for hours to get some rest from a long ferry journey as i was catching a flight to holland and within minutes of settling into my room the lady cleaner did her best and all sorts to keep me and am sure other hotel guests awake do know where to start from but here as some of the noise some events that i heard from outside my room vacuuming next to my room and above me buckets loads of water being dropped for mopping cleaning cupboards being opened up and closed at least times the lift which is not the quietest to put it mildly must have been used for the cleaner at least times going up and down plastic bags being shuffled doors opening and closing for several times toilet seats being rigorously hit against the toilet base objects being dropped without care who sleeps in the hotel iam sure i was not the only one that was kept awake its only a small hotel for gods sake with probably around so why the f all this noise in the middle of the night will the queen of sheba arrive by any chance want a full refund and an apology for the inconvenience caused,VADER
19,1,0,289,terrible do know where to start cheaply decorated tiny room and even smaller bathroom morning man on reception is by no means but not rude like the grumpy old man in the afternoon evening we never been spoken to in such a rude abrasive manner the only decent thing was the balcony,VADER
20,1,0,294,i checked in my first day in athens before leaving on a week long drive through northern greece and booked a room for july and was assigned room a premium room it was mediocre at best but for one night did not mind it upon my return i had also booked a night august for one night also a premium room and was given room i had booked both nights before leaving on the trip room was substandard to say the least dirty and frayed curtains bad causing around sink old shower head was probably from the original construction low water pressure when i checked out and printed these out to the desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and ignored me i surprised this hotel still has it best western affiliation if it does i bet that room was not inspected,VADER
21,1,0,296,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,VADER
22,1,0,331,worst hotel i have stayed in there no ac holes in the door holes in bathtub dirty carpeting and a nightclub in the basement that goes till am someone should buy this hotel and make it fabulous it probably has really good bones and could be redone as a boutique hotel the staff on the other hand was very kind when we told them we had to leave due to the noise and the lack of air would recommend this to anyone,VADER
23,1,0,346,you can hear noise from next room walls are not sound proof location was the greatest to down town the rooms are not clean all the time very dusty the hotel breakfast was not good no variety,VADER
24,1,0,386,room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,VADER
25,1,0,406,the honest of the assistant service personal is questionable i lost an important mount of money of my room and they didnt anything to find it i make an pólice report in the pólice station and i waiting the results,VADER
26,1,0,420,stayed for nights room has a strange layout in a l shape and very little storage space numerous stains and dirty marks on the floor had a stunning view of the hotel roof fencing and walls quite noisy bed was small and creaky paid nearly euros for nights i paid half that in other chain hotels and had nicer room bed and service bar in the hotel is very expensive and the service is poor pub next door is brilliant disappointed with this hotel brilliant location just very poor value and standards would love to return to dublin but i would not stay here again for what it cost,VADER
27,1,0,431,my husband and i stayed here on sunday th june we arrived at pm to check in but our room was ready which was fair as we were mins early we took a seat like we were asked and tried again to check in at pm unfortunately our room was ready so we were told to leave our bags with concerige and try later we left the hotel to get some dinner and returned and tried again to check in at pm we were asked to present proof of our booking by the young man on the desk as they had no record and then we were told for the third time our room was ready we were annoyed at this stage and he offered to get the manager he returned after almost ten minutes to say room was ready no manager we received no apology no welcome to the hotel that seemed to be only for the guests who rooms were ready and no refreshments while we waited we like a lot of the guests checking in we in town for the phil collins concert and the room prices were increased to reflect this euro plus euro for parking gate for the concert opening at pm so not giving us adequate time to refresh before hand we were the only ones having trouble getting our rooms on time and the manager should have come out to apologise but he left the young man on the desk to deal with,VADER
28,1,0,451,stayed on lower level room basic room bathroom door did shut finished to poor standard inside tiling was bodge job and grout was green windows did seal people letting in all of the noise from passers by through out night did sleep friday night in dublin reception did seem interested after we told them of the issues no apology room which was worth it wish i booked something else,VADER
29,1,0,460,it is a shame as the staff work so hard to assist and make your stay enjoyable but the constant construction works and noise is off putting from early in the morning into the evening hammering drilling workmen shouting and banging of doors it is near impossible even to take a restful hour in your room during the day as it is located on a very busy main street with bars and clubs and an outdoor concert venue just down the street people party literally to the crack of dawn so expect to not have a decent of the works the rooms was too warm as the ac is not functioning all making for an exhausting stay on a good note the breakfast is plentiful and fresh,VADER
30,1,0,466,this hotel is in the temple bar district i was disappointed with the price of the hotel and the size of the rooms when we first got there i was given an room that was already occupied than was given a room that was so small you could hardly move in it is in the temple bar district it was very noisy at night until am due to the night club in the hotel and clubs on the street the breakfast in the morning was wonderful i would recommend this hotel for the young at heart,VADER
31,1,0,471,rooms are tiny no privacy glass doors on en suite rooms very noisy can hear everything from room next door waited mins to be served at bar gave up went down the street to a supermarket bought our own drinks great restaurant next to hotel,VADER
32,1,0,477,i was dissapointed with the service we was stay four wasnt redy for wasnt enough towel and bath producs even service was verry am never dissapointed with any hotel ike this before,VADER
33,1,0,486,if you like a small room untidy floor and industrial extractor fans all day then this is for you i stayed in this hotel before and took into account the location and the fact that the building is old the beds were comfortable however this time there was no escaping the fact that the room had not been cleaned and the noise level was beyond ridiculous previously i had been at the front of the property so nightlife influences things considerably but the room this time was so small there was no escaping the noise it sounded like the window was fully open and it was the only quiet place was the bathroom and had there been a bath i most likely would have slept there having had a terrible sleep even with ear plugs i stepped out of the bed to go for a refreshing shower and found that a piece of pepper that had been around the bed not mine became stuck to my foot the level of gross was not pleasant to say the bar is lovely the location great if you completely deaf and the rooms a roll of the dice for the area there are better choices that give a good nights rest,VADER
34,1,0,495,beautiful hotel lovely location nice breakfast great buffet the hotel was not cleaning service in the room is not we had days no shower gel the other day we had no towels for two you can walk in and out nobody was talking,VADER
35,1,0,543,let start with the positives friendly helpful staff great welcome cloud pool good food lovely place to chill out in the evening and barman chris was fabulous pool good toolocation mins from alimos marina so handy if you hiring a yachtthe tv worksso the negatives we booked a family room and got two rooms not interconnecting ok for us as we have teens but not great for younger rooms were functional at best decor dated patched up in places and they reeked of cigarette smoke shower woefully inadequate fell out of its holder several times bulbs missing it on a very noisy main road despite double glazed doors and seemingly some rooms have thick blackout curtains and others not breakfast basic meat cheese bread yoghurt etc all ok but overcooked cooked breakfast fried eggs like booked through ba and the reviews were ok but seriously this is a very basic hotel we were here less than hours and that was hours too many,VADER
36,1,0,574,hotel is older but clean cozy yet comfortable we were looking for a place to lay out heads this fit the bill price was good you get what you pay for like the big bang theory the elevator does not work but we knew that ahead of time this hotel is in the heart of the temple district with shops bars and numerous restaurants just outside the door we found all forms of transit within simple walking distance staff is friendly no early checkin,VADER
37,0,1,578,went to a concert here last saturday to see coldplay and the place was run exceptionally well the only downside was the cost of beer or wine as they have you inside they can charge what they will but it was very well run and with people leaving was no problem,VADER
38,1,0,591,we picked this hotel over another athens hotel because it had dedicated parking and a pool we arrive and my husband goes to park only to be informed a car is too big and we are not allowed to park there i was not happy however the front doorman came to the rescue and found us parking garage he was so nice and had great customer service skills and was the only good thing about our got up to our rooms needed to book because of our big family to find twins bed pushed together in each room not the best but it worked the furniture is dated the tvs are ancient smells like smoke and there is no shower door or curtain it is just a half glass wall so water goes everywhere to top it off they charge euro a day for internet access in the room and that is only for devices probably the worst thing about this hotel is the pool area they have a beautiful rooftop pool with a bar however it is a very small pool area it is lined with chairs and people sunbathing on the ground so you can hardly walk around the pool we arrived at the first day at knowing it closes at with kids in tow the lifeguard proceeded to get an attitude and tell me that there are no more towels and we only have mins to swim so we should come back tomorrow well my kids were,VADER
39,1,0,596,loved the vat pub traditional irish music after from somewhere pounding driving music from nearby venue kept us awake all night long front desk was interested the next day when i reported it it more like a hostel taxi driver had had an ominous smirk when he dropped us off now i know why,VADER
40,1,0,608,whilst rooms were breakfast excellent our holiday was ruined because on out of nights our sleep was constantly disturbed by revelers on our floor doors banging people running in the corridor and loud shouting when reception was approached both during the night first thing in the morning they showed little concern and even appeared to be amused no apology was given ironically a card is left in each room with a quote from the dalai lama sleep is the best meditation what a joke,VADER
41,0,1,662,a little far from airport and shuttle requires fee free for hh members dinner was good also had entertainment in bar which was also good bed was a queen but was two less than twins couples together not great but we were exhausted and slept well,VADER
42,1,0,692,i can under stand when hotels get busy that you need to wait but when people who are booked in advance at least groups by my count are told to wait some over an hour while off the street are checked in well that is clearly all their rooms became available at once so clearly there is no coordination between and front desk they could have avoided the problem by having housekeeping release the rooms for check in one by their systems are more important than the a pleasant stay,VADER
43,1,0,704,stayed here at the start of july when we arrived after we payed and asked for a receipt but we were told we would recieve the receipt as we checked out at the end of the week we were then told our room was ready and we could check in until when it states on the website that we should be able to check in from onwards when we checked out they tried to charge us again and we had to show that they had taken the money on our banking app otherwise the stay was pleasant and the hotel is in a good location,VADER
44,1,0,706,let s start with the positive parts the location is great the pool area is wonderful the view from the rooftop is breathtaking and the reception is professional and service minded beside this it s hard to say much more positive our rooms were smelly a bit runned down and not properly cleaned the sides of the bathtub were dirty and there were hair in the corners of the bathroom the elevators are small and slow the staff at the breakfast were rude and the client computers were old and outdated could be that the hotel has been renovated in but nothing seems to have been improved changed since then,VADER
45,1,0,710,not brilliant rooms thread bare carpets on main stairs smells of damp in the stairwellwardrobes knocked up by inept carpenters bathroom had mildew on bath surrounds and the sink was sunk into what seemed to be an excuse of some old piece of kitchen work surface radiators were grubby rusty plaster falling out of wall supports good attempt to hide that behind the curtains folks advice for prospective guests avoid room advice for owners sort it out and put a bit of your profits back into your business all this for for two nights room only welcome to the rip off parliament hotel,VADER
46,1,0,715,i paid approx for a room for one night breakfast not included as my partner and i were down to dublin to watch coldplay i will admit it was close to croke park upon arrival the guy on reception assumed my partner and i would want single beds being guys when i corrected him and said the double was fine he smirked and went ahead with checking us in the hotel must of been grand and luxurious at one stage but it is dated and old now a bit of reinvestment by the owners would do wonders for the business the bedroom had old creaky furniture which was too big in a small room the bathroom was tiny but did have a nice selection of soaps and products a wet room would be much better here the room was spotless and there was a kettle and coffee but no tea also in the room is an iron plus board and a hairdryer there was no air conditioning unit and the room was roasting would have been ok with windows there but we could open them more than a crack although we were there on a saturday the area did have much happening and seems to be pretty quiet the hotel has a pool and leisure facility which we did have time to but you do need a code from reception to get into it a carvery was offered in the and upon inspection we decided it would be better to,VADER
47,1,0,732,the clean towels are stored on top of blue plastic on the floor of the hallway these clean towels are exposed to people shoes dust and other pollutants the shower doors are closed allowing water to spill on the bathroom floor room was dark and dank a substandard hotel at best depending who is on duty results in pleasant or unpleasant communication to generate the requested results my request for shampoo led to the maid busting into my room after knocking only once i was naked to prove to me that she had put shampoo in the good point is that it is in close proximity to the city,VADER
48,1,0,735,the room i got had a beautiful view of the acropolis but the air conditioner did not work and it was a very hot night luckily i only needed one night because i was leaving to the islands the next day the hotel is outdated and the towels looked old and overused like everything else you get what you pay for the location of this place is a plus thought it close to plaka and monastiraki the area is safe and it has a lot of restaurants at walking distance,VADER
49,0,1,743,the hotel met our needs it located close to the dam square the red light district and the central breakfast was very reception staff was took a room in the fifth floor it was basic room and very small but it did bother us because we spent all our time outside but if you plan to stay more time in the hotel room you should ask for bigger room,VADER
50,1,0,751,not normally something i do as i believe that people have off days but i just had to comment on my recent stay at w hotels as i found the following to be causes of checked into the hotel from another hotel in the city as we changed our flights and wanted something a bit more in keeping with what we re used to and decided to book at the hotel at and went directly to the floor for check in we were advised that the room would be ready shortly and that they could take our bags and would be returned to us upon to the room and that they would contact us directly by text to advise the room s availability it came to and we had still not been contacts so we went through to reception where they d my payment card even though i had already provided full for recommendations of lunch and was given a suggestion of the focaccia dip and the spicy tomatoes the tomatoes were lovely but the focaccia was burnt and then asked about the spa facilities in the hotel and were advised that they were indeed closed for the day due to unforeseen being a guest at hotel de lerope in amsterdam i decided to visit w as it was a more modern hotel and thought that it would have a younger and more feel to it but this did not live up to the calling reception times over the period,VADER
51,1,0,759,for being a hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high forgot our orderlazy in the barservice remote did worktook the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without askinggave us the wrong billthe staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service not worth the visit,VADER
52,1,0,784,if you want to hear music loudly until early hours of every morning temple bar inn hotel is the place for you i am not that kind of music fan so i was really disappointed about the noise that came to the room from bars in this building and around the fleet street i have to say that the location of this hotel is great near shopping areas and hotel staff is doing good work but those are all the positive sides of staying room where we stayed nights was really basic and small it even lacked elements like soap tray in the shower and hangers for jackets that we had to ask separetly there were no ventillation so you had to open windows for fresh air to come in and after opening the rhythm of bass drums was even louder until or of this can be experienced in budget style hotels but not in hotels that cost over euros per night my advice is to go somewhere else if you are not wealthy bass drum rhythm lover,VADER
53,1,0,789,when i got to the hotel i was amazed by the beautiful modern and clean smell of the lobby that image was destroyed when i got into the room the carpet was filthy full of stains and the humidity smell was awful the ac did work which made the humidity worst i was changed twice to different rooms but the problems were the same at midnight one of the front desk guys came and advised me they did have any ac i finally quit and tried to enjoy the stay peter from the front desk was very helpful and nice to even gave us good recommendations to enjoy the city which we loved despite the hotel rooms breakfast is varied and good restaurant food is delicious expensive though,VADER
54,1,0,791,not impressed rude reception staff extremely rude manager myself two friends stayed in blooms as we attended a concert in dublin when we arrived back at hotel after our night out it took the doorman about minutes to answer the door there was anyone on the reception desk or answering the we were three women in a part of town who did appreciate being locked out at that hour of the night approximately it is safe anywhere the breakfast was horrible and i had to ask times for some ice for the oj as it was just sitting out all morning this hotel is a pure tourist trap and they should be ashamed to be changing people to stay there never again i wrote a review on their facebook page and they did i noticed that they only replied to which there were many of,VADER
55,1,0,796,i had booked this hotel a few months before the visit once i arrived they told me there were no rooms for me as they accidentally overbooked now this is annoying but i know all hotels do it so i ca fault them for this they did give us free drinks and taxi us to another hotel relatively close by they had told me to get a receipt from the other hotel for breakfast so that they can refund me too this was all sounding great even gave me a card with a number to call in the morning so they could arrange a taxi to take our bags back over and put them in the room for morning comes around i get my receipt call the number on the card and i met with this number has not yet been assigned to an agent the staff at the illunion hotel were fantastic and helped get in touch with the sansi hotel only to find out that they had no record of me needing a room or for them to pick up my stuff after a bit of back and forth and the sansi staff calling a manager they realised they were supposed to give me a room and pick us up we dropped our bags off and headed out for the day the sansi hotel is in a great location minute walk to the docks upon returning to the hotel we checked in and i asked about the refund,VADER
56,1,0,800,stayed at this hotel with my family booked rooms found human faeces on the bathroom floor in one of the rooms still waiting on gm of hotel to call me back duty manager changed the room which for me should have been automatic and a free dinner which is very ordinary given price i paid for rooms i sure they will reply now did even refund the one room one would assume they would way too late not what you expect for a star hotel considering so many other star hotels do not book here how unhygienic and how badly to handle my complaint human faeces very disgusting i rarely post reviews however always read them i hope this helps others please check out other star hotels in athens i would hate for another family to have their last day on their holiday be spoiled like us,VADER
57,1,0,809,we stayed here during part of two week trip through ireland london and scotland first of all the location was terrible even though the tram is right outside the hotel you are as far away from the attractions as you can get also the entire area is under construction and felt very unsafe the room was also a let down it was small outdated and the curtains were not even attached to the rod so we were not able to close them we were put in a room with two twin beds and our daughter had to sleep on a bed all were extremely uncomfortable not that we were sleeping anyway but it was extremely loud on our second night the hotel hosted some sort of party that kept us and several other guests up until after when we called to complain we were told they would shut the doors but that never basically stayed out exploring as long as possible to not have to return to our room although we did not like our hotel we did love the people of dublin,VADER
58,1,0,827,my wife and i were booked for five days at this hotel because it was the conference venue for an event at which i was speaking we were also sponsors of this event well our visit was a farce from start to finish largely due to this incredibly inept we booked months in advance and were relegated to a tiny room on the outside of the sixth floor as we were on the outside perimeter of the building the walls were slanted just under the roof as such it was very difficult for two people to move around in this small room and we had to do this for five nights even worse the bed was simply too small for two people i measured it to under cm my wife and i were constantly pushing each other over the side during the night we asked to be moved but the hotel apparently had no other rooms curiously a colleague booked a room at a remarkably better rate about a month before the conference and had a spacious room on the third floor with a big bed and two chairs she arrived a day later than we did i had to send some documents to the united states and needed a fedex envelope the reception said there was no business center but i should talk to the concierge the concierge referred me to the business center one flight down the business center said the fedex envelopes could be obtained from the,VADER
59,0,1,838,the location of this hostel is really convenient right next to a major train station there is also a large common area for lounging the rooms can be a bit difficult to handle with so many people assigned to one bathroom but it manageable,VADER

61,1,0,886,the whole experience was disappointing we were made to wait for minutes before our room was ready and this is after the check in time of there was a line of people waiting and we had to queue three times before our room was finally ready we entered a warm stuffy room where the air conditioning has not been switched on it is definitely not what i had expected based on the review i will definitely not be coming back be ready to be disappointed,VADER
62,1,0,889,the room was clean steday wifi freat th floor and secent breakfast pretty far from the city center but all pales compare to the bed we ordered a double bed and got teo twin beds pushed togeter with a flat twin mattress on each which didnt even fit the bed i dont know how a hotel which respects itself can call this a decent bed i understood that all beds were like this very disappointing,VADER
63,1,0,896,we stayed nights on arrival no offer of any help with the bags and it only got worse staff decidedly unhappy in most areas breakfast was busy but again staff inattentive the hotel itself was tired and clearly ready for redevelopment which was happening on almost every side of the hotel avoid if possible as there are much better hotels nearby,VADER
64,1,0,899,very nice view from the heat in the elvators the need to wait around minutes to the working at the reception think that they are doing you a favor by staying at their hotel they forget that the guests are paying their salaries,VADER

68,1,0,958,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,VADER
69,0,1,988,the best of many good things about this hotel was the terrace on the top floor plenty of chairs and tables from which to survey the spectacular view the acropolis to the north and the city and the mountains beyond it to the east and south we took our breakfast up there on a tray no problem going from ground floor to fifth with a lift every morning and our coffee or wine every evening it was a spectacular way to start and end each was also well placed not only was the next road on the sightseeing tour bus routes but the junction with that road was opposite a shady little path that led to the main footpath to the acropolis so instead of joining the gathering throng in the scorching crowded and noisy coach park a walk up the road to our left we padded our way between ancient trees and shrubs on a path worn by feet ancient and modern over thousands of years and joined them a little further up only a little but it was more magical the hotel staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times whether we needed to know about museums restaurants bus routes etc they telephoned hertz for us when our lack of greek and the hertz office busy times made it difficult for us to sort out a problem with times for picking up our hire car and then one of the staff parked it for us when fitting,VADER
70,1,0,1000,room through a maze of corridors no offer of help with luggage reception rather disinterested room has very thin walls currently listening to guy next door talkingno windows open as very stuffy from am has been noise of trollies skips being loaded and moved incredibly noisy sounds like bin lorries or similar for hoursroom must be over kitchens as smells of breakfast cooking from ok but not the cleanest literally an inch of fluff and dust on side lights above the bed are filthy furniture tatty and marked general all a bit run down and scruffy dated and dingy,VADER

73,1,0,1049,the team have a serious communication the service at the restaurant it terrible night a random person enter our room at it was another guest that mistook the door the explanation of the hotel was that an error in the system allowed for a few minutes any card access to any door other day when i closed the room door a piece of roof ventilation whole felt down thanks good i closed door from inside otherwise it would break my head when you have any issue that you want to report to the manager it really dificultades to reach him not serious for a star hotel,VADER
74,1,0,1051,michelin starred restaurant closed for vacation not mentioned when booking concierge did not follow up when promised on a reservation we had to follow up on status they were unable to obtain a reservation day lost along with any chance to obtain a restaurant booking a street restaurant for us turn down service hit and miss omg the basics had to ask for that also in fact had to ask twice each time for the simplest of requests this hotel is living on a reputation and most certainly do not understand that a star reputation has to be earned every day that is why we pay so much who knows it may be your turn next to have our experience,VADER
75,1,0,1057,had high hopes for this hotel but it was at best described as adequate loud vicinity appreciate that the hotel can only do so much to address this but more could be done in terms of the decor worn out carpets on the stairwells and very low budget shower curtains that stick to you you know the ones polite enough staff but they have an air that they are just going through the motions did find them very genuine it a shame as this place could be so much more,VADER
76,1,0,1074,we visit amsterdam at least once a year we had visited the restaurant in the hotel on a previous trip so selected the hotel as we felt we knew what to arrival our room was ready nor was it ready over an hour later when we been told it would had paid for a deluxe room this is not the basic level at the hotel on check in i was told that the room did have a city view even though it was on the first floor on entering the room it became very clear that not only did the room not have a city view but it did have a very unattractive view of the bins and yards of the opposite apartments i will attach a photo the room lights did not respond to the remote controls and the room was very i raised this with reception i was told that if i wanted a city view i should have asked for one even though it is part of the room description described on the hotel website we were moved on our second night to a room of the standard we had booked however that hardly a good start to a vacation the room we moved to was great had lots of light and a view we expected but no apology or recognition of the issue with our initial in all we felt that we were not valued customers and that quality of service and ensuring that we had,VADER
77,0,1,1083,the hotel was reasonable the rooms on higher floors have a nice view on the sea the rooms were shabby but properly cleaned the breakfast was not wow a small hotel located at walking distance from glyfada center,VADER
78,0,1,1094,overall the hotel is tremendous i did not give a for a couple of reasons the front desk staff is not very friendly and in particular francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out overall that did not affect our experience much but it is something they could work on none the less also the housekeeping staff was very pleasant but only of days did we have turndown service which again not a big deal but is part of the price also two of the days we returned from our long day outside the room and at it had not been made up this was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room all day everyday yet our room is last i tip the cleaning service everyday so it could not be that it probably explains our difficulty on the first day we got there at and asked if early checkin was possible the woman at the desk said the cleaning people are outside your room now so it should be an hour or less well we came back in an hour and a half still not done this was the time she reminded us in a teachy condescending way that time is uh we know you told us we could check in earlier so we left and came back at around still not done this is when francesc mansplained that the check in time was so we knew that,VADER
79,1,0,1120,the staff was very friendly and the breakfast choices were great that where it ends the rooms were run down with stains on the carpets cracked tiles in the bathroom old and stained sink and beds absolutely disgusting the price per night was crazy at per night we shortened our stay from to night and checked into a local marriott hotel instead at half the cost,VADER
80,1,0,1131,noise from other room is so big that i could sleep well every some water that where it came from are all around my shoes so my new shoes from barcelona became wet two things above was bad but other things about the hotel was good,VADER
81,1,0,1132,we had the displeasure of staying at his hot er place you could call it while on a transfer from athens to beirut we had to walk up several flights of stairs and wake the reception guy up so he could check us in he checked us in topless which was in our early expectations of the place the room was cheap and big however the next day we discovered several cockroaches were on the ground beside us when we woke up we had a fan to help air the room but to be honest we were happy to leave the room at any chance we got we were planning to stay there again on our return transfer back to dublin but we cancelled and booked another place which was a lot better avoid if you can unless you are happy sharing with uninvited cockroaches otherwise you love it,VADER
82,0,1,1154,wanted a change from the usual hilton type hotel and chose the morgan because of ta reviews and location this is a small boutique style hotel with luxe fittings and furnishings however all is not what it seems if you look closely the place is starting to look tired the phone in my room was of the euro variety and the carpet in my bedroom is beginning to look grubby amongst a whole host of small things this place needs a little time and attention spent on it by the owners complete with a new lick of paint otherwise they will kill off what is essentially a lovely funky place to stay oh and one final thing the buffet breakfast needs to improve frequently running out of sausages and bacon an omelette stations would also not go amiss,VADER
83,1,0,1158,stayed for one night the hotel looks good from the outside and reception area but as soon as you go in halls leading to rooms its like you stepped back in time to the rooms very dated we booked an executive room only difference it seems was the bed was bigger building site to the rear of the hotel so its very noisy from,VADER
84,1,0,1161,super expensive hotel and inflexiblenon smoking room smelling smokehalf a soap in the roomparking too far awayno breakfast before am without breakfast basketi do recommend this hotel it is abusing of its location,VADER
85,1,0,1162,the hotel is an aging and quaint location it clearly needs some maintenance and they decided to do it right outside our rooms while we stayed there for over for days i like to sleep in peace and not be poisoned workmen woke us up on day one that day they painted in a gloss paint that had a fairly heavy odor my wife was affected by it breakfast was average and the staff attempted to be pleasant i suppose but for the money you can probably do better it was the only place in ireland we stayed in that was disappointing,VADER
86,0,1,1185,if i am back to barcelona i will visit this hotel again definitely i recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit barcelona but the noise of subway train was little bit annoying when i tried to sleep because i can feel and hear when the subway train comes near,VADER
87,1,0,1192,pretty disappointing my partner and i have stayed a few times and even though previously there were a couple of things that we considered not up to scratch we had relatively pleasant experiences after the last stay we wo be returning the first issue is the staff not true of all the staff members but most were generally rude entering and leaving the hotel was uncomfortable as some of the staff at reception did not make us feel welcome i do really appreciate being silently stared down as i walk to my room another issue was the relentless mini bar check while we occupied the room not a practice i expect from a four star hotel the problem with attitude among the staff became really evident when someone who came to check the mini bar while we were busy entered our room without making himself known there were a few times where someone entered our room without permission which was real invasion of privacy and then proceeded to move our belongings with his foot to gain access to the fridge all without saying much to either of us we made this incident known at the end of check out and they were obviously apologetic but during check out we were not asked how our stay was or if there were any issues and we were told we used an item of the mini bar when we had not which you think they know we did seeing as they checked so,VADER
88,1,0,1230,the bedroom was ok but the bathroom the worst one i ever used in a hotel the location is ok next to tube stations and min walking to the acropolis but the streets around were just ugly and i did feel safe the staff was nice and helpful i do recommend for people in holidays just for fast business trips,VADER
89,1,0,1242,we are currently staying at ofelias having just left the hotel catalonia barcelona around the corner where we had been for several days prior we made the switch to join friends staying at ofelias big mistake when we checked in yesterday we were given a small room with twin beds totally unromantic i immediately asked the front desk person tanya for a room with a king bed and she said that all the rooms have the same beds we discovered this morning that our friends had been given a much nicer room with a king bed desk view and balcony for the same price tanya had lied to us i hate being lied to we are very unhappy and wished we had continued our stay at hotel catalonia barcelona that hotel had beautiful large rooms with king bed extraordinary view much nicer breakfast large rooftop pool with a a bar and amazing views of the city,VADER
90,1,0,1267,positives are the hotel is very close to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum a minute walk will also take you to the temple of zeus and the stadium the plaka is a min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of athens at the end if the plaka you will find the ancient agora the acropolis metro is only a min walk that will take you to other parts of athens the beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to deg we had this for three days there is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee you have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so breakfast is rather tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm now fermenting the fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice coffee was via a nescafé vending machine tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from at least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you wo get a good night rest the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in athens you might want to,VADER
91,1,0,1280,first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,VADER
92,1,0,1300,i stayed here in and the hotel was a great find back then i felt it was in a good location and the hotel was clean and modern however during my recent stay it was dated the bathrooms were the cleanest and the staff were not friendly the place has gone downhill there are also no safes provided in the rooms in a city with pick pockets galore you think this would be a standard amenity in a nutshell shame on you for claiming you are a star hotel,VADER
93,1,0,1330,we stayed here nights in an ocean side room on the floor of those nights two were disturbed by an extremely loud concert nearby which made it impossible to sleep the first went on until am the second is still going on but it is am as i write this and the music is still playing whee if you value your rest this is not the hotel for you,VADER
94,0,1,1345,the student hotel at amsterdam city was overall just what we needed at the end of our week backpacking trip we stayed nights there after traveling with backpacking backpacks hoping between hostels shared with people so we really appreciated the privacy cleanliness and an actual quiet and comfy bed however i do have two criticisms that i believe can be easily fixed firstly our room was never cleaned even though we put up the please clean our room sign not a big deal but just letting you know secondly when we rented bikes from the hotel and rode back after a really long day in the city we accidentally biked all the way to the student hotel amsterdam west when we tried to return the bikes we were sure why our bikes did match the bikes there i checked the room key and there was no indication as to which hotel we were staying at my boyfriend and i did not remember anything else besides the brand name of the hotel when i was about to check my email receipt my phone died but we began to figure that we might be at a different hotel we started to lock up our bikes to go ask reception for help when i saw that our bikes said amsterdam city and the other student hotel bikes said amsterdam west this was the only indication that there were two locations and that we were in the wrong place it turns out we were,VADER
95,1,0,1383,lets begin where our journey started we looked up the prices through and a dutch travel agent called tui the travelagent offered a superior twin room which was also a roomtype on the website it was combined with a flight the price was about the same so we booked trough tui when we arrived at the hotel it was very clear that the room that was booked for us was not a superior room but a standard room we tried to change this because we booked a superior room but according to the manager he offered this room as a superior instead of the real roomtype because of the company were we have booked the room this was unbelievable for us he just laughed at us and did nothing to help us with this problem he did not listen to our story but was only looking at the line with people who wanted to check out behind us because everything was full we had no other option to stay in the room is interior in a building it looks like a closet and does not have enough space for two persons who stay nights there is a semi double bed but this wasnt even close to the worst things every night we heard noises from the room next to us there are a lot of young people in the hotel that like to go out every night that fine and fun but when they came home at they kept talking,VADER
96,1,0,1411,used to be when you were in dublin the staff were extremely pleasant well at this hotel the staff act like kgb officials and are very rude they were intentionally rude to my highly educated daughter and i am a lifetime spg platinum meaning i have spent over nights on the road in spg hotels additionally on some very hot nights the ac did not work in the room and they put us in a tiny room all the while the staff acted like no big yes it is a big deal as our worldwide staff has been instructed that westin dublin is no longer a place they may stay vote with our wallets gm and as the chairman of a worldwide conglomerate i assure you no dollars will be spent at your this hotel much better options where the staffs are polite and respectful of a hotel doctor hit me with some love and a helpful vote,VADER

98,1,0,1447,at arrival we got some confused information that the first night our booking had been changed to a nearby hotel if we accepted these changes we were promised a compensation for this inconvenience the hotel also assured us that everything was taken care of no need for payment etc at the spare hotel despite the assurance from sansi diputació we were requested to pay at check out from the spare hotel both for the stay and the breakfast both already payed for at return to sansi diputació no one had any knowledge about the the discussions additional transport etc took significant amount of time and energy despite repeated contact from both our side and the hotel has not responded or given any additional explanations or apologies and we never saw any breakfast that you can add to your stay is not worth the money save this and buy your breakfast at some nearby café also recommend to avoid this hotel due to the customer treatment,VADER
99,1,0,1453,we stayed here for a night as there was an issue with a flood in the other hotel we were supposed to stay in this one the alexander is definitely the less nice one bathroom was old with mildew room was musty and carpet was old definitely recommend staying in the st stephens location over this one,VADER
100,1,0,1479,one of those hotels that if you do ask you do get if you do kick up a fuss on check in you will be given the smallest room on the floor as they try to palm it off on some if you do ask for your room to be fully cleaned you return on the night to find last nights mess still in your location is great staff are very friendly as you walk about and the rooms are nicely executed,VADER
101,0,1,1494,the hotel is right outside a metro station and about a block from a tram that takes you into the museum precinct they also offer small boat canal tours ppl from memory which are reasonably priced so you do have to do it on one of those larger touristy boats we went up the eastern channels around the zoo and ended up outside amsterdam centrale staion hotel is on the main road but as bikes are the main form of transport little road noise could be heard and nor were sounds from neighboring rooms present,VADER
102,1,0,1521,the front desk personnel was very friendly and accommodating that the only plus the wifi in the room was very slow it only works in the lobby and lobby is small and crowded the room is very very basic with no cabinets the mattress is thin and not comfy furnitures in the room are basic looks new but flimsy looking there no free breakfast as it says in it about per person but the food is good and considering it expensive to eat anyway outside we loved the coconut yogurt outside the hotel is a nice park that stretches couple of miles with nice restaurants and shops with lots of nice folks just hanging out not too crowded nice ambiance,VADER

104,1,0,1537,we stayed here for night in july the room was really small with a corridor for a bathroom no bath the shower leaked on the bathroom floor so we needed a towel to stop the floor getting wet small windows very small with a beautiful view of a drain pipe we had to shuffle things around and put things on the floor in order to use the kettle to make a drink on the up side the valet was really helpful allowing us to park on the front whilst checking in we complained about the room and were told that we would not be charged for the mini bar we had only had nuts and pringles but on arriving home they have been charged this was a special treat for my partner the room cost over which i was happy to pay but unfortunately just it did feel like a treat and also did feel like value for money also on the corridor we were on there was a funny smell but there was a sign saying apologies for building work staff were pleasant but overall for a star hotel was really disappointed,VADER
105,1,0,1561,worst breakfast i believe i have encountered anywhere in the world particularly in light of the star rating inattentive staff busy but not serving very poor cooked food quality undercooked bacon sausage with gristle unappetising scrambled eggs toaster not functioning resulting in long queues and wait time teapots leaking etc etcmanagement need to observe this towers experience and make rapid improvements,VADER
106,1,0,1562,i visited the skylon at the weekend for lunch with family we were heading to a big game in town so the skylon is an obvious choice for lunch have been visiting the skylon for many years the food and service was always great however a number of months ago they decided to no longer provide a carvery option for lunch that in itself is not an issue as long as the kitchen and servers can work together efficiently to get orders taken and food delivered you may have seen on my previous review since the upgrade that the service and food was very disappointing overall we hoped for a better experience on sunday but it was to arrived at and met friends who had got there before us their lunch order took minutes to arrive the food was only warm not hot our lunch took minutes to be delivered we almost had to cancel it as it was simply taking too hard to know where the problem is because there are lots of people serving in the restaurant my guess is that the problem in the kitchen the fact is the food was taking far too long to be delivered to lots of tables not just mentioned the skylon is well located to capture trade from people attending games and concerts in croke park however they do seem to be aware of this and are certainly not taking advantage of our food eventually arrived it was fine certainly no,VADER
107,1,0,1566,the hotel offers adequate rooms in a good location central close to transport shopping and various sites big minus we were charged twice for our two night stay we paid cash upon checking out and then our credit card was charged a few days later we are now aud plus card fees out of pocket if staying here be careful re payments also breakfast was crap,VADER
108,1,0,1567,good location seconds to grafton street very friendly front of house staff nice rooms although my room was on the small side and the room and bathroom could probably do with a refurbishment very nice lobby area and bar the letdown was the breakfast service with slow and very unfriendly service especially compared to other hotel staff on morning four i just got up and walked out after waiting min to try and order no hot buffet received an apology later and coffee in bar as compensation but then drink was charged on checkout,VADER

113,0,1,1604,hotel mirabello is located at omonoia square which is the city center of athens and nicely accessible to metro and bus routes the hotel is in a small building but the rooms are of decent size and was very clean and the breakfast was of good quality but the space was quite small and at certain times it could be difficult to find an empty table overall i was happy with my only downside was the method of payment i booked from and i chose to pay at the property but the property had charged the first night without my consent it had not been indicated that the first night is charged in the booking and i was a bit upset about this confusion,VADER
114,0,1,1684,we booked nights at this hotel as my birthday treat we booked an executive room and i emailed the hotel to see if we could be upgraded as it was a special occasion i received a response to say the reception staff had the authority to do this on arrival the hotel was full this was the least of our problems the hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel taxi at euros on our return to the airport we were quoted euros by hotel staff which we booked decided to take the metro as we thought euros rather expensive the metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband passport were stolen from my handbag this resulted in a dash to the police station followed by a visit to the british embassy the following morning to report it and a return later to collect an emergency replacement day ruined and a nasty taste in the mouth regarding the city apparently this is a very regular occurrence and the passports are sold on to immigrants within executive room was nothing like executive the bath was very narrow and if you turned the bath tap fully on the overhead shower came on as well therefore the taps had to be turned only slightly on to fill the bath i reported this but the engineer could make no were replaced each day although the quality was not is unusual not to have facilities in a,VADER
115,1,0,1695,my family and i arrived at hotel after completing a wonderful stay in athens and a day cruise we checked our bags in at and then had a very full day in barcelona hotel was clean and modern and staff very kind we were located one level about street and our room was next to a very busy area noise was insane people party in barcelona that what was not ok was that room people yelling screaming and laughing until am i went down to the desk at and asked for a different room for the following night they said yes and i took my migraine and sleep deprived self to breakfast very nice breakfast be warned if it a weekend ask for a room away from the noise they should have asked me before sticking us in that room worst hotel experience in my many years of travel,VADER
116,1,0,1709,hotel location looks good so we booked may be the cheapest room because we only spent one night in athens the room was too small and did have any window its ok thats why it is the cheapest room but what about the towels their colour went yellow and smell very weird and the bed also smells like that just try another hotel there are many options in the centre of athens,VADER
117,1,0,1715,we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,VADER
118,1,0,1727,the hotel itself is quite nice and clean however when i arrived at my room was not ready and the staff took over an hour to get a room for me the staff clearly need training in customer service it is very expensive and in no way justifies the price i will not stay there again,VADER
119,1,0,1762,loud music until am every night no accommodations made to help filter the noise light curtain on window no air conditioner no sound insulation whatsoever at one point in the night i wanted to stuff the single bed mattress covers and pillows against the window to block out the noise all they gave was ear plugs our adult children were traveling with us and enjoyed the club the first night however they had an early flight out the second night and did get any sleep even though their room was around the corner from the was a real issue as we were aware of the fact that we had to park several blocks away with a discounted staff is courteous and very friendly rooms are dated but adequate,VADER
120,1,0,1766,the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,VADER
121,1,0,1786,the air conditioning was not working very well it is hot in barcelona in july someone had been smoking in the room and the air unit was just circulating the smoke we both woke up feeling ill the sheets had holes in them and we were sleeping on box springs not a mattress we were each allowed one were very disappointed and tried to book another hotel but there was noneavailability the hotel was clean and the sangria was very good but notgood enough for us to be able to sleep through the night we were exhausted,VADER
122,1,0,67,it outside of the central after the bus or train ride still need to walk about min to reach the hotel imagine after a full day of touring still need to walk quite far it also not wheelchair nor stroller accessible makes it very difficult to travel with luggages,SVM
123,1,0,92,hotel is ok kind of location is not bad but not a walking distance from attractions rooms are quite small and breakfast is very basic i would explore another hotel if i go again to barcelona it has elevators one was down during my entire days stay staff are quite helpful with good english communication,SVM
124,0,1,145,stayed here for nights for work and whilst the location is superb the room are looking very tried there really needs to be a makeover here as when you enter the hotel the downstairs lobby and bar area look very nice and inviting if a makeover is not performed soon then i can see this hotel losing out on even more business having said that the buffet breakfast was ok the items were crammed down to the one end of the restaurant where there was not enough room to be able to cook your toast etc whist other people wanted to grab some butter jam and other breakfast items the cooked breakfast i had on my last day was oright but i have had a lot better they seemed to want to present it in a fancy way rather than actually giving you a decent hearty breakfast myself and colleagues were not the only ones commenting on this i would stay here again purely due to location and would hope the hotel manager takes onboard some of the guests helpful comments i did find the lobby staff very welcoming and friendly,SVM
125,1,0,152,when the best thing you can say about the hotel is that you liked the front desk staff know it not great truly the guys at the front desk were very helpful and professional we booked an eight day greek vacation after backpacking and self guiding ourselves through italy for weeks through an aegean travel agency we had two nights in athens before heading to sifnos and serifos islands and then one night in athens again before ending our trip we were picked up at the airport and transferred to hotel economy by a great taxi driver i guess we should have known by the hotel name what kind of place it would be first of all it basically in the red light district as i would call it there are therese two minutes in any direction the hotel is very dated the beds are hard and the pillows are harder the bathroom is barely big enough to change your mind they could use plastic shower curtains you flood the bathroom when you shower thank goodness for drains in the floor you have to sit on the toilet to shave your legs actually sort of handy the refrigerator does work when you leave the room it connected to the key so there no chance to have cold water when you return from your shopping or tour it very noisy outside as well as above you the continental breakfast starts ta that late if you from the us it a pretty,SVM
126,1,0,187,be aware this hotel has two small rooms on each floor which do not have windows to the outside they have small windows that look out into a very dark small open central lobby it is our first time staying in hotel with no windows to the outside we were unlucky enough to get one of these try to sell you on their buffet breakfast euros reduced to euros if you book breakfast for the entire stay bear in mind that you can get a baguette sandwich plus a coffee for about euros from any of the little pastry shops around the hotel we did bother with their breakfast option and were glad we front desk staff is especially this one lady who works nights the only helpful person we found was maria who was very gracious and helped us with check out,SVM
127,1,0,204,came to dublin as a treat after recovering from an illness our room was shabby with the formica peeling off the furniture stains on the lampshades and grouting around the bath discoloured the air con was outdated and noisy the shower was extremely low powered the room was at the back of the hotel on the ground floor with virtually no natural light getting in therefore had to have the light on all the time how depressing large blue bins for refuge collection were lined up right outside our window the breakfast was just ok the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and courteous as were the staff in mcgettican cookhouse the food here was very good and great value,SVM
128,1,0,219,first the highlights updated hotel with comfortable rooms and a great breakfast in a great neighborhood secondly the disappointments as a gold honors member and mile flier i have stayed at a few international hotels the staff never quite got all of the amenities in my room right each day no new coffee most days bathroom amenities missed most days daily water was hit or miss on my last day of i asked for water to be replaced and was told the hotel policy was water only on the first day of arrival really this is the first major brand international hotel where i found the complimentary water rationed to one day i explained my concern to the staff and they had no answers penny wise pound foolish i will not be back,SVM
129,1,0,296,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,SVM
130,1,0,387,we booked this hotel on short notice as it came up first on we thought it would be close to town and we could walk to the main attractions as we only had a short stay in athens this was not the case and it was very complicated to get anywhere without a taxi and most of the drivers do not understand english the hotel is situated near a district so that should be taken into consideration very difficult to cross the road as it is a four lane highway out the front with a fence in the midway the hotel is very new but very badly designed and finished off very small lifts to take you to the rooms so it takes two trips if you have a lot of luggage we ordered some food from the restaurant and bought it up to the room unfortunately my food had an eye lash in it generally the staff was very friendly though check in did take some time which i do not really appreciate the hotel finishes and location lets it down i would not recommend or stay here again,SVM
131,1,0,406,the honest of the assistant service personal is questionable i lost an important mount of money of my room and they didnt anything to find it i make an pólice report in the pólice station and i waiting the results,SVM
132,0,1,412,wonderful most european rooms are small i was on my own and got a single it had a sauna and a whirlpool tub when i was there it was very hot the room did not have ac and there were concerts going on so there was a lot of traffic with cars and people walking around partying i had to leave the window open so did not sleep for almost nights i stayed i asked to be moved but no availability on night begged for a fan or something or i was going to find other accommodation i feel i should not have had to ask for one but offered so i could close the window for some quiet otherwise it very conveniently located and the tub was great after long days of walking and hiking,SVM
133,0,1,427,our experience with the roger de lluria was generally consistent with the positive reviews on tripadvisor as my wife our two adult daughters and i were going to be in barcelona for only one night i wanted a convenient location in the heart of barcelona i was already familiar with the area having previously stayed multiple times in a nearby hotel this time i wanted a somewhat more elegant place and the roger de lluria seemed to fit the bill i booked two double rooms for a sunday night and requested twin beds high floor and facing the street on the friday before our scheduled arrival we decided to arrive a day early my daughter called the hotel and asked if there was availability the next day the answer was no but a few minutes later the desk clerk hakim called back to say they could provide two rooms for the first night although he warned they would be smaller and not as well located as the rooms we would have the second night unfortunately the price would be the same as for the better and bigger rooms euros per room per night but hakim said he would include breakfast for the first morning therefore even before our arrival we had a sample of the friendly and helpful service provided by the hotel staff and after our arrival there were other examples i had parked my car a couple of streets away see why below and asked if it was,SVM
134,1,0,460,it is a shame as the staff work so hard to assist and make your stay enjoyable but the constant construction works and noise is off putting from early in the morning into the evening hammering drilling workmen shouting and banging of doors it is near impossible even to take a restful hour in your room during the day as it is located on a very busy main street with bars and clubs and an outdoor concert venue just down the street people party literally to the crack of dawn so expect to not have a decent of the works the rooms was too warm as the ac is not functioning all making for an exhausting stay on a good note the breakfast is plentiful and fresh,SVM
135,1,0,471,rooms are tiny no privacy glass doors on en suite rooms very noisy can hear everything from room next door waited mins to be served at bar gave up went down the street to a supermarket bought our own drinks great restaurant next to hotel,SVM

137,1,0,543,let start with the positives friendly helpful staff great welcome cloud pool good food lovely place to chill out in the evening and barman chris was fabulous pool good toolocation mins from alimos marina so handy if you hiring a yachtthe tv worksso the negatives we booked a family room and got two rooms not interconnecting ok for us as we have teens but not great for younger rooms were functional at best decor dated patched up in places and they reeked of cigarette smoke shower woefully inadequate fell out of its holder several times bulbs missing it on a very noisy main road despite double glazed doors and seemingly some rooms have thick blackout curtains and others not breakfast basic meat cheese bread yoghurt etc all ok but overcooked cooked breakfast fried eggs like booked through ba and the reviews were ok but seriously this is a very basic hotel we were here less than hours and that was hours too many,SVM
138,1,0,574,hotel is older but clean cozy yet comfortable we were looking for a place to lay out heads this fit the bill price was good you get what you pay for like the big bang theory the elevator does not work but we knew that ahead of time this hotel is in the heart of the temple district with shops bars and numerous restaurants just outside the door we found all forms of transit within simple walking distance staff is friendly no early checkin,SVM
139,1,0,687,we had an issue with payment checking in and even though we had the money and sorted it in the meantime staff were incredibly rude and laughing at us in dutch not knowing i a fluent speaker no food facilities and area is barren other than a small spar supermarket and sloterdijk hotel could have been cleaner but overall would recommend if it was for the terrible customer service,SVM
140,1,0,704,stayed here at the start of july when we arrived after we payed and asked for a receipt but we were told we would recieve the receipt as we checked out at the end of the week we were then told our room was ready and we could check in until when it states on the website that we should be able to check in from onwards when we checked out they tried to charge us again and we had to show that they had taken the money on our banking app otherwise the stay was pleasant and the hotel is in a good location,SVM
141,0,1,707,nice pool at the last floor staff very nice but not worth the price you payis not possible to smoke at night in the rooftop because it became restauant they gaved me the room before check in time so i appreciate it,SVM
142,1,0,759,for being a hilton hotel you expect high and good service when the prices are that high forgot our orderlazy in the barservice remote did worktook the freedom of giving us the most expensive alcohol in the drinks without askinggave us the wrong billthe staff were friendly but should maybe have a lesion in hotel service not worth the visit,SVM
143,1,0,789,when i got to the hotel i was amazed by the beautiful modern and clean smell of the lobby that image was destroyed when i got into the room the carpet was filthy full of stains and the humidity smell was awful the ac did work which made the humidity worst i was changed twice to different rooms but the problems were the same at midnight one of the front desk guys came and advised me they did have any ac i finally quit and tried to enjoy the stay peter from the front desk was very helpful and nice to even gave us good recommendations to enjoy the city which we loved despite the hotel rooms breakfast is varied and good restaurant food is delicious expensive though,SVM
144,0,1,873,when we arrived at this impressive hotel we were thrilled when given an upgrade to a suite sadly the aircon did perform very well so our room was constantly very hot we notified staff and although they initially came to check obviously there was a fault breakfast which we had included was magic served in the winter garden room we loved our start to the day and enjoyed the luxury our suite was massive so enjoyed the space great location as the downside we were evacuated late one night with warnings to leave immediately and do not use the lifts already in bed threw some clothes over the top and only took long enough to grab passports many guests some quite panicky raced down the fire escape to the street where you would expect to see a staff member to direct us no no one was there we all gathered waiting for instructions eventually we decided to go to the front of the hotel to seek help the hotel seemed to be fine with other guests inside unaware obviously the wing we were staying in was the only area i queried staff as to when they were going to let us know we were safe to return to our rooms they informed us it was no big deal and all was not good hotels should have an obligation to their guests and their safety,SVM
145,1,0,896,we stayed nights on arrival no offer of any help with the bags and it only got worse staff decidedly unhappy in most areas breakfast was busy but again staff inattentive the hotel itself was tired and clearly ready for redevelopment which was happening on almost every side of the hotel avoid if possible as there are much better hotels nearby,SVM
146,1,0,899,very nice view from the heat in the elvators the need to wait around minutes to the working at the reception think that they are doing you a favor by staying at their hotel they forget that the guests are paying their salaries,SVM
147,1,0,910,i stayed for nights in this hotel great location on the corner of la rambla many restaurants and shops in front of metro station and min walking to room is old and dusty the ac is too noisy the bed is hard and not comfort at all and the staff is not friendly,SVM
148,1,0,958,maple hotel was an uninspiring experience ok the location is good but that is the only positive response i can give we had a double the size of a cubicle one had to sit in the bed while the other we were on the first floor facing the heavily trafficked street thank god we had earplugs,SVM

150,1,0,1057,had high hopes for this hotel but it was at best described as adequate loud vicinity appreciate that the hotel can only do so much to address this but more could be done in terms of the decor worn out carpets on the stairwells and very low budget shower curtains that stick to you you know the ones polite enough staff but they have an air that they are just going through the motions did find them very genuine it a shame as this place could be so much more,SVM
151,1,0,1075,we was here last year and it was amazing but this year we are shocked from the room services its really bad sheets not changed cups not changed or cleaned and we complained the first day but nothing happened the second days we found everything the same so we decided to move to another than this the hotel was good,SVM
152,0,1,1094,overall the hotel is tremendous i did not give a for a couple of reasons the front desk staff is not very friendly and in particular francesc was condescending both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out overall that did not affect our experience much but it is something they could work on none the less also the housekeeping staff was very pleasant but only of days did we have turndown service which again not a big deal but is part of the price also two of the days we returned from our long day outside the room and at it had not been made up this was annoying because the cleaning cart was camped outside our room all day everyday yet our room is last i tip the cleaning service everyday so it could not be that it probably explains our difficulty on the first day we got there at and asked if early checkin was possible the woman at the desk said the cleaning people are outside your room now so it should be an hour or less well we came back in an hour and a half still not done this was the time she reminded us in a teachy condescending way that time is uh we know you told us we could check in earlier so we left and came back at around still not done this is when francesc mansplained that the check in time was so we knew that,SVM
153,1,0,1114,this was my trip to barcelona and this is my personal experience i have been in hospitality management for over years i am always willing to bend break the policy when it comes to legitimate human life issues of my i prefer to cultivate a relationship based on trust and return business with my clients on july we had a family emergency but even after explaining the situation were denied a refund for the nights stay on the that we could not use as we had to fly back home to on this personal experience when i return to barcelona in i will book elsewhere,SVM

155,1,0,1132,we had the displeasure of staying at his hot er place you could call it while on a transfer from athens to beirut we had to walk up several flights of stairs and wake the reception guy up so he could check us in he checked us in topless which was in our early expectations of the place the room was cheap and big however the next day we discovered several cockroaches were on the ground beside us when we woke up we had a fan to help air the room but to be honest we were happy to leave the room at any chance we got we were planning to stay there again on our return transfer back to dublin but we cancelled and booked another place which was a lot better avoid if you can unless you are happy sharing with uninvited cockroaches otherwise you love it,SVM
156,0,1,1143,i stayed with a group of teenagers with a travel company and i was surprised how calm the atmosphere was in the hotel the reception wanted us to fill out paperwork to figure out the tourist tax when we were trying to get our group settled and organized in their rooms but they let us come back later and figure out the bill the rooms were always cleaned well and the reception put in a call for me and called a taxi for me when i needed to go to the thought that there would be more craziness since it close to la rambla but it was quite the opposite i ca say that i felt unsafe at any point but there were some weird people outside i feel like that is almost everywhere near the city center but i think it important to note if you stay there i never felt unsafe but the people were strange also please note that the download and upload speeds are very slow if you need to upload download or transfer files on business then you might want to consider another hotel i had to try uploading pictures through dropbox and it would take an hour instead of which is the typical time for the amount of files i was working with at the time,SVM
157,0,1,1154,wanted a change from the usual hilton type hotel and chose the morgan because of ta reviews and location this is a small boutique style hotel with luxe fittings and furnishings however all is not what it seems if you look closely the place is starting to look tired the phone in my room was of the euro variety and the carpet in my bedroom is beginning to look grubby amongst a whole host of small things this place needs a little time and attention spent on it by the owners complete with a new lick of paint otherwise they will kill off what is essentially a lovely funky place to stay oh and one final thing the buffet breakfast needs to improve frequently running out of sausages and bacon an omelette stations would also not go amiss,SVM
158,1,0,1158,stayed for one night the hotel looks good from the outside and reception area but as soon as you go in halls leading to rooms its like you stepped back in time to the rooms very dated we booked an executive room only difference it seems was the bed was bigger building site to the rear of the hotel so its very noisy from,SVM

161,1,0,1267,positives are the hotel is very close to the acropolis and the new acropolis museum a minute walk will also take you to the temple of zeus and the stadium the plaka is a min stroll where you can find a range of restaurants and the typical tourist type shops in the oldest part of athens at the end if the plaka you will find the ancient agora the acropolis metro is only a min walk that will take you to other parts of athens the beds are comfortable and the rooms have air conditioning which is a must with the temps that can get to deg we had this for three days there is a small fridge situated in the bottom of the wardrobe but no facilities to make a cup of tea or coffee you have to go downstairs to the breakfast room in order to do so breakfast is rather tinned fruit that has been open too long and kept in a warm now fermenting the fresh fruit on offer was too ripe and spoiled and not enough choice coffee was via a nescafé vending machine tea is via tea bags and there are three types to choose from at least you can juice your own oranges with an electric juicer ask for a room that faces the inner courtyard otherwise you wo get a good night rest the hotel is situated on a corner of one if the busiest roads in athens you might want to,SVM
162,1,0,1280,first impression of the room was cool but the you start finding how dis functional the room really is there is no privacy from the bathroom to the rest of the room glass see through door and wall it was good for watching tv from the a very small mirror in cupboard to check your bathroom sink is in the bathroom it in main room but no mirror and no power point for hair straightener or electric shaver etc the power point is at the desk bellow the tv with a very small makeup poor lighting in the room which made doing makeup back and neck from bed and things were the staff were very friend helpful nespresso coffee in the room was a very nice to tram was great but next trip i will stay closer to city it was a little bit far out if you need to drop shopping off or get changed before going out for the area of vondelpark is beautiful in every way but more suitable for relaxing people rather than party people,SVM
163,1,0,1300,i stayed here in and the hotel was a great find back then i felt it was in a good location and the hotel was clean and modern however during my recent stay it was dated the bathrooms were the cleanest and the staff were not friendly the place has gone downhill there are also no safes provided in the rooms in a city with pick pockets galore you think this would be a standard amenity in a nutshell shame on you for claiming you are a star hotel,SVM
164,0,1,1409,i have to admit that i tried like crazy to cancel our reservation here at the last minute we had a devastating health diagnosis and the hotel which was refused to give us a refund that said we decided to go on our trip after all i have never been more impressed with a hotel or it s staff like i was with this location was perfect and i will never forget the kindness the staff showed me when i became ill i had an infected spider staff arranged for a to come to the hotel they sent me a tray with fresh fruit tea and a get well soon card they even had housekeeping change my bed all within a minute span of calling the front desk i was so ill that the lady from house keeping was changing my pillows as i was crawling back into my bed i remember her lifting my head and fluffing them until they were perfect they sent us dinner via room service at no charge never have i felt so pampered and taken care of i am ever so thankful for the kindness they showed me this is a perfect place to stay in the heart of amsterdam stars all the way,SVM
165,1,0,1479,one of those hotels that if you do ask you do get if you do kick up a fuss on check in you will be given the smallest room on the floor as they try to palm it off on some if you do ask for your room to be fully cleaned you return on the night to find last nights mess still in your location is great staff are very friendly as you walk about and the rooms are nicely executed,SVM

170,1,0,1562,i visited the skylon at the weekend for lunch with family we were heading to a big game in town so the skylon is an obvious choice for lunch have been visiting the skylon for many years the food and service was always great however a number of months ago they decided to no longer provide a carvery option for lunch that in itself is not an issue as long as the kitchen and servers can work together efficiently to get orders taken and food delivered you may have seen on my previous review since the upgrade that the service and food was very disappointing overall we hoped for a better experience on sunday but it was to arrived at and met friends who had got there before us their lunch order took minutes to arrive the food was only warm not hot our lunch took minutes to be delivered we almost had to cancel it as it was simply taking too hard to know where the problem is because there are lots of people serving in the restaurant my guess is that the problem in the kitchen the fact is the food was taking far too long to be delivered to lots of tables not just mentioned the skylon is well located to capture trade from people attending games and concerts in croke park however they do seem to be aware of this and are certainly not taking advantage of our food eventually arrived it was fine certainly no,SVM
171,1,0,1590,we have just returned from a a two day stay at this hotel this is the first hotel where staff do greet you and say hello no contact at all through the whole check in very clinical staff in the restaurant clearly had been trained in the same manner where is the warm irish charm the service was slow in the restaurant and the service was very disjointed the second night it was quicker especially when we asked for bill the bathroom was small the bedroom was clean and comfortable we had breakfast in the coffee bar in reception and it was fine sorry staff again ca take orders correctly and no interaction with guests would not be going back,SVM
172,0,1,1591,i stayed on the july and the hotel is as described it is no secret that the hotel is attached to a club or that its likely be noisey it is dublin and anywhere near the town is bound to be i had a double room which was bigger than i expected and yes it def not a star hotel but for the price and location it reasonable the room was clean along with the bathroom and clean towels in the room had a station a hairdryer and ironing facilities and a book to advise of local attractions and the hotel only critism i would have is that the shower head looked like it could be cleaned better and the bath had seen better days was clean but old and there were markings in some of the walls where fixtures had been moved and the wifi password in their handbook did not work but the receptionist did offer this when we checked in i would say if your looking a quiet hotel it not for you but if u need somewhere to crash close to town then it were pleasant both during check in and check out times so i would personally stay here again,SVM

174,1,0,1709,hotel location looks good so we booked may be the cheapest room because we only spent one night in athens the room was too small and did have any window its ok thats why it is the cheapest room but what about the towels their colour went yellow and smell very weird and the bed also smells like that just try another hotel there are many options in the centre of athens,SVM
175,1,0,1715,we stayed for a long weekend break our room was on the rooftop which was lovely bar the unclean jacuzzi which we could really use our main issue was that someone had been in our room on more than one occasion we had been out during the day our room had been cleaned with fresh bedding and toiletries lovely we then came back after being out for our tea and someone had been in our room and looked through our suitcases and bags this made us feel very unsafe and paranoid the second to last day when we came home after a day out touring the city the had taken one of our keys which we kept in the electricity port to keep the room cool with the air con our bags had been moved again when i asked reception why the key had gone she replied it happens sometimes i sure this should not happen at all i never been in a hotel where the cleaner or anyone else takes the key and you had your bags rummaged through we did eat in the hotel or use the bar the room was alright but we probably would stay again,SVM
176,1,0,1766,the only pleasant part of our stay at hotel adagio was the location the room temperature controlled by the front desk for each floor was inconsistent and set in either extreme the wifi was spotty and never reliable which caused an inconvenience for travelers relying on that for access to maps etc the lobby and part of the hotel always had a very unpleasant odor and because of this we never cashed in on our complimentary tapas as to avoid sitting down there for a long period of time to top it all off we got home from vacation and realized we have beg bug bites all over again the location was great but i would recommend looking into other choices close by,SVM
